1	1	a	Why don't they make more games like this?!  Simple card playing mechanic that's fun and addicting. Then you have a vaguely interesting storyline that your character has to make his way through.  If you like Puzzle Quest (1st one), you'll love this game!   Seriously, they need more games like this!
3	1	a	The core concept of this game is essentially solitare poker againt the AI. Matching varying combinations of cards will inflict damage against the AI (and AI to you). The damage will increase the better the combiation, from two of a kind to a royal flush. The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc. The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities. Overall, this game is average to above-average. I recommend a purchase of this game during a sale.
5	1	a	Runespell: Overture is a decent and enjoyable game. The story plays out as a fantasy adventure, your character being oblivious to his past and must do battles with numerous foes to advance, making allies and doing quests along the way.   The game play is somewhat unique, using a combination of battle and magic cards to attack your foe. One earns points by creating sets of 5 traditional cards (ace-king: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs), using rules akin to poker, ie (pairs, 3 or 4 of a kind, straights, flushes, full house etc.). Better hands are worth more attack points (eg. full house &gt; 2 pair). Cards are laid out in columns of which the top card can be taken to make a set, including your opponent's. Meaning strategy is important in order to create the best possible hands while trying to prevent the opponent from doing the same.  The game is simple to play once you know the rules, and can be a good way to spend half an hour or so. Battles can be hard at times but with perseverance the game is not too difficult to beat, I finished it with about 9 hours of game play. I would enjoy a sequel to continue the story as it did seem unfinished at the conclusion. At a discount price the game is worth a shot, if you like card and/or poker-like games. 6.5/10
0	0	a	Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.
7	1	a	The core combat of making poker hands to fight enemies is pretty fun. The game is very shallow and has a very lackluster story with choices that impact absolutely nothing.  Get it on a sale or from a bundle.
2	0	a	I got this as part of a bundle and really tried to make it work for me, but it was hard to escape the 'solitare with animations' feeling I got from the game. I'm sure a greater enthusiast for card games will find something they like in here, but I could not recommend it to a general audience.
3	0	a	Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.
9	1	a	My only wish is that Mystic comes out with a sequel...and soon. I loved this game even though there was a lot of negative reviews...which only goes to prove that everyone has different tastes in games. I played this game several times and loved it each time for something new that I would discover.
11	1	a	Think Puzzle Quest, but instead of match 3 you play poker solitaire to fight your enemies.  It's fun if you're into this kind of thing. The story is cliched but well-written: I appreciate characters with a sense of cynicism. The art and sound are nice. Tutorials can be skipped when you replay the game.  Downsides: Mystic Box appears to fallen off the face of the earth. Technical settings do not save when you quit the game; I constantly have to hit Alt+Enter to resize my window and re-pick 'click and click' (dragging is a pain) when the game starts up  Overall, I enjoy this game. I use this game to kill time or relax: it's not as mindless as a match 3 and it's a fun twist on the premise. I don't expect it to do much more than that.
4	0	a	I feel that this would've been more fun if the spells and abilities were more than just 'do damage', also as the game progresses your sole upgrade is more HP/MP, without any increases in damage potential, so battles at the end just end up being a long slugfest.
13	1	a	This game was a surprise! I was expecting something like Fairy Solitaire, but has much more the RPG feeling and the RPG elements. And on top of all, keeps my poker knowledge fresh:)  I can definetely recommend this game as a Casual, Relaxing, Adventure with nice visuals.  and for 1,80euro...it's a steal!
15	1	a	One of the best card based game I have ever played. And now it's a real bargain, you cannot have good enough reason to not buy it. ;-)
17	1	a	Addictive poker role playing with real tactical depth making sure every battle keeps you on your toes, all at a bargain price.Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.If you're looking for a card game and you're in love with the poker Runespell: Overture could be your game but keep in mind it has no multiplayer and the gameplay can be extremely repetitive.
19	1	a	The recommendation is pretty weak because I didn't actually like the game. I think it has the potential to be enjoyable and it is fairly unique, so that alone might be worth it to you.  This game is essentially puzzle quest but with a solitaire combat system instead of matching gems. It's not fast by any means. Essentially you build poker hands to charge attacks, then launch the attacks at your opponent. Essentially you spend the entire game moving stacks of cards on top of each other to make a combo of five, and the higher the combo on the damage scale, the more the attack will do. You can also 'steal' cards from your enemies so long as they aren't stacked.  The combat is cool once or twice, but after that it becomes so repetitive. Nearly every fight is identical, save for the select few where you need to charge and use special attacks to win.  Beyond the gameplay, the music, sound effects, story and graphics are all ok. They're mediocre, they're fine, they're acceptable. Without a doubt they are not great and won't sell the game, but they sustain it without detracting.  All around, that describes the experience: alright, ok, passable. It's not thrilling or revolutionary, but it is unique and if that's what you're looking for in a game then you'll find it here.
21	1	a	It's like playing poker and classic RPG at the same time. Challenging gameplay and good spells to help you through dozens of quests. Strong allies to unlock with fantastic artwork will make you want to summon them again and again. 
7	0	a	A very odd take on poker mechanics crossed with RPG battles. I just dont care for the strategy here. Just another game where I get to an impossible point after a couple hours with no clue what I could be doing wrong. Eh, I give. Uninstalled. I'd sooner suggest people try Puzzle Quest 2 for this kind of asthetic.
8	0	a	Marvelously fun game. Major set back: Even on the lowest graphics setting, the infernal game chops like there's no tomorrow. I've played 2 hours, then took a break. Now when I try to load her up, the game chops for 5+ minutes till I get bored and quit. And wehn I say chops, I mean the music cuts in and out and you can't interact at all.  The developers have an awesome idea for a game, it's great fun - but unplayable by virtue of their execution.
23	1	a	This is a unique solitaire game where you arrange your cards into poker suits to set up combos and blast your opponent. It's fun. The story starts out interesting setting things in real history, but with fantasy troops around, but it quickly becomes kill the bad guy, and the dialogues tries to be tongue-in-cheek too often
25	1	a	Great game. It's like Puzzle Quest but with cards instead of gems. And I don't know a thing about playing cards. So you can imagine how fun it is for me. The graphics are simple but cool, and add to the atmosphere of the game. The  sound and music are pretty good also. But there is something I hope they'll fix in future updates. Because it starts off pretty easy (obviously), but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly (after about 10 fights). And it's not just based on skill but luck as well. So there are times when you have to refight enemies 5-6 times in a row. Only downside to an otherwise excellent game.  [Rating: 77/100]
27	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
12	0	a	Poker meets Solitare - suprisingly shallow puzzle adventure, but if your into poker, you probably can't beat it for the price..
29	1	a	Single player poker based fantasy duel game. It's worth a look for the money especially if you are a fan of Puzzle Quest, Spectromancer or Poker Night at the Inventory.
13	0	a	As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.  The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.  Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).  From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.  These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.   Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.
31	1	a	Really cool game.
15	0	a	game keep crashing at a certain point every time, i tried starting over with a new campain and it keeps effecting it and crashs as soon as i get into the game.. dont waste your money on only a few hours worth of game before it crashs. and you might think its just my computer doing because of my graphivcs card or something, but ive tried it again after replacing my graphics card
16	0	a	WIll not open on mac.
17	0	a	i would not recommend this game at all - total snooze ..... everything is great except the game play mechanics.
33	1	a	This is actually a really cool game and fun too.   Also changelings.
20	0	a	The core gameplay mechanic is original and fun, but I couldn't play enough of it for that to matter. For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling 'Raptr,' but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and 'story,' but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a 'skip' button.  Again, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.
35	1	a	Grate game to help past time
37	1	a	This is one of those games that makes me wish we had a 'thumbs in the middle' button. I liked it overall, but there were times where my experience just felt frustrating, and I don't think it was my playing poorly or anything like that, I think it's just an awkward design at times. If you're looking for a card game, there are better games, but it's not the worst one on the market.
23	0	a	It's solitaire... it comes free with windows
39	1	a	Oh No.... It's so addictive... I don't recommend... It makes you loose track of time :)
41	1	a	Poker and magic mixed in one. Interesting concept but bad graphics.
43	1	a	It's a solitare... poker... type game IN MIDIEVAL WITH MAGIC AND SPELLS AND ALL THAT CRAZY WIZARDY ♥♥♥♥ which I'm horrible at.
24	0	a	Eh, it's basically poker.  The only real variations are you can have 5 of a kind and there are magic abilities which you can use the better hands you make.  The plot is somewhat interesting but not really that original. You basically suffer from amnesia and you happen to be the chosen one to save everyone.  If you like poker... I recommend playing poker. If you like the fantasy aspect I recommend any number of other fantasy games. Even if you like both having 2 good games is better than having one mediocre one.
45	1	a	A normal poker game,a little hard and simple.  The gameplay and rule is easy to learn,so you can enjoy the battle,but the game's music is so bad,only one music from start to finish ,like the producer want to brainwash you...so close the music is good at you.  This game is not good and a little short,I got it from indie bundle,so I am enjoying it and unlocked all of the achievements.  At last,Do not buy the game without special sale.
47	1	a	good game for low price
49	1	a	This...is one of those games I'd pay good money to have on my tablet. I love the mix..rpg+poker = can't loose Have nothing bad to say about it at all..well besides that it's not on my tablet ;) Soooo Devs!..take this old gem and turn it into an app in the store pls..we wantss it..preciousss   Seriously, it's a nice game worth the money, pick it up if you like poker with a twist.   
51	1	a	nice but the hard game
27	0	a	The old iPhone game  Sword &amp; Poker 2  (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.  In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.
53	1	a	RPG with poker mechanics. I hate poker.  Why not rummy mechanics? 7.5/10
29	0	a	This game gave me AIDS,Herpes,Hepatitis,Cancer,Syphilis,Erectile Dysfunction and Tourettes. ♥♥♥♥ this game and it's preferred soft drink brand, I would rather have sex with the letter 69 then play another second of this ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal game. 10/10
55	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
57	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
59	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
61	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
63	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
65	1	a	I thought magic the gathering was nerd poker. This game takes nerd poker to a new level. It's not bad but it's not that great. The artwork is pretty decent.
67	1	a	Mix Magic: The Gathering with Poker and Solitaire, and you'd come up with something along the lines of Runespell: Overture. Awesome game.
69	1	a	A pretty good game. Especially for the price.
71	1	a	Surprisingly addictive; like Puzzle Quest, but with poker
73	1	a	Pretty cool solitaire with RPG elements. The story isn't the most outstanding fantasy, but it did remind me of reading a Forgotten Realms book, a bit. It doesn't help that the story ends halfway through its overall telling, implying that there's a sequel which remains to be seen, though supposedly the studio is working on a new poker-rpg title for release this year. Whether or not that's a sequel to Overture, I do not know.
75	1	a	Combines a poker-style card game with Puzzle Quest battles. There's a quest, but you can skip all the dialogue and just get on with the game. It's not that challenging, but it's entertaining.
77	1	a	A neat game with a mix of strategy and puzzle fighter. love it!
79	1	a	Wish there was a neutral rating for games like this... Not bad because I like card games combined with RPG elements but this one has some serious flaws (too repetitive, lack of content etc) and mostly the end game. It sucks so much...
81	1	a	If you like mixing poker with adenturing around, this is a good one for you.
31	0	a	Sorta easy to follow uncomplex card game with a pretty unsatisfying combat mechanic. I enjoyed it to start with and it quickly got boring.,
83	1	a	Take a bit of Nordic and Old English myths, add in some poker, and throw in a dash of epic. Well worth checking out...
85	1	a	Runespell: Overture - Solid 7/10 TL:DR; Looks like a port from Mobile, but plays well enough to let you enjoy it. Good graphics, bad sound, decent gameplay idea.   Graphics: 8/10 Game appears behaving like a typical mobile title, with big icons, colourful sprites, single click interface. This is rather small title, so not much can be expected - but it does not disapoint anywhere.   Sound: 5/10 Absolutelly atrocious music, unfit for a title, where you need to pause for a while and think about your choices.  Sound effects are average to say at best, nothing that will make a lasting impact or increase immersion. Could be worse.  Storyline: 7/10 There is a story line, suprisingly, quite decent one. There seem to be no nonsense in story arcs, characters do all fit the setting. Unfortunatelly dialogues are absolutelly atrocious. You have a medieval world full of legends with dialogues using words from modern teenagers dictionary. Unpolished dialogue lines are possibly the greatest issue I had while playing that game (after I turned off the music).  Gameplay: 7/10 There are issues with a screen display and game settings not being saved correctly.  This is quite visible, because the game is best played in 30m to 1h bursts rater than as single continuous experience.  And the experience is sometimes uneven.  This game features poker-like mechanism of matching cards in 5 sets of poker type hands to perform 'attacks' that damage health of your opponens. This is as fun as it sounds, but wait, there is more! You can steal cards from your opponent hand, you have runecards (effectively magic, limited use), companion cards (unlimited use), passive cards that increase your stats.  This extra layer of cards is put separate from your regular playing cards that you match during a duel.   This is as cool as it sounds, however the single duel can take a long time and its outcome is quite often random - as the card you get are randomized - which means that in 30m of gameplay you will have 3 to 5 duels (five being lucky) and some story line.  Past that it is really repetitive and that is why playing this game in short sessions is recommended.  Solid 7/10, recommend buy if a fan of a genre, wait for sale if not.
87	1	a	The mix of poker and MTG is fun! Plus, I worked on this game!
89	1	a	At first sight a very simple game , but it grows in complexity as you keep playing. Besides it's a nice way to learn how to play poker in an 'RPGistic' way through a nice storyline, I totally recommend it.
91	1	a	If you remotely like poker and RPGs, pick this up. This game is addictive. Got this in the Toxic Bundle from Bundle Stars.
93	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
95	1	a	Somewhat different card based game with a fantasy setting. I really liked it, though it gets pretty difficult after the inital fast progress. I'm more a casual kind of player of such games, and found it requiring a little bit to much tactical thought for my taste. Otherwise, a wholehearted recommendation for this game, especially if you like this type of game, and enjoy a little bit of tactical challenge in a fundamentally poker-based card game.
97	1	a	Its pretty much like Puzzle Quest, but with poker replacing bejeweled. Pretty fun. Its a good game to play while half-focused on something else
99	1	a	if you love poker, you'll love this game!!!
101	1	a	A nice turn-based RPG with a playing-card/poker mechanic. Lots of options to allow for various strategies.
103	1	a	Odd mix of poker...points for card combos cause damage... and fantasy card game..spells to defend or attack.. but it works. Addictive despite it's faults ( mainly not being able to cancel selections in the trade screen and having to buy the cards to replace used ones ). Good card game
105	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
107	1	a	A very good casual RPG-poker game with perfectly fitting music and visual style.  Worth the weight.
109	1	a	It's that kind of game where you fight your ennemies by playing games against them in the style of puzzle quest, but , here you play poker. The idea is ok but the game itself can be boring at times and I stopped playing it when I reached a point where the game was curiously hard and apparently I had to do some grinding against weak ennemies in order to have the items needed to fight a boss or something. On the other hand , it's now really cheap .
111	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
113	1	a	An entertaining poker + solitaire combo with decent production values behind it. Probably won't take more than a week to beeat, but I bet you'll have fun while doing it. I particularly like the music, and the combat is fast paced and fun... for a card game.
115	1	a	Solitaire, poker and Yahtzee combine to propel a combination RPG/CCG game for surprisingly enjoyable results.
117	1	a	Puzzle Quest meets Solitaire/Poker... Pretty interesting blend.
119	1	a	This game is addictive as hell. (For a card game)
121	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
123	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Puzzle Quest but the computer cheats significantly less. Pretty fun little time killer, a cool take on RPG battles, but luck is a pretty heavy component so be prepared to lose because there are no card to chain sometimes. If you can get it for cheap then why not, it's more engaging than Solitaire for christ sakes.
125	1	a	Poker meets puzzle quest. Very fun game, some fights feel overhwelming difficult though while others are a walkthrough.
127	1	a	Very unique and fun twist on poker. If you like Puzzle Quest or just like poker/other card games, then you should give it a try at least. There's a demo out but the game is worth the price for sure.
129	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
131	1	a	Runespell: Overture was fun. It reminds me a lot of PuzzleQuest, except matching blocks was replaced with competitive solitaire. Build those those trips, quads, and boats to attack the enemy. There's also spells and other typical RPG trappings. Good stuff. It's the first chapter of a larger story. It wasn't that long and the game abruptly ends.
133	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest but with poker instead of gems. Although there's not the same depth as the Puzzle Quest series it's still a lot of fun.
135	1	a	I love this game. It's just a bit short. Got it as part of a bundle but it is probably worth a few quid
137	1	a	If you like card games, you will like this competative version of poker and roll playing. I had so much fun with the demo, I had to purchase the full version. Only complaint, it's too short. Give it a try, you'll like it.
37	0	a	I have tried repeatedly to get into this game and I just can't. I find it dreadfully boring and I usually like games that do the puzzle quest thing. I'd skip this unless you really like the idea of playing a poker/solitaire mashup a puzzle quest-esque progression. Trust me, it's not as interesting as it sounds.
139	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
141	1	a	5/10  Runespell: Overture is a single-player turn-based RPG that uses poker rules and the game takes between 8-10 hours to complete. Combat involves setting up poker combinations (flushes, full houses etc.) with different combinations dealing different amounts of damage. You can use your own cards or even steal individual visible cards from your opponents. Dealing and receiving damage builds 'rage points' (essentially mana) that can be consumed to use spells (damage spells, defense spells, etc). I would recommend this game for someone who wants a throwaway game to occupy a bit of time.  Pros: - Easy-to-grasp gameplay concept - Novelty poker rules are interesting in the RPG genre  Cons: - Forgettable 'plot' - weak story - Can be frustrating at times due to the RNG nature of cards
143	1	a	It's a mix of solitaire, with a bit of poker and elements from RPGs that is really addictive!
145	1	a	If you like poker, this game isn't bad, unfortionatly I can't run it anymore since I upgraded to windows 8. Like I said unforttionatly. Well anyone who likes poker and has windows 7 or less go for it get the game
40	0	a	5 battles in and the repetitiveness of the game has already turned me off to it. Not to mention there is no volume slider to adjust the sound just on and off buttons. I'm not adjusting the computer sound and all of the background things I have going on just to hear the sound on this game.
41	0	a	Don't let the tags fool you; this is not an RPG. A Royal Flush deals the same amount of damage in hour 1 as it does in hour 5. My 1st steam purchase where I felt I wasted my money.
147	1	a	Fun game. However, needs a few things to be really enjoyable.  1. Autosaving. This game has NO autosaving. I found this out when I closed the game and reloaded, only to find I had no save data available. There were three hours of work. 2. When I stack together a straight flush or a royal flush and hit my opponent, the game really ought to have some cool super attack special or something. I felt miffed when I got royal flushes time and again, hitting for a whopping 50 damage, and it was the same piddly animation as always.  That being said, it's a fun Solitaire+Poker+RPG, and I rate it a solid 9/10.
149	1	a	A fun game, if a little challenging.
151	1	a	surprisingly nice cards game using poker mechanics. had few hours of fun with it. they just released it on iOS, too.
43	0	a	It's oké, but not really cool. I wish there was a neutral button, because I wouldn't recommend, but also I can't call this game bad. Luckily there is a demo, so you can try, sadly it doesnt get more interesting after you buy the game when the demo finishes.
153	1	a	Amazingly fun game. Unfortunatly it lacks multiplayer and even after a year of waiting, it seems like the Devs aren't too keen on expanding what could have been an incredible thing,
155	1	a	A simple fantasy-themed card fighting game based loosely on poker.  It's debatable how much tactical depth there is here, and how much 'role playing' there is on offer. Maybe one to avoid if you're after something with real depth.  Nevertheless it does possess just enough of something to keep my attention. As a simple/casual game to de-stress to it ticks the box.
157	1	a	Oh boy, this game.  Well, it's fun, the combat is very fast paced and fun, you can do a lot of moves with you skills and magic and abilities, you can combine them or charge them for a more powerful attack.   This game is HUGE, the map is VERY HUGE, there is a lot of dungeons and there is like 300 or 400 side quests to be done, but it is very unlikely that you will want to do every single one, you see, some of them, some of the quests are like the generic MMO quests (grab question with NPC &gt; kill x things &gt; collect x things &gt; go back to NPC), but there is a lot of side quests very well done and with a nice story.   Play this game on HARD, because even on HARD it will be kinda easy, seriously, you will only face a challenge if you decide to fight more than 6 enemies (of your LVL - the ones with the name in YELLOW) at once or an enemy with an ORANGE or RED name.  There is a lot of things to say about this game, but let me give you some tips that won't ruin your fun.  If you want to kill enemies with one or two hits, pick BLACKSMITH and JEWELCRAFTING skill to level up, you will be able to craft your own gear, but you can make some GODLY gear, like, you can gain +60% DMG with FIRE DMG and LIFE LEECH and a insane amount of ARMOR, you will never die, really, it will look like GOD MODE. If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).  Try to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.  Choose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).  Try to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.  Try to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).  Try to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.  ***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***   There is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.  Thanks for reading.
159	1	a	Not a very popular game but I like it very much. One of the best RPG's I have ever played. It deserved to but a greater sucess than it was. Seems it was knocked off the radar with the release of Skyrim, but in many ways I find it a better game to sink time into. Combat is great fun in this game. The world is vast, beatiful and creative with lots of side quests to keep you exploring. The story line is a bit meh and could have been better. I've put all my skill points into Sorcery which is awesome to play, and can't wait to try the others. I recomend Blacksmithing, Sagecraft, a little stealth (unless you are a Rogue, then lot's), detect hidden and persuasion. Gold is very easy to acculate in the game. Two thumbs for Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning.
161	1	a	This is truly a gem in the rpg genre. Its got everything a rpg should have like: - A open world with, like skyrim guilds to join en other sidequest as you explore - A fun and simple crafting system - Some funny humor and dialog. - Awesome combat, let's you choose what you will become, and you can become alot. Like a mix between a mage and a rogue.  - Some clever bossfights - Lots and lots of loot and dungeons Even the two dlc packs are awesome. But this does have some lame-♥♥♥ fetch this, kill this, retrieve that missions. But most of them are sidequest and can be easly ignored. It takes alot of time to finsh this game and the plentyfull sidequest/guild missions keeps you occupied for some time. So looking for a good action rpg, then picks this game up.
163	1	a	This is one hell of a game, Massive in scope, fluent and fun combat, Beautiful eviroment, engrossing characters, with tons of unique weapons and outfits just looking to be found. With easy to learn controls you wont help but sink hours of your life into it. Its the perfect RPG game.
165	1	a	(Played over 300+ hours non-Steam)  This game belong in the pantheon of the greatest RPGs ever created!  The combat is pretty much Fable, Skyrim &amp; God of War put into 1 game with a wonderful execution, the most enjoyable combat system that I have ever come across.  The world is huge and encourages you to explore it - there is a lot of lore present &amp; quite a lot of interesting characters too. Also, the characters have a LOT to say, and it seems that every voice (which are a lot) are all different &amp; it brings out a lot of immersion. A lot of variety in the areas you can visit too, you have deserts, plains, marshes, canyons and what not.  Almost nothing bad about this game, perhaps sometimes a bit texture pop-in, some boring fetch quests &amp; characters that look-a-like, but the story is thick &amp; it has literally 1000s of side-quests. You can buy houses, explore big cities, craft &amp; more! Everything you want in a RPG!  It has a great ton of customization that allows you to change your skills &amp; magic abilities on the fly, always be able to go with per example a Templar - using Magic &amp; Heavy armor, or a Sorcerer, fully magic specced with robes &amp; chakrams (Xena's weapons!) or a Thief, wielding light weapons with hints of magic - it is literally ALL possible!  There are many weapons too, Daggers, Bows, Fae Blades, Greatswords, Hammers, Sceptres, Staffs, Chakrams, and more that I cannot remember. It has any weapon you could think of in an - and I did not even mention the magical abilites which are very numerous &amp; work well together.  It also has a GREAT crafting mechanic that will have you searching all corners of the world for things to use, and as I said, it encourages it. Combined with the crafting mechanic itself is also sagecrafting - that allows you to create gems to use with equipment to enhance stats.  All in all, this is probably one of the best RPGs that I have ever played.  It's a truly, really commendable game that every RPG lover should play!  Personal score: 9/10  Best regards, Dukhat
167	1	a	 Nothing revolutionary, but the perfect scratch for your Action-Fantasy itch
169	1	a	Underappreciated gem
171	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning  I have previously played a fair amount of this on Xbox, I am pleased to confirm this is not a bad port for the PC but would be better using a controller. Overall it's good enough, and shouldn't be over-looked beacuse of the native console settings.  This game deserves the attention of any &amp; all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy well versed fan-fiction &amp; character art. The experience throughout the game delivers those elements not only consistently, but excellently; as well as any other I’ve played that never removed the presence of inquisition and curiosity. Delving dungeons, collecting loot – slaying mobs &amp; basking shamelessly in NPC related debauchery. KoA:R strikes each node of the game’s fabric as a finely hit note under a bard’s fingers.   KoA:R was unfortunately somewhat of a casualty, only in the sense that it did not rise above some other unnamed releases at the same time of its own decent onto the shelves. That said, those who have played the game will no doubt recommend it faster than they would other titles played in the same genre. There is a wealth of lore, items &amp; art in the game that is unmeasurable against some of those other games you may list out next to KoA. The type that comes from the most experienced &amp; creativity proficient in the business – combining the talents of R.A Salvatore (One of my most influential and favourite authors) &amp; Todd McFarlane (needs no introduction) the story and the world that holds it has been extruded into an exquisite universe contained onto this game. Game developers usually spend decades writing &amp; elevating this amount of content and lore into a functioning, well balanced &amp; infinitely fun game. There are few areas where KoA flounders; fortunately, these areas do not impact so far as to deter the player away at any time. The inventory system  There are 3 schools of fighting that your hero can choose to be disciplined in; Might, Finesse &amp; Sorcery – you are not bound to any one skill line at any time, but may want to be more heavily balanced towards one for equipment requirements. That said, a mix of 2 or even all 3 really makes the combat new and doesn’t go stale from using the same abilities and slaying enemies in a linear, uniform pattern. Each tree will grant you 3 points per level to spend freely in either tree. There’s even a respec feature in the game where you can ‘re-write’ your fate and change your play style if you grow bored or have a change of heart with your skill.  The campaign offers 10-12 hours of gameplay if you’re strictly ignoring the heaps of side-quests. Add those and DLC, there is well over 100+ hours for you to get your ample fill. Some parts become tedious as there is no great way to get around the massive map so playing systematically, almost like an MMO can wear you down as the player or give you a real grind element to the game. This will sate an itch for a lot of gamers but create black holes for others and can alter the players overall experience. On sale, this game is a steal given it has more content than many new AAA titles and belongs in a lot of gamer’s library with all the features &amp; replay-ability.  7.5/10 
173	1	a	A serious RPG with an awesome fighting-system like Darksiders. Multi-Monitor-Support with Fixer. Love this game!
175	1	a	This is a review that's going to make me very sad. A sad tiger is not a sight people should have to witness, but nonetheless, hear the tale of the tigers' lament. Hear the tale of the RPG that once was, and will never be. The tale of Amalur.  Kingdoms of Amalur was pitched as a wide, sprawling, epic world. Written by R. A. Salvatore and artwork by Todd McFarlane, this was a world where big names came together to produce an impressive, colourful vista. One where grand battles were fought, where the history of races was told in rich tapestries and stories of lore. Where gnomes were no longer the comedy option (World of Warcraft, yes, you, stop hiding in the back there, this is you I speak to at this point!). A world where the strings of fate invisibly guided everything and everyone around them, and those who could read the weave could fortell glimpses of the future.  The story revolves around the antagonist, one who has managed to unpick the very threads of fate, and the protaganist, you, similarly freed from fate, and your journey from the rags on your back (and the start which sees you unceremoniously dumped in a pile or corpses), to eventual confrontation with the evil that threatens to consume the world. The story has been told many times in many other games, but it is presented with a style and sheen that carries itself well here, the core plot quests keep a coherency and pace that maintain your interest through the rather lengthy world. Not to mention the absolute *ton* of side quests and factions you can involve yourself in, and their own stories and backgrounds, all of which are intricately details and have their own little plot twists. This is a game that prides itself on depth.  ... Right up until you step into it and realise that this was probably intended as an MMO. It... takes a bit of a mental adjustment to begin with, because the world, and everything in and around it, feels at first -like- an MMO made singleplayer, there's the vendors, the towns, the crafting system, in fact, so little of it feels single player tailored you'd be forgiven for asking 'Where are all the other players?'. Once you begin the combat however, that slowly fades into the background, combat in the game is intuitive, flashy, and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons, and a constant encouragement to alternate between magic and weapon attacks, this is a game that rewards variety and creative use of your toolset.  Get over that initial mental bump however, and you'll quickly settle into a large, expansive game, with a wide and diverse world, which okay, will oft remind you that it does feel like an MMO minus the other players, but then equally it will take you places and on journeys that a lot of Roleplaying games have almost forgotten how to manage these days. It's a wonderful thing.  This unfortunately is why I am a sad tiger. The company that made this game is now bankrupt, and the assets have been sold off and everything connected to it, scattered to the four winds. There will not be a sequel, or an MMO, or any further patches or adjustments. The final product is what you get here, with a few idiosyncracies and all. It is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless. If you wish to get lost in a world for a few days and embark on a properly epic journey, visiting Amalur is definitely a place to consider.
177	1	a	It's like fable and dragonage had a child   PROS
179	1	a	Fantastic game but unless you have a major amount of time to burn it is hard to get very far into the game since there is so much content.
181	1	a	A very underated RPG that is often forgotton about with one of the best combat systems in any fantasy RPG,while not a true open world it is still extremely expansive with loads of content and a must play for fans of Fantasy RPGs.
183	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It feels like it was designed for people who like RPG's, but want more involved action type combat. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy action RPG's and exploring new worlds. It's a shame that the studio went down the way they did, but this game I felt was definitely worth my time.  Pros: Combat Loot Interesting Sidequests and Stories Leveling System Art Controller support (if you like that, I played with both, it was better with PC just because of more binds I could use) Deep fleshed out world. I really liked the Lore in this game. Lots of Quests ( I did every quest except for the 'Collect XYZ' quests, and that took me about 60 hours. Choice (It's not as deep as some games, but you can make choices that have different outcomes in the world) Bosses (Had some interesting boss fights, including the last one, although not too difficult on normal setting) Voice Acting (I liked the voices of the characters, although your character has no voice, I prefer it this way)  Cons: Character Creation/Customization (not a big deal for me personally but bare bones here) Bugs (There are some serious bugs that ruined quest lines for me. They occur rarely, but it didn't take too much away from the experience for me) Main Quest Story is OK (I enjoyed it, even the end boss is pretty fun, but the epilogue after feels short and unpolished) Can be grindy (Lots of the quests are the same, but the stories for the side quests were often interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next town/area to find new quests and solve problems) Combat (Although the combat is fun, it's easy to become over powered if you figure out ways to spam certain attacks. It's not a HUGE flaw, but the balance could be better) Voices (Although the acting is good, you hear the same voices over and over again.)  All in all I would recommend if you're looking for an RPG to play while waiting for something else. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
185	1	a	Great RPG would recommend .   PROS: -descent story. -Great combat. -Good graphics. -Good character progression ( skill tree ) -Alot of activities and side quests . -Huge amount of armor sets and weapons. -Crafting   CONS: -Cant see character stats ( have to count crit chance manually ) -Game becomes easy after a certain point. -Limited stash space ( not enough space to stash all stuf you loot )
187	1	a	A Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™  Personal Rating - ( 12/10 ) Must buy Classic!!!   Great storyline, lots of quests, very very big and beautiful world to explore, great graphics !  I will still continue my Journey until i achieve everything :) So another 80+ hours on 'HARD'. (Just for one achievment lol)   CONS? (have any? well unfortunetly yes)  Lack of Multiplayer  - Game made for Multiplayer / CO-OP...but you won't find this in game menu....( [/i]SHAME ON YOU DEVS[/i]  Music/Soundtrack...  - Tragically, the music/soundtrack was far less polished. Maybe they ran out of funds? The sound just isn’t relevant to the rest of this great game, and doesn’t compare to the rest of the entertainment production.   Tons of side-quests...  - The side-quests....Yessss..Ohhhh YESSSS.....You will find tons of them in  Amalur....Good?  depends on how you want to go through the game, in this case, performing all the side-quests (  tons of them out there  ) will make you 0verpower3d Mut4nt and the game will be just too easy and boring, even on “hard (  Basically... you will enter the opponents as the Bee Gees in leggings  ). Other way (  I think is better one  ). Other way is sticking to the main tasks and the three 'main' storylines, (House of Ballads / Scholia Arcana / Travelers) to have some challenge from our enemies, and to enjoy the game as long as possible! You will feel pleasure slowly developing your character, and the satisfaction of gaining experience after a difficult battle... (  what else do you need  )   I hope that all Action RPGs will be like this one in future :)
189	1	a	(most of my hours in this game are on Origin, not Steam)  A lot of users compare this game to Skyrim, when really it is more like a single-player mix of Torchlight II and Guild Wars 2. Tons of missions, deep crafting, combo-friendly combat, a huge game-world and genuinely interesting lore means a lot of time can be spent in Amalur.  Installed size on hard drive (with all DLC): 11.6 GB  Reckoning is rather like a single-player MMO, if that makes any sense. Looting, crafting and leveling are the primary attractions. There is a ton of loot; putting points into the “detect hidden skill reveals secret rooms and passageways that have even more loot. You'll want to loot as much as you can, even armor sets that you won't use – put points into blacksmithing, disassemble the armor and weapons you don't want to get the parts, and craft something truly epic. Leveling up provides new abilities, new special moves for weapons. At the end of each leveling session, you get to choose a “Fate Card with special bonuses. Fate Cards are not class-specific, meaning you can use them to create a warrior mage who equips heavy armor, or an archer can wield heavy weapons, or a thief / rogue who also has some magic. There are dozens of hybrid “Fate Cards. And if you're not happy with how your build has turned out, visit a Fateweaver to “Remix your Fate and reset your build so you can level up again with your existing points.  The world is huge. There are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The graphics are 2012 era DirectX 9: Colorful, bright, and occasionally low-res. The general comic-book style of the artwork hides some graphical shortcomings. And on the plus side, if you have a less-than-stellar gaming PC, the game will probably run just fine. (Back in the day, I ran it on a 1GB Radeon 6670 without issues). The soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope catches the ambiance nicely. The voice acting is generally good (though your hero is silent, a la Dragon Age Origins).  Not everything is excellent, unfortunately. Combat flows well, encouraging the use of different moves. Despite the many different skills and abilities at my disposal, once I found a way to dispose of mobs, I just stuck to that, and never really tried to change up my attacks. I won't say combat is easy – if you go into an area under-leveled, you'll die fast (even with potions). But once you're comfortable in the system, combat becomes just another chore. Fetch quests are repetitive. All exploration is done on foot – no horses. The dungeons are NOT copy / pasted; there's a lot of variety here. But the missions that use the dungeon and cave levels tend to follow similar patterns. If you try to do a completionist run of Reckoning, you'll need a titanic level of patience and dedication. Inventory management, frankly, s*cks. Oh, and jumping. You can't jump, except at prescribed places (“press F to jump).  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game if you love messing about in an open world while worrying about plot later. If you're looking for a go-anywhere, do-anything adventure (with the freedom to jump wherever you want), you'll probably be happier with Skyrim. Or online with friends in Guild Wars 2. Sometimes, though, a solitary, easy grind for loot is exactly what you want - and exactly what Reckoning provides.  On DLC: The Weapons and Armor DLC provides three complete weapons sets that are accessible at the start of the game. While great to have, the things you craft will quickly surpass them in quality and effectiveness.   The Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel are both large additions to an already massive game. Each provides a new campaign and entirely new areas to explore. Naros in particular is a great piece of DLC. Both have a lot of content in an industry where content-laden DLC are rare. Definitely worth it to get both.  Notes: An EA account is NOT required. Though the game asks for an EA login on startup, you can simply click the X in the corner to skip the login. The game will play and save normally.  The company that developed Reckoning, 38 Studios, went bankrupt in 2013. The only support for the game is what you will find when trawling the forums.
191	1	a	Great game, spent a lot of time on quests. Stable, good looking and nice voiceover. It felt a bit tedious at certain points but at the end it was a great experience.
193	1	a	This game came out 4 years ago on my birthday, and unlike my parents, I wasn't disapointed.
195	1	a	Vastly underated game. What Fable should have been 10/10.
197	1	a	The most awesome flawed RPG gem of all times. It could have been one of the most successful franchises ever but well... The real bad - the infamous running bug started at approx. 50h of gameplay. The good - the game is so great that I kept playing like this for 100h more. This bug won't be fixed because the original team is gone long time ago. At first, it was ruining my game experience until I got used to it. (Some claim that if you reload a previous save you could fix this movement bug but I had no luck with this). Regardless this, it's one of the best A-RPGs I played - fighting combos, superb story with little stories with catchy dialogues, gorgeous visuals, crafting, mini games, tons of loot, it has it all and it never gets boring. There was never - and it won't be - a broken game that I will play till the end, and then some. All in all, don't hesitate picking it up for a bargain price - you will at least have 50h of fun
199	1	a	This game is something new in RPG genre.  + Open world thats perfectly sized, not small, not huge; + Unique enemies and characters; + Crafting system; + Long story (With DLCs even longer); + Leveling System; + Possibility of reseting skills whenever You want; + Quest Filter (Main Quests/Faction Quests/Sub Quests);  This game is something like mixed World of Wacraft with Fable, everything is clear and explained, there is nothing You won't understand.  Game like KoA would be an perfect idea for MMORPG.
201	1	a	First time i played KOA i say to myself : 'Shiiiit it looks like world of warcraft !!!' BUT - With High quality textures - Without the thousands retaaards running around - Art Design :  Todd McFarlane  [en.wikipedia.org]  (co-founder of image comics) - Lead Designer :  Ken Rolston  [en.wikipedia.org]  (game design on morrowind and oblivion) - Game universe and Lore :  R. A. Salvatore   [en.wikipedia.org]  (Forgotten Realms)  Thanks Azura this game got nothin common with the mmo for rude and slow minded kids. It's a very interesting and poetic rpg with dynamic epic fights and an amazingly appealing world.  Pros : + The crafting, skill &amp; respec systems + The main storyline and the sidequests (no feeling like working for fedex) + The Ancient stones spread over the world who tell you a 'faery' tale when you activate them + The Zelda Hommage + It's really beautiful, colorful, not realistic at all, a bit cartoon like, well made + A world handcrafted with love + It's a good port and just for that it's worth to see  Cons :  - Music is not very diversified. - Not a lot of choices to build the face of your character. - Some weapons way too much massive, a bit manga. - It's blurry and pale without a   Sweet FX   [sfx.thelazy.net]  - There are Gnomes, I hate Gnomes. (one of my ex girl friend left me for a gnome)  ==AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FLAW OF THE GAME== - Even in high difficulty the game is cake and it turns quickly really boring.    You must use YSA to fix that===&gt;   HERE  [www.dropbox.com]   Don't use the standalone.exe, make your own choice to fit the game to your wishes For example : I don't use the XP gain reduction cause it's buggy (the shortcuts are shiitty after that) I don't use the health regen and mana regen modifications neither cause it screws some spells I don't use the gold gain reduction cause i love to be rich as a pig BUT except these buggy things it's a MUST HAVE !!!   In conclusion i would say i've been totally charmed by this rpg different from the Elder Scrolls, or the Risen or even the Dragon Age... But like i said it's very appealing, it seems to be a long game and the more i play the more i fall in love.
203	1	a	I could kick myself for not getting this game when it first came out. The game is very good. Beautiful graphics, the main story has a good concept, but poorly written, music is repetitive and short. Pity what happened to the Dev company, I would have liked to see more from them.  The plot is interesting, your character die and comes back to life and start changing people's fates, while being hunted by those wishing to destroy you. Combat is so satisfying, the weapons and armor is good, the leveling system is ok could have been better, alchemy system is one of the best I've seen in an rpg, voice acting is tolerable.  There are factions you can join, quests to do, locks to pick, treasure to find and lore to learn. KoA is a gem of a game and a pleasure to own. 8/10
205	1	a	KoA is a very unique kind of game with an interesting story for its development. We can partially blame our boy Lincoln Chafee (failed 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate. It was his first day) for us never seeing the MMO this franchise was set to be. Anybody can Google the story, or point out the parallels between other games.  PROS:  - This game has a really expansive story. You can't hit the game for leaving a lot to be desired in backstory as this game was solely a test game with the higher hopes of expanding the narative into a MMO.  - The Crafting system is pretty solid. I have never really done Alchemy, but Smithing and Gem Crafting is pretty slick. - The Combat is fun, engaging, and requires a small amount of skill. - I liked the talent and skill trees. Though, some might not. It reminds me of WoW back before this 3 choices every 15 levels business. - Fully Voiced (Hero Exlcuded). Ralof from Skyrim's voice actor does a lot of voices.   CONS: - If you actually pick up and do all the quests in areas, you will cap out on level just about 75% of the way through the game. Very bad level pacing. - Not enough gear sets in the game. It's basically material teired (Leather, Studded Leather, etc.), and then effects can be added through Smithing and Gems. - Glitches out the wazzou. In the House of Ballads quest line if you loot a second set of the special quest armor, one is removed at turn in; one is permanently bound to your character taking up inventory slots. Forever. My end game char has them now. - The combat IS fun, but horribly repetitive. In the case of my Finesse character its rolling and stabbing. End game I just killed everything with a bow because it required much less work. I don't really care for most of the combo moves. They typically end up setting you up to be attacked, and the damage output was hardly worth it. So I would have to count exactly how many clicks most of the time to avoid using a combo that is too slow. - With the proper time put into Smithing, your gear is insanely powerful. You hardly take damage even from Boss' mega attacks. Also smithing is obselete after you cap out 75% of the way through the main storyline... so, I hope you really dig your armor's look. - The game NEVER SEEMS TO END. I am a completionist. I like to do everything I can. But damn... its just drags on and on, and maybe this is made worse by no new gear, skills, or anything since you capped out a LONG time ago. I beat this game on sheer willpower alone, and it was a friggin' chore. They just keep giving you quests, and the end is never the end. I, seriously, had to quadruple check that the bad guy I was chasing the whole game was really, truly the end of the game.  Despite the Cons to Pros, I recommend this game. Its fun, engrossing, requires quick reflexes, combat is smooth as silk. The female models are stacked (if you're into that). Most of the game's problems could be fixed with a single patch (if the devs could have afforded to keep the lights on). The glithes I ran across were mostly inventory stealers or quest related. This game copied WoW and, maybe, The Witcher/Fable. BIG TIME! This game had Garissons in the Expansion pack long before WoW added them, just saying. It's just a badass game. It IS way too long and drawn out. Especially when you can't become anymore powerful shortly after the fight with the Balor. I loved this game so much I bought it for PC, when I had previously purchased it for XBox 360. Get the game, but don't expect perfection. For a one-and-done game developer, they made a much better game than some big name companies put out everyday.
207	1	a	this is a good game , i have played for more than 300 hrs . and its still fun
209	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is definitally a great game, it may not be up at the same standards as Skyrim, but I definitally enjoyed this game more than Skyrim (This is a personal opinion, if you disagree that is fine) I felt that this game had more get to the point missions than Skyrim, and this is why I enjoy it more than Skyrim. For me Skyrim felt like you have no purpose to just wonder around and do a few missions, but Kingdoms of Amalur had more of a feel like - Get mission -&gt; Get lvls -&gt; play side and main missions, this has more of a RPG feel to me (once again this is all personal opinions)  This is a great game.
211	1	a	It's a real shame that this game is not well known. I had a blast playing it And exploring. Typical action RPG with some sweet visuals and op main character.
213	1	a	This is a GEM!!!!!! If you don't have this you are missing out. Good story, good gameplay, nice graphics. Too bad the whole bankruptcy thing with the dev's and the city killed Big Huge. Politics, ruining gaming for everyone LOL.  Lots of loot for the 'loot Loonies' out there, Lots of quests for the ' I must do everything OCD'ers Crafting and naming your own weapons and gear for the 'who needs a purple, I made this green thing-a-ma-jig' Evil choices and stealing for the 'I was never hugged enough as a child'  This is one of my all time fav's, 10/10 in my book.  Test of time nominated
215	1	a	Two things when playing this game: Stick with main and faction quests, treat sidequests / tasks as filler content to help you level. And play it on hard because that seems to be the base difficulty of the game, with normal and easy being merely watered down.   It's a good RPG, with an enjoyable combat system (even without controller) and gorgious graphics but it's selling point of having TONS of quests is also what shoots it down. They're mostly copy / paste of the same concepts and feel like they'd belong in a MMO. Not suprising considering this game was going to be an MMO at first, but a shame that this is what ultimately dragged down the ratings and enjoyment of a world that seemed so full of promise.   The two story DLCs are great value for your money, recommend getting those for more story and less sidequest grind.
217	1	a	Kingdoms Of Amalur:Reckoning Is An Fantasy RPG Game Worth Spending Time On..The Combat System is Great..Also it Has Massive Maps and Locations...Unlike Skyrim you Can Go to Many Places that you never Saw Before...The Most immersive part is when you Engage in Great Battles.. *Spoiler*: such as in Mel Senshir if you keep progressing Main Misisons...but what's Bad About (KOA) (My Opinion): is the Atmosphere of the game...and the Camera...it Sticks to you as if you triggered Third Person View.other than that it's an cool Game Worth playing and Paying For..i Recommend it for every RPG Fan
219	1	a	Shame the devs got ♥♥♥♥ed in hte ♥♥♥ and went belly up because this game did not get the approval and attention it deserves.  Sorry to say guys that the likelyhood of a sequel to this is not possible.  If only someone could see how glorious this game is and pick it up to not let it die in the background.
45	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I don’t see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.
221	1	a	This game was such a beautiful let- down. the scenery was gorgeous, the side quests were more befitting a hero than Elder- scrolls side quests ('Go slay these giant spiders.' vs. 'Hey, would you mind carrying this bag up those stairs? kthx.'). and all the classes started with unique abilities and weaponry. But about midway through the game, you start realizing how lop- sided the class options are. Stealth is nice for killing one dude, but there will always be 15 other 'hive- minded' dudes in the area ready to swarm you. The mage is flashy and interesting, but you only get four real attack spells, and only one of those deserves constant use. To make matters worse, despite you having the ability to be the grand archmage of everything ever, you dont get access to any of the spells that enemies use. like teleportation across the battlefield, and auto- targeting tornadoes. The only class ready to stand against anything is the might class. Anything close to you gets pulverized by your hammer (the only weapon option with a decent speed vs. damage output trade), and anything out of its short range gets yanked in by a hookshot. It is a powerful combo that breaks down targets that will always laugh off magic or stealth approaches. Now for the ability sets. lock picking and spell breaking protected chests is a matter of probablility, so quick saving and loading makes points into that moot, same for stealing, so putting points into these is worthless. the only decent options are sagecraft and smithing to make decent gear, a point in persuasion ( to gain access to yet another probability game) and detect hidden to find better gear and more money.   TL;DR- Get this game when it's 50- 75% off. Gameplay gets boring, but exploring the environments will be worth while, and it's pretty long, to boot.
223	1	a	Before playing KoA, I had read reviews that tried to pit it against Skyrim for some reason, an odd choice considering that the gameplay and 'feel' are at opposite ends with both of these games.   One thing you really need to ask yourself before you purchase this game is ' Do I have a lot of time to invest in another long drawn out RPG'. I asked myself that before I bought KoA and just ignored how much time I do actually have to commit.   Though I havn't finished KoA and I bored of it at about the 70 hour mark, I did enjoy the exploration and the way the game felt to play. It's not exactly open world or a sandbox but there is a lot to see, lot's to explore. I found myself swapping out specs because playing the one style got tedious and my time got taken up with a lot of travell.   Otherwise, I'm actually glad a bought this, I may finish it when I have more time, up to the point I've played was enjoyable, just a little burned out. If you do buy this, be prepared to commit with small amounts at a time.     
225	1	a	An excellent RPG. Simplistic combat system, but i like that it's not needlessly complicated. No need to open a UI and allocate combat options every time a conflict ensues. World is fairly open, seemingly endless quests and gorgeous graphics.
227	1	a	77h of pure gameplay, honestly more than I expected from a console-esque RPG. Game is a bit long for it`s own good, cause side quest are dull and repetetive in the second half, looks like the devs have run out of ideas. Rich lore, mediocre story, bearable fight system. And don`t play it on normal difficulty settings, it`s way too easy. Certainly, miles away from the best RPG experience I had in my life, but approximately same distance away from the worst. Golden middle ;)
229	1	a	If you can get past the odd feeling you're playing solo in a cartoony looking MMO, there are tons of fun ahead with this one ! I strongly recommend, especially when on sales !..
48	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do.
231	1	a	I spoke to a tree about mortal politics
233	1	a	I got this game from my girlfriend because she wanted me to try it out, I was complaining about games not meeting my standards/expectations and that I got bored of them so quickly. All I can say is that it was the right choice from her, gifting me this awesome game!  Graphics might look 'outdated' compared to many new games coming, but it has the charm that so many games lack. I continue to hop into it and not even to follow the story line - I enjoy all the things you can do, been doing so many side quests that I was in a whole completely different place than where my main story line played.  I have an emotional connection with the game, which almost no game has been able to give me besides 'Jade Empire'. KoA has the same combat style as Jade Empire, really fastpaced the only difference being KoA is way more brutal. I love the sneak take downs, always different and always very rogue-like. I remember sneaking up on this enemy and actually patiently waiting for him to turn around for 5ish minutes, sneaked up right behind him and executed a sneak attack. My character covered the mouth of the enemy, stabbed him three times in the chest while pulling him back downwards, layed him softly down on the ground while crouching, slit his throat and then looked around to observe the surroundings - if her attack was noticed by the other mobs in the area.   This game has so high immersion that I completely forget to check the time, it isn't the easiest when you are trying to fix your sleeping pattern, haha!    Pros:   - Immersive gameplay - Story rich, the story grabs a hold of you from the start and it has a high sense of importance (we all know those games trying to force you to do stuff for the 'story' and you hate it because it is so tedious and you are not interested in it, because poorly written/executed/makes no sense/makes little sense or it is just plain stupid and boring, this game has no such thing as any of the above, the story is rich and interesting) - Your character looks badass! - Fastpaced combat, it gives satisfaction with killing blows, sneak attacks, random badassery with any other weapons than daggers for example. - Brutal combat! - Awesome cutscenes, I have watched every single one! - Good/evil choice settings (gotta love that!) - Big world - not huge, not tiny! - Unique characters/enemies, even talking to random NPCs is satisfying!     Cons:    - No romance almost (every RPG needs a romance option, even if you will not play it). There are like three minor options for romance and it feels like the concept is very overlooked - Spiders (not as much as a con as it is a personal problem). Imagine running freely towards any destination, then suddenly you hear a loud rumbling, your camera spans out and out comes a huge spider! While the minor cinematic goes on, spiders have surrounded you... it isn't a dealbreaker, the loud noise makes me jump everytime.   That was a small list for cons, I know!
235	1	a	The very definition of a hidden gem.   The premise behind this game is that it's an offline MMORPG, you wouldn't think it could work but ,boy, it does. Its story is nothing new and fetch quests abound but the lore brings everything to life. The world is interesting and every map-space is unique. The combat system is amazingly fluid. Plus, the game allows you to essentially rebuild your character mid-playthrough, thus saving the trouble of multiple playthroughs to try all the character builds. The difficulty is funny though, you can get pretty broken pretty quickly in this game. Then again, you're the chosen one after-all, why shouldn't you face-melt everything you meet? lol. If that's not your thing though, there's the YSA mod that will fix the difficulty issue, making it more fair. The 2 DLCs [Dead Kel + Naros, let's pretend the armor bundle doesn't exist] are worth getting as well, both introduce a new world-space to explore that are equally unique in their own rights.   To sum up, would have been the next Skyrim if not for the existence of Skyrim.
237	1	a	I've had a bunch of fun with this game. The world is really interesting, the combat is a ton of fun, and it's beautiful.  I don't think I can overstate this. There are tons of dark, grungy, washed out worlds out there. I love Skyrim, (250+ Hours and counting) but it's colors are grey, brown, and blah. Amalur is gorgeous, colorful, vibrant, living.  The combat has a decent amount of variety, and once you get in the upper levels of power, especially as a mage, you really do feel like a tiny god, stomping on those who displease you. It's also super easy to respec a character, don't like the thief powers/attacks? Respec to a warrior and aim pointy end towards other man. Not a fan of hitting things with sharp objects? Go mage and bring down the pain. I also really do enjoy the story of this game. It's got it's share of cliche bits, but overall, it really drew me in, and kept me interested.  There are a few problems with this game that I have to face, even as a booster. It's pretty damn easy. Like, I normally play stuff on easy, maybe normal, and I didn't feel overly pressed when I played on hard. It's also easy to level past the game if you're a sidequest sort of person. There are a lot of quests of the MMO variety (fetch 10 wingdings, kill 10 grobnarks, etc, etc.)  Overall, however, I really do recommend this; it's a blast.
239	1	a	Pros: -So much to do -GREAT music -Quite a few interesting characters -A lot of different and diverse quests* -You can reset your skills and perks any time -Loot adapts to your class to a certain extent and always to your level -Huge world -Interesting combat for all classes -Story might not be the greatest of all time but it feels consistent and hasn't let me down -Steady and rewarding progression level-wise -Mixing different class skill trees gives awesome results (supported by the free class system)  *Although there are a lot of 'Go kill X' and fetch quests the great atmosphere and world design makes largely up for those  Some cons: -Balancing, late game criticals just face-roll everything, while for example slow warriors are helpless and slow -Humans look like clay dolls; especially facial expressions are just awful -Some funny depth of field and lightning effects sometimes when out in the woods -Level cap at 40 feels a bit low with the steady progression, hybrid jobs cannot reach the highest skill tier -A lot of skills are just worthless in their normal class and become only slightly useful for hybrid builds -Your inventory is gonna get clogged like your toilet after that one chili-taco-chipotle evening (AND THE STORAGE DOES NOT HELP) -Some areas feel awfully empty -Most ruins and caves look the same -A few bugs with NPC interactions  Overall 9/10 I love it
241	1	a	This game here is a double-edged sword really.   On one hand, you have: - Some absolutely insane and breathtaking scenery - Great art style, creature designs and a lot of eye-candy - Fun and dynamic combat - Very in-depth lore - Rich character building - Non-linear(ish), massive open world with fast travel  But then on the other hand, there are some pretty annoying cons, such as: - Next to no memorable characters, and if there are any, they are hardly likable - Terrible dialogue, talking to NPC becomes a chore you'd want to avoid - Limited character creator with presets instead of sliders, chances are you'll be running into twins throughout the game - Some skills like lockpicking are utterly useless - No enemy level scaling  Last thing to mention, game has quite a fairytale vibe to it, though it's still much darker than, say, Fable. It's a game that you'll either like or you won't. The game is nevertheless very much worth purchasing if you're fond of DA, Fable, Divinity, GW2, and alike.
243	1	a	Such a shame about 38 Studios going under -- this is one of my favorite games of the past 5 years. Wonderfully polished, beautifully realized world with all the loot, spells, enemies and environments you could ask for in an RPG. Playing in Big Picture Mode is especially delightful and the story is fantastic as well. --Highly recommended!
245	1	a	This is a sprawling, epic action RPG. There are three classes to choose from, might (fighter), finesse (rogue) and sorcery (wizard). It is extremely easy to create a pure character or a hybrid. Respec'ing your character is easy and you will find yourself doing this several times, if not for anything but to be able to purchase skills from an earlier trainer. I started with a pure melee character and took him to level 36. I played around with a hybrid melee/sorcerer/rogue, but didn't have fun. In the end I settled with a powerful rogue/melee hybrid that could barrage enemies with arrows from afar and mop up with blades afterward.  Combat is a mixed bag. It is essentially a click fest like many action RPGs. Even still it is rewarding. Loot is the end game and trying to find the right equipment will keep you going. Unfortunately, as with most ARPGs by the time you get a complete set of armor you have better non-set stuff. However, sometimes the bonuses gained with a full set overrides the slight decrease in protection.  Side quests can be annoying. Many are of the FedEx variety. It can be extremely frustrating to move from place to place delivering goods, or killing X number of beasts to collect your reward. There is a fast travel system that allows you to move from location to location as long as you have been there on foot at least once. This does cut down on travel time, but these FedEx quests are tedious. Since this is likely the only time I will play, I finished the majority of side quests. I did get bugged out of two and couldn't complete them. And a couple others I didn't do early and never went back to finish them. The quest system is easy to navigate and helpful markers show up pointing the way to your next objective.  In the end, I was finally glad to get through the game. The last levels are mobs after mobs standing in your way of the final battle. I did enjoy this game and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good action RPG. There isn't a lot of depth in character development, but what is here is good.
247	1	a	I bought the game even though I've never even heard about it. It was on sale, I like RPGs so I thought I'd give it a shot.   The first thing I've noticed or rather heard were the familiar voices from other RPGs. It was great to hear Canderous Ordo from SW: Knights of the Old Republic who gave voice to Agarth. Also you can hear Cullen's voice from DA: Origins. I've figured out more names when I was playing it but I've forgotten most of them now, it was a nice surprise though.  I like the open world, and man it's huge! I've played ~100h and I still haven't discovered every location. Also, each location has different environment which is good because it doesn't get boring (well maybe except caves which are all similar).  The story isn't the best point in the game, the beginning is enough to get you intrigued about it but when I found out the truth I was a bit disappointed. However, a good thing was that I enjoyed every moment that led me to finishing the story. The gameplay is very good, I found it easier to play using controller, but sometimes I found it frustrating that you can only map 4 skills. However, if you have a good feel of your character and combat it shouldn't be a big problem. Another thing that I absolutely loved about it is the possibility of mixing the skills from all trees which allows to make some interesting hybrids. It's a feature that isn't very common in RPGs.   I've found some things that were frustrating for me, for example sometimes when you have a boss fight the camera behaves weirdly, and you don't see the enemy. You just have to move your character to an open space but it's annoying if it happens often. Another things is that, you have to go everywhere on foot. Yes, there is fast travel, but the areas are pretty big and sometimes I wish they've added some mounts. Sometimes it seemed to me I've spent more time walking than fighting...And, one other thing - MORE ALYN SHIR!!! I mean seriously, she was the most interesting character out of all of them and you only interact with her a few times...such a shame. Don't get me wrong, Agarth was quite cool too but...ALYN SHIR!! What can I say, I just love her voice.   When it's on sale again, don't think twice about it, just buy it!  Edit (June 2015): I've just started to play this game again and man, the camera really sucks. You'll die more times because of it than because of your skill, it can get really annoying.
249	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur confuses me.  It is a game I couldn't imagine *anyone* asking for. Not in 2012, anyway, it is not a game to enter the Dragon Age and Skyrim league: Its art design is tepid and barely par for course, the story is not really that good, the UI is a consolized mess, there is no stat sheet (!!!), mod support is ZERO, there is very few skills and combat can be overly easy at times.  Now, with that out of the way, this is one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, and one I've certainly played way, way past the point where I should have stopped. The best comparison I could draw with a similar game would be Fable, really, since there's a lot of elements in common with it: Quick, flashy combat, three skilltrees you can invest points in (finesse, might, sorcery), two weapons you can switch between on the fly, a few magic spells (2, until a bit further on), you'll be on your own most of the time, and combat is strictly real time. The only part the game looks a bit more developed is on the skills category, where you can find several ways to improve your adventuring and crafting abilities. The greatest achievement of this game over Fable however, is that while Fable lost itself dillydallying over customization and tattoos and farting in the face of villagers, Kingdoms of Amalur disregards all that in favor of an incredibly tight gameplay and a very flexible, if not perfect, skill tree and progression, which provides an open-ended freeform progression to the player while at the same time opening new abilities and overall feeling way meatier than Skyrim's, whose progression was more of a polite indicator that you were getting better at shooting with a bow by way of shooting more with a bow.  Now, this review will be based on my 50-odd ingame hours so far. I have played with a ranged/daggers rogue complemented with some magic spells and Might talents. As you can see, I'm a kinda indecisive player, and chosen a class that's been historically looked down upon on RPGs. One, or both of those choices would have made it very difficult for me in other games: being spread too thin in Skyrim, or playing an archer on Dragon Age would make things exceedingly difficult for me. Not with KoA. There is a class that favors all-rounding. Specializing in bows doesn't mean you can't put points in swords. Or magic. And if you choose straight combat, you can utterly annihilate anything with basic combat. You can respec a pretty good number of times, too, and clever players will be able to squeeze every profession in order to get the most of them and the best equipment. But I must admit, reaching that conclusion required a bit of patience from me. The game starts very insipid and generic, and as I said, none of the first impressions I got was really that enticing, but if one can look past that, beneath the apparent simplicity and half-assedness there is an incredibly strong and extense base material: graphics are more than competent, the soundtrack is perfectly functional with moments of greatness, quests are pretty interesting if you decide to listen to them and finally, at the center of it all, the delicious, chocolatey core of it and its main driving force for me: the gameplay, and specifically, the combat.  Combat is fast and flowing, camera never gets in the way and animations and attacks are very well done. All abilities have a place on it, and a lot of approaches are viable. They might say it's a game designed with a controller in mind, but I've found the keyboard layout extremely confortable (unlike in, say, Devil May Cry), and since it's way more actiony and mobile than other games', it is also extremely satisfying: even if you are decimating groups of wolves in 5 seconds flat, you'll feel like a badass doing so instead of getting bored because it's too easy. Yes, my character has 4 active offensive skills and 2 sustained ones, but I can kick so much ♥♥♥ in so many different ways between them and my ultra-powerful handcrafted equipment that it never feels old or boring. And besides, it's better to never let your guard down: it's as easy to lose half your life as leaving your guard down for a moment.  To sum it up, if you are a fan of exploring places and killing monsters I'm not just going to ask you to buy it, but to get all its DLC (especially on sale) and to be a bit patient with it. Empty your mind, shed your preconceptions and have a bit of fun with it, start doing the first missions, you don't even need to pay a lot of attention to it. Play the game for a bit, and you most assuredly will get a satisfying experience out of it. If you ever got excited about Fable, or if you are in the mood for having a good time whacking critters over the head with weapons of incredible power, pick it up without a doubt.  8.5/10
251	1	a	This game is great with lot of stuff to do and combat is awesome.
253	1	a	I think it's time I finally gave this gem of a game a review.   Unfortunately this game didn't do well on its release because games like Mass Effect 3, and Black Ops 2 were stealing the hype of players, and Skyrim had just come out four months before - thus this game went unnoticed. 38 Studios went bankrupt shortly after the game was released completely destroying any hope for a sequel.     So, why should you buy this game?     It's definitely not an Elder Scrolls game, which is why I have enjoyed it so much. The game offers:   200+ hours of gameplay. (Excluding DLC)    Extremely comfortable and convenient fighting and spell casting controls. (100% Controller Compatible)   Countless armor and weapons to build, collect, and upgrade.   Stunning visuals and graphics and so much more!  Todd McFarlane was the graphic artist on the game, which gives it a breathtaking and also somewhat cartoonish feel of the game. Each area of the game is distinctly different and absolutely beautiful, whereas with other RPGs you get the feeling you are in the same area the entire game.   If you're still skeptical of purchasing, go ahead and download the demo and see for yourself. The game is more than worth its full price of $20, so if it's on sale go ahead and grab it. You won't regret it!  9.5/10
255	1	a	You get to punt a gnome through a glass window.
257	1	a	Fun game. Decent storyline. Excellent graphics, an enjoyable game. Has some bugs that were never fixed, but can be easily ignored. For the price I paid, it's a fun game.
259	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a western rpg, meaning when you get out of the tutorial area, the game goes 'okay, the main plot is over there, sidequests are over here... go nuts.'  Overall, the game starts out with you dying, and you're brought back by the Well of Souls, an experimental form of resurrection. So far, you're the only success. You have no knowledge of your past life, and you seem to be unbound from the threads of Fate, meaning all your actions will have unknown effects on everyone else, for good or ill. People destined to fail may succeed, those who were supposed to live may die, etc.  The game has a fair number of good points for it - you get a good range of emotions from quests and character dialog; even minor characters have been fleshed out and given personality. The combat system is fairly simple but engaging, so it doesn't take too long to learn, but for the most part remains interesting throughout the game. Most enemies who die in motion will drop a treasure bag, so if the body falls off the edge of a cliff or becomes inaccessible, you can still get the loot. There are a number of quests which your decisions will actually have an overall effect on the area, as well. More than once, someone you're sent after will go 'uh hey, I have no beef with you, just those guys. How about you leave me alone?' and you can actually work for them instead, or leave them alone. Most of the escort quests aren't too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥, either. The graphics are quite nice as well; the game is very beautiful, and the character models are done well.  The game definitely has its flaws, however. A number of fluff items are tagged as essential, meaning if you pick them up, you cannot get rid of them or even leave them in your stash. A number of quest items also remain after their use is expended, making them clog up your inventory list (or in rare cases, take up actual carrying space ). There's no way to drop quests, and some quests are repeatable, so you'll always have their markers on your map after you've stopped caring about it. The questflow is a bit odd as well - one branch of the main questline, and all of the faction questlines (along with a fair number of regular quests) point you to a city called Rathir fairly early (a place which marked somewhere around two-thirds to three-quarters of the game through for me), while only the other branch of the main questline went to an area called Detyre, which is much lower level than Rathir. This wouldn't be as much of a problem is you received the Detyre quest first, but you receive it the same time as the one pointing you to Rathir, and if you've been working on any of the faction quests, you're going to be getting a huge push to go there as well. The crafting and skill system could have used some more work as well; the lockpicking is a joke as most of the time you don't even need to move the pick, money becomes a nonissue quickly, making mercantile pointless; sagecrafting, alchemy, and blacksmithing all feel kinda useless until you max out their points. Also, after a certain point in the game, all of the health and mana potions seem to drop back to lesser for some reason, even though the others are at the correct level... until even later in the game, when any non-health or mana potion drops are all just greater damaging.  Sadly, given what... happened to the company, most of the bugs will never be patched, and no sequels will be made, which is a shame 'cause despite its flaws it really is a good game. It's definitely worth $20, and any sale price it goes to is an absolute steal.
261	1	a	I played this game on PS3 back in 2013 when I was subscribed to PS Plus. I logged hundreds of hours. This game is HUGE, maybe not as big as Skyrim, but it's up there. LOTS of quests.
263	1	a	took me about 150hrs to complete the whole game and dlc:s.very enjoyable,biggest downfall it comes a bit too easy about halfway there even on hard difficulty.recommend.
265	1	a	This is a really well-done game.   I never got into Oblivion or Skyrim, because they were just too big and chaotic for me. I happily sank 100 hours into this game because the leveling and quest systems are very intuitive. The graphics are pretty (like a very nice World of Warcraft) and the story was intriguing enough.   The combat was the best part, though. I never felt like I was flailing around, I felt like something of a beast all the way from level 1.
267	1	a	Pros:   - Story (ofcourse R.A. Salvatore) - Combat mechanics - Musics - Level design - Character design - Challenging bosses - Art direction  The one and only Con:  You're running waaay tooooo much. Running to everywhere! And no mount.
269	1	a	i can't believe it's taken me this long to discover this game. if i had known about it when it came out, i would have been all over this. it's sad that the dev has shut down and this game won't see a sequel, but it seems like there is a HUGE ammount of content to get through in this game as it stands. the world is really thriving, and i haven't played an RPG before where i've felt like the world i'm in is really varied and dynamic.  also, the magical gameplay is second to none. if you're like me and you salivate over anything remotely magical, GET THIS GAME.
271	1	a	its a good game. but while it ran wonderfuly when i was using windows 7, after i upgraded to windows 10, it keeps crashing after 5 to 15 minuts. from what i understand, this problem us uncommed for windows 10 users. but, if your in the same boat as me, i would recomend eather doing a clean re-install of windows 10, or holding off on picking up this game untill you do.   update: after disabling all my drawing tablets drivers, it now runs realy well. i have no god damn clue why wicom drivers were crashing the game, but there you have it..
273	1	a	Pretty fun game. I bought it because someone told me it has a massive game world and is fun to play - both of those things are true but the game world is split into pathways, so not quite as open as you'd think. A lot of the areas in the game just feel like hubs with different strands and pathways leading out into other hub areas. It's pretty weak to be honest and not a patch on something like Skyrim which feels like a vast, breathing world. The world here is dull, lifeless, populated by NPC's that are only really there to serve you. A shame, as the visual look of the environment is really lovely, but because of the design of the paths you never really get to appreciate the vast cliffs or forrests or deserts or anything.   The game boasts a metric tonne of quests, which is good, but really this just lends itself to feeling even more lifeless as it just feels like NPC's are kinda waiting around to have a chat with you about the rats in their house. Most quests are a bit of a waste of time and only the main quest line has anything worth paying attention to. I just skipped past most quest dialogue, sadly.  The combat is really fun. It operates on a combo/button combination basis and I thought it was a blast. Levelling up makes you feel genunely powerful as levelling up your different powers adds visual effects to your attacks and even special moves - it sounds gimmicky when I describe it to you here but somehow it kinda works. I had a pure mage and managed to level her to the point where I felt pretty godly. A lot of RPG's these days miss this feeling of superiority so it's nice to see a modern action RPG do this again.  I guess I really enjoyed the game - I did play it for 15 hours after all but also, it kinda felt more like a 3rd person Torchlight than anything close to Skyrim or any other RPG's you like. But to be fair I just thought it was quite mediocre in places. If there was a 'meh' rating i'd put that but i guess a thumbs up will have to do.
275	1	a	English (US) The game is actually good, you get all you want on a avarage action rpg, open world, lots of items, items creation and upgrades, however, this is only a goood experience if you never played skyrim or dark souls, because kingdoms of amalur is really easy and repetitive, the A.I is really poor, and have this cartoonish style that I hate.  Pros: - Lots of items and big world to explore - Best item creation system I have ever saw in a rpg  Cons: - Cartoonish visual style - Poor A.I. it is really really easy... - No coop mode - Poorly told history. - Very repetitive   Portugues (Brasil) O jogo é bom, tem tudo que voce espera de um bom rpg com ação, mundo aberto, vasto, itens a vontade, com direito a criar e encantar, pra quem nunca jogou dark souls ou skyrim, vai achar um ótimo jogo, agora se voce ja jogou jogos de rpg com ação melhores voce vai achar ele bem fácil, inteligencia artificial é pobre, e ainda tem um estilo bem cartunesco, meio infantil, parece que voce está no desenho animado do he-man.  Pros: - Bastante itens e área para explorar - Criação de itens é a melhor que eu já vi em um jogo de rpg  Cons: - Estilo visual mais infantil - Lutas são bem simples, fáceis e repetitivas, pobre inteligencia artificial - Faltou modo coop - Historia não te prende. - Muito repetitivo.  Nota 7/10
277	1	a	OLD REVIEW WAS A THUMBS DOWN In one word  'Convoluted'   NEW REVIEW BELOW  Ok i recomend this game based mainly on the incredible length and number of quests, decent storylines and dlc. But before you grab it and get bombarded with so many skills and abilites there are some things you should know.  First your skills, more then half are worthless and should be ignored till you have an excess to drop your endgame poitns into. IGNORE Lockpicking, mercantile, and stealth. The Most important skill from the start is the FIND HIDDEN skill, get that to 5.  Dispell is the next skill, get that to 6 or higher, dispelling is the hardest thing about opening magicaly locked chests. Persuasion is a mixed bag, it won't change any major storylines, but it can lead to a few extra rewards. It's not game breaking, CRAFTING COMES LAST Crafting won't make a ♥♥♥♥ of difference till the very end end end of the game, the gear you find will be better until the very end, Sage Crafting and Blacksmityh go hand in hand. SageCrafting can get to 6 or 8 Alhemy can realy be ingored, up to the user but it really can be. you'll be so rich you can buy the potions you need easily, and plenty drop.   CLASSES, Ask yourself, do you want to blaze through the game or slowly go through the game? Mages are FAST DEMOLITIOSHERS, WARRIORS are unkillable slow dps, you have to TRY to die as a warrior. Stealth seems nice but it's so slow you often ignore stealth kills and just go into combat, also the finesse/stea;th tree is majorly focused on bows.  You can mix and match any 2 or 3 trees for hybrid classes, but it keeps you from getting the top tier abilities in each.  Suggestion, don't make your first guy a warrior, don't try to craft till your lvl 25+ Get your Find Hidden to 5 ASAP  If you don't follow those basic suggestions this game is going to be tedious and so slow in the first 8 hours you'll hate it like I first did. i went to gamefaqs and read some guides to learn what was crap and what wasn't.  7.5/10 Better then most RPG's LOTS of play time, many ways to play, ability to fully espec into something else entirely is great, the DLC is super long. Adds 10-20 hours each on top of a 35-50 hour game. If you're a lore reader (which I am no) expec to drop 100+hours for a full completion
279	1	a	Besides The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, this is got to be my favorite RPG. Beautiful game, great combat (better than Elder Scrolls to be honest) and great sound design. A must play for hardcore RPG fans!
281	1	a	The good parts of Fable and the good parts of Dragon Age mixed into one game.
283	1	a	This game is my pride and joy ! I love it too much because there isn't anything like it when it comes to PC RPGs. You can play it with an XBOX controller for an immersive experience. The graphics are beautiful without being demanding so it should run flawlessly even on older PC's.   The story is intriguing but there is space for more.  Yes it's inspired from Fable or Witcher but hey those are awesome games and it's not just a crappy clone ; it somehow manages to be unique and fascinating. You can get lots of hours of fun by playing this game (probably hundreds of hours) so it deserves all the attention. Too bad the studios who created this little gem are now closed. They deserved more than that.  It kinda reminds me of MMORPG genre but that is not a bad thing. It's a shame that MMO's are populated by jerks and kids - that's why i prefer anytime a single player experience. Call me crazy but that is how i see things - i just want to game in peace.  The price is big on Steam but you get more than you pay - i got the game for free from a friend but i would have bought it without even thinking. it's A NO BRAINER!  Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions, four playable races, and three class trees with 22 abilities per tree.The four playable races are the Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans).The player starts off as a 'blank slate', but can afterwards choose a class among the three available in the game, which are called Might, Finesse, and Sorcery; they correspond to the fighter, rogue, and mage classes respectively. As the player fights and gains experience, additional levels are unlocked. With each level gained, the player gains three ability points which can be invested in the skill-tree system to unlock or augment the 22 abilities. By completing Faction quests and investing ability points, the player can also unlock various 'destinies', which add positive buffs to the player. Combat is based on the timing of button presses, similar to an action role-playing game, with occasional quick time event cutscenes. The combat includes a 'fate' system which allows players to accumulate 'fate points' and ultimately enter 'Reckoning Mode', a slow motion mode that allows the player to quickly dispatch enemies. The Reckoning Mode may end on player's command, with the depletion of the fate bar or by the act of 'Fateshifting' an enemy. Fateshifting involves performing a brutal finishing move on a single enemy. During the cosmetic Fateshifting phase, the player may rapidly tap a random button (chosen and displayed by the game) to increase the experience yield up to 100%. After the Fateshifting, all weakened enemies also die.  The player can travel on land, jump down from predesignated spots and swim in the water. The player has the ability to communicate with, rob or kill NPCs; each of these actions have their own consequences. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara emphasized that 'twitch skill is only going to get you so far. Strategy and proper RPG playing is going to get you farther.'[5] 38 Studios founder Curt Schilling said that the style of the game would be a marriage between God of War and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
285	1	a	Excellent game overall. Here is a short overview:  + Excellent combat system: Game is very fluid, rewards proper timing and position. + Optimization: Runs very well on pretty much any computer. + Customization: As a proper RPG, this game allows you to customize the ♥♥♥♥ out of your toon(with the ability to respec for a fee).  - Graphics: Game looks a little cartoony but i'd imagine this was part of keeping the game as accessible as possible. - Overpowering: You quickly feel incredibly strong depending on how you specialize your character.  So overall, the game is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of Action-RPG's.
287	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur sure feels like a refreshing wind after trying out a bunch of different mmorpgs and rpgs.  This game combines the combat of many console-esque titles like God of War and Darksiders, with the lore and rpg-aspect of games like Dragon Age and Vampire the Masquerade (roughly speaking).   Lore  After playing around 12 hours I was feeling fairly immersed in the world of Amalur. Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for 'lorestones' across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game. But for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.   Size of game-world  The game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand &amp; you travel between subzones on it. 'Clearing' each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.   Quests  Some people voice concern that the game is too 'grindy' and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.   Visuals  The visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.   Classes  One of the games absolute strongpoints is the 'class'-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own 'class' - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic 'Warrior, rogue and sorcerer'-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.   Combat  The combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and 'combos' as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.   Minor flaws of the game  My only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather 'instanced'. Still the 'instanced' areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.   Conclusion  In overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.   Rating  Giving this game a 8 out of 10.
289	1	a	Big, long, open-world RPG. Grabbed this when it was on sale for $5. Totally worth the sixty or or hours I got out of it (and I didn't bother doing everything). Great art direction, too.
291	1	a	I have always loved this game, I love the variety of weapons that can be used, I love the art and i love the combat style especially with staff, the areas are pretty too. It's great for an old game, but the cons for me are the quests, there are just so many and sometimes it feels like 'blah blah blah' a lot of the way through you just want to hurry them up and get them out of the way, that aside.. for me it's still worth playing.
293	1	a	Despite the company going bankrupt after the launch of this game, this is actually a really solid, involved, RPG. I downloaded it years ago and finally decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.   +Pros -Immense character customization -Incredible variety of equipment -Fleshed-out, interesting characters -TONS of side quests -Innovative, easy to learn/difficult to master combat -A huge, expansive, living world -Lots of lore and background into the world -Interesting, forward-moving story -Crafting/alchemy -Solid DLC -Good enemy variety  Cons: -Level cap of 40, which I hit at about 3/4 of the way through the game -It gets EASY towards the end. The final boss was hilariously simple to beat. -Silent protagonist. -Occasional camera issues -A few bugged quests  As a completionist, doing all side quests, I beat the entire game in about 70 hours. If you are a fantasy RPG fan, you should check this game out when it's on sale.  
295	1	a	awesome rpg game i enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game u have spells crafting and a huge map so there every reason to play the game and its not hard to play u can also play it casualy thats what makes beter
297	1	a	Worth every cent. The skill combinations and seamless integration between magic melee and ranged skills always keeps a fight interesting. The monsters are a bit repetative but what do you do when you see a lot of repetative mobs?  Kill them all.  The story line is also well thought out with extensive and detailed lore.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mmo's and action games.  A side note; you will become incredibly powerful in this game. Hard mode is the way to go if you want a sight challenge, but the game isn't very hard to play. Great for the casual gamer.
299	1	a	Why have I waited so long to recommend this game? Why? I know why, because I thought, 'When I get to the end of the game, I'll have a true appreciation of it, thereby writing something from my extensive knowledge.' Yeah, sure. At level eighteen and about sixty some odd hours in, I'm no where close to finishing. So onto my actual review:  This game is actually really good and I feel it's been overlooked. I honestly feel it is a diamond in the rough. It -is- similar to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but let me tell you something fascinating. I bought ES:Skyrim before I bought KOAR (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and when I bought it and played it, I did -not- care for it. I was lambasted, cast out and disowned but there it is. I didn't like it. Now flash forward to spending time in Reckoning, I want to go back and play Skyrim. That's how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. It takes me back to a place when I started playing World of Warcraft. There were these amazing characters, this fascinating storyline, beautiful artwork. This, that and the other. Eventually I fell out of love with World of Warcraft, but this game takes me back to that feeling of rolling my first character.   The combat is very user friendly. I would akin it to hack and slash, but I feel that simplifies it far too much. You have abilities, the way you unravel the fate of a foe is cinematic and enjoyable, somehow savagely satisfying. The talent trees are easy enough to navigate. Much in the spirit of Skyrim, you can choose what you want to be and whether you want to go, might, finesse or mage, or all three or two or...you get where I'm going.  The skills are pretty neat, you have options on alchemy, a sort of jewelcrafting, blacksmithing, lockpicking, dispelling...and on and on. I wouldn't recommend lockpicking as the lockpicks are cheap, cheap and even the 'hard' chests are done simply enough.  The quests are pretty fascinating, especially the main quests. There are some side quests that will have you fetch and step bear butts but its to be expected with any sort of RPG, in my opinion. Character creation is neat, not overly detailed but enough where you get your input in. If you're expecting to spend 3 hours lost in faces, noses, ears and hair style, you will be let down. This game is not linear. You can put off the main quest indefinitely if you so wish, there are factions to join and quest for, increasing your reputations with them. There are choices to be made to decide the moral ambitions of your character, there are persuasions to attempt, assassinations to be had and endless monsters to slay until your heart is bursting with contentment.  TL;DR? Does it revolutionize the RPG genre with it's intuitive and mind-blowing format? Not so much. Does it bring out some of the -best- of what we love in RPG's? I firmly say, yes. Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely. I think if you're a fan of RPG's you will find hours and hours worth of enjoyment, plus replayablitiy.   8/10
301	1	a	I think this game is amazing, I sunk 25 or so hours in before even touching the main story line. To me, it feels like everything Skyrim could have been. The graphics are quite good, the look and feel is great, the voice acting is decent, quests are varied in a number of ways and the combat is amazing. Althoguh it doesn't do anything insanely special, it does a lot of stuff really, really well, making it a very polished game.  The one thing that annoyed me quite a bit, as I frequently used reskilling as a way to keep the game and combat fresh and exciting, was that there were always a number of skill points that were wasted on things I didn't need or use but were required to unlock the next tier of skills.  Very good game all around though, I hope more games come out with well rounded quality like this.
303	1	a	Amazing Game that deserved much more.  The best combat systems in a game i've ever played, huge mmo type world in a singleplayer experience, very nice crafting and skills sets etc.  Well worth the purchase for hundreds of hours gameplay, which is rare in a single player experience these days.  Still better than Dragon Age Inquisition.
305	1	a	one of the must unknow and underrated RPG games, i bought it for 360, LOVED it...was free on PS3...loved it more...saw it on PC with all DLCs...yes it is a must get. great story and great game play. just wish they would make a 2nd one but never will.
307	1	a	Awesome game. It's like the artistic style of Fable and Oblivion got blended together with the playstyle of open worldness of Skyrim and, to some degree, combat mechanics capturing the essence of God of War. The story is enthralling and the gameplay completely open for you to choose how you wish to approach it. Not to mention that it looks completely amazing, and the load screens are seconds long, never having one longer than 10 seconds, even with the settings maxed out on my somewhat dated machine. Something I wasn't expecting when I got this game, was how mature the story and some of the kills are, though tastefully done. If anything, I'd call it a positive that they made this game more adult oriented. I really love this game, thus far, and it has tons of replay pottential. The only thing I find that could detract my love for this game is the apparent time it takes to complete, which I've seen many say is about 200 hours of gameplay. Be warned of that.
309	1	a	Possibly the best open world rpg sngle play game I ever played, and I can replay it without getting bored of it. The menu style is super clean, though the weapons and armor are abit out of wack but overall it's good. 9/10
311	1	a	I don't understand why this game couldn't sell enough copies to stay afloat. It's beautiful, huge, high fantasy, with fun combat. Borrows from Fable, Diablo, Elder Scrolls. Lots of side missions and lore, good voice acting. It's a really solid rpg and I wish they were still working on the sequel.  Only complaint is that the pc port was obviously hurried and they'll never fix the bugs now (eg quests menu is totally unusable on larger monitors, no walk speed, redonkulous unchangeable menu key bindings).
313	1	a	Overall, the game is pretty good. The main problem is that it's too easy.   With Lorestones and unlockable Destinies, there are no shortages of permanent bonuses. If by the end of the game you have fewer than 30 bonus mods not related to your equipment, you must be doing a speed run.  Each area apparently has a level range, and the levels of enemies get locked to your level within that range the first time you visit the area. There are no areas where the minimum level is 40+, meaning after you get to a certain point, leveling further becomes impossible. Luckily, 40 is more than enough to become totally invincible, especially with the Dead Kel DLC.   With some clever blacksmithing, you can end up one-shotting many foes, and bosses will take no more than 4 hits.   Also, the map you have is magic. For most quests, they ask you to go somewhere and find something or kill something, and the map knows exactly where it is, even if you haven't been there before. The Lost Treasure Of Meropis is a quest to find a bunch of relics sunken in various bodies of water. Surprise, surprise, it's not a 'lost' treasure for long because your map knows exactly where all the relics are. This happens in 95% of quests. NPC's will be totally amazed that you found the lost journal of a long-dead scholar or the bandit-in-hiding.  This aside, The world is pretty large and decently well-rounded. Some of the quests are pretty interesting on their own, but most will seem silly. With a little work, your character will soon be the undefeated champion gladiator, the archsage of the largest group of mages, the king of a bunch of immortals, etc. Sadly, no NPC will know you are more than one of these at a time.  The fighting system is pretty good overall but again very biased in your favor. With the exception of certain bosses, no regular enemy has more than 2 or 3 attacks, many of which are staggered so you have time to react. The variety of enemies is lacking considering the size of the world so you can quickly learn how to deal with them all and then demolish everything standing in your way.  The storyline is alright once you properly understand how literal the characters are when they talk about fate. The Fae are pretty much stuck in an eternal loop of rebirth and redoing the same thing as last time, and knowing that they are doing it. The other races have fate issues too and your character seems to be the only exception. All things stem from this.  From what I've seen of Skyrim, this game seems very similar to it, except this version seems to be more rushed in it's development and a little buggy.
315	1	a	Kingdoms of amalur: Reckoning is an open world action rpg with emphasis on combat.  The game's plot is interesting in concept, but flawed in execution (more on that in a minute). The world is filled with powerful magic and watched over by a powerful race, the fae, split between the winter and summer court. They have lived in relative peace with the mortal races of humans and elves, until one day the winter fae attacked the mortal races. Unlike mortals though, the fae ressurect after a while, for no fae truly dies, or stays dead forever, while mortals do. You are the recently ressurected hunk of meat that takes whatever form you customised it to look like, dragged out of the well of souls, a magic item capable of bringing the dead back to life in massive numbers, except that you are its first and only success. You learn that on the day of rebirth, the winter fae have attacked the facility you are in just as you wake up, you are told about the well, what you are to a basic extent, and then told to flee the place before it caves down on your head, not before you learn you have weird powers, somehow connected to fate...  Now, it turns out that everything and everyone has a fate, dictacted by the tapestry of fate, you however, are not connected to it, and can change it however you like, in theory. This is leads to one big problem. how linar the game actually is.   You can do all the side quests in any order you like and follow a number of faction quests in whichever order you like as well, but, even if you have literally nothing binding you to a set path, no choices you make have that big of an impact, save for a handful. You are stuck following this same basic path up until the points where the game says you can make a choice, do you side with A, or B? Sometimes, if you are lucky, C. A good example is when a soldier who wants to sell everything he owns to the people of a town asks you to do it instead. You can buy all the items off him instead, but i wanted to give him way more money, maybe an OP sword i forged and make him feel better about life. I couldn't, i just had to follow the quest line mindlessly. the majority of quests can be summed up similarly. Most of the side quests are fetch quests, or 'go kill this' quests, or delivery boy quests (where you go back and forth between two characters exchanging messages and items). You can ignore them, but even the major quest lines feel weak, the only entertaining ones were those to do with the fae, but i, at no point, was able to just do whatever i wanted. I can't explain how restricted i felt doing some of these quests, and how many of them felt extremely boring.  The lore of the game is suprisingly well put together in some parts, i really loved the fae and how the winter and summer fae acted within the world. Both of the fae quest lines were the highlights of the game for me. That was the only bit of the story i found actually praise worthy.  The game, apart from the dull quests and plot full of holes, is really fun. The combat system in this is very satisfying, you have a total selection of nine weapon types, each one with a few combos each, and a slew of special moves. The enemy variety isn't great, but its just good enough to stop the game from getting stale. In the early game, combat is a bit tough, especially against niskaru, but, by the mid to end game, its dreadfully easy, especially if you ever get health regen above 4 points per second and max out smithing and sagecraft, effectively allowing you to mass produce gear that outshines every other piece in the game. The game never felt truly challanging, except for a few bosses here and there, and the only time i was fully involved and entertained was when i was surrounded by a pack of niskaru and i was out of health potions, then it was challanging.  Character progression is pretty in depth as well, you have three skill trees, magic, strength and stealth. You put points into various aspects to unlock and power up abilities, and if you put enough points into trees, you unlock classes, allowing you to gain bonuses to certain aspects of your character. I did however manage to break the game by unlocking the thunder storm ability, which was a mass AoE attack that also stunned and knock back, from there, it was down hill the moment i got chakrams, which were AoE melee weapons with high damage output.  The art style is, overall, vibrant. Everything is saturated in a rich color scheme, and alot of the designs for the enemies are pretty interesting. Though, every last bit of armour and weaponry looks like it was pulled directly from an MMO (which this was originally meant to be, or at least, meant to be a pre-quel of if i recall). As such, its all rather over sized and silly looking. Your character looks like a goof, mainly because half the time you'll be running around with pieces of different armour sets that just do not blend together. Not to mention the rather limited character creation menu.  This game isn't terrible, I would never talk anyone out of buying it unless they are specifically looking for great plot. Everything it does, it does to a decent standard and only in storytelling does it fail. It not an all time great, its not a hidden gem and its not a classic. Its more of a cult classic than anything. If you are looking for a standard, decent rpg with good combat and have some time to kill before you move onto something else, or just want an rpg who's entire focus is fae. Then this is a game for you. If you are looking for a strong plot or an rpg where every action you take directly influences the overall story for better or worse, avoid this.  I personally found this to be...acceptable, I don't regret my time with it, nor do i think i'll recall this game with any amount of deep fondness. In truth, i tried to beat this twice as a console pleb back when i had a PS3. The game glitched and broke twice on me, around the 40 hour mark. So the main reason i bought it again and beat it was for closure. Having finished it, i can cry to the heavens 'Eh, it was alright'.
317	1	a	A damn good RPG with great art-direction, sound, music, combat, character progression, crafting...all top-notch.  One of Steam's most underrated gems.
319	1	a	WOW, Another MUST have game IMHO !!! I waited a Long time to play this game &amp; get a price drop on STEAM compared to retail/Etail editions due to some problems with the dev going under. This game has EVERYTHING i Love in a Arpg, looks great, plays silky smooth (on a old system gtx285/q9550/8gb ram), more then enuff replay value with tonnes of good loot to be found. The game has lots of depth, decisions you make actually make a difference in the game. If you like to explore &amp; want to get everything out of the game be prepared to sink hundreds of hrs into this lovely game. The music &amp; atmosphere help to project you further into this realm of Amalur, it really is a joy just listening &amp; watching all that is going on. Unlock abilities &amp; truelly have a say in what u can craft/disasemble as U lvl Up in the game. Some will say you waste time with side quests but i find it all adds up for those that love to dig deep &amp; explore the world. I love all the abilities this game has, something i just found out today is pickpocketing, i was like DANG, wish i knew that from the start, oh well....i can't read manuals, i just 'GAME'. This game has an artistic feel to some other rpg's i really like like torchlight, some will argue it but each to their own evaluation. For me, i Know a game is Golden when initially i i play it 18hrs+ &amp; can't stop playing it till i finish. This game is possessing me to finish it like the Batman series did, it Truelly is an addictive game.  P.S: BUY this game if u love Arpg's or '1st person view' rpg's in general ! Is it worth FULL PRICE for the base game ? HELL YEAH, is the DLC package worth it ? i don't know but if it's like the base game i say YES. Obviously to those wanting to save $ on a sale of 50% min it's a NO brainer !!!  Another note: the 'Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle' seemed to be WEAK, if you use it right away then it may be 'OK' but if u sit on the fence before using it after many hrs of play it seems like a ripoff. (IMHO) PLEASE DO BUY skills for $ from NPC trainers lvl1-3 Good day &amp; DO pick up this wonderful game, i hope the IP wasn't lost &amp; that there will be another edition, but it seems like that won't be the case:(  WIN 7 64x works without issue on my system !!! specs are: q9550 gtx285 (SLI) Not used 8gb ram 2tb hdd..... 256gb ssd
321	1	a	The game is Action RPG, but it feels like offline MMO and its quite massive to complete.  here some pros and cons:   +Colorful Environment [Mid-Anime]  +Massive areas to explore  +Crafting (potions, armors, weapons etc.)  +Leveling system (max. 40)  +Home upgrades +Abilities and cards system  -Shallow main story -Auto-save mechanics are not working properly. (be sure to quick save)  -Repetitive soundtrack (gets quite boring after a while)  -Repetitive mobs (enemies)  -NPC Lip-sync is a total disaster -Lots of side quests (but meaningless)  In conclusion is a good game and I quite enjoy it.  ...even better if you bought it on sales. 7/10
323	1	a	This game is often compared to Skyrim, for a reason. Both present a huge, open fantasy world with hundreds of quest which can be taken in no particular order. This is, however, where any similarities with Skyrim end.   Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has stunning and very colorful visuals that had me hooked in an instant. I pay a LOT of attention to scenarios in RPGs, and Amalur probably has the most beautiful I've ever seen. The forests, ruins and towns really give you the impression of a world full of things to explore.   That being said, there are a bunch of things that feel 'off' in this game. The gameplay is just fine: not brilliant but not bad either. It is not a challenging game and most of the time I just found easier to hack and slash my way to victory than to use spells or rogue abilites. The way your casting is interrupted by literally any attack is really annoying and counterintuitive. The most powerful AoE spells take a long time to cast, and should be more useful against several enemies, but chances of being interrupted are huge and therefore said spells become useless. Like I said, the melee strategy was the most efficient by far for me, which is a little underwhelming since I really like using magic.   Another problem with Amalur: questing. 90% of quests will reward you with gold and experience. The quests have some cool stories and lore behing them, but being rewarded with the same things over and over agains becomes tiresome, especially considering you won't need that amuch gold.  There's also no reason NOT to use the 'fast travel' ability, which makes exploring the world less interesting as well. You won't get cool random events like in Skyrim, ever. 90% of the experience you get comes from quests as well, so fighting monsters is not a reason to backtrack ON FOOT (because there are no mounts).  To be honest I think Amalur should have inspired itself in Skyrim even more. Maybe it didn't had the budget to do so, I don't know. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is crazy about fantasy and cool scenarios (like me), but be mindful that most of it's problems are glaringly obvious for players who are used to play lots of RPG games. That being said, Amalur does provide a satisfying experience under its own limitations.
325	1	a	Kingdoms is one of those hidden gem games. With gameplay and a questing system similar to World of Warcraft, an incredibly rich and detailed lore and an absolutely massive world to explore, Kingdoms should have enough in it to keep you occupied for hours. Unfortunately, the company behind the game has since collapsed, so don't expect any support or future DLCs.  Still, overall an 8/10.
327	1	a	I've played the crap out of this game and it is awesome. The storyline is rich, the character creation wasn't too in-depth, the skills are freakin awesome, and the quests are numerous. Definitely has replay value since you can choose different skills to level and options to take in conversation. I wouldn't call it revolutionary but it's certainly fun to play. Good mechanics with very little bugs, even though I can't recall any at the moment. The voice acting is not cheesy so it doesn't ruin the game. I'm a fan of single player rpg's and this one got me. Epic battles.
329	1	a	This game is a hidden gem! Got this game during a weekend sale and boy was i amazed!  Great gameplay, beautiful visuals, huge number of quests, nice dialogs, it gives you a feeling of progression as you keep discovering new upgrades for your weapons/armors. The world map is absolutely huge (skyrim style), each area has it's own specific mobs. At the moment i'm writing this i have around 35 hours of gameplay and i'm not even in half of the game with over 100quests finished, and around 100 more started. This game is a must play for any RPG fan, and you might find it even better than Skyrim. For sure i do.
331	1	a	After playing it so long, i have finnaly decided to put a review in. Now, first off, this is the first game i have ever felt compelled to write a review for, so that means its something special. Now after looking at the reviews that have 180 or so hours on record, that is pretty impresive, but at the same time its not. On The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, i have about 500 hours on record, so doing the math, that would be playing for about 20 days straight without sleep. The reason why that is is the fact that you want to try out all of the different classes and combinations, and this game is very similar. The whole game is centered on fate, and that you are not effected by it (you will see why within 20 minutes of the game). Just like skyrim, you basicly choose your race, then get dropped off in a huge world and your class forges as you play. There are three ability categories: Might, Sorcery, and Finesse. wWhen you level up, you get three points to put into whatever you want. You also have destinies. When you get a certian amount of points in a single ability, or in two abiilities if you are doing a combo, you can select a destiny which will grant you addtional bonuses. You can combine destinies, (Finesse, Finesse/Sorcery, Sorcery/Might, All Three, etc...) into what every you want, and there are 6 levels of destinies for every one. There is a very helpful element to the game, and that is unbinding fate. It basicly (for a cost) resets and refunds all skill points, ability points, and destinies. This lets you make yourself the best mage in the universe to the best warrior in the universe in about 2 minutes. Unfortunatly, at the point in the game when you do this, you will have probably gotten far and there is not as much point (since you done have as much time left to play with it). You can reset your fate within 10 minutes of the game, although i went pure stealthy thief and have not unbound my fate once. I recently beat the game, at 35 hours, and am trying to unlock the last finesse destiny (you will understand when you play the game), and plan to continue with that character until i do. Speaking of the thief class, the game is hard on you closer to the end with it. You are UNSTOPABLE against a single enemy, even the final boss, the semi-final boss, and every other boss like thing was absolutely no trouble, but anytime there is more then one enemy, it gets pretty hard. Alot of the finesse (rouge/thief) class requires you to charge up your attck by holding the button down for a extra second or two, but with more then one enemy, they attck before you can do that. I have yet to play anything else, so i do not know if it is the same for the other classes or not. If you are playing just the story, you could probably beat the game within about 7 hours, but it would be incredibly hard since you would not get to a very high level. Just like other free-roam games like skyrim and far cry 3, you will be lost in the side quests before you know it. I recently showed it two one of my school friends (im in 9th grade), and after about a week of pushing, convinced her to buy it. She is only like level 5, but she said it is amazing. She described it is a skyrim like game, looking like World of Warcraft (in some ways, but i dissagree. The pictures you see above are a little better). Ultimantly, it is an amazing game definetly worth twenty dollars (i would buy it for $60), that you need to play. Even if you just play the demo to see some of the stuff i am talking about, you will probably want to buy it. It has amazing faction quests, some very fun side quests, and probably one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) story questlines. If you are still reading this, that means that this review was interesting enough, which means the game if better. There is alot of the stuff that i left out, that you just need to play to understand. I will defenetly be playing a new game of this again, and possibly even make a walkthrough, just because i love it so much. To close, i am going to say that this is my favorite game i have every played (and i have 167 games on steam, and about 40 more on the xbox) and i really hope that this review convinced you to purchase it. It is a shame that 38 Studios closed down, but i loved the game enough to really dig deep in the internet to see if there is a sequel, and there is a possibility, and buying and promotion the game will definetly increase that chance. I ask that you please buy this, and then write your own review and tell your friends. I have just spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes writing this, and it has not gone to waste. Please, buy this game and tell your friends, your will be glad you did.
333	1	a	Summary: I highly recommend Amalur for anyone looking to scratch that high fantasy RPG itch until the next great title comes along. For the full purchase price of $20, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid purchase. For $6 when the game goes on sale like it is now, it's a ridiculous bargain.   Background (or why my hours played is so low but the review remains relevant :P ): I originally bought this game a month ago through Origin (don't hate, back then it was seven dollars there vs twenty here) where I clocked in over 90 hours of game time and finished the game. Well, currently Steam has the Amalur Collection on sale for $12 that includes the core game, both DLCs and a weapon/armor bundle. Back on Origin the DLCs cost $10 a piece so I just went ahead and bought the entire collection here. So on to the review!  Pros:  (1) This game is massive. And I mean MASSIVE. I stopped doing side quests about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game because I wanted to see how the main quest line would end, and it still took me 90 hours to finish the game. So if you're a completionist and you decide to explore the entire map and do every single quest my guess is the game offers around 200 hours of game time. For six dollars that's... kind of crazy. And yes, you can continue adventuring and discover/finish side quests after completing the main story line. :)  (2) Combat is fun and fast paced, with fluid animations, nice particle effects, and charge ups/combos galore. There are three schools of combat skills available (basically mage, warrior, thief), but you can explore any and all of them without restriction and for a price you can respec your character any time you want through a number of vendors in the game.   (3) The voice acting is solid. One of the worst sins a RPG can commit to kill immersion is to populate their world with terrible voice actors. Luckily they avoid that problem here. You might still meet the random side quest character who could have put in a little more emotion here or a bit less ham there, but all the main characters do a fine job carrying out their roles as do most of the secondary cast.  (4) The game world is well developed. A good RPG needs an immersive game world to lose oneself in, and Amalur does a good job on this front. First, the world lore is well fleshed out with books and lorestones (think audio books) scattered throughout the world providing history, context and even humour. Second, the game world looks nice, especially for a two year old title. The stylistic approach they took is very high fantasy, with colorful and vibrant settings, so if you're looking for an overall darker/perpetual winter type environment you might be disappointed.   (5) The game is stable and bug free. In 90 hours of game play, I've only come across one bug. Unfortunately that bug did force me to load up a previous save game to proceed in that side quest, but 1 bug in 90 hours of game play is pretty darn good. For those who buy this game and are curious, the bug takes place right before your conversation with Sir Sagrell on the House of Ballads quest line, so just save before then and you should be golden.  (6) You get to support the state of Rhode Island! After Steam takes its cut, proceeds from Steam sales of Amalur goes to RI, not EA. Well, okay, if you hate the state of RI I guess this would be a con. I've never visited RI, but as the tiniest state in the US I have a soft spot for them. Guess it's just me rooting for the little guy. :D  Cons: (1) No more support. The company that developed Amalur is bankrupt, and its assets scattered to the four winds (or RI in this case which was the company's largest creditor). So there aren't going to be any sequels, or patches, for this game. Ever.   (2) The camera is too zoomed in and you can't manually zoom out. This REALLY bugged me when I first started playing this game. The camera automatically zooms out in combat to fit all the people on the screen as well as during special attack animations, so the game is fully capable of zooming in and out. They just decided to be lazy and not implement a manul zoom function for the PC. -.- After a few hours, I got used to it but chances are it's going to bug you too if you're a regular PC player (apparently this is a console port issue?). I've read you can fix this by using Widescreen Fixer, but I haven't tried this so YMMV.   (3) The story is just adequate when it could have been so much more. At its core, the main story itself is derivative of many other fantasy tales. Their focus on the interplay of Desinty vs Free Will offers it a refreshing change of pace, but the game never takes that extra push to make its stories truly emotionally gripping. For example, one of the more interesting and sympathetic characters I ran across was an antagonist who has been condemned to play the part of a villain in a never-ending, repeating fairy tale for all eternity. So yes, she's a villain, but she's a villain who is doing these things to break the cycle where she is condemned to play the villain forever, and forever. And while the game lets you choose her side in the end, the resolution just never reaches any kind of deeper emotional crescendo or pathos like they could have if they dug just a little deeper.  (4) The depth of your relationship with other characters are just adequate. This, similar to the story, is an issue of wasted potential. Like the story, the personality of the people you meet and their relationship to your character is portrayed in a perfectly adequate matter, but it never progresses beyond that. We learn that our character had a past relationship with some of these people, but the relationships never really evolve in the here and now. Sure some of them greet you differently after you've helped them, praise you, even call you their lord, but a true emotional connection or investment just isn't there. Contrast this to titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect where it was your relationships that basically made the game so great and.. well... so... much... potential... :(  (5) Some of the dungeon layouts are not very optimized for fun. Barring its many flaws on release, one of the things Skyrim did very well was their intelligent dungeon map layouts. Every dungeon was set out so that it would either loop in itself or end at another exit so you didn't have to track through an already cleared dungeon to leave. Amalur does this for its main dungeons and most of the side quest ones, but they neglect to do this for a noticeable number as well which, well, is just dumb. This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're talking about a 200 hour game with countless dungeons, it gets very annoying having to backtrack through an empty dungeon just to exit.   Conclusion: All in all, this is a solid RPG romp through a well developed and entertaining land of magic and adventure. And at six dollars, or even twenty, I would give it a solid recommendation. So get out there, craft your own Destiny, and happy questing! :)
335	1	a	i played this game on ps3, pc back in 2012. and i recently bought it again. this game is a masterpeice, people that wanted fable 3 but never got it will worship this game. its all you wanted in fable 3 and more,   3 years and a half after the release and still as good as day one.  pros:  -lots of content -Over the top combat system -Over the top class [ ability ] system -Good skills system -Stealth works really good -quests never bugged for me, -amazing Music and voice acting -ALOT of weapons and types of weapons -A good crafting system -A law system like fable 1  Cons : - ' for me ' the story didn't really move me at all -All characters that i interacted with in the story line look the same. so noone really grew on me -after 20 hours of the game i found my self skipping so much dialog.  this review might or might not be good. its the first i ever did so you might understand how good this game is  Diehard fans of Fable.. just get this game.   the studio that made this game went down. so the title right is held by a bank at the moment. and any company can aquire it. and i hope to see someone do. it is undoubtable a good game to make a sequel for. and will be seccessful in the right hands
337	1	a	Not bad at all. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this game. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a well-fleshed out single player RPG with a very Blizzard-esque art style. The combat is active and lively, the progression is deep, and exploration is rich. Story is a weak point, but otherwise it's hard to find fault in this one. I'd give it a go if you're in the market to sink a fair amount of time into an active combat RPG.
339	1	a	One of the best RPG design I have seen. The best is the combat with the evolution of the character, very impressive and with good control. Very very big but easy to learn. I also like the history and the setting. Very good graphics and better if you use SweetFX and Nvidia inspector.  Just one thing, is too easy so PLEASE use the Ysa mod, search in the forums, it makes the game HARD. Read about the mod, is very customizable, if you don't want a overhelming difficulty, to me the most important thing are:    - Reduced EXP - Reduced Fate Points - Reduced Gold; They don't add a real difficulty, just the thing is to not overlevel everything, not use everytime the fate easy mode and make gold have an actual value.  Is the thing most close I have found to Dark Souls, and you know, Dark Souls is one of the best game I have played.
341	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is fantastic. It's one of the best action RPGs to date and still better than most newer games coming out today. It's an incredibly large, open world with a rich storyline and fast, fun gameplay.  Pros + Fast paced action + Great animations and special effects + Hundreds of quests to do + Huge, intricate areas + Beautiful graphics + Interesting Ability and Destiny system + Can make whatever kind of fighter you want with many different skills and traits. You can respec easily, too. + Wide variety of weapons, armor, and their respective customizations + Crafting is simple and efficient + Very smooth gameplay  Cons - Bad lip syncronizations and weird facial expressions - Shifting polygons on distant terrain as you approach - Camera is too close and that's bad during combat. It also has a mind of it's own at times. - 'Stale air' in the towns. They don't feel like towns to me. It's wierd. - Can only map 4 spells on the controller - MANY different terms, people, and locations mentioned throughout the game but no in-game glossary for referencing - I personally don't like the map - Very annoying sound controls. Sound Effect volume affects dialogue, instead of Dialogue Volume doing it. Poor sound equalization.  8.5/10
343	1	a	Probably the #1 under-rated RPG in a very long time.
345	1	a	One of the games that got me into playing, so underrated!
54	0	a	Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design.   The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.  The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.  I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.
55	0	a	Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.
56	0	a	It's a good game. Anyways you will be killing the same damned monsters from the beginning of the game to the end of the game, it's absolutely ridicoulous, there are like 6/7 types of monsters so let's repeat the killing again and again and again.  The good part is the character evolution. You can upgrade your champion in many different ways...  A good game for 6$ but it would have a lot of potential with other monster types
347	1	a	This game is a solid 9/10 Classic RPG with elements ala Skyrim and Fable. High fantasy setting with lots of drops and gear upgrades along with a nice combat system for those of us who want to keep it somewhat simple. The setting are stunning and the story is really good. I loved it. It was just the sort of game for me.
349	1	a	Awesome hidden diamond!!! Must play!
351	1	a	Impression after an hour: Wow, why hadn't I heard about this? It kidna has a stupid name. At least, it's not catchy. Apparently it didnt' sell well enough and the companies involved went under.   Controller friendly, interesting art style, polished, good lore, kinda action combat that seems fun so far.   I got it on sale. Looking forward to finishing it.  FIVE HOURS: I still like it. I'll see how much staying power it has, still like the art style and the combat. Aside from the stupid name, I'm thinking what killed the company is it's not an exceptional game. It's standard high fantasty, but it's not gritty or enthalling in a way like the Witcher or Dragon Age is. The writing is a big part of those, this does feel more like FedEx quests. But I paid about a tenth fo this of what I paid for Dragon Age. So far I still think I got my money's worth, and it doesn't have the addictive quality of some othe rgames it's still fun so far.
353	1	a	A very good game! Not as polished as current RPGs but definitely worth a look
355	1	a	Really good, it like I'm playing skyrim, but with a better battle mechanics.
357	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I spent 200 hours playing it on X360 when it released. I plan on 100% this game again, and it is still fun in a second playthrough.
359	1	a	Oh ya great game and get a 9.5/10 from me very few bugs/glitches but not gonna get into that cause it really dosen't get in the way of the gameplay. It's on sale I say if you like other rpg's at least check it out its control on gamepad and kb/m are very responsive. I have made a combo class mage/warrior and it works great lol I love it. I have been away from it for a while but gonna get back to it soon but ya a great rpg and worth a 75% off price maybe even 50% off but thats up to you to decide :)!
361	1	a	While many seem to think Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a poor game (Just google its name and prepare for the hate!) it has a great storyline with a lot of action, quite a few twists and a truly unique setting.  In the world of Amalur, all living thing has a destiny, a fate. And all follow it, even if they don't know they do. Fateweavers, people who study fate for years, can see its threads and as such can tell someone else's, or their own, fate. Wether anouncing to a prisoner his imminent and unexpected release or telling a young man he will die in his prime due to an accident, what a fateweaver sees always holds true. For no one is above fate itself.   No one but you. Yep, you read that right! The player character in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a recently diseased person brought back to life through certain experiments and their recent return to the land of the living makes them fateless. Supposed to be dead, fate holds nothing more for you. Soon, and without knowing this, you are sent to see a fateweaver. Not remembering your past life, you hope he can bring you answers. What a shock when you get there to discover that not only does fate not affect you, but YOU in fact affect fate itself! Your actions, as they are fateless, are purely up to you, and nobody can predict them. Because of this, you can change anything: Kill someone and the fate of their whole family, or even of the whole land, might change. Save someone else and a family supposed to disapear might survive and go on to do great things. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is truly a great game which I found myself getting lost in for hours on end, trying different types of characters and gameplay, having fun simply wandering around. And if you think combat is a little boring, try to sneak-kill everything you can, I can promise that up the difficulty! And I haven't even talked about the DLCs, which brings even more fun to this party!  All in all, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, filled to the brim with fun and free roaming, loads of side quests which are all interesting, and characters whom have their own lives, relations and problems. Definetly worth every penny... Now what are you waiting for? Play the game and write your own fate!
363	1	a	Had to get used to the camera angle and interface at first, but now that's no longer in the way I'm loving this game more and more.   Good: - Great main story  - lots of interesting side quests - good voice acting on every npc you meet - lots of crafting options. armor, weapons, potions, gems.  - plenty of loot, lots of different weapon types - great combat system for melee, very interactive with lots of combo moves - lots of skills and abilities. the skills remind me of Dragon Age with the persuasion, lockpicking, herblore and such. the abilities are much like vanilla wow's 3 tabs skill trees. great replayablity  - huge world to explore  Bad: - sometimes enemies cheat when you try to dodge and hit you anyway - character creation/customization options are a bit limited - ranged combat felt a bit weak/wrong to me. Not so much damage, I didn't focus on ranged to know how well the damage scales, but the auto targeting, the sound, the bow drawing, it just didn't feel right. - no camera zoom afaik, I wish I was able to zoom out more.  I'm glad I finally picked up this game.  I highly recommend trying it out if you are into action rpg's or rpg's in general really.
365	1	a	It's a pretty standard Fantasy Action Game experience - you pick from a couple of Totally Unique Racial Categories, make some basic cosmetic changes (hair, skin tone, etc.) and then you go smash the crap out of things.  Character progression is somewhat reminiscent of Torchlight with a bit of The Witcher for good measure. You can 'multiclass' between Tough Smashy Style, Sneaky Stabby Style, and Explody Magic Style.  The lore is more-or-less your standard fantasy novel business - there's good (not-)elves and bad (not-)elves and the bad (not-)elves are going HAM on your homeland. Good thing you're a Chosen One and can stand up to those naughty naughty (not-)elves! Did we mention that you have a Mysterious Past that you have to uncover? Of course you do.  It's going to be tainted by comparison to Skyrim, as they're both Epic Fantasy Smashy Smash games. Skyrim excels in having a truly open world (much of KOA is pretty much linear - the old invisible fence is full in effect here) and near-limitless modification capacity. KOA excels at having a much more enjoyable combat system - lots of fancy combos and trick moves. There's a 'rage meter' mechanic that's kind of neat in a silly 'Mortal Kombat' way - you charge up your murders and then you go into Super Murder Mode, where you get, of all things, a quicktime event where you have to mash buttons to Extra Super Duper Murder someone for bonus XP.  It's silly, even for Epic Fantasy Gaming, but it's probably worth snagging on sale.
367	1	a	A very good action RPG. No stunning story included or great dialogues, but the combat system is really fun.
369	1	a	Good game but let down by quest breaking bugs if you complete certain side quests before progressing the story.  Once you know which side quests to leave its a good game.
371	1	a	I will openly admit that I had absolutely no intention originally of ever picking this game up... until it went on sale majorly discounted (Thank you, Steam!) and a friend told me to just give it a shot. I have to say, I rather enjoy it very much and I am kicking myself for not giving it a shot before.   The artstyle for this is what hit me first. It has such a bright and colorful atmosphere while still being able to be dark when it needs to be. I find myself looking around each and every new area I visit rather thuroughly and not being disappointed in the least. The designs of the characters, items and equipment are also very unique and the fact that Todd McFarlane had his hands in it really shows.  It has a story that really draws you in and it has such an ambiguous morality meter that you really feel your impacts on the world. the gameplay is just as fun and addictive as well adding a unique combo and weapon swap ability that just works and the magic use itself is spectacular. It is not without it's faults though as I found the quests themselves rather repetative. Other than that, it is definitely worth the full price that it is. :) 8.5/10
373	1	a	This game is unusualy easy. Even on the hardest difficulty it is not that complex. It has great character evolution and many magnificent items. Even though there is the difficulty problem this game is worth it.
375	1	a	So at first i wasnt so sure if i was gonna like the game or not but the prize was only 4.99€ so i decided to buy it and i think i played about an hour or so and i loved it. I also instantly bought the DLCs aswell couse i know im gonna continue play this game.  The overall feeling of the game is great, the combat feels amazing and also the story seems really interesting so far.  So if you are a fan of RPG games and are considering buying this game you should go for it couse its one of the best RPG games i have played by far!!
377	1	a	Combat is where Kingdoms of Amalur truly shines. Other RPGs do present an overall better and complete package in terms of lore, story and characters, such as Dragon Age: Origins (the last true Bioware game), Skyrim (the best of the Elder Scrolls series) and Knights of the Old Republic (one of my personal favorites). However, combat in these games is something to 'get through' and 'endure.' In Kingdoms of Amular combat is something that is enjoyed in the moment.
379	1	a	This game is unusualy easy. Even on the hardest difficulty it is not that complex. It has great character evolution and many magnificent items. Even though there is the difficulty problem this game is worth it.
381	1	a	This is an amazing little gem, it has all of the characteristics of an early Skyrim but it is simple enough to play, I would recommend this game because of the playability which is second to none. Its really easy to pick up and you can play to how you prefer to play it in terms of fighting style, there are 3 base classes to choose from, which in turn, each have a complex tree of varying combinations of classes. The world you play in is a very vibrant one, full of colour and texture. There is alchemy, blacksmithing, you can upgrade certain weapons and armor and best of all, for all lovers of RPG's, there's plenty of loot. Money is scarce at first but after a dozens missions or so under your belt and you will see how quickly your money can build up. You can level up your character, choose as you will because you can always change completely at anytime by visiting Fateweavers who will, for price, reset your levels so that you can rebuild to a different style.
383	1	a	Really fun mechanics, and a decent story, one of my favourite RPGS and a must play for any RPG lover. 8.5/10
385	1	a	Really a shame what happened with the devs, this is an extremely good ARPG with only some small issues - narrow field of view and a crafting system that takes a hot second to get used to.  That being said, the game itself has at least 70-80 hours of content outside of DLCs if you explore, and the achievements definitely incentivize exploring. You can switch up your character at will when you find better loot - and better loot you will find - in a ton of different ways, with all kinds of different hybrid playstyles being viable and fun alternatives to ther norm.  The takedowns in Reckoning mode are flashy, the executions from stealth are super satisfying... And for 6$ every other week it's embarrassing not to own a game with this much quality content by now.
387	1	a	This is an amazing game. The combat is satisfying and fantastic, the story is interesting, and the universe is intriguing once you get into it. The downsides to the game include less good character models, and the graphics aren't Skyrim level. I would, however, put this game above Skyrim in the categories of combat and stability. The game world is huge, but the game itself runs extremely smoothly and I have yet to run into a glitch.  My friends who enjoy a good RPG gaming experience, this should be on your list.
389	1	a	What an amazing game! It's so weird it's not mentioned often when talking about RPGs. This game should be in top 3 atleast!  The game is huge, there's tons and tons and tons of things to do. The storylines are fun and easy to follow (even for me, who usually doesn't care about stories too much). The scenery is simply stunning, there's so many different areas and regions and each with a different style. The combat is fantastic, so many different paths to follow and builds to make. I'm sure there's something out there for all of you.  The only downside is that it's abit easy but then again, I'm not a fan of games that get so hard that makes me want to throw my pc out the window.  Would I recommend this? Yes, absolutely. 10/10
391	1	a	A very good rpg with a nice length story and lots of side quests where you died and was reborn with no fate.This allows you to play your favourite class/es.Also when I ever get one of these quests I sigh.Get quest from NPC&gt;Kill x things/get x things&gt;Complete quest&gt;Sigh.
393	1	a	one of my favorite games this year, really too bad the dev went out of business so we won't ever get a sequel :(
395	1	a	This is a really good game and doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The combat system in it is awesome, the landscape is awesome and the world is HUGE. There's also a crap ton of sidequests, and the main story is pretty good too and has a decent length. Lots to do, like alchemy and blacksmithing and there is more than that too. You can mae completely custom weapons and armor too. The graphics are not increddible, but they are definitely not bad.
397	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: a pitch-perfect fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, difficult to master, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that has yet to be seen in the genre. The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.
399	1	a	This game has an MMO feel to it without multiplayer, but with many great features such as the combat and crafting system. The setting is very well made, even so the story isnt that amazing. So anyone who decides to buy this game will be playing it for the fantastic gameplay not the lore.
401	1	a	7/10   This open world single player frpg is no Skyrim(what else is?), but it has the potential to engross you for many hours if you like this type of game. The game suffers a bit from feeling like it was a template for an MMO more than being designed strictly as a single player frpg.    PROs +Lots of content -- skills, items, quests, zones +Action combat +Open world (sort of) +Fully voiced NPCs +No significant bugs encountered +Fate weaving was an interesting game mechanic  CONs -No jump key -Narrow zones in lieu of a true open world -Cartoony graphics reminiscent of WoW. Low polygons with vibrant coloring -Mildly annoying inventory management, (mostly)mitigated by fast travel. and an in game stash -A little slow at first   +/- The lore in the game was fairly deep, but I personally did not find the lore(or story for that matter) particularly compelling. ymmv.  +/- Not particularly difficult. Some may say too easy.   Conclusion: Holy crap,did you really read everything to this point? cough.... If you are between AAA games, can find this on sale, and have a hankering for a big single player frpg, this may be a game you should try.
403	1	a	What an amazing game! It's so weird it's not mentioned often when talking about RPGs. This game should be in top 3 atleast!  The game is huge, there's tons and tons and tons of things to do.

405	1	a	If you think this game like Skyrim. You come to the wrong place. Why everyone tell this game like skyrim? Just because Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston is a developer of this game. After that? Nothing similar to skyrim.  If you come here to play game that similar to skyrim. Don't buy this game. You can buy another games that similar to Skyrim. Open World in this game is suck. Not a sandbox game like skyrim. Quest is suck too. It's like MMORPG but offline.  But, i recommend this game because the Combat. Well.. The combat in this game is fun.  Well.. This is my opinion. Sorry for bad english(:
407	1	a	I finished Kingdom's of Amalur and I gotta say, if you had to call it anything you'd have to call it ambitious. Get it if you like a good ol' save the world from sealed away evil storyline, interesting world and lore and games like Fable or World of Warcraft.  Avoid it if you get frustrated by limited camera control, simple movelists and a VERY limited amount of enemy designs (theres about 15 noticable enemy models and a lot of pallete swaps) and loads and loads of empty walking broken up by almost repetetive combat encounters. Theres a rewarding crafting system that sadly invalidates all the cool custom armor and weapons they've designed as the stuff you can end up making will far outclass the unique gear.  Play the demo to get a feel of the combat and camera and to unlock content for the main game (a fantastic touch) and be a little cautious of where you go because dungeons appear to scale to the level you first enter the at (same goes for entire DLC content)
409	1	a	Fantastic game. Not as polished as some other RPG's out there, but I believe this is due to lack of funding. If you enjoy RPG's at all, I highly recommend this one. Tons of content. I pretty much skipped 90% of the side/faction quests and proceeded along the main storyline, took ~40hr to complete. There are supposedly an additional 400 or so side/faction quests in the game. The map is huge as well. Larger than some MMO maps. The storyline is decent. The fighting mechanics are a blast. Protip: do NOT start pure sorcery. It gets boring quick. My advice is to start with might or finesse and then play around with sorcery later on if it strikes your fancy. You can respec on a whim.
411	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur combines everything I love about role playing games with a hint of fighting with combos from games of my youth. I love the music, game-play and the lore. I find this game highly addictive, with instant gratification and flexible play style. I would reccommend this game for any players looking for a fresh RPG.
413	1	a	Game feels like a MMORPG but single player. The gameplay is nice, never get tired of it. Graphic isn't the best but understandable, however the landscape are something you can really look at and be like wow. But as we all know the feel of a MMORPG game with 'Kill and Collect X items' quest gets boring over time when it's repetitive. The main storyline is short, but there are tons of side/faction quest that you can do which will add more hours of gameplay.  Overall Rating: 8/10 Hit: Gameplay Miss: Quest (too repetitive)
415	1	a	Fantastic RPG set in great fantasy world if you go for all side quests easily play for 100+ hours
417	1	a	Well it's a good RPG game if you get tired of Skyrim combat in this game is bloody amazing
419	1	a	 A RPG with surprises!
421	1	a	The gameplay of KoA is fantastic. A strong world of warcraft feel to the graphics allows for a smooth gameplay on a poor spec machine. On the world of warcraft note, I would like to add that the entire game feels like it was based off it. The graphocs, quests, locations and characters are all very similar to wow. That aside, there is a lot of orginality in the game, with decent voice acting, the combat system and the smithing concept.   My ratings for the game: Audio: 9/10 - Ambient soundtrack was done well, allowing for smooth transitions between combat and adventuring. The voice acting was done really well. No faults in my opinion, didn't get 10/10 because I wouldn't purchase the soundtrack just to listen to it.  Visual: 9/10 - As mentioned above, the visuals are smooth and familiar.  Gameplay and Content: 10/10 - There is enough in game that I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I was lucky enough to catch KoA and all of it's DLC during a sale at a bargain price.  Replayability: 6/10 - The different classes within the game allow for a HUGE amount of replayability. If you want to mix stealth and magic, there are classes and bonuses to suit. If you want to mix all three aspects, there are classes and bonuses for that too. If you want to focus purely on one aspect, then obviously, there are classes and bonuses for them too. The only problem is, even though I had a great time playing through once, I get bored with it quite quickly when I go to start the game again.   All in all, I would definately suggest the game to other people, and have done. I would really like to see 2 player co-op brought into the game, if I'd seen that come through, I don't think I would have to buy another game on steam ever again!
423	1	a	 Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning  has all the trappings of a traditional action RPG along with a few unique claims to fame. One of those claims is the development agenda and post-production of this game, a very interesting story in itself, but that has little bearing on the game as is, which offers some good Fantasy fun.   It helps to understand KoA:R in the context of  Big Huge Games ,  38 Studios , Project Copernicus and the game owners bankruptcy and default on a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island. If the experience feels like an mmorpg in single player mode, that's because the game was more or less a template for the planned but never completed Copernicus. Despite having strong opinions about this whole business, I won't say more since it's been covered well in the news, and at this point it's old news.   The story was crafted in large part by one of my favorite Fantasy novelists, R.A. Salvatore, and the quality shows. Plentiful lore and background is there to find if you bother listening to dialogue, reading books and paying attention to quests. In particular I enjoyed the Fae (Elves) Houses. Their social traditions, internal politics and perceptions of the mortal races reflect the Fae's immortality/reincarnation in interesting ways.   Gameplay is rock solid. It is slightly reminiscent of Fable. Options for stealth, hack n'slash, melee, ranged, martial or magic devastation all stem from a clever class/skill mechanic seated in the game's lore about fate. Essentially there are three archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage - and three types that are hybrids of those. The combat is engaging however you choose, with various combos and skills to mix it up. The monsters are diverse and will keep you on your toes, although it is possible to skill and gear up to a point where the player is virtually unkillable, rendering tactics irrelevant and thus diminishing the satisfaction of well executed fights. That only happens in late game though; plus, you can always increase the difficulty! I played the entire game on the standard difficulty setting.   Design overall isn't all that innovative save for a few aspects. It feels a little bit generic and safe as fantasy RPG's go. One issue I had was that pacing seemed a little off. I explored side areas and finished every faction questline in addition to many side quests, but still wasn't quite able to unlock the highest tier of the Fate system (classes) until the very end of the campaign. Also, towards the halfway point and onwards, some side quests felt like derivative, cliche filler content for the level grind. It felt like an mmo. This wasn't a huge problem, just an annoyance. Backpack expansions should be slightly more frequent and the inventory should have more categories for crafting materials in the trade interface.   The technical issues are few. One rare but recurring problem is that the camera - during and immediately following combat - likes to get fancy and zoom out or chase the player at certain distances. The camera gets stuck sometimes, or shows a bad angle that hinders combat. Quest and lore items shouldn't count towards the inventory item limit. For some odd reason, you can't switch from the journal to the map without first closing the journal. Like so many RPG's, this one has recycled voice actors even for primary characters. While the world is huge and varied, certain areas feel strangely boxed in when they shouldn't.    The music and the voice acting are brilliant here. I was especially pleased with how high quality and well fleshed out the dialogue was. The visuals are beautifully realized and have some fun fantasy art concepts behind them. On the other hand, given the budget of this game it doesn't reflect the money spent in my opinion.    I did not play the two content DLC's,  Legend of Dead Kel  and  Teeth of Naros . I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning to any fantasy aficionado. If you check this out, you'll probably be glad you did. I cannot necessarily recommend it to players with no patience or time for branching out from the main quest to see side content, or for players who are utterly uninterested in seeing more of the same from the fantasy genre.  TIP: Use Reckoning as often as your fate bar fills up, since it rewards bonus experience for kills. TIP: The gear obtained via crafting (Blacksmithing plus Sagecrafting) tends to be the most powerful. Crafting is greatly facilitated by diligent gathering of materials in the world and the salvaging of looted armor &amp; weapons. TIP: Finish all of the faction quest lines at least, since those are among the more interesting content.
425	1	a	Played this game on PS3 with 60h game time, now on PC with DLCs, hell yea the DLCs are so awesome and the game is just one of the best RPG i have ever played, the Design of the Characters, the Open World Feeling and so much fun in this game, its totaly worth to buy this game :)
427	1	a	R.A. Salvatore and Todd Macfarlene, and Oblivion creator have outdone themselves with this one. I have no words that can fully express how amazing this game is. It is a mix of Fable, meets Darksiders, meets god of war and open world. There is so much to do in this game and the possibilites of how to play it are endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of a great story and so many things to explore with the add-ons it just makes it bigger. Think Skyrim map x 3. I hope you all enjoy.
429	1	a	I really love this game. It's one of my favorites to play. When I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.  The combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated. I've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.  Loads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)  The world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.  The dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.  The only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.  The herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail. The professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :P  I enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price. 
431	1	a	This is one of those underrated games that got overshadowed by Skyrim because they came out around the same time, and the company was pretty new and unknown. But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.  Kingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other. I have logged about 90 hours on this game (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great. This really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.
433	1	a	ALthough not widely-known, this game heas heaps to do! Creating weapons and gear and improving with gems. The map is vast and the options endless. Different skill trees and ways to play. Weapons I haven't seen in any other game.! Great RPG! A must try, a personal favourite of mine.
435	1	a	I went into this game after being very frustrated by aspects of Divinity 2. Kingdoms of Amalur turned out to be a far more satisfying experience, albeit in unexpected ways.  A major selling point is that it was written by R.A. Salvatore, one of my favourite authors. However, the game's story is very forgettable. I mean that literally - I've played 60 hours, am nearly at the end, and can barely remember anything that's happened. There is a great set piece battle and a few clever side quests, but the rest just blurs together - something something 'fate', something something 'mortal'. There's few choices and little reason to even read the dialogue most of the time - just follow the quest markers and do what the pop-up text tells you to do.  What it really gets right is the gameplay. Combat is varied enough to keep things interesting, despite making up the bulk of the gameplay. Enemies flail around when set on fire, dodge arrows, resist some forms of damage and have some neat skills and spells. The player character can be built in several different ways , and the paths are distinct enough to encourage re-specing (which is quite easy to do). Controls are straightforward, although the camera can be bothersome at times.  The inability to jump, with the resulting unpassable ankle-high obstacles, is irritating at first, but moving around the world is simple enough through a generous fast-travel system, and there's plenty to do as you walk around.  There's no shortage of loot, both from enemy drops and in numerous chests and hidden locations. The inventory fills up annoyingly quickly, with no option to screen items by quality, but there's no shortage of merchants around.  The crafting system is great, allowing all sorts of equipment, potions and gems to be made.  The game loads quickly, and looks lovely even on a mid-range system.  There's certainly plenty of gameplay - expect 60 or more hours to complete most of the sidequests.  It's a shame the game will never be followed up, because there is an excellent core game here.
437	1	a	Underated RPG Gem. Its a shame we may never get a fallow up to it. Fast action, fun qwests, and looks good too (sans the bad face's on the NPC that is). Don't pass this game up again!
439	1	a	Large, enjoyable, underrated action-rpg. Fun, button-mashy combat that still requires some attention/strategy (esp. on hard); pretty good amount of loot; interesting skill trees and character advancement options; semi-sorta-open-world (new chunks of world unlock as you progress deeper into the game). Gameplay is smooth, responsive, and satisfying, though I recommend using a gamepad for this one. Graphics aren't cutting edge, but they're decent. The world, on the whole, is nicely varied and fun to just roam about and button-mash in.   On the downside, the world is pretty superficial compared to something like a Bethesda game. There's plenty of lore and subquests and dialogue trees and all of that, but none of it is very involving -- just kind of par for the course, more of a console-game feel to the progression and atmosphere. I can't really fault the game much beyond that, though. It's a really solid game, just don't expect quite the level of depth you'd get from a hardcore open-world PC rpg. At the time I'm writing this it's on sale for under $10, and it's a great get for that price.
441	1	a	Great combat. I found some mage thrown weapons and now I'm in love with chakrams, they are beautful and are amazing when actually in combat. They have great range and good damage. I'm going to hold onto my shock chakrams even though I love the fae-blades and whirling around like a lunatic in battle. Wee!   ~Character creation is quite nice. Different races, jewely/ acessories, hair, gender, ect.  ~Art style feels a bit reminisent of TorchLight and Fable. While the game play feels like a mix of Fable and Skyrim. Lots of freedom of choice for quests and morality. I typically go chaotic-good if I can.   ~Main and secondary weapon slots, with ease of access and use, and a nice hide helm option in options.  ~Different armor types for different classes/ play styles. Heavey, medium, light. Lots of different item types and item looks/ designs.   ~I heard about being able to buy a house and upgrade it, much like in Skyrim (sorry, really getting into and playing Skyrim recently).  ~Story is turning out to be quite interesting. Not too strong of a pull to do main questline though, because of how open and free choice the game is.  ~Different crafting types (poitions, smithing, shards) and you can learn potions by randomly combining ingredients. You can dismantle non magical gear for crafting mats, but I'm not sure about doing the same with magical gear and I would love to be able to dismantle magical/ higher tier gear and get magical crafting mats.  ~Multi-classing is quite in depth, but not too complex from what I've seen so far.  ~Nice voice acting and artwork     My only complaint right now is the sign into EA servers nonsense when loading up the game.
443	1	a	It is a good game with its gameplay, story, and such; it just gets a bit boring over time.
445	1	a	dungeon crawling rpg with a wide variety of weapons great at making you diversify your weapons/armors the enemy levels are hard to distinguish ♥♥♥♥ wolves
447	1	a	This is a surprisingly underrated open-world RPG. It's got real time action-based combat system, dozens of zones with quests that take you everywhere, and an interesting storyline. This game is definitely worth checking out, especially if you can get it on sale.
449	1	a	If you've heard of this game you may have heard that it is like an MMO. Don't walk away just yet. I'm not an MMO player, but I do enjoy this game.  It is like an MMO in some respects, but it lacks the things that make MMOs not fun. For one thing, it isn't grindy. You don't have to invest many hours to get into this game. There are a lot of side quests, but they don't feel as trivial as the ones you might encounter in MMOs. The battle system feels very fluid and polished and you don't have to spam your number keys to get attacks off.  As far as what I kind of don't like about this game there is a rather large land to explore, but it consists of a lot of trails and forks in those trails. There are some open areas, but you will mostly find yourself on trails. It isn't a real big negative though because you don't feel like the game is a linear excursion.  All in all, this game is worth a look, but especially so if you can get it on a sale.
451	1	a	Fable III and Skyrim, Watch out! This game combines detailed graphics with superb combat. There are many upgrades to choose from, and all the weapons you could dream of. Dont listen to people saying This game is horrible im gonna return it, because its not. Very sad and in a way wrong for the maker of this great game to go bankrupt. The best feautre in this game is to build of 'fate' to Slow-mo assasinate enimies. recommend this game to everyone! Happy Playings!
453	1	a	Pretty good, but lacks its own identity (feels like Everquest + Fable, and a dozen other rpgs at once), and suffers from a lot of what makes modern RPGs (even many FPS) suck; being artificially extended with pointless busywork.   90% Sidequests for Deliver this to-, Kill 8 of-,.. 'Hey you're supposed to be a warrior on an important mission to save the world, but can you go fetch my &lt;mundane object&gt;?'  It's certainly not this game's fault. They ALL do that these days because it's an incredibly easy way to flesh out a game. Leveling via uninpired fetch quests isn't so bad in an MMORPG, but its dull as hell in single player games. I'm not anti-sidequest by any means, its just that they're a whole lot more common and less creative than they used to be.  I'd still recommend it for the $5 I paid, though its ~82 metascore feels a bit high. I'd have it closer to 70.
455	1	a	It's big. Too big even. After about 40 hours of questing I got tired of doing practically the same quests over and over again. I even skipped through the conversations, and I normally read/listen all dialogues, mind you.   KoA is basically a MMO game in single-player form. Is it a bad game ? Not by any means. It's just that it loses focus about halfway through, giving you too many quests to deal with. This game can easily take 100+ hours to complete.  The active combat system works great; you're not just pushing buttons and waiting for your character to finish off an enemy. YOU do the actual combat. It's fresh until you have unlocked most of your skills though, then it can grow a bit stale.  My biggest gripe with the game was the inventory system, which was awkward to use. Having to pause, select a category and (un)equip items that way is cumbersome and frustrating. It's an area that could definitely use some work.  For an action RPG it's pretty cool, but don't expect another Skyrim.  [Rating: 84/100]
457	1	a	Overall, a very enjoyable experience. If the combat system appeals to you, then this is a title you cannot pass up. Just keep in mind, due to the lower difficulty of this title even on the highest difficulty setting, you might want to consider learning how to combo, for a different kind of difficulty. Just giving a tip.
459	1	a	I usually don't play ports. Got this one from sale almost a year ago. Didn't really have time to get into it.  I'm on holliday now. I think I know where I'm going to spend it. In Kingdoms of Amalur.  ++ Big Word. Gender, race are customasable for hero Quests are intereting and chaladging. Side quests seem endless 40 levels to upgrade your hero. Thief, Warior, Mage -you pick whatever. Blacksmiting &amp; Alchemy in the game can make you think of PhD degree :) Change the fate and destiny is possible Lag free, Haven't expirince any for almost 30 hours of play Story is big and interesting  -- It's a port NPCs can be stupid from time to time   P.S. Gonna pick DLCs on the next sale.
461	1	a	It's a shame they wont get to turn this game into a MMO like they wanted. KOA is a great game, love the action and the easy to use controls. Discounted or not its a must buy for anyone that's into Action RPG.
463	1	a	Underated asffff
465	1	a	One of the best RPG's I have ever laid my eyes on. Huge world. Great graphics. Main story is more than great. Side quests suck and feel like some bad MMO quests at level 3. Don't be fooled by my playtime. I've got more than 200 hours on Origin (Drop dead EA).  Graphics 9/10 Sound 7/10 Story 9/10 
467	1	a	Awesome game . A lot of Tasks, quests and side quests to do,  a really good rpg game..   Well worth the money.  I recommend this game.....buy it :D Rating 8/10
469	1	a	AWESOME game but there has to be co-op or multiplayer at least
471	1	a	picked up this one from steam sales. seemed like a crappy low-end rpg at first. started playing it with not much hope. but wham! it blew my mind in no time! totally immense story, effing vast open world map, deep character customization and improvement, and action! lots of it! there soo many things in this game that i am not sure if i could find and do all of them. got me hooked up as much as skyrim or fallout 3. a definite recommendation for the fans of the genre...
473	1	a	This game certainly is one of the best RPGs i know.   The world to explorer is huge. There are a lot of nice quests with long stories. Combat is better then in most other RPGs (not for the camera zoom..) A high difference of weapons and attacks  The only thing I'm still missing in this game is the option for multiplayer :(
475	1	a	This is what Skyrim or Gothic should have been! Where other popular games failed imo, this game suceeds!  About the reasons: The graphics and the sound are great, the atmosphere is good, the story is interesting, the world is huge, the game mechanics are well developed, the gameplay is fluid, the battles are awesome, the controls are intuitive and the crafting is deep and satisfying.
477	1	a	A pretty formulaic action RPG with a sometimes-interesting story and little to no challenge involved on even Hard difficulty. If you've played Fable, that's roughly what you should be expecting. It's okay for wasting a couple of days of your life and somewhat enjoying it, but the wasted potential makes me cri evertim.
479	1	a	Great game, easy controls, nice graphics. Definetly worth a play through.
481	1	a	Nice Open world game, similar to Skyrim, but graphics are more fablelike then realistic and slightly less character diversification. However the combat system seems far more fluid then skyrim.
483	1	a	This game is amazing so far. There are always challenges everywhere you go. If you're a skyrim fan, then this is a game for you since the stories are kind of similar. The gameplay is a bit like Dark Souls except easier and less rage inducing. Either way, I'm having a load of fun with it and its easy to get used to the controls and quest concepts. Great game :)
485	1	a	Amalur is still as fun now as the first time I played it. High quality game with heavy replayability. If your on the fence as to whether its still good to pick up...buy it.
487	1	a	I have so much to say about Kingdoms! This is one of my all time favorite RPG games. The battles can be a bit repetative and you can count on your enemy throwing the same fight combo at you time and time again (which makes it pretty easy to get those parry achievements) The story line is huge! and there is so much to do in this game which brings me to my first complaint... the level cap :( You can reach the level cap by just doing the main factions. The first time i beat the main story line i was a little bummed to learn of the level cap. I mean who doesnt like to watch their XP sky rocket when you finally beat that main pain in the a** boss?! However, i just started a new game, leveled up the weapons i knew i loved and kept on going.  Sometimes the camera view got a bit wonky, its hard to fight when the camera decides to view only the ground lol but it is possible. Just a slight annoyance.   The open world is also huge! There are tons of side quests to keep you busy for quite awhile. I love the Fast Travel option, which lets be honest, who doesnt just love spending half the game walking from end of the map to other?! (insert sarcastic gaze) Fast Travel really really helps with a map that is this big.  I downloaded The Teeth of Narcos DLC after i beat the game the first time. It's okay.... The underground sewer is a bit of a maze and isnt as 'open' as the main game map, but it's still pretty fun. Again, it brings up the level cap that sucks....  The game says Partial Controller Support but after 200 somthing hours i would have to say that its pretty much full controller. Has anyone heard of a Kingdoms 2?
489	1	a	I really like it, reminds me of a cutesy Elder Scrolls. A nice Casual RPG adventure, job well done and good controller support.
491	1	a	 Great Game,Its like Fable Mixed with a MMORPG and maybe a little Elder Scrolls
493	1	a	So good i can not discribe it :)
495	1	a	Would I recommend this game?  THAT'S A BIG YES, thumbs up!  The graphics: 10/10 The story: 10/10 Side quests: 8/10 DLC: 9/10   The story is awesome. No words for that! For the sidequests: I am talking about EVERY FREAKIN' SIDE QUEST THERE IS IN THIS GAME: there are A LOT!  Some quest are big, you can earn houses for them. Some are small, get this - bring it to me - you get money,  kill him - tell me he's dead - you get money. Still, they send you to beautiful places and each sidequest has is own little story and that can be really fun too, right?   This game makes you feel like a God!   For the DLC: buy them except for the Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle. They'll be good in the begin of the game, somewhat in the middle of the game you will find better and stronger armor and weapons. I don't think it's worth the €4,99  The Legend of Dead Kel includes a brand new quest line, multiple side quests, three Twists of Fate, previously unseen armor and weapons, and a new player home.   Teeth of Naros opens up a new unique quest line, a new floating city to explore, and multitudes of unlockables.    Skyrim was my favorite game before I started my adventure in Kingdoms of Amalur.  This became my favorite game and it still is! I hope this review was helpful!  Have a nice day! :)
497	1	a	An enjoyable A-RPG. It's not the best, has a few quirks here and there, but for the price you can fetch it for, it's definitely worth it.
499	1	a	Great game really enjoy it. A mix of Fable and Oblivion.
501	1	a	this is the best game once you get the hage of it and i think its bettter then Elder schrols
503	1	a	basically skyrim.. haha (although much cheaper)  would highly reccommend for any RPG lovers.
505	1	a	It's a really good game I personally love the open the open world the combat is quick and nice I recommend this game. 
507	1	a	Just like the description of the game, it's litterally Salvatore, McFarlane and Rolston meshed into one. This game is freaking rad. I don't play many RPGs like I used to, but this one is a good exception. The game play is like a mix of elderscrolls, mass effect and the witcher. The world is absolutly massive and its quest overload (just like an elderscrolls game). The world (that I've seen thus far) is oversized giant mushroom styled high fantasy....its pretty to say the least. Dialoge, actually pretty well done. A lot of folks seem to think this plays like crap on PC, well I disagree. This plays very fluid. Don't like the keys? Rebind them. I already see myself tossing a couple hundred hours into this. Totally worth the whole 12 bucks or so for the game + DLC on sale. I'd be willing to throw 20 at it....well worth it.
509	1	a	A must play!!!
511	1	a	If you like RPG's then this one is worth a look. When it comes on special, grab it and all the DLC's.  The good: Nice graphics. Large open world. Entertaining story lines across most quests. I enjoyed the combat system pairing both physical and magic attacks.  The bad: As the dev house ran out of money / time, some of the quests and cut scenes are buggy but this does not detract from the overall experience. The entertainment value outwieghed the few minor bugs. I did encounter one major bug that resulted in an incomplete quest. The quest dialog says that you should pick pocket one of the NPC's, which I did. However, the quest did not progress. I then discovered, in the quests menu, that you should kill the NPC and then recover the items.  All in all, a good game and worth it when it comes on special.
513	1	a	I had originally played this on the console {Xbox360} and I enjoyed playing it for hours at a time. I believe I spent a good two hundred hours on the side quests and factions alone.   I decided to purchase this game on Steam while it was on sale {Because I am cheap haha.} and it was an amazing purchase. It is as fun as a remember.   As for the keyboard controls, I had to rebind most of them to suit my hand placement. The Wakening mode finisher is difficult for me with a laggy computer to pull off, but it is still rewarding to see those animations.   I would rate this game a nine of ten.
515	1	a	This game made me feel like a kid again.  I've played a ton of games to the point where I felt like nothing was new, but this is defintely a unique game.  It's graphics look pretty good for it's time. It's got more of a fantasy look than anything and they certainly did a good job on that. While in combat everything looks really smooth and it's fun to look at... especially those finishers, oh man. Sometimes the combat is a little clunky though, mostly regarding the camera. It doesn't have a lock on feature so sometimes it's a little frustrating when you're trying to lock target onto someone else. With that aside, the combat is still great.  Usually with an RPG, you'll have to go down a specific specialization to be powerful. That mostly holds true in this game, though you can still spread your talents more thin and still not do underwhelming damage.   There's lots and lots and lots of quests. You might not even find all of them which makes this game great. Though it's no Elder Scrolls size, it's still a large game. Because you can make so many different characters and take different quest paths, it's definitely got great replay value. I'd certainly reccomend this game.  9/10
517	1	a	Good story, beautifull enviroment, adictive gameplay, freedom of character, this is one of my favorite games ever made.
519	1	a	A wery well-crafted script,certainly the best title role ( for me ). Has everything great detail, luxury buildings,caves,magnificent  perfect environments.The creators also want to enjoy all the beauty. ♪ From here I thanks to BIG-HUGE Studios,38 Studios and EA games ♪ ************************************************************************
521	1	a	Amazing game to play if you're a fan of any role play games! The graphics are really well done. Most of the game looks really colourful and bright, or dull and dark when it needs to be. The gameplay is loads of fun and offers a ton of variety in terms of what your character can do to fight. Finally, load times seem to be very low, and overall it's an amazing RPG to play!
523	1	a	Absolutely love this game, Beautiful graphics and keeps me busy for hours.
525	1	a	One of the best all round great RPG's I've played in years. It looks stunning. It moves stunning.
527	1	a	So take World of Warcraft and Fable-esque art style and questing but add dynamic combat mechanics akin to Darksiders or Devil May Cry and you get Kingdoms of Amalur. While the story is somewhat lackluster and dull, the open ended exploration of vivid Amalur and it's treasures/loot make up for it shortcomings. The character builds consist of classic dungeon crawling roles of the Warrior, the Mage and the Rogue or combinations of the three classes which offer unique combat approaches. Unlike other open world RPGs ,like Skyrim, you are able to completely respec a character's perk points (for a fee) if you feel you made a bad decision in their allocation or just want a change of pace. Almost 25 hours into this game and I feel I've only scratched the surface. Great buy!
529	1	a	It's really unfortunate this game came out at the same time as Skyrim, as it deserves it's own place. It has an amazing story, a world at least as big as Skyrim (maybe bigger), and great comic-book style graphics. Combat is much better than in Skyrim. The add on DLC is amazing, can't recommend it enough. The world setup is very immersive as well. Crafting is OK, not as good as Skyrim, but the potion creation is a bit better in my opinion.  Only downside is that there's a lot of walking, and no horses. The fast travel system works the same was as in many of these games - you walk there the first time, then you can teleport between places. Overall, really loving this game.
531	1	a	 A cohesive narrative and vibrant visuals bring the world of Amalur to life.   As I glance through some other user reviews I see a lot of positive comparisons to some of the leaders of the RPG genre: Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, Fable, Diablo and Torchlight. Personally I saw the closest resemblance to World of Warcraft with its visuals and questing system. However, this is no clone of a game. It has a unique identity that, in part, is made from borrowing successful traits from these other titles. What stands out most strongly to me about Kingdoms of Amalur is its narrative and world lore. It presents fresh ideas and throughout my 95+ hours (including 210 quests completed) with the game it always felt consistent, like the developers shared a unified vision of what they wanted this world to be.  Without discussing any specific plot points, I'll say that things begin on a high note and intrigued me right off the bat with a mystery surrounding who this character you are playing as is. It is a special feat in my mind to be able to have a personalized, voiceless protagonist that you are expected to project yourself into also have a predetermined, very interesting back story of their own. Too often these types of characters are just a boring blank slate.   My sense of progression through this world was wonderful. Your journey begins far from a major warzone and consequently you merely hear stories about it. As you advance closer you begin to see more immediate effects like sons and daughters gone off to fight or altered local economies. Eventually you'll see large refugee camps causing overcrowding problems and burned down towns before reaching the warfront itself. By and large, the settings you visit along the way stand apart from each other both visually and in local story. The exceptions to this are some of the dungeons that look and play very similarly, just with different layouts and quest objectives to fulfill. For a game already so big I think it would have benefited from cutting some of them out.  All dialogue is voice acted and of good quality. There is some noticeable reuse of voice actors among NPCs, but that is excusable for a game of this size. I would rather see good voice actors reused than bad voice actors brought in in greater numbers.  Combat, unfortunately, is just adequate. There isn't enough depth here to stay compelling throughout. There is a nice mix of weapon types that all control very differently, but you're likely to pick one or two early on and stick with them. Magic brings some cool spells to the fray but are very limited in number. Leveling up is a good, customizable system that does gradually add new abilities, but not enough to keep things from going stale. To be clear, I never got to a point of hating battles. However, a combination of things getting too easy by the end, the long length of the game and repetition of enemy types eventually sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it. I will warn you that it is possible to become over leveled if you do all side quests as you find them. Google 'Amalur Wiki overlevel' to find a guide for avoiding this.  I'll wrap things up with a few more minor critiques. Loot is dealt out in such volume that inventory management becomes a chore (similar to many Diabloesque games). Despite this abundance of gear it was surprisingly infrequent how often I found something better than what I was wearing. Also, before long I had more money than things to do with it. I play most games on Normal difficulty, including this one, but didn't find enough challenge here so I suggest playing on Hard to most players. The orchestral score was competently produced but lacked the artistry to make it memorable.  Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fantastic, expansive experience that could have benefited from seeing its great length reined in a little bit.
533	1	a	When I first saw Kingdoms of Amalur : Reckoning I thought 'Oh great here's another Fable. Another try hard, no hype RPG.' I saw it on sale for $5. Realized my mistake and consider myself lucky to have experienced such an incredible IP. Then I learned the studio went under because no one bought this game. Why...why oh why didn't we buy this game?
535	1	a	I would highly recommend this game! Great fantasy RPG, huge world, lots of dungeons to explore, more quests than you could count, and fantastic combat. Love it! &lt;3
537	1	a	Short: The game is amazing, yet so underrated and overlooked. It's got good character customization and creation, it has a plethora of awesome weapons and delivers a funny yet dramatic storyline.  * Pros - Open world (HUGE) - Lots of weapons and other equipment - Three 'classes' to choose from, warrior (Might), rogue (Finesse) and mage (Sorcery) with lots of skills each, which can be mixed! (I.e. Might/Finesse or Finesse/Sorcery or a bit of everything). - The player is fateless, so you can choose different fate-cards that have different effects, choices in dialogue also make differences. - Funny dialogue, you can decide what to say and get a funny response if it's absurd. - Lots to explore, many dungeons, areas and quests! - Awesome combos and finishing moves  * Cons - Lacks some sounds, even though your player says something, there's no sound for the dialogue. (Though the npc's are voiced) - There aren't as many monsters as weapons, enough, but there could be more. (Some vanilla are even used in the dlc content) - There's no mounts, so running everywhere is a pain sometimes. (There is fast-travel though)
539	1	a	Probably one of the most overlooked games I've been surprised by. Immersion is completely to the 9's, the artwork amazing, and possibly the most convincing voice acting of any RPG I've played of late. It's only weakness that I have seen is it's combat so far. Simple and only challenging sometimes. This may be cured by the difficulty slider, but due to the big warning that is given for changing it, I have left it for this playthrough.
541	1	a	This game is like Skyrim if Skyrim was high on crystal meth. Fluid combat with an interesting skill tree. A massive detailed world filled with colour topped off with great boss battles.
543	1	a	Awesome game! pick this up if you love long long RPGs.
545	1	a	Picked this game up when it came out on the 360 back in 2012 and loved it from the moment it started. Now that I have moved on from the dieing console world and back to my PC roots this was a MUST for repurchasing. With a team made up of R.A. Salvatore, Todd McFarlane and Ken Rolston you get a world that is insanely vibrant that has depth and a fantastic story to take you through it all.    Bottom line is buy this game!  
547	1	a	There is so much to do, I'm only 12 hours in and I haven't even touched down on the main story line, I've just been keeping myself busy with side quests and adventuring!
549	1	a	A great single player mmo rpg, wonderful story written by Salvatore. Good graphic and characteristic world. Vote: 8.5/10
551	1	a	This is actually a really fun game with engaging combat, tons of stuff to do, and a lot of replayability. Its a shame the studio went under.
553	1	a	Brilliant game, absolutely brilliant, the only reason this game isnt one of the most played games of the genre, is..... well..... skyrim.. skyrim's shadow is way too big for the genre.
555	1	a	This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a 'little skyrim'.  That said, this game has some unique features, such as: +Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive) +Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests) +Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)  The game has some replay value since you can: +Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions +Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions +Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his power  As for the game design itself, some pros and cons are: Pros: +You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency +Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition +Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from +Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions +Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on) +Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue options  Cons: -The main storyline boss fights are quite dull -Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options -Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're 'running errands' -Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.  Overall verdict: It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.
557	1	a	I feel this game is under rated. I actually enjoy it much more than Dragon Age or Skyrim. The others I didn't get nearly as engrossed in as I did KoAR.
559	1	a	An excelent game. It has a level of character customizability that rivals and possibly surpasses the Elder Scrolls series. Your ability to thoroughly customize your character's powers and abilities adds a level of forthought to who you want your character to be while you fight. If you don't like the way your stats are progressing, then you can wipe the slate clean and start over. Through the course of the story line, you could have a warrior, a mage, a rogue, a combination of any two, or all three. Plus, your ability to sneak, forge, craft potions, find hdden items and other such skills are seperate from the combat skill trees. You could have a warrior with an insanely high sneaking and discovering items skills, or a thief that likes to forge weapons and armor. Basically, this game is definately worth playing, Nine out of ten, I'd say.
561	1	a	It plays like God of War. It has a loot system like Diablo. It has a crafting system and exploration elements like Skyrim. And looks like World of Warcraft. Unfortunately, it does none of these things like the games listed. It's a really fun game, but could have been much cooler with more care taken in these elements.
563	1	a	I've always felt RPGs to be a bit different than other types of games. They require time, dedication, and skill. But in return, they give you one of the greatest possible benifits- no, not a drip for your sensory systems or endorphins, but an endless creativity and a bueatiful world. That being said, creating a game is different from creating a painting. It can't just look good, it must be fun to play, fun to interact with, fun to experience. And while when many think of RPG, TES comes to mind, I think Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games that is sorely missed. It carries you into a colerfull, viberant, world, ripe with imagination and ready for the taking. It gives you what is, in my opinion, a better system than any other game- it allows you to have the freedom of skyrim, but also the classical class system and skill trees. The gameplay is fun, the world is simply gourgeous, and the lore is plentiful. This is one hell of a game you would not want to miss.  (NOTE: I am a PC gamer, however, I find this game is much more enjoyable with Xbox 360 controller. Its not meant for it, but it sure should be!)
565	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, took around 75 hours to complete including the DLC. The only criticism I'd level it at is that it's rather easy, especially once you start crafting your own gear.  If you are a fan of action RPGs, you should definately play this game.
567	1	a	Very fun and addictive combat. Story is good yet suffers from a lot of the typical and overdone gater/kill x quests. The world, however is very deep and rich. The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.  The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.  Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.
569	1	a	This game has the best storyline/gameplay of all the RPG's I have played. This game make Skyrim look like a childs game.
571	1	a	This game is:  An rpg That plays like Dragon Age: Origins That also plays like an MMO With the combat style of Dragon Age: 2.  I'll explain. If you've ever played an MMO before, you'll know that there's a rotation to your skills/abilities. This game offers up three sorts of abilities - melee, ranged, and magic. The game allows you cross-abilities and encourages it. The UI is set up like a typical MMO sort. The controls aren't difficult to grasp.  You move as though you were in an action game. Think Kingdom Hearts if you've ever played that. Or Devil May Cry.  This game came out about the same time as Skyrim. It was overlooked because of this, and subsequently the developers went out of business.  This is a tragedy. The game has the same open world feel as Skyrim, and allows you to fast travel to places you've been before. The looting system is much the same, only it allows for more.  For instance, you get the inventory is full instead of slowing down.  For another, within your inventory are bags. Each bag is for a crafting. Alchemy, sagecrafting (jewelcrafting), and blacksmithing. The components for all are placed within these bags, and not in your actual inventory. So you can stock up as much as you like on them all.  You're able to purchase a house, expand it, and have your own shared storage within it.  The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are pretty amusing, and while the character customization is sparse, you're allowed to be something other than friggin' human.  The plot has an absolutely fascinating premise, and how many games can you play that starts you off in a dumping ground for corpses?  It also touches a LOT on fae mythology. Brownies, trolls, sprites, etc. The elves are particularly badass in this game rather than being a bunch of pretentious snots or a downtrodden race.  The downside to this game is that there won't be any sequels coming to it due to the company going out of business.
573	1	a	Cool storyline, great voice acting, interesting artwork, fun combat... if only it was co-op it would be a 10 star game.
575	1	a	Extremely great combat system, decent skill trees and pretty good blacksmithing / sagecrafting mechanics. I definitely recommend this. Chakrams are my favorite weapon in this game lol. Get it!
577	1	a	This is actually a really fun game with engaging combat, tons of stuff to do, and a lot of replayability. Its a shame the studio went under.
579	1	a	Brilliant game, absolutely brilliant, the only reason this game isnt one of the most played games of the genre, is..... well..... skyrim.. skyrim's shadow is way too big for the genre.
581	1	a	This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a 'little skyrim'.  That said, this game has some unique features, such as: +Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive) +Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests) +Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)  The game has some replay value since you can: +Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions +Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions +Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his power  As for the game design itself, some pros and cons are: Pros: +You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency +Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition +Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from +Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions +Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on) +Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue options  Cons: -The main storyline boss fights are quite dull -Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options -Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're 'running errands' -Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.  Overall verdict: It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.
583	1	a	This game is a hidden gem all the way and I wish the company would have continued with a series. If you loved playing fable you will love this game, I highly recommend this game.
585	1	a	A good game with tons of content. If you're a completionist like me, you'll put 100 hours into this easily. The art style is kind of WoW-ey but that has allowed it to age well. It's challenging without being artifically difficult, and the DLC adds a lot of content.   Pretty standard plot, you're a special guy/gal that needs to save the world from ancient evil. But if you like exploring a (mostly) non-linear world and killing baddies for loot, it's a good game and certainly worth the time.
587	1	a	I'll make this brief. This game is more than worth waaaaayyyyy more the 10 buck asking price. Intricate story, awesome weapons and easy to use control scheme--saying a lot from a RPG noob like me--make this a fun, captivating and replayable game worth every penny. DLC just as good and worth scooping up with the game.
589	1	a	The RPG format is one where you have fairly clear expectations. Despite this, most of them get it wrong. But KOA Reckoning is the first one I've found in a long time that has actually had me telling myself I needed to go to bed (and then ignored my own advice).   The storyline is rich, which a lot of developers forget is important when you're supposed to be *playing* a role in a virtual world, and the gameplay is fun and flexible. As much as I love games like The Witcher, the user interface and controls can be awkward and clumsy; this game overcomes those problems and is genuinely enjoyable from start to finish - where you'll actually *want* to spend dozens of hours off on lore-related side quests instead of begrudgingly doing them out of necessity.   Overall one of the best RPGs that I've ever played. I haven't checked out the DLC yet, but it's definitely something I'll be doing and not just considering.
591	1	a	Very fun and addictive combat. Story is good yet suffers from a lot of the typical and overdone gater/kill x quests. The world, however is very deep and rich. The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.  The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.  Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.
593	1	a	This game is like Skyrim if Skyrim was high on crystal meth. Fluid combat with an interesting skill tree. A massive detailed world filled with colour topped off with great boss battles.
595	1	a	An amazing lore rich game with fun combat unlike Skyrim. I highly recomend this game to anyone who loves rpgs.
597	1	a	This game has a ton of content. Lots of quest and other things to get into. I would be further along the main quest line but every time I'm running around its like 'Ooo another NPC with an exclamation point! Let me see what quest that is!' Then I get sidetracked for an hour or two. I'll probably never finish but it's still a fun easy going game to play. Sort of WoW meets Elder Scrolls. Has a good visuals, beautiful land scapes and good combat animations. Fate moves and the backstab kill cams are a pretty awesome touch. Story line is good, tons of lore, with better than average voice acting. I'd definitely recommend this game. Check for it during one of the big Steam Sales, which is when I picked it up.
599	1	a	I purchased Kingdoms of Amalur on Steam as a complete package for $11.99 which included all of the DLC and finished the main story in 53 hours. As with most games I play, I finished all the side quests I came across.   Graphics – Great  I loved the graphics in KOA. There is a strong a vivid use of color and the world is filled with detail. Animations are fluid and my PC never once stuttered the frame rate from a constant 60 fps. The environments could have used a little more variety as by endgame you will grow tired of the same recycled assets.   Music – Fair  The music in KOA is well orchestrated but the songs lack depth and variety. More songs would have been a plus as a large amount of time is spent in each area before going to the next and this can have you listening to the same loop for many hours at a time.   Cinematics – Good  Picture the same dialogue cutscenes as KOTOR or Mass Effect. The dialogue itself is very well written but unlike the Mass Effect series, you may not find yourself delving into the various conversation options. The characters and their backgrounds just weren’t interesting enough for me. The choices during conversations also lacked the Mass Effect style feeling of autonomy. You could make good or evil choices but it never mattered much. “Quick Time events in combat are a cool sight to see.   Story – Good  As RPGs go, this story is original and kept me interested enough to finish the game to see what happens. I did not grow attached to any of the side characters or find them interesting. This game is really all about you. The main villain(s) were menacing but far from the kind of evil we love to hate.   Control – Great  I had no issues with the controls. They are very simple and easy to learn. The UI was easy enough to use. The awkward camera may startle you at first but you quickly get used to it.   Gameplay – Fair  I played as a melee class so your experience may vary. Combat in the beginning is fun but quickly grows stale. All I really had to do was click mouse 1 until everything died. Even on the hard setting, combat becomes too easy as you gain better weapons and armor. You completely overpower everything and I did not die once the entire game. I also never needed any of the consumable items with the exception of a very rare healing potion.   Content – Good  There is plenty to do here and the game’s zones adjust to your level so you are free to do as little or as much as you want to for side quests. The loot you find is very rewarding in the beginning of the game but by the middle, I was scrapping everything I found for parts. I had over five million gold with nothing to spend it on.   Value – Great  For $12 I had 53 hours of fun. The game is huge and kept me playing until I finished. I did not feel inclined to play through the DLC quest lines. In my opinion, they weren’t worth it.   Recommended – Yes  I recommend this game for the price I paid. In my opinion, this game is worth $20 or less. It is currently $19.99 on Steam without the DLC.
601	1	a	got the game yesterday and i have the feeling i play Fable, nice fast gameplay and many choices, runs very smooth specialy for older computers like mine with not the dual cores required ( thumbs up )
603	1	a	The game seams a bit simplistic the combat is arcade style and a bit styalized. I like the graphics but the world doesent seam to be as 'open as they suggest in the intro. I expected an open world to explore. The controls seam to work ok and the dialog is interesting if you like fantasy adventure I would recomend this game. My only dislike is the charachter creation process and tutorial in the begining which you cant avoid if you want to play the game through as a different charachter.
605	1	a	Highly enjoyable, fun gameplay, good story, quite a bit of customization and seemingly great deal of replayability. I went full Warrior, you can do Thief and Mage as well or any combo of the 3. I hear people call this a mix of God of War and Oblvion. I can certainly see what they mean, but its not quite right. Youll occasionally have to rapidly click M1, M2, or space, Its not like GoW's massive amount of button presses and analog stick twistings QTE sequence.   Tiny gripe;   Oftentimes, youll be on a cliff or ledge, youll have to find the predetermined spot that the game allows you to jump off. Its not hard its just a bit silly. Its the only time youll be able to jump in the game.    A must buy on sale!
607	1	a	Lots of quests, huge map, nice character development possibilities - very nice overall.  Too bad it's so underrated.
609	1	a	Awesome game with loads of stories and quests. The combat is phenomenal, and the skill tree system really allows you to create a unique character that suites your needs.
611	1	a	It's a shame the studio is now defunt as an avid fan of the Elder Scrolls Franchise I REALLY enjoyed this game. You can see the talents of the professional story writing all across the game. The story is what really does it for this title, not only the main story line but the faction story arcs as well, and even the one offs. I recommend this title for any RPG fan.
613	1	a	This game is better than Skyrim.
615	1	a	boy is this game a hit or miss relationship. it has buttonmasher gameplay that is extremely satisfying, and a story good enough to keep you going. the graphics arent the best but they are stylized enough to still look good. the world feels empty though, and i think that is because it was originally intended to be an mmo. i would definitley snatch it on sale.
617	1	a	Great game, worth every penny sad that it never got the attention it deserves
619	1	a	This game is awesome, it took me almost 70 hours to finish. I'll never regret about it.
621	1	a	For myself, this was one RPG that slipped under the radar. I had heard about it years ago upon pre / actual release, but for one reason or another it never made my purchase list. Having bought &amp; played now for 35 - 40 hrs., I am actually glad I waited. My hardware runs this thing flawlessly now, but 4 yrs. ago when this came out, it would have been a struggle. Good game, story, combat, upgrade system; definitely worth adding to any PC players' action RPG collection.
623	1	a	Absolutely Epic
625	1	a	loved this game when it first came out. A veey underrated game if your a fan of rpg you should definatly pick this up
627	1	a	Underrated gem of a game. Cool combat, pretty great class customization too.
629	1	a	A gem that I find myself always coming back to. Not a perfect game, but just does so many things well you can't help but want to try every race and class.    Pros:     Decent graphics. Not breathtaking, but not a lot of buggy nonsense everywhere either.   Story is genuinely interesting, and each DLC story makes you yearn to discover more as well.   Combat. Holy cow, the combat is fun. There may only be a handful of weapon types, but the way your talents affect them and the combos you can string together is just plain fun. Mixing and matching magic spells with weapons adds some nice flavor as well.   There is a  LOT  to do in this game. Even if you only did the main story it takes a while to finish, but rising through the ranks in the various factions is some of the best parts of the game!   Your character's abilites are NEVER set in stone. You can reset everything to try new ability combos at any point in the game.    Cons:    This game can be very unforgiving. Probably my biggest gripe with this game, is that there is very limited auto-saving, yet many ambushes/surprise events that you can be quite unprepared for. I ragequit many a time after having hours of work sucked away by carelessly forgetting to save, then dying.   The voice acting may seem decent at first, but some of the accents and voices get VERY annoying and repetitive. Not the end of the world, but definitely noticeable.   At points this game can be grindy, when the level gap between zones is a little too big. One moment you'll feel like a badass, then move to the next zone and get wasted immediately(Then lose a ton of time as previously stated haha sob).   Overall, 8.5 / 10 I'll take slightly flawed, lesser known game with insane replay value over a big name blockbuster that leaves me yawning after 20 hours anyday.  PS- Bought this on Steam after logging 100+ hours into the PS3 version. Cheers everyone!
631	1	a	One of the best RGPs out there. It deserves a way more attention than it got. Even though it probebly won't get a sequal I'm still hoping for one. EA, please make that happen. :)
633	1	a	Great game, worth every penny sad that it never got the attention it deserves
635	1	a	Fun game that's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a good action RPG. The DLC is fun, though maybe a bit short if purchased at full price. The graphics (especially for an older game) and story are solid, though not as good as something like Witcher. One of the biggest things that I like about the game are that the combat, while not necessarily the most complex, is fun and customizable depending on your preferred style of play. The other biggest pro for me is the amount of character progression, in terms of the look of your character, the gear that you get, and the talents/abilities that unlock over time.
637	1	a	A decent game with bright visuals and a long runtime. The story is confusing and forgettable, but decent for an RPG. There are a variety of environments, owing to the size of the map, and a number of different enemies to match it. The travel system is easy to use. There's really nothing that I disliked, but it lacks some content and systems that other RPGs have. Overall, well worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
639	1	a	GREAT game for a newbie. My first RPG and it was very easy to pick up and play. Beautiful scenery and storyline.
641	1	a	Excellent game. Severely underrated. Good storyline, large world and lots to do.
643	1	a	Great game so far, but its pop ins are almost as bad as la noire's.
645	1	a	Excellent game. Severely underrated. Good storyline, large world and lots to do.
647	1	a	wanna play a really good game, with lots of side quests? God of War meets Skyrim right here....Trust me when i tell you, you can't go wrong picking this one up. 
649	1	a	This is a good single player game, i enjoy playing it. really simply to play &amp; uses the xbox contorller nicely.  its just missing multiplayer. if the make another mulitplayer would make it more fun.
651	1	a	 Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.   Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a  lot  of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that  feel  like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.    Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:   - Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.   This bullet is not exaggerating with the 'hundreds of hours' bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.  One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.    Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:   - Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.   Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.  If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.    Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:   - Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.   - Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.   The combat system is a hybrid of  God Of War  and the  Fable  series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.  Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say 'softly' is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.  Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.  The 'Fateshift' mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!    Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:   - Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.   - Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.   When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices:  Might  (Warrior),  Finesse  (Rogue), and  Sorcery  (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.  Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.    There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!   http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646

655	1	a	Someone said this game is like a single player MMO where you only do quests. Very good comparison. Fun for a little while, but not enough to hold my interest. Didn't finish. Combat system is rather simple, but lots of variety. Nice combat graphics, but there seems to be an emphasis on appearance over actual challenge.
657	1	a	Hands on the table, I've yet to explain such a great experience as I have been having with this game, thus far. Amalur: Reckoning, has become a favorite in a matter of moments, to me.  If you are in search of a story-backed, heavily armored RPG, or something to bring an emotional (and nostalgic) rememberance to you. THIS IS IT! Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has brought back to me the same nostalgia of games such as, Fable, Morrowind, and other timeless classics that brought in a new era of RPG gaming.   9.3/10 Story 8/10 Graphics 10/10 Content 8/10 UI/Combat Mechanics 10/10 Replay Value  The story is unique and enthralling from my point of view as the player, many bonds formed in the game. Reckoning has an exciting amount of information to learn for almost every NPC character as well, there is lots to learn, and always a bonus!   Graphics are intriguing, lots of intuitive graphic inspirations which look and feel similar to games such as WoW, Prince of Persia, Fable 2, and The Last Remnant.  I could not ask for ANY more content from this game, personally. The content that has been provided, is incredible. It takes a keen eye to see all the little details put into the fabrics of this game, and there is a bountiful amount of things to do in this game, never boring.   As for the UI of this game, it's not 'clunky' or 'misplaced', but it definitely could have been shown off a little more.  Speaking for this in a comparison, it would land closer to an original inspired UI, such as Dark Souls. Relatively simple to navigate, and basically gets the job done. Could have been better, but I've seen worse.  Combat in this game lands incredibly close to that of a Fable game, the particles of Magic based skills/attacks are very similar to the style of that series. And the combat feel is smooth, and aaalmost clean. It has a bit of register and error when it comes to trying to scroll between weapons when you want to, and when you want to aim at an enemy while moving backwards, something that comes with most games. Just need to remember that these things occur. The actual skills and devices of combat in this game feel familiar to Continent of The Ninth Seal (C9 by Webzen), the skills are incredible and awe-inspiring!   I really feel at home with this game, and there is always something new to accomplish, or experiment with. Lots to tinker with, lots of different ways to go about doing one single thing. Always new possibilities for your character progression, and every class tree is fun to play with. Needless to say this game userped the throne of my RPG Top 10.  Feel like this game is for you? It should. It is worth the full price, believe me. It is always nice to get it on sale, just don't waste any time NOT playing this game :)
659	1	a	one of the best rpg's i've played in a long while
661	1	a	I had heard that this game was too similar to an MMORPG without actually being one to be fun, but these claims were wrong. Certainly, the quest system is a degree like an MMO's, but it was nowhere near as monotonous, and I went through the game doing every quest for every region, and only became tired of that when I had went through every piece of land on the lefternmost (see: largest) continent, and was about 40 hours in. The combat is fantastic. I only played as a warrior, but the moves were so stylish, and made you feel so powerful, that I never got tired of fighting. The challenge is kept consistent all the way through, and the gameplay and character customization overshadow the admitably awful story and characters (that fortune-teller dude that follows you throughout the game is badass, though, as is your gnome buddy). I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.
663	1	a	Jean Kirstein strongly approves of this game.
665	1	a	Highly underrated game. Incredibly fun. Great story. It's a shame that the studio that made it went under.
667	1	a	★★★☆☆  When i was playing mass effect 2 on xbox 360, I had chance to play kingdoms of amalur (as KOA) demo version. And this demo game gave me a good time. So i bought this one.   Anyway that's personal history. :) Return to the subject, 'KOA' presents the new fantasy world about 'Rule of Cycle', 'Immortal Fea', 'Crystal War', 'Fateless One'... and so on. And these things are showed with beautiful graphic (not mean good quality).  Also this game contains many thing to do. After tutorial, you will be faced a lot of quests. Even sometimes these quests make me confusing. You can collect regents or shards to create potions or gems. And you can breakdown equipment and salvage gears to make weapons or armors.  And battle system is good. Even this is a RPG game. You can against your enemy by combo, air combo, combat ability and reckoning mode. Various weapons, skills, destinies (like specialized jobs) give you joyful choice. Even you think 'I made a wrong choices', don't worry, you can return to level 1 with all skill points. And reckoning mode is awesome, you become a powerful one and you can do fate-shift (like finish blow). I always felt catharsis when i finished a strong enemy by fate-shift.  But 'KOA' also has bad things. First and Worst thing is '38 Studios (developer of 'KOA') was closed without 'KOA' licence sold. That means no more updates, DLCs and 'Kingdoms of Amalur II' :(  And character customization is awful. May be, you have bad feeling, when you make your player. Because character customization has very little selections to make your face. Then your worry become a problem of game play. You can see a NPC what have exactly same your face with different hair color. But that's not a problem, i can imagine he is a my doppelganger or unknown my brother who was seperated at childhood (in game story). But real problem is same faces NPCs are too many to focus story line. For example, You will meet a mentor who guide you in arcana faction quest, and he will send you to the archimage. (I skip many things to prevent spoiler). Then... you will see a same mentor face archimage with white hair. WTF, Even they are major NPCs of faction quest, they have same face!!! except hair color!!!! This problem will teases you until final battle.  Other thing is the low level cap. If you are a person who complete all quest in the game (not repeat quests), you can reach level 40 (max level), soon. In my case, i could reach level 40 after siege of mel senshir. Probably i could do that because i finished 'The Legend of Dead Kel' and 'Teeth of Naros' before cross the ocean. Then i lost my purpose of side quests and battles. Level cap must be higher than level 40 to make player can push forward.  Anyway 'KOA' is a good RPG game. If it was not, i didn't get all achievements of this game. 'KOA' is a new IP game what has potential to be a great franchise game. But it's a shame, future of 'KOA' is unclear.
669	1	a	Buy it. A shame the company went under, worth playing especially if found on sale
671	1	a	Great lore. This stands way above Skyrim. Skyrim is considered better only because players do what devs couldn't - improve the game. But there are very few issues with Amalur. It's good, especially at this price!
673	1	a	Excellent game and mechanics. Graphics are very nice.
675	1	a	I don't know where to start but this game is best RPG I've ever played. Please don't ask me about Skyrim this is my personel opinion. Whatever, let's start:   • 4 races to play. • 3 skill trees Might, Finesse &amp; Sorcery. (You can be three of them if you want) • Fighting system like Darksiders. • Epic boss fights.  • A great story, never got bored while playing.  • A huge world to explore. (Better with DLC Packs) • Amazing animations.  • And the best part, insane finishing moves while in Reckoning Mode!   So, you MUST buy this game if you wanna feel the real action. Trust me, you won't regret it!
677	1	a	really good game had hours of fun.
59	0	a	Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]
679	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the best RPG games I've played in a long time. Skyrim didn't really catch me, but Amalur has. I don't know if it's the combat style or the atmosphere or just the storytelling that makes this game great or if it's the great combinations of these. Anyway, this is a great RPG and most likely a candidate to 'Best Game of the Year 2012'.
681	1	a	Wonderful game! Underrated gem. GRaphics are a little toony, but gameplay and combat mechanics as a dual wielding fae-blade guy it so damn nice. ONe of the first games i look forward trying again!
683	1	a	So I bought this game a few months ago, not expecting much. Honestly, I was expecting it to be one of those games I play for a couple of days and then lose interest in. I was very wrong on that account. This is actually one of the best, if not the best, RPGs that I have ever played. There were a few cons of course, but I will get to that in a little bit.   Because The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the last RPG I played before this game, I could not help but to make comparisons during my entire time playing this. In terms of graphics, I found Amalur to be far superior than Oblivion. When you are walking in caves and you see all of the flora just come to life as you walk past, it is just captivating.   In terms of story line, I would say that they are about equal, but then again, I have not gotten all that far in Oblivion's storyline (I spend most of my time doing the side quests, build my character up some for the really tough bosses). If I compared Amalur to Morrowind however, I would pick Amalur's storyline anytime. Because unlike Morrowind, in which the storyline has you do all of these tasks to the point that it feels crazy, Amalur is fairly straightforward.   Voice-acting, I don't really care for. But from what I can tell, the voice of the characters in Amalur tends to have this almost...ghostly quality? Almost like you are hearing someone in another room rather than them talking right next to you. I guess you will either love it or hate, but for me? I was indifferent.   There are plenty of side quests to take part in, just like in Oblivion. Like Oblivion, you can take part in faction quests. Like if you want to be the head of a Mage's guild in Oblivion, then you can do the same for Amalur. However, while it it can take a few days or so to finish a faction quest in Oblivion, you can knock them out in Amalur in like, a day because the quests are so much easier and there are fewer actual quests to complete for the faction.   There is a huge variety of character customization. Do you want to play a male or female character? Go ahead. Do you want to play as an Elf or a Human? Go ahead. If memory serves me right, then I think there are four races to select in Amalur, but the building of the skill-set does not occur until you actually start game play. Like you do not decide immediately if you want to make your character a mage. You can decide where you want to place your character's skill alignment later on and even then, you are fully able to go back and change your character's style whenever you want. If you decide you want a hammer wielding mage, but decide later that you want to have a magic wielding thief or warrior, then you can do that.   I guess now I can get into the overall pro's and con's.  Pro's  -Absolutely amazing graphics - Wide skill-set available -You can change your skill-set whenever you want with no consequences other than what your character can or cannot wear or what they can do in combat. -Game play tends to be fluid and smooth, particularly with the combat. You can dodge-roll or teleport out of the way of an attack and the game is not in first-person so you can see more. I will get to con's later -Once the main storyline is complete, you can still continue on side-quests -Items will not weigh more than others. While some weapons will impact attack speed, they will still only occupy one item slot in your backpack. For example, your hammer, while slower in combat than your daggers, will still occupy the same space in your backpack as the daggers.  -There is a hide-helmet option so that even if your character wears a hood or helmet, you will not see it in game play yet you will still have the effects. I personally loved this feature. -Easier than Oblivion, but the boss fights can still crush you if you are not ready -Good enough that it deserves a sequel -My overall verdict? I enjoy this game way more than Oblivion.  Con's  -Camera angles tend to lag every once in a while, to the point where you might have difficulty seeing an enemy -Character may freeze while running. As in your character will just stop moving while running. This can be overcome by rolling or teleporting, but it can be troublesome to freeze in the middle of a fight. Also, this freezing will occur A LOT, and as such you will be rolling or teleporting almost all the time. It took a couple of days for this to occur to me though. -Voice-acting is so-so.  -From what I have heard, you can only reach level 41. That is it. But you can still reset your skill points later on. Keep in mind though that this means you will not be able to completely max out all skills and abilities.  -I have had difficulty completing a side-quest because every time I try, the game shuts down. I do need to give it another try though. -Last I checked, the company that developed this game went bankrupt. So do not expect a sequel or any patches.  Overall, I say check this out. I got it for $9.99 and this game was most definitely worth the price. It is fun, beautiful, and the ability to change your skill-set helps to take away the pressure of having to stick with one field.  
685	1	a	As for KoA:Reckoning it is by no means a bad game. The game's problems lie in its large vision, where for various reasons was left only half fulfilled. It had the frameworks for a great game, but just that, the frameworks.  The mechanics were there, but as a new IP they shot big, aimed wide, but in the end it was all just superficial and lacked depth. There wasn't any wonder in exploration and the lack of trully likable/charming characters comes off as a sore point. Had it been an indie title it would have been best indie wRPG ever, but sadly it was marketed as a AAA game from the get-go and as-such was set to fail by the buisnessmen in suits who weren't brave enough to aim smaller.  Maybe if the development didn't start-stop so many times, if BigHugeGames didn't get passed between 3 different owners, and Ken Rolston (former Lead Designer of both Oblivion and Morrrowind) was able to complete his original vision we may have had one of the greatest wRPGs in recent memory... alas that is not the case and what we got was KoA:R. Not a bad game, but one that shows the makings of a trully great one but is never able to go all the way.
687	1	a	This is a great game and definately worth picking up if you're a fan of action RPGs. Probably averages about 50 hours of gameplay if you do most of the sidequests and have the DLC packs.
689	1	a	I heard allot of good stuff about this game. It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. 'You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!' and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing 'Have you played Reckoning yet??' 'Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!' So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game. So stop reading this right now and purchase it so you can go ahead and get the download started. I love you...er...where did that come from...sorry..
691	1	a	Nice open world with lots of side quests. Better combat system than most of games of its genre *cough*skyrim. Lore created by R. A. Salvatore, artwork by Todd McFarlane. Definitely worth the money and time spend.
693	1	a	Even a few years after the release I still think that this game is among the best RPGs ever created for console and computer. The graphics plus characters are lovely and the world is as many-sided as it is dangerous. You can do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of sidequests which sometimes makes you forget what you are supposed to do, but personally, I love that about my openworld RPGs. After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer. Personally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on 'Load' instead of 'Save' but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD  I haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer. So anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!
695	1	a	Nicely design game wonderful creatures the only problem I have is the inventory system is a little clunky but other than that I would totally recommend to anybody who plays RPG's and such things ! :)
697	1	a	Truly a work of art. If you enjoy fantasy and stories that explore The Forgotten Realms, then you might want to try out this game. R.A. Salvatore, author of The Legend of Drizzt series, puts his influence into the world of Amalur and helps create a beautiful world to explore and fierce creatures to slay. A streamlined combat system makes it easy to get into the game and enjoy any class or play style, while offering those looking for a challenge a little fun too with combos and flourishes to master.
699	1	a	This game has bad rep for how awesome it actually is. It is a really fun RPG that is on the list of 'must plays in order to consider yourself a PC gamer'. It really is an incredibly fun, unique and enjoyable game worth getting.  
701	1	a	Definitely one of the best ARPGs that came out recently.  The combat system is really well done. Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.  One thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.  The blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. 'Wow your fate is blank' 'You'll save the world' blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.  One last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10
703	1	a	i've put about 20 hours into this game. I've never played a game so much in my life! Get this, you won't regret it!
705	1	a	A great free roam game that incorporates strategies and battle movements as well as a dynamic storyline to make this game more than just a hack and slash game.
707	1	a	Great for all ages!! Love this game and highly suggest it. The enemies are fairly simple and not too scary for little ones to fight! Great story line, and lots to do!!!
709	1	a	Awsome game :) 4 out of 5 stars.
711	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time! Similar to Skyrim but not much can beat Skyrim. Its a Must Play for RPG fans.
713	1	a	Actually pretty fun! Sometimes the story is basic and not deep, but the fighting and combat system is pretty epic!
715	1	a	Good game with potential to be great. Has some flaws - bad FOV, random encounters, forgettable side-quests - but many strengths: great main story, a vast semi-open world with rich lore, absolutely fun combat (I recommend playing a mage). I had fun with it.
717	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is your typical fantasy open-world RPG. Its fantastic combat system has you pulling badass moves right from the start, rewards player use of variety and offers a well thought out skill progression. The level scaling unfortunately makes the game too easy later on. The environments are lush and visually spectacular with a huge amount of variety. Despite this, its populace are cookie-cutter NPCs and you’ll fatigue from the hundreds of quests constantly being thrown in your face. The resulting little characterisation makes it hard to get invested into this game. Combat and exploration are its saving factors.
719	1	a	Please note that I played about 3 hours of the demo and though that only brings the total playtime up to about 8 hours, I'm writing this review while KoA is still on sale.   Overall a very fun game; refreshingly fun.   I am playing as a Varani Rogue, a stealth-based character and I'm loving it.  Definitley worth the money!
721	1	a	An amazingly immersive bit of storytelling that tied together with an excellent, fluid combat system and an intuitive skill tree with tangible gameplay effects where nothing feels supurfluous. Whole-heartedly recommend. Make sure you pick up the DLC as they're built more like expansion packs than most modern DLC.
723	1	a	Absolutely worth buying especial for its price, If your an RPG fan that likes unique and skilled base combat systems, and storylines that are not too huge with content (athough there is plenty of fun, amusing, and interesting storyline content in the game) The game has a huge open world with plenty of areas to explore and find, if you chose to do so. But still its a game you can put down and forget about and then come back and immerse yourself once again.
725	1	a	This game has completely engulfed my being. It's all I want to do. Play it.
727	1	a	know how a lot of RPGs get REALLY good 20-30 hours in? Kingdoms Of Amalur is ♥♥♥♥ing fantatsic right from the start.
729	1	a	Was a bit sceptic in the beginning regarding the controls, but as it turned out, it flows really well with the combat system. Weapons, NPCs, progressive systems, skills etc. are engaging and fun.  I'm a couple of hours in and i like what i see so far!
731	1	a	A very fun game. Rich lore, interesting storyline, various unique creatures and weapons. There are 3 main playstyles that vary considerably. If you want you can focus on one of the 3 or you can split it up between. There are so many possibilities, cool moves and useful spells. It has a solid blacksmithing and alchemy component to it, as well as something called sagecrafting where you can create gems that will power up your items.   Because most people are going to know what its like compared to Skyrim I guess I'll have to talk about that. In my opinion the combat is more rich. There's dodging, and blocking with sheilds is actually worth it and plays into your attacks if timed right. Also it feels way less hack and slash than Skyrim, there a different moves that when applied correctly can turn the tide of what might have seemed an unwinnable fight. The game auto-aims for you, but that doesn't detract from the fighting experience at all. The spells are also more interesting than Skyrim's. Skyrim might have more spells but they end up all feeling the same while KoA:R's are all unique and have very powerful uses in certain situations.   Kingdoms has an amazing world to explore. It is a bit small compared to Skyrim and doesn't allow for as much freedom (for example you can only jump down from cliffs and walls at certain points on the map) but it is something you get used to and it helps with where the game really excels: combat, because you are channelled towards groups of enemies.   The graphics are fairly decent and the game runs smoothly. I did run into a bug where you get stuck and cannot move at all and have to fast travel to get out of the place and the general pop in distance for enemies could be a bit longer, perhaps there is a way to change this in the .ini files or something, I'll have to check. The lipsyncing of characters is sometimes off and occassionally they make really awkward movements when speaking, which are a bit immersion breaking. The voice acting is quite good though like all RPGs I really wish they could have used a greater variety of voice actors.   Overall its a great experience and I'm quite addicted to it so far. There are so many choices and I feel as if I will do a bunch of playthroughs with vastly differing character builds to get the whole experience. Oh that brings me to one last thing. You can 'unbind your fate' for a relatively cheap gold cost to reset your points. This means if partway through a playthrough you got sick of smashing people with giant swords you could pay a bit of gold and change your character into a stealthy assassin or a flashy mage.
733	1	a	There are already several excellent in-depth reviews here on Steam so I'll keep this short.  I really enjoyed playing through this game. The story is done well and offers some fresh takes on your standard fantasy fare, the world is huge with plenty of places to go and things to do. The DLCs are worthy expansions that add new world areas with yet more places to go and things to do, along with some nice loot for your troubles. There is a tremendous amount of content here.  You don't pick a class for your character, like in the elder scrolls games you build your class up from skills, and you can mix and match pretty much however you want. The skills can be easily be reset at any point for a nominal fee if you want to try something different.  Combat is fast and fluid, nothing turn-based here. You need to learn to dodge and hit your enemies from behind, or use a ranged weapon or magic and blast them from afar. It's also possible to get a teleport dodge that does damage as you pass though enemies. You can equip two weapons at a time in any combination and switch between them fluidly in combat. Once you've filled a gauge, you can unleash awesome kill moves to quickly take down difficult enemies.  The graphics are bright and colorful and look good, with an art style that reminds me of WoW. The animations and effects are well done so combat is fun to watch.  There's a few cons, the biggest one being game balance. Early on, the game is fairly well balanced, but each zone has a level cap on the monsters and loot which spawns there which you can easily exceed before finishing all the quests in that area. This makes the later parts of the game laughably easy unless you've just been rushing through the main story missions. Also, the developer unfortunately went bankrupt making this game so there will be no fixes, sequels or additional content, which is a real shame given how great this game is all things considered.  Overall, an excellent game with a few small issues that can be easily overlooked. Make sure to get the DLC as well.
735	1	a	This game is great on so meny levels the combat is fun and easy to use the story is really good. tons of side quests and a huge world to explore makes is one of my all time list top games to play. Classic must have RPG's of all time.
737	1	a	Decent story - relatively satisfying conclusion - and enjoyable gameplay with gorgeous scenery throughout. Immense customization is available and the combat is fast paced, intuitive, and rewarding. It is easy to change your 'fate' and try a different play style at any point in the game - I switched back and forth from magic and finesse more times than I can count - and the different unlockable options for combat are really enjoyable. More than just a hack-and-slash, this game encourages you to consider particular approaches for particular enemies based on their weapon type and behavior. At the upper levels you have four or five different moves for any given weapon, all executed through a simple interface - click, pause click, click while dodging, click while blocking, click after parrying. Combined with a wide variety of spells and special abilities, you have numerous options for engaging with a particular enemy, or multiple enemies at once.  It was hard to really get a feel for my character, though, since it is clear that in order to complete quests and gain experience, there is a very particular sort of person your character is supposed to be. More options for how to complete certain quests would have been nice.   Overall though, it was a great experience and my first playthrough lasted 78 hours. And I'm thinking about playing through it again because I know I missed so much and never even gave the 'might' skill tree a chance! 8/10 would recommend.
739	1	a	everything you expect of an RPG and more. fun for the whole family!
741	1	a	KINGDOMS OF AMALUR HERE IT COMES THE RECKONING  Kingdoms of Amalur was a surprisingly good fantasy game. It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.  What I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.  The story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?  Weapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.  The game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.  The DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia &amp; Dead Kenan &amp; Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!  So am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.  Finale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)
743	1	a	This is a great RPG. A huge world, great items, and cool art.
745	1	a	If you are a fan of the Fable franchise, then this is the game for you.
747	1	a	Underated gem. Lots of fun, lots of weapons, lots of quests. It's an awesome game if you like dope fantasy RPG's.
749	1	a	Really cool game,one of the most entertaining RPG's i've played but it's lacking personification in characters. 8.5/10
751	1	a	Fantastic rpg! Deserves more love!
753	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a 'should buy' for anyone into fantasy CRPGs. Why not a must buy? It is a game and apparently a game franchise with no future. It plays far better with a controller than it does with a mouse and keyboard.   What about the good stuff?   If you don't like crafting, you need not engage in it; but, if you are into crafting, there are opportunities to build some crazy good gear. Potions are kind of hit and miss, but you won't regret being able to make health regeneration and healing potions. Overall, crafted gear is not as critical as it can be Skyrim; and potions are definitely more useful.   I really liked the combat system with its combos and different types of attacks working better/worse for different foes. There are opportunities to crank up the difficulty and win by thinking your way to victory. Alternately, you can reduce difficulty and just button mash your way through . . . should you fear the joystick and the nuances to combat. Each of the three major types of character archetypes yields a different playing experience.   The story and RP aspects of the game? Given the pedigree of those involved, this was actually little disappointing. The story arc isn't bad, but it is not as rewarding as, say, Dragon Age: Origins or the first installment of Mass Effect. The DLC is actually pretty good if you can forgive the grindiness of Naros and the silly in Dead Kel (some will find the silly endearing . . . others not so much). Some of the faction quest lines are actually good to very good; but the relationships you build with the factions comes to crashing end when the faction quests end. At the very least, this is a missed opportunity.  I have no regrets buying this game when it was on sale.
755	1	a	Great game all around. Give it a try. Watch Day9 and Alicia Day play  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MngZF7uqQJs  
757	1	a	Feels like skyrim should have done. Interesting and distinct environments, superb crafting system, a story you actually want to explore... the best RPG I've played since Human Revolution.
759	1	a	An under the cover game, dwarfed by other releases such as the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, this game should be viewed in greater light and strength. An addictive expansive world fuelled by a real fantastical scenario and setting, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning brings strong RPG elements to an otherwise uncomplicated genre. Though this game is stuck between an MMO and a traditional RPG, its combat, crafting and magical elements make this game a strong condendor for anyone looking to play an addictive, massive world game. The downsides to this game may be considerable for some: the purely linear main campaign, the massive open world with no fast travel and lack of considerable and ultimately interesting quests. Nevertheless, it makes up for these pitfalls in interesting dialogue that is both well tohugh out and witty. It is a real blast for any gamer. 8/10
761	1	a	I like this game and I do enjoy it a lot but I recommend reading a guide on quests and item bindings before going in because this game has some really irritating bugs. Some items become stuck in your inventory forever, taking up space unneccesarily. There are some quests that give you items that you can't get rid off, too. Overall, really good game but developers went bankrupt so no new patches.
763	1	a	Surprising how well made this game is; the detail and attention and expansiveness is just as deep and impressive as with skyrim. Very well made high quality game that is just as worthy of being played as skyrim.
765	1	a	I quit console gaming a few years ago. I had Kingdom's of Amalur when I first got my PS3 and had been playing on and off ever since. Between the PS3 and PC version, I probably have ~200+ hours invested and just about caught in progress in relation to my console play time. The core game itself has way more content than Skyrim with all of its DLC put together. No exaggerating, you're going to get your money's worth when it comes to content.  Kingdoms of Amalur is one of those titles that suffers from the gaming industry itself and faded into obscurity under its own weight. A shame too because there was a MMORPG in the works. But enough of the meta.  Essentially, the game is a single player ARPG that draws a lot from the Fable series and does it much better in most aspects. Combat is fluid, requiring timed button presses to block/counter or generate different effects from abilities and spells. Your character growth is based on three skill trees: Might, (your warrior) Finesse, (rogue) and Sorcery. (mage) On top of those trees, you have classes that are dependant on how many points you mix or match in the three trees. You can fully invest in one tree to gain access to exclusive abilities, split two trees into a formidable skillset or even split all three and fully customize a class to your playstyle, all with different bonuses as incentive.  The story is a bit hit or miss. There's a lot of that 'Chosen One' trope being overused, but the world itself is interesting enough when you get into the literature and lorestones you find along the way. You do, however get to make choices that have lasting effects withint the narrative. (or telling proclaimed by the Fae) Most of which will affect how certain NPCs react to you as the story goes on. Without saying much, consider how you go about doing things because different actions could create more desirable outcomes. At the very least, save often.  Definitely reccomending this to any Fable, Two Worlds, The Witcher, and even Elder Scroll's fans. While Kingdom's of Amalur doesn't have the depth of an Elder Scrolls and Witcher game, or the disappointment of a Fable or Two Worlds, there's a litte of something for everyone. I'd compare it to finding a nickel on the ground but finding out it's one of those rare coins that happens to be worth $500.
767	1	a	Man, what a unique concept. The entire game storyline is gripping. The writers really outdid themselves.  The gameplay is pretty standard in between fights, but the combat is stellar. Alternating between two weapons is seamless, combos get more varied as the game progresses, and skills/spells are easy to use and useful.
769	1	a	A surprisingly well made game. The graphics is not spectacular (though the combat animations and spell effects are good) and the game does not bring anything really new to the genre, the combat is excellent and the possibilities to progress your characters are many - want to be a rogue with chakrams and combat magic? No problem. Want to be a warrior in heavy armor, wielding huge warhammer and summoning skeletons to help you in fight? Go for it. There is plenty of side quests, usually involving finding something/killing somebody/stealing something. There is not much variety, but the quests lead you through the areas and into loads of combat, so you do not really care as long as you can slaughter some boggarts and brownies (yes, you heard me).  The world is quite huge and open, if you want, you can just explore and roam and kill stuff, though do not expect Skyrim here.  The game also offers a straightforward crafting system including weapons, armor, potions and socketable gems.  8/10  Worth your money, worth your time.
771	1	a	Game is fun
773	1	a	I love this game so much, and I feel much sorrow for the developers as they have gone bankrupt. This is a great game with a lot of free-roaming, the world is full of awesome quests and sweet gear. It's to bad there will be no more updates or games.
775	1	a	Fantastic game. It's pretty linear, but not in a bad way. Sidequests will fill your questlog as you pick them up every 10 feet or so if you explore a little. I think it took around 70 hours to finish the main quest and all the side stuff I could find. Combat took a little getting used to for me for some reason, but got the hang of it once I found a weapon style that I liked. Worth playing as this game goes on sale really cheap quite often.
777	1	a	One of the most overlooked game.
779	1	a	I'm m ight be a little late to the review scene, But this is one of the best action rpg games around.
781	1	a	After 80 hours of pure joy i finished this awesome game.  This Rpg-Game did evrything right: epic story, lovely sidequests, big area and lot of dungeons to explore , nice soundtrack, a lot of creapy creatures; but what i liked most was the awesome fightsystem and the ♥♥♥♥ing best art design in an rpg i have ever seen.  You can feel that this game is made with a lot of love and patience.  For me it's the best RPG i have ever played and i wasnt expecting that because i'm a big elder scrolls fan. I would recomend it to everyone who loves RPG-games (and ofc has a lot of time to play ^^)!
783	1	a	LOVE LOVE LOVE this game, great story, easy controls, and straightforward questing. the only drawback i have found is the inability to see quests other than the one tracked quest in the world map.
785	1	a	Ruined my life &lt;3  its awesome  GET IT 11/10
787	1	a	Fun Action, Easy to follow, Recommended Game
789	1	a	Well worth a play. Very simlar to Dragon age and the like but Ive found it a lot more accessable and more of a good old hack and slash. Gripping storyline, enjoyable flowing combat and a nice varity wepons and play styles.
791	1	a	play this game. now. why are you still reading this? buy the game, download it, and play it. im serious.
793	1	a	I've owned this game before, but couldn't hold myself back from the steam sale.  The one thing about this game that just wins me over is the fluidity of combat. Pair that with the huge world, lovely graphics, fully voice acted story and great character progession and balancing and you get an amazing game like this. At every point in the game you feel OP but still wanting more 9.5/10
795	1	a	I had heard a lot of crap about this game before I played it, and only bought it because it was 7 bucks with all the DLC included and because I had tried a demo of the game on the 360 a while back and it seemed decent enough. That 7 bucks brought me roughly 77 or so hours of content. I consider this to be a pretty decent deal. The main complaint I hear is that the game is repetetive - which RPG isn't? I also hear it compared to MMORPG games a bit, but the quests do actually have you going to places and doing various tasks rather than your traditional MMO routine of 'kill 5 rats.' It does have the Dragon Age 2 issue of all of the dungeons looking roughly the same, but that was the only real negative I could think of while playing through the game. The story is interesting enough, the combat while a bit easy at times is variable depending on how you spec your character (one of three styles: warrior, thief, mage ..essentially). You can also mix them up a bit.  If you can find the game for as cheap as I did I say grab it. For 60 bucks? I don't think I'd have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I spent the money and got this in return, but I'm not sure I'd buy this over something like Skyrim for the same amount.
797	1	a	Really good rpg game, nice graphs and a HUGE map, ive got only 5 hours into the game and its great!
799	1	a	a single 3rd person view player action adventure rpg set in a MMO-style world.  Nuff' said.
801	1	a	this is amazing! i love the story, and it's incredibly expansive. the combat system is really well done. camera takes a bit of getting used to because it's connected to the mouse but once you do get used to it there's very little in the game that trips you up.  Definitely worth your time :D
803	1	a	The game 'Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning' is one of the best open world games to play. Along with many locations the player must deal with many different enemies in each location. The mechanism's of fighting is really well done. Every time the strategy must be created to survive every single attack. The possibility to dodge and immediately respond with an attack mixed with the use of spells can bring a powerful combo.  Multiple quests makes the game much more interesting. There is no way for players to get bored because there is no break from fights. Each time, if the player decide, a new quest can be started giving a high chance to gain the higher level. Also bosses' fights leave no time to just sit and admire. The faster player fight, the faster the combo can be created with a powerful surprise at the end.
805	1	a	I originally played and beat this game on the Xboix 360  The big draw for me was there is open world. Lots of areas and hidden secrets to explore. I like to inspect every corner to find all the really awesome loot hidden somewhere.  And no choice of playstyle is a bad one. Very Balanced combat triangle.  10/10
807	1	a	Bargin from the sale, pumped only five hours into it so far. But i must say it plays very well. Warrior, Thief , or mage as your classes and they also do multi classing when you get higher in the levels , so you can build your own style with in the game. The story is easy to follow , with a strong back story that you can jump right into and feel apart of from the out set. Well done voice acting, on normal ive not died yet but the first play though i dont mind as you can increase that part in another play though.
809	1	a	I would heartily recommend this game for anyone who enjoys RPGs and high fantasy games without too many ttropes that have been trod upon one too many times.  At first I thought it was going to be like Skyrim, only less engaging and more cartoony. It is indeed more cartoony, but if you like helping people out, or are a student of Fae lore, then I think you'll find this game quite engaging. True, I've put about half the time into it as I've put into Skyrim (and I don't have the DLC for this game), but I ended up enjoying the hell out of myself anyway.  There's lots of memorable characters; the voice acting is really well done by a proliferation of actors; and at almost all times you'll feel as if you're really in a magical world. I thought that part was really well done.  And to top it all off, it ran really well on my mid-spec machine.
811	1	a	great single player game, would be awsome if there was some kind of multi player in it maybe with just friends but...... overall a fantastic game with AWSOME combat and class choices. the weapons and attacks frikin look bad ♥♥♥ and it keeps you hooked. the hardest dicision isnt choosing to buy the game, its choosing your class and weapons. if you like adventure/action/RPG, you will LOVE this game. definate must buy
813	1	a	 This is what I wished Fable II and III were
815	1	a	Fable + WoW + DMC = WIN
817	1	a	MMORPG in solo. Great graphic, great DLC. Lots of place to discover, and fun skill system.
819	1	a	
821	1	a	At time of writing it is 2:40 a.m. so I'm ranting  BUT WHAT A GAME HOLY ****  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a gigantic map of living, breathing npcs woven together by a glossy art style and quirky, sarcastic tones for every serious moment. It prides itself for having a wide selection of combat and adventuring styles, from a measly peasant to a brutal war-mage. You'll find loot for days and a fighting system that delivers satisfying crunches with every impact. I picked up six different builds before I settled on one that fit a medium-range capacity with all the abilities to deal with enemies of every calibre. The game punishes as much as it rains down riches upon you, the player. Keep your eyes peeled and your hands on your keyboard or controller, 'cause there's plenty of things to do from killing to talking to throwing out junk to getting blown up by that one annoying trap to crafting MORE gems to discovering an ancient ruin of a city to getting rejected by that one hottie of an elf. Don't ever trust the game to hold your hand; take what you get and give nothing back.  Copious praise aside, there were a few factors which tripped over and otherwise pleasant gameplay experience.  There were bugs galore, from broken quests to broken npcs to missing items to items stuck in your inventory. A few of the colour palettes used were neon-nized to the point of frying the rods and cones in your eyeballs. There was so much story in the form of books that if you were to read all that AND read the npc dialogue AND run around looking for treasure, you'd be in the space age before you finished. The skill slotting menu and subsequent settings metres were broken in that they wouldn't move when dragged. Lastly, THERE WERE ONLY 2 DLCS ;_______________;  I first got this game when I saw Youtuber @SSoHpkc playing it and it looked fun as hell  It really was fun as hell.  BUY IT
823	1	a	This is a really good game with many story lines to follow. And depending which path you choose to take it will always lead to you completing the game I have spent many more hours than quoted on my steam account since I have the game also on other formats due to enjoying it very much well worth its full price. I do believe the DLC well worth buying also since it opens up many more hours of game play and interesting plots to follow. The one thing I do say to look up the alchemy and other crafts for recipes needed throughout the game. It is an easy game to complete if you are a seasoned gamer but still has enough to keep you interested for many hours. I hope you get all the enjoyment I have had whilst playing. It is also one of those games where you can play through and after several months later play again and still finds things you missed before. I have made many characters and enjoyed each one. The only bad point is your toon does not actually use her voice even in cut scenes which is a little annoying but that is like most RPG's
825	1	a	Great game, i have this game in my library pretty much since it was released and never got to try it out, but a few weeks ago i found a documentary about the downfall of 38 studios and found that this game was some kind of test for much bigger tittle that never come to see the light of day (one thing is certain, if it was better that this one, its a shame that never got completed). Im doing this review now bc the game is on sale right now, im at 104 hour in game and didnt completed the game yet (but i usually do every side quest, look every rock and that kind of stuff but didnt touch in any of the dlc story yet, so my money is already worth while).  This game is kind of the Fable Lost Chapter with few diferent combat mechanics, many side quests to do, tasks, some story choices that turn things out for good vs evil, and a very well scattered Lore behind all life in Amalur, and believe me, so much Lore, backstory, insane amount of dialogs that you could build another story just was much was rich was this one.  The combat is satisfying but there are a few things to keep in mind and avoid to ruin the experience, never enter dungeons before any task told you to, to keep enemy at your level and avoid overpowered character early in game, you cant really do nothing outside of them bc after while, doesnt matter where, enemys are much lower level that you, but dungeons, always bring enemys to your current level. Tasks are a good way to get money or materials since they never end and you can always get the reward for completing them since the moment you accept them.  There are so much information to be found in the world, that if you like this kind of background story like me, you have so many hours to get entertainement out of it, and even that the combat sometimes get a bit repetitive, it doesnt really detach you from trying to know more about everything.
827	1	a	This game briefly felt like everything fable was promised to be by Peter Molyneux. I often fondly remember the fun I had in this game, lamenting that this is a story that will never be finished.   An heavily story driven, action hack and slash RPG, with some over the top, beautiful animations and spell effects.  If I had to equate this to something, imagine if Dragon Age met Fable.   Pretty good, definately worth a look if you enjoy fantasy games.
829	1	a	Extremely fun, so mad they weren't able to fix some things like leveling and even make another. If i was a millionare i would honestly try to get this game back on whole new levels.
831	1	a	Good looking combat, great writing/story (R.A. Salvatore) and a different kind of fantasy RPG experience. It isn't as immersive as the Elderscrolls games and can get pretty boring as the side quests design is pretty weak. Combat is awesome looking but does quickly become very repetitive. That said, for anyone looking for an easy-to-play RPG, KoA does a pretty good job at entertaining. If you're a fantasy RPG gamer, do yourself a favor and try this game.
833	1	a	Even within a few hours of playing it it has easily become one of my favorite RPGs to play. Play style isn't just a cast bar with abilites tied to your 1-10 numbers, it combines click action gameplay with classic RPG play styles. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys good stories with amazing combat.   Another thing that I would like to point out is the character customization beyond physical features. The game allows you to create the perfect character based on your details. Create a Shadow Mage, a pure Mage, or a Battle Mage. The game covers each possibility that you could think of when creating a class for your character. Best part is, you can respec at anytime.   Perfect.
835	1	a	Finished the game on PS3 and got all achievements (trophies), but didn't do every sidequest, some other things and never got the DLCs, so now I got it on here with all DLCs and I'm planning on doing everything.  It runs well, so giving it a review already since I already know the game quite well.  Amazing game and easily one of my favourites.
837	1	a	KoA: Reckoning is one of the most underrated, wonderful RPGs ever. DO yourself a favor, right now, if you haven't played this game yet and you like games like Dragon Age Origins, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher and Fable, buy this game and see that it does something that most modern RPGs don't attempt...   Some of my issues with other modern RPGs as of late are the 'build your own class'. I'm not a huge fan, because it ends up feeling bland to me. where as when you play a game like World of Warcraft, you pick a race that is so colorful and interesting, then you pick a class that adds another layer of flavor.  What KoAR has done is incredible, it allows you to craft your own class without shedding that flavor by using a system called 'Destinies'. It's a sort of Tarot card system, that allows you to hand pick between 3 major class types, mixing as you like and then you pick a card or Destiny that encompases your choices and adds bonuses to your choice to incentivise your picking a card that aligns with the ability choices you have made.   It's the perfect remedy to bulding a class without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, or the classes out with the player's handbook...   The story goes a long way to explain the gameplay which many RPGs fail to do. It has a way to explain character death and resurrection which i find very interesting and until recently many games have not attempted to explain, like Pillars of Eternity.   The games armor and weapon models are some of the most fantastic I have EVER seen!!! Not to mention the character models/designs, designed by none other than Todd McFarlane, have like many other featrues in this game, gone the extra mile by creating extreme detail to the characters anatomy, animations and movements.   The combat is VERY fun and fast paced. As you build your character up, you gain more and more moves and combos that all intertwine on the fly beautifully!!! You feel a real sense of power when you dispatch your enemies because ultimately it was you who chose this path of raw power.   There are a few things some players take issue with in this game, but for me the quality of the game outshines any small issues I might have otherwise. I know some gamers have issues with the cameras FOV and height, and I agree it could be better, but it is no where near the problem that could reduce my fun and also combat, if you are adept at games like Fable, Skyrim, you should set the games difficulty to hard at the beginning of the game because if I remember correctly, you can't change the diffiiculty after you start a new game, which is the only other odd design decision.  Otherwise, PLAY KINGDOMS OF AMALUR RECKONING!!!  Such a shame this company didn't sell the amount of games needed to keep this franchise going, with an MMO that was on the way, its an utter shame that this incredible fantasy world was created from top to bottom and no developer has come forward to save this IP!!!
839	1	a	This game is good, but could have been great. The first few hours, this game is a blast to play, until you out level everything. Once you out-level everything this game gets way to easy on hard settings. Also after you out-level everything your gear is way better than anything you loot from enemies (not rewarding).    So, why do I recommend this game? Because if you get it on sale you'll atleast enjoy 30 or so hours of it until you out-level everything and it becomes boring. The combat, skill trees, and the weapons and armor are really freaking awesome. I really wished they released coding for modders, this could have been my best game in my collection if I could've fixed how fast you level. There is one older mod for it to fix experience and gold while leveling, but it looks shady and you have to run the program everytime you play.    I'm not a dark souls fan, but also hate playing games were I one shot eveything. So I give this game a 5/10. I knocked off 5 points for bad acting and becoming strong than a God after 30 hours with no real incentive to contiue the 100+hour game.
841	1	a	Very Decent RPG  Silky Combat, Plenty of room for Customization and faffing about and a dizzying amount of things to do 110% worth its price tag
843	1	a	Similar to The Witcher in combat. Not as epic in scope as Skyrim but highly recommended none the less.
845	1	a	Really fun and dynamic game, though might be a bit too easy unless you play on hard mode. Would be nice if we can have companions like a wolf or such.
847	1	a	Excellent game! Like a cartoony Skyrim.
849	1	a	Now this is a game I would like to have back when I was a kid. dont really know where to start with it really. craphics remind of some good MMO games which works pretty well in this one, also combat is very fast and taking down hordes of enemies will take only a moment. or you can simply run from them if you dont have time to deal with them right now or you could not simply care less.  havent played it throug yet, but for these first few meters. I gotta say that I surely will. its fantastic game and its beauty is something to I really admire.
851	1	a	really like this game...... I have only one thing I would change,the clothes for the female mages suck ,lol. The citizens or npc have nicer clothes and or armor as in rathir. I,m a dude but i prefer watching female toons when im playing. I have put a few hrs in an almost all have been in their under garmets because they all look like tanks in mage armor, thick heavy and bulky yuk..
853	1	a	I guess the title Kingdoms of Amalur fits better than Fable: The good version.
855	1	a	Very good game with excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics, and top quality artwork and atmosphere. Even the full orchestral score (the music) is very good. It does not repeat endlessly and fades in for appropriate scenes and the right times to enhance the game ambiance.  I am not usually an RPG player (except for The Elder Scrolls series), but after watching some YouTube videos for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™, and because of the excellent quality and depth of this game, I made an exception. It was a gamble on my part that paid off in spades!  I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes single-player RPG games that are very high-quality.
857	1	a	 Honestly, this game is amazing.
859	1	a	Awesome story, artstyle and gameplay. Very unique skilling and character building options! One of my all-time favorites, sadly it's extremely easy which can make it dull at times.
861	1	a	Good, not great. God of war -esque combat system is the only real thing that sets it apart. Reminded me a lot of Dragon Age and Skyrim, which isnt bad.
863	1	a	Its Like Skyrim but with an actual story, engaging combat , and genuine quests!  8/10 get it if you like action RPGs. be warned though, its semi-Open world game.
865	1	a	Great game, definitely underated.   Story telling is brilliant (Salvator and his writting team does not disappoint), the environments gorgeous (McFarlane can do no wrong), and game design inspiring (much like Elderscrolls, but with tighter combat mechanics).  I would like to have supported this game when it counted.
867	1	a	Have just started and love it like a mix between the witcher and skyrim but far far better BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!
869	1	a	So I've played enough of this game to completely fall in love with it. The art style reminds me of an older style kind of xbox original game, which isn't a bad thing really. There are plenty of in depth quests to do and a lot of replayability without being bored out of your mind. Now my favorite thing so far, actually, is the weapons. This game posseses a unique array of fantastic weapons such as Chakrams and Faeblades, and there isn't one that comes out on top for performance, so you can use what you like without drawback, all weapons are just different styles of combat. The second most favorite thing about combat for me is the fateshift. When you build up enough in your fate meter to use a fateshift, you go into Reckoning mode and just own everything, ending it all with a finishing move that looks super badass. Definitely recommend 9-10/10 honest review.
871	1	a	The most epic, colourful and beautiful fairytale I 've seen. Enourmous world, a lot of locations and places of stunning beauty to explore,great plot, style and attention to details and history, yet at the same time without any boring and repeating stories. Along with the main story, there are a lot of !!!!!!! (a whole lot of)!!!!! different quests for factions and just NPCs. With 2 DLCs ( each as big as the main storyline) you can play this game for a very very long time. And this time you'll spend with a great pleasure.
873	1	a	You smash wooden crates for gold, 5/5.
875	1	a	I cannot rate this game high enough; totally overshadowed by Skyrim, this is a piece of roleplaying mastery. Not only is it visually stunning, the story is epic and draws you in to shaping the fate of an entire world - you feel like you make a difference! The combat is absolutely amazing, and really excels when using a gamepad; it's fluid and massively customisable - changing weapons and moves on the fly to produce dynamically open combos. One of my favourites of all time!
877	1	a	Another Great game/series cut short at the first chapter. Single player fully customizable characters to go whatever class/path you wish to create. Randomized map loot, all kinds of loot and qualities.   Only thing besides the story being cut short from its cancelled sequels is there is no ability to Jump.
879	1	a	Tons of fun!   Great main story and includes many fun side stories. The combat is very enjoyable, and has satisfying finishing moves.   Also included is plenty of customization options to define your character, race, gender, and fine tuned featurs.  The classes include your standard, rogue, warrior and mage, each with different moves and skills. Notefully, you can change your class at any time within the game.  This game pairs well with an Xbox 360 controller   
881	1	a	In KoA you play the fateless one. Basically, you start off rather crappy and everyone either loves you or wants to smash you to bits. :P The game is not difficult but is very VERY extensive with a deep lore..  There are just so many quests and side quests and tasks and stuff you could do, it some times gets kind of tiring to play. This makes the game very worth your money as it could last forever if you are big on quests on the other hand, you may get sick of the overwhelming number of quests and decide to dump it.  I have not completed the game as of yet, but I believe that it has great replay value just because there are so many weapons and skills you could try out. You could be a chunky 'warrior (might)' type or sneaky 'thief (finesse)' or sparkly 'mage (sorcery)' type or even your own special hybrid. This is really want I feel makes the game so interesting.
883	1	a	The combat is plenty of fun...,but lacks any compelling dialogue or story (this skyrim excels in). And again, combat is lots of fun. Try it if you love your rpgs.
885	1	a	7 bucks for a much better, more beautiful, pleasing single player WoW with the combat never getting old somehow? thats this. definitley pick it up.
887	1	a	A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.  1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the 'balance' I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.  2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better 'graphics', they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.  3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.  To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.
889	1	a	i recommend this game and i also forgot how to spell recommend for like 2 minutes even though it's on the page
891	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that is well known for its customization, while this is its most strong point, I would like to take the time to point out some of the other incredible things about this game.  While the story is kind of lacking in tying into the Lore of the world of Amalur, it does a fantastic job of being a gripping story. You will grow to love each and every character that you meet in the storyline, but there are some you will grow to hate as well. The Voice-Acting is superb, but the level designs are very hit or miss, some landscapes are beautifully crafted and are visually stunning, but there are some that are very much so lacking in beauty and are very poorly designed, that you'll have to empty out your vomit bag after you clear the area. HOWEVER, this are minor setbacks compared to what this game can offer for only 19.99$, I personally rate it as an 8/10, with it also being one of my favorite games of all times.
893	1	a	For 2 hours played.. I'm quite impressed.
895	1	a	A.W.E.S.O.M.E .... Just awesome.
897	1	a	Pretty fun hack n slash style RPG! Very beautiful landscape. I am in love.
899	1	a	its like al the sord n magic game i ever play in one but rely gud and fun 2 play
901	1	a	F-   I think this game is trash, as you can tell by my playtime of 111 hours.
903	1	a	An excellent RPG with tons of hours to spend on.
905	1	a	I wanted this game to be rly great after i saw all reviews, but for me it wasnt total blast in the end. You should buy it is still nice rpg, but I expected something more. The thing that kept me playing was definitely AWESOME Combat sytem. This is 9/10 combat, but camera wasnt that great sometimes but not a huge deal. I hate, that this game doesnt have FOV slider and i couldnt almost play it at original setting so i downloaded 3rd party FOV program (found it in community guides) which made my time with this game much more enjoyable. Also if you are fan of epic story and great storytelling you will be probably kinda dissapointing. Story isn´t awful, but nothing spectacular and storytelling in this game isn´t good enough to keep you invested in characters.  All things considered this game is worth trying if you are fan of action combat and want GOOD RPG (dont expect best RPG ever). PS : sorry for typos
907	1	a	Don't let my low game hours fool you. I played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox before I wiped it. [Slight Spoilers]  Pros: +This game lets you play whatever build you want to do.   -&gt; Do you want to be a Mage and surprise people by slamming them to the ground with a massive warhammer? Do you want to play a Rogue who uses Daggers for assassinations but can hold her own in normal combat by wielding a Longsword? Do you want to play a Warrior who's only goal is to destroy people in insane combos with a sword that's twice their size? If you answered yes to any of these, please keep reading.  -&gt; Each class has a set of weapons and armour associated with it, as well as abilities. A Rogue, for example, is built on skill points invested into Finesse and uses light/medium armour that gives bonus critical hit damage. Rogue weapons are the Bow, Daggers, and Faeblades. Their abilities are varied between sustaining mana to apply poison damage to all of their weapons to raining arrows from the sky.  -&gt; The Warrior class is built on skill points invested into Brutality and can use Longswords, Greatswords, and Hammers with the heaviest armour that improves damage resistence and blocking ability. Their abilities vary from an adrenaline surge to deal massive damage when close to death to lifting all surrounding enemies into the air and slamming them all down.  -&gt; The Mage class is built on skill points invested into Magic and can use Staves, Septres, and Chakrams with Robes for armour that help improve mana regeneration. Their abilities can vary from chaining lighting to summoning a meteor to crash down on enemies.  +Gives the middle finger to restricted builds with the Destiny system.  -&gt; You are not set to one way of playing the game. Just purchase a reset from a Fateweaver and suddenly, you can rebuild your character in their entirety! Go from a Mage in robes with a Staff and Septre to a hybrid Warrior/Rogue who uses a Hammer and Faeblades!   (Keep in mind that there are many abilities to each class and you can do more than one class, or even all of them at once if you wanted. When you level up, read up on everything in your abilities tab and decide how the game should work for you.)  +Super satisfying stealth gameplay.  -&gt; Say you were spotted by a Jottun (a reverse Dwarf as I like to call them.) You can teleport through them, throw a smoke bomb down, jump on their back from stealth, and stab their neck to oblivion only to backflip off as you watch them bleed out. It's not just the massive enemies that are satisfying to stealth kill! You can sneak up on a Bandit and in quick succession you can trip them, making them land on their back only for your character to cover their mouth and stab their chest. The sneaking mechanic itself is a little bit wonky but oh my gosh it's still amazing to assassinate half of a Tuatha scout party and have the last few left ♥♥♥♥ talk you only to get torn to bits by open combat; speaking of which, my next point is close to this one.  +Fluid combat system.  -&gt; My favourite build was on my character named 'Lorabella.' She was a Warrior/Rogue hybrid that used a Longsword and Daggers. In the span of a minute, she can roll behind an enemy in stealth, backstab them, and immediately turn to the other enemies that spotted her afterwards. From here she can toss a smoke bomb or use an invisibility potion to get more stealth kills, or she can hold a weapon's attack (you can only equip two weapons at a time) and use the charge ability to launch herself at the nearest enemy, starting an attack combo which kills them quickly. After that, she can block with her shield at the right moment to deflect an enemy's attack and turn it into a combo to kill them quickly. I could go on and on about how many different ways you can play the same game and still be satisfied, but I will spare you from that.  +Fateshifting.  -&gt; In a tight spot? Too many enemies and you just want to go to the next area quickly? Want to get bonus XP for doing what you already do to kill enemies? Just do it™  +Fast Travel!!!  -&gt; Seriously who doesn't like this feature?  Some cons:   -The game can feel very repetitive.  -&gt; Bandits, Fae, some Gnomes here and there, Jottun, Etten, Spiders, Kobolds, and so on. There's not much for diversity in enemies to face, some are just slightly different reskins of the base creature that does something different. See: Kobold Savages are Kobolds that throw their spears instead of try to poke you with them.  -&gt; A lot of the game's quests are a variation of 'go here and kill these things for me' and while the combat system is very fun, there's only so much that can be done before it feels like a chore.   -Short story.  -&gt; Excluding the time spent running to the new locations, the Faction quests as well as the main quests feel a little short compared to the size of the world given to the player.  (Overall, I would say this game is absolutely worth buying. I haven't gotten to the DLCs yet though I do look forward to it! I hope this review helped!)  -KEM
909	1	a	Awesome RPG game. Fantastic combat. Compelling story. Delicious visuals. Pick this one up while it's on sale!
911	1	a	Underdog detected :)  PROS  - Truly HUGE world. - An amazing amount of quests, a lot to do - Three classes with that play very differently because of their skills - High polish and optimisation  CONS   - Weird to say but the game is so huge that sometimes it can be discouraging :) But this is not really a con, mostly we have been playing short games for so long that we lost the attention span required to play a game for weeks. - Some of the lore can be boring sometimes. I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.  REVIEW  This is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.  I am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title.   I only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.  Some advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.
913	1	a	The game is well-paced as an action RPG. But, because it was formerly an MMO in development, the whole structure suffers, somewhat, from a multitude of bland quests. Later in the game I've noticed some botched up voice acting too. However, these are just the flaws put up front, the game itself is glorious in it's features.   The storyline also happens to be quite good, although the end is totally expected yet not disappointing in terms of combat. All things considered, the game is a long trek for completionists, one which I hope you will find enjoyable too.   Have fun!
915	1	a	Played the game for 6 hours so far, and it's really good. The gameplay is interactive and fun, storyline seems solid so far, with manny side quests (so far). The game is not super hard so far, but not easy to the degree where it's ruining the experience.   8/10
917	1	a	-I got suggestions from 9gag this game being one of the most underrated RPG. -I am not dissapointed in this game at all. It was a beautiful world and amazing RPG elements. I love crafting weapons and robes. -It has an amazing storyline and great side quests, not easy nor too tough. Just the right amount to make it interesting. -It has great faction stories, such vast expansion of cultures and traditions explained . -I love the way they talk, so medival.
919	1	a	One of the most under rated RPGs of all time. The heart pounding, action based combat, with wonderful, rich skill animations. The MASSIVE open world, plethora of side quests, and truly astounding dlc. The story is full, decision driven, and breath taking. Truly a shame the company behind went bankrupt, as it is now unlikely we will see a sequel to this truly astounding game.
921	1	a	You use x to attack ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
923	1	a	Its like the Fable we always wanted.
925	1	a	  I had this game on on my wishlist and my good friend bought it for me. This game start out as a good adventure in a new fantasy world and I was really excited to finally get started playing it. The first 20 or so hours were really enjoyable trip of collecting quests, beating down some monsters, and reading all of the lore. I made a point of finishing every quest. Hour 20 - 40, I had had enough of killing the same monsters so I tended to run through dungeons and monsters just so I could finish quests as fast as possible but I was still finishing every quest. The last 20 hours I was done with the game, I skipped everything that was related to an achievement or the main story and just slammed it home.  Pros Story is really good Combat is pretty fun but there isn't a lot of variability. 5 or 6 moves per weapon.  Cons I played on hard and the game was really easy. You will fight the same enemies all game. A lot of quests and items of note in the game are complete rips off of other games but only done half way.
927	1	a	Fantastic game, wish the studio was still around to give us more.
929	1	a	This game is the LoveChild of Skyrim and Fable. It acts a little more like it's father (Skyrim) and looks a little more like it's mother (Fable). But in all aspects of gameplay you can feel both of it's parents. I LOVE this game and I've only played for about an hour.
931	1	a	This is a great game and probably the only game im going to complete any/all sidequests
933	1	a	Slow to start, but I have faith in R.A. Salvatore's story writing skills. Excellent graphics and gameplay.
935	1	a	Hey there! Now right off the start I want to mention that although I only hve 26 hours on steam, I did indeed play this game on console for many more hours , and through multiple play throughs. I believe that if you like RPG games and whatnot this is definitely a game for you. And as for someone that beat the game 3 times I have enjoyed it all 3 times. Unfortunately though the 3rd time was actually a drag beating because I had to force myself to play since Ive seen all of the content. But even though that is the case, this game is definitely worth the money considering that it is a singleplayer game and only $20. So yes, I most definitely reccomend this game for anyone that hasnt played this game before because there is a feeling that I have only gotten out of this game. :)

939	1	a	It is a fun game with an intriguing story, lots of side-quests, that it does not end when you complete the main story(which is good). In addition, I encountered *no bugs* during play(which is *very* important in the era of bug-infested games) *and* it does *not* need a DRM to be installed to play(which was one of the factors to buy this game. I do not buy games needing a DRM after my HOMM VI fiasko). The optional EA registration during installation does not interfere with offline play and, although I could not see the 'skip'/'cancel' button during that, others have reassured me that it exists but I missed it.  Easy controls, nice class system, ability to roleplay your character the way you enjoy best and very flexible in giving you the chance to rebuild your character in case you feel you do not enjoy the choices you had made so far.  Not recomended to the hardcore RPG player but recomended to everyone else.
941	1	a	Imagine if Path of Exile met Skyrim and then met Assassins creed. This game is a gamers fantasy, seriusly! Purchase it, I only just got it, but from first impressions it is really fun. Good side quests, fun button mashing (with a lil skill) gameplay, and a diverse story.
943	1	a	Similar to Skyrim (and other Elder Scrolls games), but with an 'over-the-shoulder' fixed camera system that makes for highly intense combat situations. There are lots of options regarding weapons and moves; and the skill tree adds a layer of customization and flexibility to make the gaming experience a bit more personal. One of the reasons for the comparison to Skyrim is because, just like in Skyrim, you may buy your own home(s) to use as a sort of 'home base' on your adventures. My only complaint is that I wish there was a High Resolution Texture Pack (or mod) for this game because the graphics, while decent enough, have been directly ported over from the console(s), as far as I know. It would have been nice to have seen some PC-centric graphics options for this game. Overall, an epic adventure worthy of a fantasy lover's time!
945	1	a	The game feels like a more modern version of the first Fable game, and is really what they should have evolved into. The story is fairly straightforward, but does offer the player choices, and while many choices are one off events, your actions do change how NPCs at least talk to you or initiate conversations with you. The game does also have some interesting new fantasy ideas, like the Fae, an elf like race that lives by the stories they tell and are destined to repeat throughout their multiple lives.   Combat maintains a nice balance, with different playstyles being perfectly viable, and some fights will require preperation to have a fair chance of getting through them, but there's no major difficulty spikes. Basic crafting trees like alchemy and blacksmithing are included, and blacksmithing has a nice touch where you break down loot to make into other weapons and armor. The world is large and about as open as Oblivion, with only cities and dungeons having their own instances. And lastly, the graphics have a very WoW like feel to them, but far more technically advanced and nicer looking.
947	1	a	Spent SOOOO much time in this game... didn't want to leave. Never finished out all the achievements or even all the stuff for the dlc that I could have. Other games beckoned.  Graphics- decent Combat- decent Options- all right Crashes... happened. I've learned to save  Would I recommend this to someone looking to play something where they can wander a bit open world? Certainly. A good sale would sweeten it , did for me. Just watch out for the trolls....they have a mean streak.
949	1	a	The combination of rich lore inspired by Celtic and Gaelic mythology and the varied and engaging combat, I loved my experience in this game. I like the idea behind MMORPG games, but the execution falls short for me and the social component is more of a liability than an asset. Kingdoms of Amalur delivers on the promise of the MMO setting, and the ability to rebuild/respec your character from scratch was a great way to keep the experience fresh and engaging. While it doesn't warrant multiple playthroughs, once through gave me dozens of hours of fun and exploration. I just wish the player races had greater consequences.
951	1	a	It's like a linear version of Elder Scrolls if you've ever played one of them. Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a 'double layered' level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.  Perhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.  On a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.  Combat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.  I would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.  I would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.  Additional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game. If War in the North mixed with Amalur...
953	1	a	A very good alternative to Skyrim. I have had great fun so far, although the quests (as expected with a game of this size) do get a bit samey as the game goes on. Fun in small bursts and definately worth it if the game is on offer!
955	1	a	Best game ive ever played so far in my life cant wait till Bethesda make new games hopefully like this one

959	1	a	An unsung treasure that deserves a spot in every RPG fan’s collection.  Writer R.A. Salvatore created original IP for this game, giving it one of the most unique settings and characters of any RPG you’ll play. While the game itself is nothing groundbreaking Kingdoms of Amalur does it all well; the controls are good, the story is compelling, the graphics are solid, and most importantly, the game is just fun to play. One of the best RPGs to come out in the last few years.

965	1	a	Came for the combat system. Stayed for the open world. Yahtzee called this game 'My First Skyrim' He wasn't kidding. Over 200 hours in and im still not done! Had a ♥♥♥♥ing blast with this. Can not recommend this enough!   P.S. Hey Rhode Island if you're reading this, work out a deal with a publisher. Or just cut your losses and sell the damn IP already! We need mods ASAP!!
967	1	a	Best game ive ever played so far in my life cant wait till Bethesda make new games hopefully like this one 
969	1	a	I've spend about 2 hours or more when playing this game daily...because of side quest
971	1	a	If you like the idea of smushing Fable and Zelda together in a world so massive that you'll never finish all the side-quests, if you like GREAT action RPGs instead of FO4 or ES5: Skyrim's shallow, weaksauce bullsh*t, play this game instead. It is much, much better than either of those games will ever be with all their mods installed. Graphics? Sound? Gameplay? Plot? Writing? World size? All AWESOME.  There are some caveats: 1. Don't take every quest you run across unless you really want to do it. There are simply too many. 2. This game REQUIRES a controller. Works well with my generic XB360 controller. 3. There is no mod scene nor further patches beyond what's out there. The company tanked. 4. You will have to make an account for and log into EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t service. Steam handles it more or less transparently after the first time.
973	1	a	This a fairly generic Fantasy RPG, but it is very solid, the combat is quick and feels good to play, the main storyline took me 25 hours of playing to get through, not to mention the side quests and stuff I did along the way. Definately worth buying as it goes on sale freqently. The ability to craft weapons and to respec your class means you could mix things up without having to create a new character. Good game, if not the most unique or original.
975	1	a	great game
977	1	a	mostly my 2nd longest played rpg on steam first one would be skyrim unless you count ffxiv.  game is really fun and un-noticed by many gamers, you will like this game it has many hours of content in the base game plus many more in dlc content. side quest are fun to play and even give purple weapons exploring caves and killing monsters gives blue and purple at times. graphics are nice and have a fantasy feel to it the music is okay but can be better the combat has to be the best part of this game from evading strikes to using chain attack moves on farther away enemies, mages are my favorite class to play because they can call down giant rocks on fire and just wreck everyone. stealth is fun to play as to but not really needed with there were more classes to choose from maybe a demonology or summoner maybe even a cleric class :(. only thing that really pisses me off is the fact that everyone looks the same and the monsters get dull after awhile i mean skyrim had the same monsters spread out but you didn't fight them every 5-10minutes like in KOAR  i will still give this game a 8/10 because it has kept me playing it this long   doing this when i am tired so spelling may be off :/

997	1	a	Grabbed the collection bundle for $10 on winter sale and I've got to say I'm surprisingly happy with it so far. It's kinda like Fable meets WoW meets Skyrim. Worth a spot in any RPG fans collection next time it goes on sale.
999	1	a	I'm not good at writing reviews, I just wanted to click the thumbs up button for an amazing game!
1001	1	a	A simple game. Extremely repetitive. Has its charm or else I wouldn't have put 50 hours in it. Every dungeon looks the same, every quest is kill this or collect that, and the combat lacks any variety. But if it's on sale and you want a change of pace it's not that bad.
1003	1	a	Fantastic game that is overlooked by many. It's a simple game to play with responsive controls, quick combat and easy to grasp story. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I hope you do to.
1005	1	a	9.8/10 Gameplay 8.8/10 Audio and Music 9.5/10 Graphics (ENB Boosted) 10/10 Game Duration 8/10 Story Overall Score : 9.0 'Excellent'  Main Story Completion : about 30 hours Completionists Time : 120+hours  Positives: +Decent Story Telling +Side Quests are Decently constructed. +Loot! +Crafting System is very good. +Lore is everywhere. +Skills and Spells are downright fun. +Combat is very fun and Engauging. +Early to End game equipment all looks really good. +DLC extended and expanded the game EXTREMELY WELL.  Negatives: -Will likely never see a sequel. -NPCs were average at best. -DLC can make crafting too easy. -DLC mats are NOT droppable or deletable. (I used CheatEngin to expand my inventory due to this bug) -Not enough End Game Armor and Weapon types to craft.
1007	1	a	Fantastically underated. I highly reccomend this game and even more so if it's on sale. I only have 10 hours on Steam but I had 50+ on my old Xbox 360 copy.  Pros: -Great writing, the lore is deep and very immersive.  -The class system is really neat in how you can mix and match classes while still having the upper hand on your foes.  -Beautifully crafted world, the color pops and the art style is really nice.  Cons:   -You'll never see a sequal   
1009	1	a	What can i say..... its the best game ive played in for a while !
1011	1	a	This is an ok game not amazing but not too bad either. For starters this is made by EA and you need to always be online to play which is a pain.  Story:  The story is ok but very bland and not really interesting lots of stuff to do and places to go but very predictable and I pretty much knew what was going to happen to the end.   Content:  Tons of quests (I MEAN TONS)to do hundreds of hours of content but also many are the same and are not interesting I never really wanted to do any side quests because they were boring and just a pain. Also lots of enemy type but very overused in many areas. I personally had a problem with WOLF's are the ♥♥♥♥ing worst and a the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥ ever. Lots of cool places and seemed very inspirational and just cool too look at even if the game isn't the most graphical intensive game.  Graphics(How it runs): This game is not the most graphical intensive game ever and it is not hard to run and could be played on almost any PC. I have never crashed or had any game breaking glitches. There are some settings and you can rebind all keys. Plays well on keyboard and mouse.   Combat: Combat is the main point of this game or well the best part. I had fun fighting bosses and finishing them off was fun and satisfying as hell.  Misc: -Inventory is well done and you can put items in the junk section to easily sell if uneeded. -Camera is pretty bad and a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control. -Fateshifts are very fun and i loved finishing off bosses. -I was a Mage with my first play through and many items need you to add points to a warrior and I found this to be a pain and many good items unusable. -Level up system is well done and you can put points into any class. -Voice acting on everyone and is ok but the main character which seems off to me.   Its an ok game and I plan to play through the game again this time taking my time with it as a Warrior After I am done with this play through.  Final Verdict: 7/10 It's ok
1013	1	a	This is a great game, and I've had a lot of fun with it.   HOWEVER, something to be aware of is that the game studio that developed this game is no longer around. This means that there are not going to be any official patches for the game in regards to any bugs that you may experience, and there are some game-breaking bugs that make it impossible to complete the main storyline. For example, The Hunters Hunted mission.
1015	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, looks great and colorful, is fluid and responsive. Story is fine, it revolves around player quite much and there are lot of sidequests too. I'ts always fun to come back to this good looking world, good idea when you have some stress.
1017	1	a	Since it's on sale today for 4,99€ there is no reason to pass on this. Amazing RPG with good combat, story and graphical it's very nice.   The DLC you want to buy with this are: -Legend of Dead Kel -Teeth of Naros
1019	1	a	I love the world in this game and the combat is loads of fun. I recommend checking it out when you get the chance.
1021	1	a	Underrated RPG  I bought this game without any anticipations and for what it is I had a lot of fun, of course it's not the next skyrim or dragon age origins, but there are worse Rpgs to play than this. Although I have to mention it's still in a somewhat unfinished state, which is rather unfornunate :( because this game deserved more!  Lets get to the up and downsides of the game.  Up: - A big, open world with plenty to explore and varriang landscapes (lush forests, dry deserts, damp swamps, etc.) - Really intuitive active combat it has some elements of darksiders and devil may cry (you can change between main and secondary weapons on the fly, use magic and can string together long combos *although therefore I recommend playing with a controller) - Quiet unique main story and setting (you are being killed and revived and therefore being able to change fate itself and later you also get information about your past before you were killed) - Crafting system (you can salvage any weapon/armor, except legendary and sets and get parts to craft your own weapon/armor and name it) - Dialogue system (sometimes you are able to persuade people, if your skill is high enough and therefore avoid some encounters)   Down: - Tasks, secondary quest are pretty boring (many fetch and kill-x-of those quests) - Crafting system somewhat unbalanced (mid-to-late game if you craft your own equipment you will be pretty overpowered and will kill most enemys with one hit)  - All in all a little bit to easy espacially some boss battles which therefore were pretty anticlimatic xD (minigames to pick locks is pretty easy even with few points in lockpicking *although the dispelling mini game can go eat it man, even with maximum level I still have problems but maybe it's because I suck at those things xD) - Graphics are average there are some good designed places, but other than that not really outstanding (and little variety in the faces, you will meet a lot of siblings but who knows maybe the genetic pool in Amalur is not really varied, that would explain the almost lack of facial animations espacially the main character which looks as emotional as a wet stone ;D ) - Some bugs and exploits (due to the developer going out of business :( ) - Best played with a controller  All in all it's a decent game, it's a real shame the developers went out of business before they could patch out all the bugs but you still get get enough entertainment if you go into it without expecting the next RPG-Hit.
1023	1	a	You will find interesting when you play it more than 5 hours
1025	1	a	I have to be honest and say I didn't even know this game existed until Sony released it as a free monthly game on PS3 through PS+ I downloaded it to see what it was about but I was skeptical at first, so I downloaded the demo on PC to try it out and after about 2-3 hrs I enjoyed it so I played it on PS3. And it's a great game a truly underestimated game at that the combat system alone does it justice and I found it fresh and seriosuly I never got bored in going in to combat not once, because of the different style from swords, great swords, bows, daggers, faeblades and charkhams yes charkhams you can switch to many different styles because you can use 2 different ones for 1 button on your controller or mouse if you wish too.  Fighting with a great sword to switch to a bow or faeblades is just cool in my book the game has a stealth system and early on it can be good because you can get caught but downside is it can be over powering and when you have the skill at max you can be literrly facing them and they won't do anything. I don't mind that they can't see or hear you at higher levels but if they are facing you no matter what level you are I would prefer if they just attacked, Magic is also in the game you can use septers etc and have different kinds of magic like the usual fire, ice, thunder and poison to your weapons. Magic combat is ok it can be a little slow but again you can mix it up from a bow attack to ice or fire it's your choice and thats one thing I love about this game.  The world of KoA is very well thought out the forests at the start as vibrant and colourful to the plain barren deserts world it's got just about everything, characters of the world are cool as well but the voice acting is ok not the best but sometimes a game doesn't have to have the best voice acting to be enjoyable. I put about 70+ hours in the PS3 thats including the DLC as well the game is a great game to play it really is and I plan on doing the same for the PC version too, I would recommend in getting the widescreen fixer mod for this can be found in the guides section if you have a big montor the character in the console version has a better FOV in the PC not so good with out the tweak.
1027	1	a	I can definitely say this game is worth playing. Dont get confused by my steam hour count, I played Reckoning on Origin before I got it on steam. Graphics are really good, combat system is easy to learn and world is very big, full of quests and enemies. You are in for a lot of fun if you decide to give it a chance.
1029	1	a	In my personal view, Kingsdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has been the best Fantasy RPG I have played so far, even 3 years after it's release. It did not only fulfill my expectations but surpassed them easily. It is sad to think that this game was so poorly advertised and underrated that it actually cost a lot of people their jobs. This work deserves more. This world has been created with great detail and amazing imagination, the story is classic fantasy yet totally different. And the combat speed and effects will burn your eyes out! I always return to Amalur, exploring the vast landscapes is a treat in its own right and there are still so many missions and quests yet to master.
1031	1	a	its basically what fable 3 should have been..
1033	1	a	This is a great action RPG... no really, I mean that. Most ARPGs are neither good action games nor good RPGs. This is actually good on both accounts, the combat is actually fun and not a click-fest. The story is quite good too. It doesn't have a big brand or franchise behind it so it was a bit of a risk, but it payed off big time. Long game, lots of hours of fun.
1035	1	a	its basically what fable 3 should have been..
1037	1	a	This game is very under appreciated. I love this game, it's absolutely fantastic and any RPGer should get it. The main questline and the faction quests are the best parts and most interesting things about this game, and I especially love how completing some of the faction questlines will bring up interesting dialogue.  The thing I really love about this game is the fact that it's an adventure RPG with action oriented combat. That was the big reason for me buying this, and although the combat is sometimes finicky, I was not disappointed. A gem amongst so much RPG trash.
1039	1	a	Definitely a hidden gem. Lots to do, engaging combat mechanics, boss fights keep changing until the end of the game, so you do not just always fight the 'same' boss with similar mechanics. Amazing game, highly recommended.
1041	1	a	So bad, but so good. The story, characters, and lore of the game are at best forgettable, and at worst utterly nonsensical and irritating. The questing is SO BORING, almost everything is copy pasted with SLIGHT changes in who you get to face smash. The enemy variety is quite low, I don't think there are more than 15 different enemies that fight uniquely outside of the bosses, most of the enemy variety are just skin changes with better stats. The NPCs are very bland and uninteresting. Also, I don't know if it was just me, dispelling was super bugged. I literally could not unlock spelled containers with the dispelling game because it was so bugged, I had to crank dispelling so I could auto-unlock them.  On the other hand, the combat is SO GOOD. Admittedly, their archery doesn't make a lot of sense(THATS NOT HOW QUIVER WORK) but it is still really fun. You get magic, archery, and melee talent trees with different special abilities liberally sprinkled throughout (including Scorpion's signature move). The weapon augment system is kind of interesting, unless you get and finish the Legend of Dead Kel expansion and then you can just use your diplomat to farm the best augments and call it GG.  Overall, I would only lightly recommend this if you are looking for a good hack and slash game.  6/10 would Fate Shift that lone Boggart again.
1043	1	a	Great game, lots of fun!
1045	1	a	This game needed more knowing that it got. Its a sad story what happened the the game devolpers...  This game is creative, and has combat that feels good.   If you like fantasy RPGs, try it. Seriously.  10/10
1047	1	a	There’s a game you probably didn’t play. It came out 2 years ago, it’s a genuine epic, a vast, elaborate RPG with a sprawling story and vast numbers of sidequests. It features superbly in-depth combat, has huge variety in character design and levelling, and lets you instantly wander from the main plot and explore its enormous world to your own entertainment. It’s Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. By John Walker
1049	1	a	This is one masively underrated RPG in my opinion. A massive world full of people, factions, quests to do, places to explore and experiences to be had, it never received the due praise that it should have received.  Possessing a truly original and authentic story and set in a vibrant world, I keep coming back to this game for more. A non-linear leveling system that actually lets the player customize the game around their own playstyle, and a Fate system that allows for either further customization and giving the player a sence of accomplishment. I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.  For a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC. At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY. The demo includes not only the starter 'tutorial area', but after that you can take to the first zone for 45 minutes and do ANYTHING you want - quests, crafting, gathering, killing NPCs, whatever your heart desires.  I cannot say enough great things about this game. I wish everyone could get as lost in a single game as I did (and still do) with Kingdoms of Amalur.
1051	1	a	I'm having fun with this game, its only draw back is that it will use the same dungeon more then once for quests.
1053	1	a	This game needed more knowing that it got. Its a sad story what happened the the game devolpers...  This game is creative, and has combat that feels good.   If you like fantasy RPGs, try it. Seriously.  10/10
1055	1	a	I'm having fun with this game, its only draw back is that it will use the same dungeon more then once for quests.
1057	1	a	love the game. fighting style is epic, kind of like a cross between dynasty warriors and diablo and the game reminds me in a good way of sacred. would buy it again, and definitly when its on sale. was well worth my money :D
1059	1	a	An all round awesome ARPG. The worst thing I can say about it is that due to the poorly managed company behind it, we won't see any more to what could have been a longer lasting title.
1061	1	a	Prettier, more fluent, and less tedious than Skyrim.

It’s Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. By John Walker
1065	1	a	Sadly Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning kinda flew under the radar for allot of people until the reviews started popping up. This was mainly because of the terrible advertising that made this brilliant game come across as mediocre. To put KOAR simply it’s a Fable-like MMO style action RPG with rich lore, unique creature designs, an interesting story &amp; faction stories &amp; a brilliant character development system that encourages multi-classing. A little FYI a Ranger type Rouge with defensive &amp; buff Mage skills is pretty much unbeatable. It’s a very colourful game which is a nice change from the very dull &amp; dark designs of most games today &amp; if you are OCD about exploration &amp; completing every side quest this is a game that’ll take quite a while to complete, I have not even finished it yet &amp; as of this recommendation I have stacked up about 103 hours of game time. I recommend this to all fans of RPGs, exploration &amp; a good story &amp; I hope to see more from this franchise in time to come.
1067	1	a	Alright
1069	1	a	From what little I've played of this game, one thing is for sure: I wil certainly be playing it a lot more. The world is beautifully designed and quite a spectacle. The combat and gameplay are incredibly fluid, something I was skeptical about but was quickly reassured. The gameplay style itself is very unique, and it works very well. It combines an Elder Scrolls feel while playing like one of the Fable games.  The combat is more or less very close to 'God of War' and 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow', but you're always excited to get into a new fight. It's not a chore to battle your enemies, and the use of certain combos and combining skillsets make every battle a fresh experience.  The story isn't anything to laugh at either. It's quite interesting, even from what little I've played so far. I will be replaying this game many times after I finish it, just so I can create new characters and try out new combinations.   9/10
1071	1	a	KoA is going to be remembered not for the game, but for the complete collapse of the studio and the fallout from that. Which is a shame, because KoA is a decent game. Right away I'd like to point out, it's essentially Fable + MMO, all single player. Combat is generally quick and easy, quests are your standard fetch and kill fare, and the world is generic high fantasy. That said, it's also lovingly crafted and just flat out fun to play. Even on the hardest setting the game is easy, and as quick as I am to decry games being dumbed down, it can be incredibly satisfying at times to just tear through hordes of enemies. The skill system has some decent depth to it, as does the gear. The world is beautiful and the sound design is solid. The game can feel grindy, again, it's basically a single player MMO, but it's also fun if you're into that sort of thing. If nothing else, pick it up cheap for some awesome chakram action.
1073	1	a	Since I am bored at work And I'm tired of viewing screenshots from my friends, I decided to just review pretty much all the games I own ;D Yes... I am that bored...  Alright then, Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning is an RPG single player only, while you play you will get the feeling that since the world is so expansive, filled with life and Npc's it should have had an online mode or it should have been a FREE Online game.  To Describe this game in few words they would be: Immersive World, Quests, Magic, Fate, Medieval Style, Monsters and Hitting deers into space.  Ok, with that being sed you can picture what the game is like!  Let's start with the story, I was hyped about this game I remember seeing the trailers, how it had a guy who worked on the story of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, so the game showed great promise.  The game starts with the Story of the World, what's going on and HOW YOU DIED in the War the people of Amalur fought. You wake up in a pile of decaying corpses and make your way up from underground to the Tower, you then realize that the tower is under attack by the Tuatha Dehon ( The bad guys) who are immortal. As you go along you discover that you were revived by the well of souls and hence forth you are sent from quest to quest to find out what's going on.  The story telling in this game is average, the story itself is also average but the best by far in this game is the Combat System, fighting multiple units at once, with a fast paced system ranging from Bow, Hammer, Sword, Great Swords, Wands and the longer Wands XD. One of the best features in this game is The Fate power you get early on, which allows you to slow down Time and beat the crap out of your enemies and finish them off with an Epic and Awesome animations.  Since you died and were revived, you can now change your fate and that of those around you. Example: By killing the Monster X they will not have the children X they were supposed to have. That enables to player to change the world around him.  The Side quests are repetitive and meh, The Devs sed that to complete the game fully it would take about 300 hours. I object to that! I am 50 something hours in and and I have done every boring and repetitive side quest there is to do, and I'm almost done with it. :)  There are also interesting and vast Faction Quest Lines with alternate endings but in the End they just get repetitive as the side quests do. I get the feeling that this game could have been more than what it was, too bad the company went broke from debt but there is still hope for the KOA Trade mark!!   Also a pretty huge part in this game is that, IT IS TOO EASY!! you'll realize this like 2-3 hours in, you destroy everything in your way pretty much without dying. I can even challenge myself into Not even dying once while playing through this entire game. Thanks to the modding community there is a mod out there that makes the game harder to beat.  You can also craft armor, The skill system is quite vast, and there should have been Mounts in this game, I got tired of walking after a while.  And there you have it, my review for Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning if you are a person that loves RPG like I do you'll get over the fact that it's single player online and immerse yourself in the mythos like I did.

1077	1	a	It's a simple fun ARPG that was unfortunatly overlooked due to release timing
1079	1	a	love it. its like if fable and skyrim had a child this would be it. XD
1081	1	a	I completed the version from origin, completed xbox version and now it's time for steam version.  No. They are all the same. I just had to buy all of them. For my own sanity. No matter what, this game is still the best. Story is perfect.  Worst thing about this game is that there won't be more Kindgoms of Almalur in the future.   ...but I have a little hope...
1083	1	a	 It's a damn shame 38 studios isn't a thing anymore
1085	1	a	I wouldnt call this game bad, but not good either. Its an rpg that lets you skill what you want, in 3 skill trees. Missions are always the same, ala kill this or bring this, or collect this and that, but mostly they have somekind like a story or a background, and some of them are really interestening. The fighting system is quick, fast and based on blocking or dodging. It needs a bit of balance, since i think this game is too easy, and only enemys with much life are annoying because you need really much time to kill them even tough they dont give a threat. But the atmosphere, is fantastic. It looks like in a (bloody) fairy world. R.A Salvatore, made a interestening story,also reminds me some of the dragonworld saga from him. The repetetive missions and gameplay(you come into a new place, there is somewhat a problem, you solve it , or not, and advance further ) is the only thing i dont like about the game thats why its just an 'okay' game.  5/10
1087	1	a	This game is the ♥♥♥♥♥.
1089	1	a	An enjoyable, 3rd person, action RPG.  + The voice actors did a good job. + The writers did even better - NPC dialogues are wonderful. Metaphores, philosophy of life/death cycle, contemplation. + Story idea is refreshing,   it is as if there is a static story from a book, but then the strange element or 'you' is thrown in it. And, maybe you are not the only 'dynamic' power in the book's story...   + Nice combat with easy controls, with a bit of playing around you can combo things up. + Big game world, playthrough can be lengthy if you like to sidetrack.  - The world might seem a bit MMO-ish (but that is only because of our perception of things). Good part is, nobody can stop you from running to some dangerous areas of the game right from the start. - Too much eye candy - turn off post processing and enjoy the game.  ~ If you are a person that skips every NPC dialogue and 'rushes', you will find the game dull. ~ Recommended to play on Hard.
1091	1	a	This is a surprisingly good game. If you're into RPGs and you see it on sale, grab it! A controller is highly recommended!  My one complaint is that I wish there was more combat cause it's a lot of fun. I often want to jump right into another mob and just keep going. Otherwise there's a lot this game gets right. The quick travel is a great feature. I mean, who wants to spend hours just running back and forth. With this, you just click on points of the map and go. So much more to say, but I want to get back to gaming. So stop reading and go buy it!
1093	1	a	I love yjis game. Prettiest RPG ever. And I love the fighting system!
1095	1	a	Jumping with Dagger Class weapons thrue Enemys is alot of fun, even more are the Finisher xD. Would Finish Again 10/10  I got over 50 hours in Origin Account but wanted it on Steam too, stil had not time to play much xD.
1097	1	a	I have played quite a few rpg's before, and many of them I find amazing. This game being one of them. I'm not a fan of rpg's that contain difficult controls/require you to use every key on a keyboard. I find that the most amazing rpg's are ones that spend more time on story, characters, and immerse you into the world that the creators are portraying. So far I haven't played this game for long, but I can tell that it will be an experience I wont forget. Controls are easy, plot seems interesting, and graphics are a little outdated but once you get past that, this game is a lot of fun. I recommend this game to those people who love rpg's, and for those who are just getting started.   9/10
66	0	a	I was really looking forward to this game, but in retrospect I probably shouldn't have bothered playing it. This game wastes your time with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidequests at any given opportunity (and a boring main quest). However, the scenery is very nice in places and they did at least TRY to make interesting combat, but it becomes very repetitive after the first quarter.  It's definitely not the worst game I've played, and I can understand people enjoying it as a mindless time-killer, but I cannot recommend it.
67	0	a	I spent hours playing this game, hoping at some point that it would get better. Sadly it did not.  The action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.  The monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: 'Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart' in the end.   The characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot.   The quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into 'go here, kill 5 wolves, come back'   The plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.  And everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.  I literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.  The endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.  I did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.  I would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.
1099	1	a	fun game get lost in it sink hours into it
1101	1	a	Tight game. if you like story drivin solo RPG with well over 60+ hours, pick it up. I played this a lot on 360 and getting back into on PC.
1103	1	a	Very addictive!  If you want an old-school RPG with tons of quests, crafting system, player-decision-based story, and quick-reaction combat, this game is recommended.
1105	1	a	This game is like finding a precious stone among tons and tons of sand after months of looking for it. No, seriously, this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a very long time. Dare I say even better than Skyrim? Sure, the world isn't as 'open' as Skyrim, but the graphics are more colorful, it plays more 'actiony', and the story is richer. Nothing makes you feel more powerful or awesome than throwing a pair of chakrams and taking out all of the enemies around you.
1107	1	a	Think Diable meets Skyrim meets Witcher meets Fable.   Pretty solid game overall, only complaint is their camera can be abit off-putting at times
1109	1	a	This game offers interesting combat, customization both in terms of equipment and skills, with basic traits and abilities split and a world which is fun to explore with its multitude of colors. The game production values shine with some excellent voice acting, amazing environments and art, a rich story and lore, and a fitting soundtrack. The sheer magnitude of content in-game is astonishing, and worthy of praise. The world is huge, there are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The fast travel system is handy and the world map very helpful and easy to navigate. There are so many things the game does right like the faction storylines, item management, combat, great looking world to explore, dungeon sizes, two world style re-skilling, etc. It does feel like they took the best western fantasy rpg ideas and put them together in one. There's also a day-night cycle that impacts NPC/enemy activity as well as adding some pretty environmental effects to the lush environments. You can buy houses to store your junk, restore your health, and allow makeover options, and these residences can be upgraded in a variety of ways. Theirs a lot of crafting in the game, whether it be blacksmithing, sagecrafting, or alchemy with sagecrafting being the most unique and interesting. The combat is well suited for this type of game and is ever changing, with every level and power you gain, and it allows you to learn different moves with each particular weapon, allowing you to essentially create your own combos when you mix in spells as well. The hybrid skill trees allow you to combine the classic mage/warrior/rogue combat styles with one another to your liking. The classes are well executed and each allows a different gameplay. This is one of the strengths of Reckoning: the experience is flawlessly fluent whatever you want to do as the controls remain simple yet effective. This is an excellent game for those who enjoy a well done story, and pretty good combat.
1111	1	a	Amalur is a brilliant game to get lost in. I found myself wandering the world embracing all the unique landscapes of regions in Amalur. The aesthetic and colour to the game is magnificent, and I always found myself appreciating the variety of regional areas the game had to offer. Each has it's own lore, story, quests and tales, beautifully dictated by the lorestones scattered about the world.  Lorestones are superb, and I found the voice acting brilliant for specifically the lorestones. Although it lacks in dialouge and it is apparent that many voice actors were reused for several character, which I understand due to the vast world Amalur has to offer. There's hundreds of unique NPC's with unique dialogue to keep you interested, and Amalur never lacks in conversation with NPCs from region to region.  Each region is unique, but I feel like I need to elaborate on this more. Every place you go to has it's own unique story and urban legends, many containing quests pertaining to these. Some of my favourites and ones to look out for are Canneroc (a spider infested town, with a strange woman at cause) and The Red Marches (a strange cult has swooped in and slaughtered an entire town, why.) These are just two instances of what makes Amalur a great game and examples of the hours of content you can obtain from it.  Another thing is that the lore is huge, and you have to earn it. Lorestones are the main source of knowlege throughout Amalur, although their are quite a few books located throughout the world containing information also. But Lorestones are convenient and a nice addition as you don't need to read an in-game book and pause for a few minutes to learn something new about Amalur. You also get a small bonus for completing a 'set' of lorestones, which encourages you to learn the full story.  Then there's the combat. The combat in Amalur is so fast-paced and exciting, with so many combos. I love it. I played as primarily a warrior on my PC playthrough, but I remember how satisfying been a mage was in this game, which is what a lot of games tend to miss out on. Also, stealth didn't feel that overpowered for once, as, while you could one shot normal creatures, been undetected the entire time was hard to pull off.  Amalur is not without it's flaws though, as their are many bugs in the game. Especially quest bugs, such as dungeons respawning as soon as a quest is finished...while still in the dungeon. This can potentially break certain quests or bring characters you've just completed a quest for to their untimely demise. Another bug I ran into during my PC playthrough is that audio would cut out during Reckoning mode, and stay that way occasionally. Only a restart seemed to solve this problem.  Another problem is that the main quest is pretty drab, The main quest has it's high points, but the entire premise is cliche (you're the only one that can save the world, you're the only one who can control their own fate, save us all!) But, I found the characters quite likeable, but I felt like they could of been fleshed out a little more. Amalur kind of feels like an MMO with the tons of quests but very little fleshing out of characters. It feels as though everyone is insignificant to you, which I guess they technically are if you think of the main quest plot.  What amazes me about Amalur the most though is how it can appeal to all sorts of players. When I originally played the game on XBOX all I cared about was the combat and the boss-fights and all the unique weapons and armors in the game. But when on my PC playthrough I took the time to learn about the story of each region, and the overall lore of the world. This made me appreciate the game a lot more, but made me realize that Amalur can appeal to both the casual and hardcore loremaster players that are attracted to modern RPGs.   Amalur somehow makes a blend of fluid combat, an expansive world and interesting lore to appeal to the adventures, fighters, and scholars in each of us. And it's  fantastic. 
1113	1	a	If WoW, God of War, Skyrim, Dragon Age and Fable had an orgy, this is the product. 10/10 A force to be RECKON with.
1115	1	a	MMO fantasy experience for people that have no friends.
1117	1	a	I love this game  it has a good crafting in game  you do not have to stay as a wiz or ,,,,,,,,  you can mix and mach as you go throw the game 
1119	1	a	I adore this game. Ive been playing RPG's for years. I think aiming for 5 million sales for a first game is a little overreaching , even if its good, their aim should of been a million or so and then make then ext one even bigger. Elder Scrolls didnt get hugely successful in its first games. The expectations were just to high for this for a first game of an unknown franchise.  I enjoy the fun of the combat, i enoy the story archs, the wonderful IRISH flavour of the universe. The Winter and Summer Fae are a fantastic concept and all the villages and towns and cities in the game are beautifully realized, that still leave a little to the imagination.  If you are seeking a fun , action rpg, that has a wonderful in-depth fictional Irish fairy tale type story, to sink your teeth into , this is great.
1121	1	a	Excellent game, essentially a better Fable.
1123	1	a	One of the best RPGs I have ever played, but gets to be very easy and sadly, the studio that made it has been shutdown.
1125	1	a	This was a lot better on ps3. A poor port.
1127	1	a	People don't think that this game be like it is, but it do
1129	1	a	I love this game. It's just too bad not a lot of people know about it. It wasnt a popular release which is unfortunate. On the offside tho, this game has a great story line, smooth fighting mechanics, over 200 hours of side quests, and two DLCs which I have to try after beating the main story. The game has beautiful art work and amazing scenery. I highly suggest people play this game. If you like Skyrim and other freeworld RPG's then you will have hours of fun wth this game.
1131	1	a	Loved this game and it held my interest for quite a while. I played it before it was available on steam, missed it, and just had no choice but to get it again. The play style is fun and very easy to get used to. I love how customizable the play style can be with 3 different trees to choose from (Warrior, Sneak, or Magic) each have multiple paths to follow as well and you can mix several of the trees as well and make a magic using warrior if you'd like.  The story was good, and held my attention throughout the whole game (which is rare). Plenty of side quest, crafting and lock picking were fun.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone
1133	1	a	very good fantacy rpg, looks are good too. gear and classes and skill points are all great for customizeing your cherector however you want.
1135	1	a	AMAZING Action RPG. Combat is satisfying, story is interesting and everything is far as heck away from everything else.  Don't get me wrong, i love this game. BUT everything is a LONG hike away. There are also only certain points you can use to drop from higher levels to lower ones (AND NOT BACK UP). Everything feels unnecesarilly far away, so be prepared to stare at scenery bc you'll be doing lots of it. STILL worth playing the fun parts though!
1137	1	a	Back when this came out I played the demo and bought it for 360. Played the holy hell out of it. Just picked it up on sale and am repeating. The game is fantastic. Seriously. Such a shame that it will exist as a one off and no follow ups will take place. The world is interesting, rich, and gorgeous. On a meta level the game reminds me of playing an mmo solo but with combat that takes certian elements from the arkham games while adding in a nice dash of strategy to how you go about things. On lower difficulty your build wont matter a whole lot but increase the difficulty and you can find yourself in a bit of a pickle so pay attention to what loot you are getting and how it factors into your way of playing. If I had my play times from the 360 version I would reckon I have spent 200+ hours on the base game and its expansions - which you should also buy because they are every bit as good as the base game. My only real issue is that there is not more DLC. I need more of this game. Strage situation seeing as EA published it and they would milk the ♥♥♥♥ off a tic tac toe clone if they could. Strange times.
1139	1	a	awesome game with great combat . slight camera issues and too many caves 7.5/10
1141	1	a	A hidden gem among the RPG games that are overshadowed by heavy hitters like Mass Effect and Skyrim.
1143	1	a	Great game. Own it on steam and Xbox.
1145	1	a	this game suck ! such nostalgic iwanna back in time was this game release :(
1147	1	a	if u are looking for a good RPG then you found it
1149	1	a	A nice game with a great storly line. It's been a while since i've played such a well ''made'' RPG based game. With a lot of customizable content - the game offers users unique ways to make and build a character, upgrade and define a gameplay stile. It laks the all important multiplayer feature, but overall - a good RPG title that i truly recommend.
1151	1	a	Wow wow wow... this game is amazing!! Why haven't I heard of it before? Bought it on sale on a whim, and absolutely love everything so far. Must spend a whole day playing and emerse in this world. ^^
1153	1	a	So underrated. So much fun in combat. It has some faults, especially near the end, but it is fun, versatile, and the story is great. If you see this on sale, pick it up. Bring a 360 controller.
1155	1	a	Very simple but still fun game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
1157	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™, when I first read about this game before it's release it claimed it would be a Elder Scrolls killer but as some people many know that it really wasn't that case. The game has good and bad qualities about it. Lets start with the story, the story isn't a strong point for this game and is pretty generic for an RPG and after you play through it once, playing through it again is something you just seem to want to avoid, though the concept for the story itself was pretty good.  The Combat. The Combat is this game is in my opinion better then Skyrims, in Skyrim I just felt like I was just whaling on people like some untrained warrior, but in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ it felt a lot more smooth and just flowed a lot better and some enemies I needed to learns some of there moves and time my dodges right to either take no damage or at least not suffer a large blow. It is true that after a few hours the combat can become a bit or even entirely boring as you will have a solid tactic to spam with crowds, bosses or big creatures.  'Fateshift' is basically a super, nothing can really stand up to you when your in this form and the final kill animation is great and the fact that there are many make it so it doesn't become boring that quickly, though I found that in my later level Fateshift was something I always had and clould eaily build up but I never used it as I found no enemy challenging.  The World. Kingdom of Amalurs world is extremly nice with a good colour palette, though the game is a bit aged right now it's still a great world to explore and just look at. The characters were very well Voice acted and it was nice to have everyone in the game have a voice instead of just text, well I say everyone what I mean is everyone but the character you play as, he/she is a silent protagonist and it really seemed to kill some of the games immutation as people who you talk to seem to express something to whats going on and to what you just said while you just seem to stand there with a blank expression of nothingness on your face not give a sh*t.  The Classes. Now I enjoyed the class system in this game, I found it to be better then Skyrims as you can't get to the point were you can level up every tree (I'm talking without Mods) you have to choose to either focus on one tree and become a Warlord, Nightblade or Archmage which means you master all the weapon and gain the top tier abilities. You could go into two trees and become either a Blademaster, Shadowcaster or Champion with these sorts of builds you don't reach the top of either trees which means you don't gain the top tier abilities. You could go into all three trees at once and become a Jack of all traits person or as it's named Universalist, which means you're gonna be getting mostly the basics of all the trees. The classes themselves some with different effects and stats themselfs, to boost damamge or Mana regan per second also the Shadowcaster class had a poison blink ability that replace dodge. The class system in this game makes choosing a class to strive to a did more hard as you know how far you will go in the trees.  Side Quests. Side quests could be both good and bad, in some you just be fetching something and in other you would be exploring caves and dungeons, so overall I find the side quests to be like every other RPG a combination of good and bad, with some being fun and interesting and other being dull and pointless all together.  Crafting. I only went into Blacksmithing and made some of my best gear it was simple to do and rewarding still, but for the other crafting options in the game well I'm not gonna say anything about them, not because there bad but because as I said I didn't go into them, I soley did Blacksmithing.  The DLC. You have 2 DLC's not including the Weapons pack, these DLC's are Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel, both DLC's never seem to improve the story but are good for higher level players to get good gear and fight enemies the same level and sometimes even higher. Teeth of Naros. Honestly I didn't enjoy this one to much, the combat was sameish and the story was just something I didn't pay much attation to as it didn't interest me. I'd give this DLC a 5/10 as the story isn't so great that it kept my attention but the fights were good as you faced a new selection of enemies and got both good armor and gear from it, but when I finished the story line I was gone from that DLC area. The Legend of Dead Kel. I enjoyed this DLC more the Naros, the story was somewhat interesting and the combat was good aswell and with the addition with the Keep that you get which honestly was great at first, after a while you start to feel a bit detatched from it as the pets you get and raise just give you a stat increase and then are in a corner of the Keep, you don't get to take them outside the keep nor can you have them walking with you in the Keep. You also get a Scavenger who will find people in ship wrecks who will become something in your keep and get you closer to the end of the Keeps quest line, but after you find everyone you'll send him out sleep for 24 hours and get items and then repeat and if he says he lost the bag you'll be dealing with a group of bandits you can easily cut through to get Items to sell, gets boring after 2-3 trips there. There are other people who do different things but you'll find that the only person you'll use in the end after you've done everything in the keep is the Scavenger guy because he gets you items to sell and make more money that you don't need because you've got the best gear but because why not. I'd give this DLC a 6/10 the story is somewhat good and the combat is still good but the Keep seems to both be it's strongest and weakest point as when you first get it you;ve got lots of things to do but it runs out in the blink of an eye and the Keep is just something that you have.  Overall I enjoyed the game, it had it's flaws and wasn't close to being an Elder scrolls killer 8/10 Rating from me
1159	1	a	Quite a good game. Nice movement sets for the characters. Rather too much sidequests.
1161	1	a	Good game :) make sure to play on hard mode 1st playthrough as it is hardly any different to normal
1163	1	a	Graphics are a little dated but an extremely fun game
1165	1	a	I loved this game. The battle system is fun and i liked the story.   It has A LOT of sidequests (but thats a positive to me). I explored every dungeon, every city and did every quest i could find. The key to enjoying it is to take your time exploring the world.   If you try to rush through the game, you wont like the experience and will probably get bored long before the end.   
1167	1	a	A highly underrated game, in my opinion. I honestly wish I could find more RPGs like this one.
1169	1	a	Recommended, as long as you run Widescreen Fixer to give yourself a more zoomed-out camera / wider field of view. The default is waaaay to close for my comfort. If you're looking for an RPG where choices matter, look elsewhere - I completed nearly all the available quests, and I can count on one hand the number of them where you actually had to make any decisions about how to complete them, and maybe... one? where there was any sort of fail state if you picked the wrong dialogue options. If you just want something where you can kill dudes while traversing the overworld and dungeons, perhaps while listing to podcasts or otherwise multitasking, this is it.
1171	1	a	This is the case of a game that could have been more and falters to stumble to a unremarkable finish. The concept of the game allows for free class shifting allowing a wide range of combat playstyles to be changed often but the quest themselves are fairly rotuine for the fantasy genre. It is however my personal feeling that where the game fails most is in providing an endgame to care about. The climatic battle of the game is comes well before the final boss who is introduced in name but fails to engage as a plot device and dies mere seconds after appearing, the final zones provide nothing that you haven't seen dozens of times since due to poor level pacing you most likely hit max level several zones ago. But you''ll notice I still recommend the game, despite these drawbacks its still fun to play if taking for what it offers. Picked up on sale it will easily provide enough to make is worth the price and that's really all a game needs to do.
1173	1	a	This game is incredible. I have over 80 logged hours playing this and more when I was offline. I don't often replay games but this is one that I do all the time. It was hard to stop playing it until I beat it. But with so many achievements there is always something to do even when you complete the main quest.
1175	1	a	Amalur is a well-polished game with it's base game being extensive, easily offering up 40+ hours of gameplay and up to 70+ if you explore all side quests. Its colourful, with well scripted dialogue, some unique combinations of standard fantasy concepts without being too aggressively unique, and placed an interesting spin on the undying character (with an idea as interesting as Assassin's Creed's Animus). However it fails to maintain interest during the late game as quests and challenges become all too easy, leading up to a disappointing ending that would have been far more interesting if it had more impetus. Boss fights are also poorly executed with a variety of standard RPG tactics being utilised, and no unique inventive ways to challenge the enemies provided. Many of the Bosses attacks, have been done in previous games before, not a problem if you're new to the genre, I suppose, but problematic for 3rd person action RPG veterans.  Amalur does provide an interesting levelling and skills tree progression, that allows for limited customisability, but does shine in its simplicity to understand, and ways to play around and discover effective combinations of skills from its three separate progressions. It's most definitely a fun game to play and waste a few days on, but won't offer much depth either in combat or narrative, so will always be a rather dismal second to its far more developed and innovative competitors.
1177	1	a	very fluid fighting and interesting rpg elements.
1179	1	a	Great rpg...super easy control really nice game
1181	1	a	Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur is a really enjoyable action RPG. This game looks great, has awesome combat, tonnes of loot,weapons,armors, abilities and skills to customize your character with. The DLC for this game is worth getting and adds to the many hours that it already takes to complete this massive game. The only cons I can see for this game would be the jittery camera movements and some of the minor side quest can be rather dull. All in all however, this is a great RPG to pick up.
1183	1	a	Kingdoms of DMX: Shrekoning is quite possibly the best game in the ghetto.
1185	1	a	The game feels like an abandoned MMORPG. Lame fetch quests, hard difficulty is not hard, just time consuming. Monsters have too much HP yet they can barely hit you. The combat is fun and animated well although gets boring fast because of the stale pace of the game. This could've been a classic RPG if they tried a bit harder. The characters are plain, the plot is somewhat generic, the game has zero depth. Maybe co-op could've saved this game but it's only single-player. 5/10
1187	1	a	It's really insane how overlooked this game actually is. It should be up there with titles like Fable and Dragon Age, and yet I have rarely seen anyone bring it up in fantasy RPGs discussions. Great maps, stunning locations, captivating storyline (both the original game's as well as the DLC's), good voice acting, beautiful OST and replay value.   
1189	1	a	Very nice game and beautiful scenario worth buying it and its always excited to finds rare item and also unique set pieces in this beautiful open world RPG highly recommended
1191	1	a	It says i have 2 hours but i've racked up 70+ hours in offline mode (i played this game during internet shortages etc), and boy. Was. It. Fun. I had alot of enjoyment doing the finishers from the reckoning mode and that made my day that massive bonus exp.  Its got its own pros and cons such as -Rather Small world +Vibrant Colours -Creatures get repititive +Great Combos, and I Mean GREAT. Combos. -The DLC Weapon and Armour Pack is rather weak, as it's more of early game. +The Two other DLCs provide an additional 3-4 hours of content, and rather interesting stuff too, i'd probably like it more if they also added additional races, that'd be sweet.
1193	1	a	Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, if you're into RPGs. The story is interesting. The game has excellent character customization with no preset classes and the ability to reset your character at any time for a small in-game fee. Combat is fun, though this is where the game feels somewhat like a console port. It's different from most games I've played, but it's fairly easy to get used to. Once you get out of the first area, you do not need to worry about money. This game is a loot fest, and you will soon have more gold than you know what to do with. Experience is the same way. I did most of the side quests and easily hit the level cap (level 40). I recommend getting the DLC, too. They provide completely new areas with new quests and story arcs which are fun to play through. The bottom line is that if you like RPG games, pick this up next time it's on sale, and get the collection version with all the DLC.
1195	1	a	To its core, kingdoms of amalur is a MMORPG but not MMO. Quest spread around the world, massive in scale and length. Not extremelly versatil in the combat aera though many weapon are available they sometimes feel the same in your end. Regardless the art style mass scale and variety of the environnement makes this rpg a very good one well worth your time.
1197	1	a	This is the kind of game that fits me like a glove and can really get into! If you like the Elder Scrolls series or the Zelda series, you will probably like this too. Very expansive environment to explore &amp; lots of gameplay time available. I love long treks in freshly crafted robe &amp; plate mixed gear on my mixed class wizardly cleric who sometimes whips out elven ranger style blades when the going gets too thick or when a beefy giant resists my meteor fireball spell &amp; my ice staff too. The art style is highly colorful like WoW. I recommend faeblades and chakrams as maximum versatility backup weapons. This game even has shields for wizards called talismans. They have a magic energy field about the size of shield but with a slightly different unique shape.
1199	1	a	i recommend this game to all my friends its a really good game to play
1201	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos. The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.
1203	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
1205	1	a	loved it on the xbox was able to buy at a good price with all the dlc on steam.
1207	1	a	It says i have 2 hours but i've racked up 70+ hours in offline mode (i played this game during internet shortages etc), and boy. Was. It. Fun.

1209	1	a	Recommended. It's a solid RPG. The art style bugs me a little, there is an amazing about of lore in the world (Fueled by R.A. Salvatore), it can be a bit of a hack fest and it pretty easy, but It's worth at least one playthrough. It's one of those games that's on the edge as far a opinions I've encountered: a good 50/50 of like/dislike, but no outright hatred.
1211	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos.

1213	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
1215	1	a	This game. This company. Oh the potential. RA Salvatore created a wonderful world. The developers did a good job of making it feel large and alive. But all of the money issues... they are gone now. We will never see a KoA Online.  Let me start with the bad. The difficulty? Too easy. The DLC was letting players pay to effetively add power (at least the preorder DLC I had). I never understand why players want to effectively pay money to use cheat codes. And how developers started deciding that that would even work. But it is common now. The story? Mediocre... oh the world is wonderful but the story... well it is not quite top tier.  The good. The combat is fun. The character customization feels nice. The world (yeah I keep saying that). It could have made a great MMO but we will never know.  The devs just spent too much money, took on too much debt. I still recommend this game when you see it go on sale. But just remember that the team is gone. Don't expect an expansion, more DLC, or even more patches. I feel that $30 is a bit steep but at half off I can definitely say give it a try.
1217	1	a	This game had me hooked in 5 minutes! I love the story and the lore surrounding it. It helps make a more cohesive story. All in all a great game that deserves way more credit, 9/10, you should buy it.
1219	1	a	This is one of those games that i picked up from blockbuster back in the day on a hunch. turns out my gut was right this is one fun game that has alot to it. I didnt have downloaded content at that time and in a week barely scratched the surface. this game is worth a look at if you are into rpgs and well games that have alot of content to them with the abiltiy to build your character your way since as far as i seen it doesnt matter how you build it
1221	1	a	Nine hours, first play!...I just couldn't sop! Great fun and no complaints other then it is an EA game...  It's been on the shelf for like two years in my inventory and today finely took it out for a spin. Man, didn't know what I had!  I play on a pc. Mouse and keybord work fine. Not sure how it would work on a console. No bugs encountered from what little time I've played, read some negative reviews concerning this issue though.  A little corney but I rate this game 10/10 anyway.
1223	1	a	The minds behind Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning are certainly cultured in the world of fantasy RPGs. Ken Rolston brings his pedigree (and some Bethesda alumni with it) having worked on both The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and its successor, Oblivion; while accomplished fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore breathes life into the world of Amalur, creating a 10,000 year history for the developers at Big Huge Games to pull from. When you factor in the fantastic art design from Todd McFarlane and the enthralling backing from retired baseball star Curt Schilling (yes, really), it’s easy to proclaim you have a veritable dream team of talent for the genre, and the exciting precedence for a new IP to really blossom.  Reckoning starts off on the right path, even if its beginnings are fairly derivative. Upon creating your character using a fairly limited creation system, you wake up amongst a pile of festering, rotting corpses. You were previously dead yourself but have since awoken: a successful lab experiment and the latest in a long line of video game protagonists suffering from a contrived bout of amnesia. Before long you discover you’re quite the unique prospect in the land of Amalur: one without a pre-determined destiny. This is a world governed by fate, its residents able to visit fortune tellers to see how they’ll end up; left to live their lives on a decided path. Only the Tuatha – an evil race of elves – are able to be resurrected once they pass, so the fact you’re the first non-immortal to do so has shifted the balance of the kingdom and left you without the burden of a preordained life – a blank slate ready to be crafted.  Not only is this a superb premise for the narrative that unfolds but, as you can imagine, it also factors into the gameplay and character building. There are three archetypal RPG classes to choose from: Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue) and Sorcery (mage). Each presents itself with different skill trees but you’re not asked to pick one, singular class. Instead, you’ll dump points into different active and passive abilities on each tree, allowing you to mix and match classes. This allows a fantastic amount of freedom and variation as you’re able to craft a skill set of your choosing, perhaps mixing together Finesse and Sorcery to create a stealthy magic-user, or combining all three sets together to reap the rewards of a well-rounded jack-of-all-trades.  Depending on what path you choose you’re granted with multiple destinies that provide you additional stat bonuses. So if you choose Might you may find increased damage multipliers or supplementary health, while someone combining both Might and Sorcery may receive a bonus to elemental damage and improved mana regeneration. It’s a meritorious system that encourages experimentation, the lore endorsing re-specialisation if you want to try another path.  Of course, that will come down to how you want to play Reckoning. Each class brings with it its own set of weapons, from longswords and giant hammers, through to daggers, longbows and staffs. Their over-the-top designs provide a sense of personality, while more unconventional weaponry like the chakrams and faeblades offer a welcome change of pace from the more regular fantasy tropes.  Whichever set you choose you’ll find a simple one-button setup. There are no elaborate combinations for increasingly complicated attacks (whether you’re using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad), instead you’ll time and change the pace of button presses to execute different combos. It’s easy to pick up and play and there’s a nice fluidity to the way it handles, allowing you to go from using a staff, to slicing guys up with a pair of daggers before switching to a variation of magical, elemental attacks. It hits hard and is very satisfying; Reckoning‘s bevy of diverse enemy types requiring a smattering of dodges, blocks and counters to stay out of trouble. Crowd control is often the name of the game, facing off against big and small foes; magic-users and straight up brawlers. It keeps you on your toes, the game’s loot-driven nature repeatedly throws up new weapons to starve off any sense of tedium.  It’s the side quests that invoke the greatest sense of apathy – and even implicate the combat in some major ways. Along your travels you’ll encounter an overwhelming amount of quest givers; your map quickly filling up with blinking lights like it’s Christmas at Rockefeller Centre. This cluster of side quests and tasks offer little but middling content despite their increasingly high numbers. Collect x amount of items or kill y amount of enemies; it’s unimaginative and provides a stark reminder of Reckoning’s MMO beginnings (and its future), drudging up mundane and repetitive quests to pad out the content. None of it is compulsory, of course, but when a game is stacked with 200 or so quests, it would be nice if some of them were the least bit enjoyable.  If you do decide to partake in any number of these quests then there’s also a real threat your character will over-level, negating any sort of difficulty the combat once had. You’ll often find yourself fighting enemies with grey names, indicating they are no match for your combat prowess; it’s a wonder they don’t flee in horror at the sight of you. This seems like a major oversight, particularly for a game as action-oriented as Reckoning is. The combat may be fantastic but it’s still relatively simple. If you play too many side quests the formula becomes rote, and that simplicity just can’t carry a hundred hour game. Reckoning may be a loot driven game, but no reward is worth the banality the side quests offer.  Fortunately, the main quest line and faction quests are eminently better. Your character may be an emotionless entity, but the rest of the writing and voice acting elevates the narrative’s quality. There are branching storylines, interesting and set-piece driven combat scenarios, enjoyable boss fights and plenty of exotic locales.  For the world of Amalur is a large place with distinct areas for you to explore. It doesn’t encourage exploration as much as something like Skyrim, instead opting to funnel you down corridors between much larger areas; but it’s a vast game world with plenty to see, the art style shining through despite its poor draw distance and some low-res textures. The desert area provokes an oddly befitting Wild West vibe with its orange hues and rocky mountains, while the wide open plains of Erathell are transcendent with their use of space and colour. Reckoning might not have the graphical fidelity of some of its counterparts, but its bright colour palette, excellent art design and smooth level of performance is certainly an aspect to be lauded. The orchestral score helps too: it’s often riveting, inciting a sense of enchantment and wonder, beckoning on your adventure. It’s really phenomenal throughout.  The same cannot be said for all of Reckoning’s many parts, however, but there’s an enjoyable game here with some interesting ideas – providing you stick closely to the main quest line and faction quests. The drabness and profusion of the side activities is too big a dampener to ignore, especially once it significantly impacts the gratification of its combat. If you treat Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a shorter, story-driven experience, you’ll have a much better time of it than the completionist who chases every single side quest.    Recommended 
1225	1	a	i recommend this game to all my friends its a really good game to play
1227	1	a	This game is great, pretty heavy actually but who cares the game is well made, nice graphics, smooth gameplay its interesting because its no like some games where u pick a class and its the almost the same as the others in this game the 3 set of skill or abilites that u can choose are unique they all have their own style, on each skill tree u can choose diferent type of weapons which u can use to create a lot of unique combos. The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.
1229	1	a	Awesome game, have some great battles in it, love the lore of the game fighting is quite fun and always looks awesome although its easy combat really, but for any fan of RPG's get this must have game its a gem!
1231	1	a	Fantastic RPG. Its like a cartoonish Elder Scrolls game with a better fighting system. Very easy game to get into.
1233	1	a	This is one of those games that i picked up from blockbuster back in the day on a hunch. turns out my gut was right this is one fun game that has alot to it. I didnt have downloaded content at that time and in a week barely scratched the surface. this game is worth a look at if you are into rpgs and well games that have alot of content to them with the abiltiy to build your character your way since as far as i seen it doesnt matter how you build it
1235	1	a	loved it on the xbox was able to buy at a good price with all the dlc on steam.
1237	1	a	One of my favorite games of all-time. It's a shame that the company was so horribly mismanaged that a sequel will probably never be made. The state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations has a large chunk of money tied up in the IP, and refuses to let go of it.  Curt Shilling brought animator Todd MacFarlane together with master story writer R.A. Salvatore to create what I view as one of the greatest RPGs ever created. If you can pick this one up on sale, definitely do. It's pretty long and has some replay value as well.
1239	1	a	Fantastic RPG. Its like a cartoonish Elder Scrolls game with a better fighting system. Very easy game to get into.
1241	1	a	I got this game the day it game out on 360. It is one of the best game I have ever played. If you can get it on sale do. If you miss the sale and have the money and don't have it yet..get it. I have only ever played with a 360 controler so can't speak to the KBM controls. The combat is fast. And once you get the hang of it yes it can get ez. The DLC is fun and worth it I think. The added gear from the none story DLC is way OP so I would only use it if your having a hard time. O and play on hard.. there are Mods but I have used none. The base game is a rock and is what I judge all other action combat games buy...anyway play it.
1243	1	a	This game has to be my all time favorite. It has a vast and wonderous world to explore, and and an entire worlds worth of in game lore to explore made by reknowned author R.A. Salvatore. There are tons of things to do, so many quests to complete. Also it has a coveted aggression mode to toggle on. So. Remember that town that you were mad at. Wipe it of the map. Or not. I don't judge. The combat system is very good so it has a very gratifying feel to it, and is well 1v1 or 1 vs an army of trolls (but decidely harder then -_-). The DLC adds so much to do as well so I would highly recommend getting it as well. It also has a beautiful musical score. This game is worth going back to play agains to experience it from all possible angles.  11/10 would unsuccessfully woo blue elf that stalks you throughout the game
1245	1	a	Picked this one up on sale back in June for $10 (game + all DLC). If you're looking for blockbuster material, you won't find it here.  The story is excellent and the lore to back it up equally great. So if story driven stuff is what you're after, you should enjoy this. For me, it was the sole reason I went ahead with playing it to completion.  The main problem is the graphics and gameplay drag it down badly. I've been talking about it in passing as though it was a 2006 release because frankly it doesn't look as nice as Oblivion, then just noticed it has a 2012 date on it. OK.  Gameplay is very very MMO-ey, and as it turns out there's a reason for that. It was supposed to be one at one point but got downscaled into a single player game. So yo have lots and lots of combat action and loot grinding going on.  The two DLCs were actually much better than the main game too, though that could be because I'm partial to content that gives me castles and keeps to build and upgrade :P  Over all, worth it when it's on sale. I'd not pay the full $40 for the whole collection though.
1247	1	a	Great RPG but the fact that it is a console port hurts it. The controls and interface could have been done better in the PC version. The combat is very satisfying, though.
1249	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a 2012 single-player action role-playing video game developed by Big Huge Games and 38 Studios, and published by Electronic Arts.   Before this game was released, it was touted to be designed by a former Bethesda Game Studios veteran Ken Rolston who had worked on the award winning Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Famed fantasy author R.A Salvatore created the lore and backstory for the game's universe and the artwork was done by Todd McFarlane who is famous for his work on the Spawn comic series. 38 studios itself was owned by former baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who was known to be a very avid video gamer himself.  With such big names behind this title, how is the actual game itself?  Sadly, it can all be summed up in one word: Average.  Graphically, while the game was done by Todd McFarlane, it looked nothing like McFarlane's signature style of bold colours and harsh artistic lines. In fact, the whole game looks like a Fable clone artistically. While the locations can look quite nice at times, it gives an overall 'Been There, Done That' feel. Especially for players who have played Fable.  Gameplay is also extremely linear. Every location in the game, every dungeon feels like a corridor. While the game gives you an illusion of an open-world, it never really is. You will be stopped by invisible walls, can only travel on certain allowed paths. Its so restrictive, that your character cannot even jump, and can only leap off ledges at certain designated points.  In every RPG, story is quite possibly the most important aspect, and surely a story by famed fantasy writer R.A Salvatore would be something special? Well...not really.  While R.A Salvatore tries to craft a very intricate universe with lots of backstory, most of it can only be found in lorestones, books and you actually need to go out of the way to read them to understand the lore behind it. I don't know about you guys, but video games aren't novels. I'd rather EXPERIENCE a story thru gameplay myself rather then read one when i'm playing a video game. The over-arching main story quest is also quite generic, and is actually rather short with only 13 quests in total. None of the characters are particularly memorable and there aren't any plot twists.  Now I wouldn't have minded if the main quests were full of depth but they simply are not. Most of them just directs you to go to a specific location, kill someone and rinse and repeat. If it isn't a search and destroy mission, NPCs will actually ask you to go to 3 completely different areas on the map to do basically the same thing before you trudge back to the NPC to continue with the story.   Considering there are no mounts in the game, you can understand how tedious it was to travel on foot to repeat the same thing 3 times. This is obviously used as a cheap way to artificially lengthen the gameplay time. Luckily there is a fast-travel option available, but you can only use it if you have been to the location before. I never once used fast-travel in an Elder Scrolls game, because each location in that title is unique with lots of explorable locations with interesting quests. With this game however, I was so bored of the generic story of the main quest and boring fetch quests type sub-quests that I fast travelled whenever I could.  With that said, the only saving grace of this title is the combat which is absolutely brilliant. Combat movement is extremely fluid combined with beautiful animations makes combat a joy to play. It doesn't matter if you choose to swing a sword, use a dagger or cast a spell. All of them have unique and cool animations and are a joy to play with. It almost felt as if they spent all their budget on perfecting the combat but neglecting everything else that makes a RPG special.   This game adds a unique 'Reckoning' mode for combat which is a mode you can activate to go slow motion ala Matrix style after accumulating enough to fill a meter to dispatch multiple enemies with flourish that will net you extra experience points. The game will go into a QTE mode where mashing certain buttons can net you even more experience points. While its cool to go all Matrix style on enemies for the first few times, the novelty does wear out after your 50th 'Reckoning' mode and it quickly becomes just another way to farm Experience Points.   As I come to the end of this review, I feel that you should know that this was the only game developed by 38 Studios before they filed for bankruptcy. 38 Studios is no more. This also means that the future of this IP is in doubt. The last I read back in 2013, there were no buyers interested in this IP Franchise when they were doing an auction to sell off their properties. Do not expect to see a sequel or anything Amalur related anytime soon. (If ever.)  Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10 An Action-RPG with excellent combat mechanics but with little ambition. It doesn't try anything new and gives a very average overall feel to the whole thing. Worth a look though if its on a very deep discount.
1251	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Not quite skyrim, not quite WoW; somewhere in between, and I love it!
1253	1	a	Great game, reminds me of Fable when i was playing it. Only problem i really had with the game was that you could not change your 3rd person view distance and after awhile it can make you rather dizzy, aside from that this is an excellent game far worth the money its sold for. Sad that we are never going to see the sequal to this game in the future.
1255	1	a	I fell in love with this game at first sight, I saw that it would be like one of the older RPGs, except it had its own ring to it- it isn't some sort of hack and slash or ping into random places sort of game, its a game that once your in, your mind is the key to your role, specifically, you have the power to chose exactly how you're going to play you're part of the game, whether it be a classic staff &amp; spell, sword &amp; shield, or dagger &amp; bow, the game does not force your class on you, instead, you may be a hammer wielding thief or a chakram throwing warlord. The leveling tree in this game is spectacular, you level up, choose what attribute you want to level up, and then ability points that allow you way to carnage wreaking moves that can turn the tide of war. Another thing to this game is it's graphics, although they may not seem the 'best', I can assure you they're beautiful in their own fun way, it makes me think of the Fable series' artwork, where everything would fall into place perfectly with all the wonderful scenery within the map. I would love to name more, but there are a lot of things-small things- that I like about this game, and eventually I'd ramble on like I am now, so without further procrastination, I will end this review now...wait no! ..... yea now...
1257	1	a	This game just feels so good! This game has it all!  MANY different combat styles (great magic, melee, sneaky, ranged, massive 2H's and more!), crafting, good (not great IMO) story, amazing word, great graphics, great variety in zones, weapons and monsters, good optimization and just a lot of depth to it! Feels like the only thing missing for me is a co-op option for this game :D  Especially with the very frequent sales on this game this is one of the easiest recommend I can make!
70	0	a	This isn't a bad game, its just not worth your time.  The best way to describe it is like an awsome MMO from the mid 2000's with nobody on the servers.  The main story is good, but there are SO MANY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fetch quests that just eat up time and you have to do some of them to be an appropriate level to beat the game. There almost all terrible.  The ONLY way I could reccomend this game is if you are an unemployed gamer (no judgment) and want a large amount of time for you buck and don't mind sacrificing gameplay.  If you have a good internet connection I reccomend any good MMO over this game. It will scratch the same itch but better.
1259	1	a	I r8 it 10/10 mates.
1261	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Not quite skyrim, not quite WoW; somewhere in between, and I love it!
1263	1	a	THE most memorable RPG I have ever played. This game combines the best of my RPG favorites such as Fable, Warcraft, and Elder Scrolls and marries them together beautifully. The immersive and diverse environments will constantly make your jaw drop. The graphics, scenery, and storytelling are fantastic. Before buying this again on Steam I had previously owned a copy that I sunk hundreds of hours into. I bought it again and chose to revisit it for nostalgia. A fantastic RPG for anyone that enjoys rich combat, deep customization, and the freedom to truly play the way you want to. 10/10.
1265	1	a	This has everything a good RPG needs, AND the fighting is awesome.
1267	1	a	Single player mmo... kinded like any mmo people play nowadays minus goldfarmers.
1269	1	a	True gem of a game that was seriously overlooked on release! Despite my extreme dislike with EA products, I found this when it was on sale and decided to give it a try... it is very well made, the story is immersive and the combat is intuative. The world is huge and I found myself wanting to explore every corner of it! Of course that same OCD meant I had to finish every side quest before really moving on, and I did find myself a tad bit over-leveled from about halfway thtough and on, but most people (the non-OCD ones anyway) shouldn't run into that problem. The DLCs actually felt like they added to the game and not the typical 'add-what-should-have-been-there-for-another-15-dollars-because-f**k-you-we-are-EA' kinda way xD
1271	1	a	5
1273	1	a	I LOVE IT!!! I don't usually write reviews...but for this game... well...I Just freaking love it.
1275	1	a	Pretty amusing game, moderate replay value.
1277	1	a	I remember playing WOW back when it was fun. This right now is better then that ever was.
1279	1	a	A fairly unsung RPG in its own right, not sure what I haven't heard that much about it. Nabbed it, plus the DLC during a major sale, getting it all for 10$ though it's certainly worth the full price of admission as this will take ~40 hours or more of your time.  The game feels like a mix of Fable and the earlier Bioware games such as Mass Effect, Jade Empire, and Knights of the Old republic, though it's a shinier variant of all of those. It has the aesthetic and music of Fable but with a Bioware-esque RPG mixture.  It's not a complicated game to be sure. The dialog doesn't affect much of what you do and there are no companions to fiddle around with.  I'd certainly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of all the other games listed and have played the rest of them to death. This will be refreshing.
1281	1	a	Very Good Everyone Should Have Played This.
1283	1	a	It's like fable and dragonage had a child  PROS  Beautiful design and environments neat gear and weapon designs interesting story and lore a super vast number of side quests very cool skill combos and fight style variations very well done skill try and class management  CONS  Repetitive af with tons backtraking ending up feeling like a chore. Had to start rushing just to see what happens in the main story. Sidequests and guild quests are ending up the most boring thing. It's nice to have a huge quanity. But varietion start feeling way too poor very early. Invisible walls in an open world design. It's not too bad, but it's a bit stupid some times.   It's recommended. Especially during special offers.
1285	1	a	One of those games that will pay off if you're an fantasy rpg gamer. Its cheap and will guarantee at least 200 hours of gameplay,  it has an incredible class system that allows you to create all kinds of mix class characters,  beautiful graphics (fable style) and more or less interesting story line (side quests are a bit repetitive but quest rewards are satisfying)
1287	1	a	This seems not to be your typical hack &amp; slash, i very much like the senerie (graphics). It is definatly giving my fingers a work out trying to remember the key map but i find it very fun.
1289	1	a	This is a very good game, with a lot of options. In fact, it's so big and deep that the game becomes overwhelming. It also gets repetitive very fast. Fighting enemies gets dull. You have a plethora of moves you can unlock as you level, but in the end, a short 3 hit combo, block hit and dodge are all you need to survive. Weapons like bows or two handed weapons become redundant once you can craft your own items with god tier gems. Daggers, with their speed are the only choice as all the enhancements are +X per hit, instead of scaled or % increases.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game and go back to it every so often. With an art design between Fable and WoW and a combat system reminiscent of Devil May Cry (minus the focus on strung out combos) it is incredibly fun for short bursts. The Combat is fun and takes a while to reach the repetitive droning that I stated earlier. There is a large variety of spells and skills, but weapons and armor are pretty much able to be maxed out just around halfway through the game.   Note if you want a challenge, top tier regen gems and life/mana leech gems on weapons should be avoided. The only downside here is the lack of variety for enemies. Most enemies are beefed up/palette swapped versions of enemies you encounter early on.   The world is huge, and the lore is pretty deep if you take the time to find it all. The Lorestones are impressive in their stories, and the bonuses they provide are generally useful. But there are TONS of Lorestones. Trying to find them all is tedious even after getting the upgrade that reveals EVERYTHING on the map. Which leads me to the last point: the Jack of all trades approach is not only good, but generally preferred in this game. The rewards at high levels in this game (where your classes are determined by which one you want to be and qualify for) are far above the high level rewards for any other classes, IMO.   This game is a good play, but due to some repetitive (if fun) combat and quests, it only gets a solid 7 of 10 from me. You should play it, especially if it's cheap. But don't get obsessed with 100% completion.
1291	1	a	If you try and play this after playing the Witcher 3, you're gonna have a bad time...
1293	1	a	The gameplay is very good and fun to play with the combination of weapons combo. The story is kinda meh, i feel lost after i got out of the first cave and the story does not really followup like the opening story which got my hope highs. The most fun about this game for me is the killing npc modes, idk whats it called, its really fun watching those guard helplessly fighting me with bow and sword. Overall its a good game.
1295	1	a	This is Skyrim with better combat.
1297	1	a	In Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, you get not only a fun, dynamic action RPG, but you get a meticulously crafted world created by R.A. Salvatore. A blast the whole way through, although admitedly not challenging in the least.
1299	1	a	Its like skyrim without skyrim 7/10 was not op enough
1301	1	a	A severly underrated game from a short lived team (Big Huge Games). If you're a fan of action RPGs then this is worth the money.:)
1303	1	a	A really good action Rpg that gives you tons of loot, tons of builds, and tons of awesome.
1305	1	a	DISCLAMER: I have about 100 hours logged into the console version, so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I hold the controversial opinion that maybe, just maybe, THERE ARE GAMES BETTER THAN SKYRIM. I also hold the opinion that this game is one of them.  It does so many things better than Skyrim, and many other RPG's in general:  Pros:  -Fluid Combat that is just right. Everything flows so well, and it's not hard to control.  -An engaging story. They had a proffesional fantasy writer, R.A. Salvatore, help them with the story , how could it not be legit?  -A large world that you can easily be lost in.  -The DLC has a good quality, providing a good 15-20 hours of gameplay per expansion, of which there are 2. They might as well be there own games.  -Expansive Side-Quest lines that will take up most of your time.  Cons:  -The character models are...something.  -Mediocre voice acting here and there, you'll be able to tell which accents are fake.  The game and all of its DLC is $9.99 right now. There is literally no reason not to get this game.  
1307	1	a	The Game Is Godly!!!!! My only Grip was the hit box you would have with Some Enemies. It seem not matter how much you dodge they seem to hit you anyway. I lost myself in this game, I really wish this game was still running to day. Customization was decent the gameplay was fulfilling other Fantasy open world rpgs need to kill themselfs, a blood Sacrifice to ressurrect this game.
1309	1	a	Yes it is has good as the video. Ignore the demo issues, the finished game is good.
74	0	a	Boring game. Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names. Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors. Dont waste your money, even if its on sale
1311	1	a	a nearly solid action rpg games...
1313	1	a	A well done, underrated game with a great gameplay. 9.5/10.
1315	1	a	i am enjoying playing this but the small amount of classes and races seems to bore me quickly.
1317	1	a	I reckon this game is fun, if the map weren't so gosh darn huge.
1319	1	a	A must play, visualy outstanding and a great but short story line. also, if you want to have fun but the difficulty to at least high and don't cheat!
1321	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. Hundreds of hours out into the ps3 version. Now playing the even better pc version. A must buy. just bought the DLC (teeth of naros, legend of dead kel) and it adds a significant amount of hours of gameplay. you'd be a fool not to purchase this on sale.
1323	1	a	***** Highly recommended. Spent a riduculous amount of time in this game (think Fallout)
1325	1	a	The game reminds me of the Fable series. There is a mass of side quest and the story seems interesting so far.
1327	1	a	Great game, Criminaly overlooked
1329	1	a	***** Highly recommended. Spent a riduculous amount of time in this game (think Fallout)
1331	1	a	one of the best RPs i've ever played. a big world, tons of quests .. looks great, and has its own feeling.
1333	1	a	one of few rpg games i enjoyed playing.. greet story line and good fighting system , i love games which enable u to make ur own talking script and equipment .. any one loved (Dragon age ) games he must try this 1 ...
1335	1	a	one of the best rpgs
1337	1	a	its sooooooooo good game amazing mmo rpg so mush fun time ....you could spend so mush hours just on sidquest
1339	1	a	Love the overall impact of the game especially how the combat works. Gameplay is also good and also for the art!  Issue:  The game crashes after a few minutes when opened in Windows 10. I hope that this will be updated.
1341	1	a	Fantastic game. Sad that it will never get a sequel. The game studio was really talented, it just got ruined by poor marketing from EA Games.
1343	1	a	This Game actually got me away from afghanistan for 50(+) hours... Yea while we had downtime i spent away logged roughly 50 hours of steam recorded gametime. (I played alot more offline) While this deployment was in 2014 and it is now 2016 i figured i'd give it a review. Though the game seemed slow at first when i first bought it. It was colorful. It reminded me of the old days of world of warcraft. Well the colors the graphics and thats about it. Set in a diffirent fantasy world this game help revive my love for RPG's. The game had an interesting story line. You actually died? hmm interesting. I was hoping i'd get to stay my zombie self for eternity but eventually you just become more and more human again it seemed. With some awesome powers to change peoples Fate. Overall the game is good but had a lot of bugs and wierd boss fights which were enjoyable. Wish there was faster combat but there wasnt. And how to end this review on a good note... well i guess it was more like a story a story of a fate of a man who got lost in tablet screen playing this game on his downtime in afghanistan. (Yes i played this game on a windows surface pro.) 
78	0	a	Can not get this game to run. Forums are no help. Want a refund. No game should take this much of my time to fix.
79	0	a	After everal hundred hours of play, the movements of the character stalls, hesitates and locks up. I have removed this game and reloaded it without any improvement. I have reloaded flash player and shockave, no help. The other steam games I use still work properly, therefor the problelm seems to be intigral to this probram. HELP??
1345	1	a	Very underrated. Gameplay is fantastic. Story may be a disappointment.
1347	1	a	Fantastic game. Sad that it will never get a sequel. The game studio was really talented, it just got ruined by poor marketing from EA Games.
1349	1	a	right now this is my favorite game
1351	1	a	This is a game I have a love hate relationship with... when I get bored I tend to go back to this game... After playing it for awhile i tend to get fed up and move on to other things but its a very underrated game.
1353	1	a	5/5
1355	1	a	It is a world like no other, where you can lose your way but find your destiny. As rivals face off, kingdoms will rage war. Paths will be chosen, new fates will rise. Choose your destiny.
1357	1	a	The 'Teen Titans, GO!' of Skyrim.
1359	1	a	Swaggernauts KIngdom of Amalur:Reckoning review  Graphics: 9/10, this game has quite impressive graphics, nothing next gen but is still quite good  Gameplay: 10/10, this is what makes the game great, the combat is fluid and the world is fairly large, and i always liked searching for loot and exploring, there is also plenty of content 30 hours +  Storyline: 8.5/10, the story isnt anything to special, but these days not may are  Glitchyness: 9/10 This game runs quite impressively, with the occasional render problem and little to no lag this game runs very well even without a high quality computer  Overall: Kingdom of Amalure:Reckoning Is a very good game and i highly recommend it to fans of the Rgp Genre
1361	1	a	Buy it its worth it nuff said   10/10
1363	1	a	The only reason I got this piece of ♥♥♥♥ was because it was on sale.
1365	1	a	I got killed by a cow. 10/10
1367	1	a	Great, timeless game. highly reccomend if you like fantasy games
80	0	a	The combat is okay, but magic is straight up better than the rest of the trees (which are broken up by your standard warrior/thief/wizard) and while there is a 'lot of content' most of the side missions are repetative and boring. The people who give those quests are almost real people, but I feel like while there was all this time put into the world could have gone into more of the gameplay itself.  I can not recomend this for the current $20 price tag, and I wouldn't recomend it at a lower price tag. I would say there are probably better options out there, especially if you don't want to use a controller or are not a fan of bad camera.
1369	1	a	Fantastic game!
1371	1	a	10/10  Would like to jump again... oh wait nvm
1373	1	a	You know the best part is ... after play it i know i need to make a mod for this game.. ofcourse for myself  i hate when we change weapon the other weapon just pop out to the air.. we are a warrior not a magician xD  but this game well im not playin this game that long 'yet' but after play the prologue and mission 1 im pretty sure this game will give me same addiciton like Borderland 2 and Elder Scroll Franchise give to me   - ( not rated yet ) - ( read other people comment about this game ) - ( This game have a good graphic ) - ( but not have a badd ♥♥♥ enemy inside it )  
82	0	a	Well, this one is quite a hard one for me.   For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, 'Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?' And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours.   A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...  But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore.   Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.  So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game. If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.  Cheers,
1375	1	a	For those who cannot quite afford to get Witcher 3 just yet and are looking for something similar in style, this is a very good substitute. It is older and not as well written, but you can customize you own character and has very fun combat
1377	1	a	may not find a game like it.wished there was a sequal..
1379	1	a	It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pile of ♥♥♥♥ with terrible graphical fidelity, annoying character movement, poorly written plot, embarrassing voice acting, and repetitive and bland combat! 10/10
1381	1	a	Yes. Beautiful grphics, excelllent gameplay. Excellent replay value, with a very refined skill system. 10 out of 10.
1383	1	a	This is a great RPG. The only problems with this game are the voice acting and some quests. Its pretty obvious that Kingdoms of Amalur was designed with MMO in mind (before EA forced the devs not to make it an MMO). The voice acting in the game is pretty bad. It feels like the voice actors were pulled into the booth, and told to emotion, but none of them did. All of the voice acting feels forced and emotionless. Quests feel a bit like generic fetch and combat quests. However, this is made up for with the massive map and gameplay. Gameplay is fun and I feel that each hit feels powerful and fun. There are 3 skill trees to go down, a Sneak based tree, a magic based tree, and a warrior based tree. The game recgonizes that some people like to take all 3 trees, and offers perks for going down all 3 trees. The maps is massive, with loads of content to explore. The DLCs offer even more to explore and fight. However, I can only really recommend it if you can find a sale, and I don't think you should buy the GOTY edition. Stick with the regular edition, and only invest in the GOTY edition if you have spare money to throw around.
1385	1	a	If you lke RPG then I recommend this when it on sale.
1387	1	a	Cool story bro. DLC and ♥♥♥♥..
1389	1	a	Fun, a sort of Skyrim light. Neat stories and quests, but the voice acting gets kind of repetitive despite how good it is.
1391	1	a	this game is severely underrated. i felt like a jack of all trades beast when it came to combat. dialogue felt very stiff and life less and had me skipping tons of dialogue through boredom of the (mostly) deadpan voice overs. the powers/weapons/spells felt so perfect in combat that this game won me over right off the bat. the character customization is passable. the art style in the game overall impressed me and i enjoyed the fantasy setting. the game is honestly somewhat reminiscent of the Fable franchise, and if you are fine with those games then this is right up your alley.
84	0	a	-Did not keep my attention for long -World feels enclosed/empty and superficial (like playing in a giant bowl) -Combat-oriented; inappropriate/out of place hack-n-slash combat system for an RPG  -Felt reminiscent to a mediocre MMORPG without all the players (shallow quests, for instance)  +appealing visuals and aesthetics  +despite combat system feeling out of place, it is rather satisfying +skill trees presented cool abilities and freedom of playstyle; you do not have to spend points on a single tree to benefit  Final Verdict: I want my $5 back.
85	0	a	At first the game seemed to be fun. It was fun trying out different builds, character looks, weapons and magic. The quests were fun as well, in the beginning that is. But the fun pretty much stopped when I realised that the quest are all the same 'we have a problem, please do that and that' - so tedious and unimaginitive and boring. I mean the quest in Skyrim are so much better and IMMERSIVE. So combat system becomes a drag and a total bore after you get to Ysa (that how it was for me) and the difficulty is disheartening. I played on hard, yet it was a stroll. Boring. Don't mean to spoil the ending, but it was so ******* stupid and dull. The whole game feels so scripted you can't feel yourself immersed in the world of Amalur.  3/10
1393	1	a	Awesome yet underrated.  Pros: Combat System Beautiful Graphics Beautiful Scenery Short loading screens Lots of content Finishing moves are brutal Class freedom  Cons: Some quests are boring Might be too easy  Score 9/10
1395	1	a	1. Game is old but still enjoyable. 2. Got error 83 when first attempted to run the game. 3. Never could get EA to accept my account email and password. 4. Tried 3 times to download the game on ORIGIN but the download failed each time. 5. Game cost more on STEAM but at least the download works. 6. Will play the game for a bit before trying the DLC which must be purchased. 
1397	1	a	Go to  https://www.widescreenfixer.org/  and download this. The FOV in game is horrendous.  - Papa Bless
1399	1	a	I am better than you at this game.
1401	1	a	Great Story, Great gameplay! Best combat in a RPG I've Ever Experinced!  (Pitty the company went under, they had an amazingly looking MMO comming out)  If... you can get it to run for longer than 30 mins with out a Hardlock! (Just to clarify, i was having GfX issues)   Really Really fun game! 9.5/10!
1403	1	a	One of the best, despite being the easiest, RPGs I've ever come across. The combat system is basic and refined, it's not as twitchy as most other Action RPGs because it still requires a proper strategy when engaging enemies. The graphics are great, not too overtly realistic yet it's not as cartoony. Kinda reminds me of World of Warcraft, and for that it kinda makes me sad. Because I miss WoW.
1405	1	a	Great single-player action RPG. The respec and multiclassing system works really well.  Cons: Requires more graphics hardware than normal for a game released in 2012. Don't expect it to work on an old gaming PC just because it's an old game. A GTX 550, a mid-range card from 2011, could run the main game smoothly, but not the Teeth of Naros expansion.
1407	1	a	I can't wholly recommend this game, but neither can I give it a thumbs-down. The game is rather good-looking for its age, similar to and slightly better than Fable 3. The levels are generally bright and feature vivid colors that are a very welcome change from the dark palette so many games utilize. Gameplay, too, is much like Fable - there is some room for character development and loot progression, but it's mostly an action romp. If one chooses to do all the optional quests (many of which are rather boring), the game is fairly lengthy - I clocked more than 40 hours when I came to a game-breaking bug. Which brings me to my biggest complaint - no game of this depth and length should ever be released without some sort of dev console. At the point that I encountered my glitch, the only option was to revert to a saved game some 30 hours prior. Unacceptable. If it weren't for the bug, which I understand not everyone experiences, I would rate this game very highly. As it stands, I'm just not sure.
1409	1	a	started playing this game at 2 this morning. Gotta be to work in an hour. whyyyy?!!!!!!!!!!!!
1411	1	a	On sale, this game is a steal. An interesting RPG and great for the WOW player that likes to do thier own thing instead of waiting on others.
1413	1	a	Love it apart from the map interface.. the map and quest tracking sucks... will go more in depth later, but since it's on sale I thought I'd put in a few words. I recommend this game, even when it's not on sale. But since it currently is, there's some insentive.
1415	1	a	I love this game. Extreme skill customisation ftw. Be a mage! Be a rogue! Be a warrior! Be all of them at once! Made even more interesting with the card system, giving further specialisation options depending on how you distribute your skills in the 3 skill trees. Combat itself has a great flow, and experimenting with different combos is a lot of fun. And The finisher move animations from the reckoning mode are varied enough, so I never tire of seeing them.
1417	1	a	Love this game. Never understood why it got such harsh reviews. I enjoy going back every so often just to re-roll and do things differently. Lot of fun!
1419	1	a	Fun, but too long. You're not fixed into a specific character class like a lot of other RPGs, and you can build your character to fit your playstyle. As the lucky one who's immune to fate, it is up to you to complete dozens and dozens of side quests because Bob is trapped by fate to be unable to get off his barstool to give a letter to Tim who's sitting at a table on the other side of the tavern. I imagine if you didn't do all the sidequests, you might be able to remember why you are slaughtering your way across the land. There is lots of gear to be found, but once you get a set, you find yourself keeping it for large parts of the game due to the set bonuses. Occasionally with the combo system you end up just being dragged around by your sword. Occasionally you will get NPCs to help you, but they are only to hold aggro as they do no damage and seem to be invulnerable.
1421	1	a	good game you cant turn off the quest makers. Makes for a challengeing game, instead of just running from way point to way point. Good voice acting,good dialouge and story. 8/10   SUCK IT 
1423	1	a	This game is so good from its story to how the spells work to how the destiny stuff works to the general fighting it's all around awesome If your thinking about it definitly buy this game
1425	1	a	This game is fairly Fable-like. Decidedly more sexy, with much lusher graphics, a much wider world, and absolutely ZERO 'Fixed' story.
1427	1	a	Much recommended
1429	1	a	I haven't finished the game in all the years I've had it but I still go back to play it. It's not that the game is bad, its actually a fun game to play, there are just other games that come out that catch my attention. Give this one a go.
1431	1	a	Dear god the camera angles are awful in some areas. Game is also incredibly easy. 8/10
1433	1	a	6/10
1435	1	a	This game is pretty unique, I would say it is sort of like Fable. The game is pretty easy to pick up and there is alot to do right from the start. Also the main quest will talk you through just about every zone when you are the propper level. Its like Fable with guns. 10 skyrim copies out of 10. wood recommend!
1437	1	a	An amazing Open World RPG adventure! The graphics are so good and not only is it beautiful, it's fun to play. With Amazing Customization and ways to make your play style your own, I reccomend this game to anyone that loves the grinding, looting, all around fun atmosphere of RPGs. The demo is well worth playing before you buy, since if you play the demo you get extra items in the full game :D
1439	1	a	Skyrim with a less open world and infinitely better combat
1441	1	a	Absolutely underrated and unbelievable game. Great story and environment. 10/10 Don't expect something absolutely new, its like most of MMOs around, just single player.
1443	1	a	If Fable and Dragon Age had a kid that partied with Skyrim and was roommates with Mass Effect, this game would be that kid.  Get it.
1445	1	a	Nothing earthshattering or unique, but definitely a game to pick up if you are into RPG's. Not a bad game, especially if you pick it up on a steam sale.
1447	1	a	very profound and entertaining game, need a good time investment in order to be appreciated fully.
1449	1	a	Nothing earthshattering or unique, but definitely a game to pick up if you are into RPG's. Not a bad game, especially if you pick it up on a steam sale.
1451	1	a	I really enjoy a deep storyline every once in a while, and this game provided just what I was looking for! I will say that a mount system would have been lovely to compensate for those long runs, but overall the game is amazing. I stumbled across it on the PS3, decided to give it a go, and was pleasantly surprised. Very nice &lt;3.
1453	1	a	Recommended if you love exploring a vast world, a CRAP TON of loot, new lore, and action RPGS. Not if you love an overly long, incredibly repetitive experience. I give it a 6/10.
1455	1	a	The story is amazingly deep and rich and the gameplay is fun and rewarding.
1457	1	a	games great but great deal of a P.o.a. to install would rather have 10 dentist appointment than reinstall 2nd time. problems not with game install per se itself but idiotic e.a. account.
1459	1	a	First off let me start off by stating that my hours played on Steam doesn't represent my hours played in KoA:R by a long shot. I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.
1461	1	a	It's pretty good. Recommended.
1463	1	a	It's a lot of fun, too bad there will not be any sequels. It's a unique game with moderate repeatability
139	0	a	Graphics: ok Gameplay: to slow for Hack &amp; Slay Camera: extrem poor :( Inventar and Menue: poor Interface: ok Cinematic: to many and poor Spelling: ok  Quality: poor 
140	0	a	Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.
141	0	a	It would be a good game if it weren't for the Main Story Bugs In the 'hunters hunted' mission (a main Quest mission) there is a bug that prevents you from proceeding with the main quest and there is nothing you can do about it  Sorry to say- don't buy unless you see some actual patching being done on this game i spent hours on this game only to find i need to restart for the CHANCE of passing this level 
142	0	a	Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.  Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.
143	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  
144	0	a	A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality. In the end, why play it? If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead. Miss Fables? Play the original, for it is still the best.   Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.
145	0	a	My first reaction to the game was: Graphics weren't what I was expecting, polished combat and extremely well made. But I quickly felt like there was something missing in this game. Something uncoherently mistaking. The combat feels really arcade as do the graphics but besides that there is areally polished RPG factor in it. You might say: that would be a positive thing. But I can't help but feel it does not match well together. Atleast for me it does not. The way I see it Kingdoms of Amalur is quite a big game, not seamingless, more like zones connected to each other. But the bland quests, not really appealing story and on the other hand good looks and superb combat makes me feel like I can't land my feet and immerse in the game.
146	0	a	Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold don’t scale fast enough to match shop prices, so don’t expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase.  Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.
147	0	a	no jump / no auto run / messed up hot key system = fail for me  but if u dont care about those things then its a great rpg.
148	0	a	Moderately ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with far too easy of a combat system / gameplay, a storyline that tries to be rich and complex and detailed and just ends up being uninteresting while throwing far too much information at you, and graphics that feel like the entire thing is taking place in oldschool Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Honestly. Areas all have a tint to them, and the first major one is pretty damn purple.  I've never regretted paying full price for a game more (Save maybe Fable 3), but that's what I get for buying EA.
149	0	a	It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.
150	0	a	It starts good but after 20 minutes of gameplay, apart from the bland quests, found a box with all powerfull weapons and with that all game completely become so easy to be uninstalled.  'Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do'  I completely agree!
151	0	a	This game has one of the best action mechanics i've played, but it's just too long and it starts to get very boring and repetitive, I've played this a lot and didn't gt to end it yet
1465	1	a	If you like RPG's, why do you not have this game?
1467	1	a	Sprinkled with Fae dust and magic, it's a beautiful single player rgp with the best combat mechanic of any traditional rpg style that I have found. Only loses out a little on depth of character. If you stay on the main quests it's a really rewarding and enjoyable 40 odd hours of sword play and spell adventuring.
1469	1	a	A mostly failed IP that began life as an MMORPG. It shows, but in a good way, honest. The easy-to-pick-up action RPG-ness of the Fable series meets the world and character design out of World of Warcraft's playbook taste excellent together.
1471	1	a	Great Game
1473	1	a	Recommended if you love exploring a vast world, a CRAP TON of loot, new lore, and action RPGS. Not if you love an overly long, incredibly repetitive experience. I give it a 6/10.
1475	1	a	10/10 would game
1477	1	a	It's good.
1479	1	a	Great game, lots of replay value here.
1481	1	a	First off let me start off by stating that my hours played on Steam doesn't represent my hours played in KoA:R by a long shot. I played at least eighty or more hours on the Origins version back when the game first game out. KoA:R is one of my all time favorite games, also one of the biggest disappointments to me as well in a lot of ways because I had such high hopes on the IP reallly going places and it's offspring becoming a contendter for WoW. Too bad that never happend, however that still doesn't stop the game from being a great RPG by it's own right.  Since I upgraded my main gaming rig to Windows 10 I found that my big screen TV seems to play better with my HDMI out on my laptop now so I decided to fire up KoA:R that I had on Steam and use it to as a gauge big screen preformance. Once of the problems I had with the PC version of KoA:R was FOV settings and luckily playing it on the big screen helps resolve a lot of those problems.    Game wise the game still is a beautiful game. Yes it has that WoW-like comic book feel to it, but I enjoy it personally over the more realistic Elder Scrolls artwork. No the combat isn't as good as TES and yes considering the writers involved the writing is a letdown but still the game is fun for what it is. It is a great lay back on the sofa / gaming chair and just goof off type of third person action RPG. It is overshadowed by other RPGs and yes it failed to live up to the hype and it was done in by legal issues but still years later it is a fun game by its own right.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, nor did it change the gaming landscape like I had hoped but still years later it is worth playing. It has me hooked again after a few hours now that I want to do another play though and see what look nooks and crannies I might have missed. All in all I still recommend it. I would recommend it though only on sale, and personally only on sale on Steam. I wouldn't pick it up on Origins.
1483	1	a	Simply AMAZING!
1485	1	a	This game is actually freakin' fun. Ok, gear grinding and quests are standard fare but sometimes you want to go dungeon diving and swap out your gear some. This is definitely one of those games that lets you do that. The controls are tight and exactly what every MMO and action RPG ought to be: Dodging, blocking, spell tossing, reasonable mana regen, cooldowns, etc. The visuals are great and the way the camera handles makes you believe you're in control, side saddle to the action. Quest givers talk to you and there's an endless amount of stuff to do and ways to wrap up each adventure along the way. If you're just looking to have a good time or you really want a game that reminds you of Everquest, Lineage or World of Warcraft, this is the way to go. Ding it on one point: Should have been a way to host a server so you could play with friends. Maybe this studio will do an MMO at some point. Would definitely be interested in that. Lots of good ideas executed well. 9/10 from me. -Knight
1487	1	a	game runs like a knife cuts through butter, stable 200+ fps on a 780Ti, gameplay-wise one of the most enjoyable RPG's I have ever played. Really cool and versatile combat mechanics, every piece of gear looks friggin' awesome. Semi-linear open world with fun quests, great voice acting, and a lot of side quests to kill time with. All the basic RPG elements combined with a really addicting blacksmith system. KoA will always have a place in my heart.
1489	1	a	
1491	1	a	More cartoon then skyrim but entertaining
1493	1	a	I like this game quite alot and played through the whole game along with one and a half of the DLCs. The big thing about this game is it's upgrade system as your 'class' is determined as you upgrade different things along the three skill trees, might, skill, and will. You can choose one tree to specalize in, two to favor, or go with all three.  I did enjoy the combat but after a while it got pretty old. I eventually found my favorite combination of weapons, (greatsword and charams), and pretty much spent the rest of the game and DLCs doing the same moves over and over again. The game does have a system to let you respend all your skill points and try a different style but I never found a combination of weapons and skills that I liked more than the one I had already found.  Also the enemies got really old too, flinging the same filler enemies at you again and again. If I get ambushed by imps ONE MORE TIME I am going to die!  But now that I got my rage out of the way I do like and recommend this game. I could say the game is worth it's price but who am I kidding? Everything goes on sale eventually and this is somthing I would grab when it does.
1495	1	a	Interesting story full of adventure and mayhem. Great gameplay mechanics. Beautiful graphics. R.A. Salvatore! Just an awesome game. If you're into ARPGs and haven't played this game yet... for shame! 9/10
1497	1	a	I'm loving this game, I highly recommend. It's worth the full asking price and if it's on a good sale I wouldn't hesitate to get it at all.
1499	1	a	If you like RPG's, why do you not have this game?
1501	1	a	Never could stop playing this game on Xbox. Maybe I should be playing it on PC instead lol great game
1503	1	a	More cartoon then skyrim but entertaining
1505	1	a	9/10
1507	1	a	Basically everything about that is good has already been said. Let me tell you one thing, the camera is great (in my opinion) it is very smooth and doesn't glitch and skip about.

1511	1	a	While slightly lacking with a weak story, still a solid RPG. Kinda like a singleplayer WoW, where lackluster NPCs send you on grind and fetch quests, with a few action packed fights to break up the benality.
1513	1	a	I flipping &lt;3 this game!! ^_^
1515	1	a	How many levels does this player go up to level 30 or  40....more??? 
1517	1	a	Awesome game. has a few bugs but ii's definitely worth it on sale.
1519	1	a	I want to start off by saying yes, this is a genuinely good game. 8.5/10 in my book. Nobody's getting paid to write all these positive reviews.  Pros:   -Excellent combat: It takes a bit of getting used to; because the game LOOKS so much like an MMO, you expect to just be able to hold down M1 and swish around. This is not the case. Combat takes a bit more skill than that, and honestly reminds me a bit of Dark Souls, just cleaned up around the edges a bit. You get several 'encounter powers' that use mana, and these come with every class. The ability to slip into 'Fate mode' is an awesome addition, basically everything slows down and the last thing you kill is smote in an epic slow-mo QTE.  -Great art style: The graphics kind of remind me of Torchlight, but if you could zoom waaay in on Torchlight and see all the little details. It's overall smooth, and, once again, reminiscent of your typical MMO. Overall the landscape is bright and colorful, and there's never a lack of things to look at even in the darkest, gloomiest caverns.   -Good animations: Overall the game flows. I suppose this ties mostly into combat, but I hardly ever see things chopping around. It's not exactly the best in show for animation, but only the occasional buggy-eyed townie and jump to another stance while in combat break the immersion, and the physics hardly ever seem out of place.  Cons:  Crafting: My biggest bone to pick with this game is the crafting system. I personally have had a difficult time figuring it out, and it really doesn't seem worth it. There are Smithing, Alchemy, and 'Sagecraft,' each representing weapon/armor crafting, potion crafting, and enchantment crafting respectively. Sagecraft is a bit like Torchlight's enchantment system, where you can upgrade gem shards into enchantments for your weapons. My problem is, I can seldom find weapons that are better than my starter (from a DLC I'm assuming) hammer, The Mountain, which lacks an enchantment slot. So I'm brought to wonder what the point of that even is. I haven't focused on Alchemy at all seeing as I can just buy potions, and am brought back to my Sagecraft problem when it comes to Smithing. Nothing I can fabricate is better than The Mountain thus far. Furthermore, the crafting skills all level with you, assuming you've put your one skill point per level into a crafting skill. There's no way to level them up besides this, which is probably just as good considering they seem to be fairly useless entities.  Music and Sounds: The music is fitting in most circumstances, but the sounds could have been done a lot better. In particular the grunts/squeals of the various characters and fauna; the action noises and other sound effects are just fine. Right off the bat though, you're met with strange grunting noises that seem out of place and repetative as your character decends from a pile of dead bodies. You can replicate this awkward, way-too-long performance at any time by repeatedly smashing the sprint button; if this is done right, the player character will take on the posture and personality of a large ape as he lopes towards his next objective, making strange gutteral noises while he does so. I also found the animals to have similarly small sound banks that tend to repeat themselves a tad too often.  Overall the pros certainly outweigh the cons, and for such a low sale price you'll get many hours of quality gameplay.   
185	0	a	I really really tried forcing myselfe to continue playing but i simply couldn't. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements. But it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests. I heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!  The Good + Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.  + Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the 'uh' 'uah' 'ah' in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.  + Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.  + Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.  The Meh ~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.  The Bad - Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.  - Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.  - Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.  - Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.  - EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.  - Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.  3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me
186	0	a	I honestly can't recommend Kingdoms of Amalur unless you buy it on sale. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't good, either.  Some of the major problems I have with it include a terrible camera, generic story and setting, boring and uninspired RPG elements, bloated busywork sidequests, and a combat system that would be fun if not for groups of enemies that stunlock the crap out of you.   That said, I DO think it is a decent timesink if you are looking for one. I just think that your money is going to be better spent elsewhere.
187	0	a	It's a fun game to start, but could be much shorter. So many of the quests are 'fetch 10 of this' or 'kill 10 of that'. It gets boring quickly. I feel as though they made a massive world, put the main story in, then realized it was still mostly empty.  I outleveled every zone quickly before finishing most of the faction and side quests, forcing me to increase the difficulty just for a sense of fun.   You can respec at any time, so there is no reason to play through more than once.  I haven't quite finished all the DLC, and I don't plan to do so.  It's a decent game and the world had potential, but I think it missed the mark. I'd recommend something else for your fantasy-rpg fix.
188	0	a	15 hours into the game and I encountered a bug which makes it impossible for me to progress further into the game. Apparently I have to restart to get it to work.  No thank you.
189	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself. On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW). On the other, it is an arcade action game. The arcade part is fun. The rest... not so much. The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors. Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y. But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.  The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead. And other characters want to help or exploit you. Or something like that. But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together. There's nothing compelling about the story. The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts. I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible. There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over. I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.   Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair. You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent. Some monsters just absorb hits until they die. Others will take a few before striking back. The only downside is that it becomes repetitive. Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map. But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.  Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element. Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees. Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat. Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull), and the like. And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.  The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game. Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.   Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it. It hasn't grabbed me. And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment. The story needs to be compelling. The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest. And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting. Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?  It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole. It's not enough to keep my interest.
190	0	a	KoA: Reckoning is a single player take on the MMORPG formula complete with hundreds of uninspired fetch-quests and tedious, loot-driven character progression. I am actually relieved to have suffered a game-breaking bug 23 hours in, as I hadn't been enjoying myself since the 15-hour mark.
1521	1	a	Like Skyrim with more classes 10/10  
206	0	a	MMO style single player rpg, too easy even on hard difficulty.
1523	1	a	Great game its like playing World of Warcraft by yourself without the hot key rotation 
222	0	a	Played this game on a console a year or so ago and I liked it. Now I can't play more than 5 hours of it and I don't know why.                                                                                              hey dad i thought we only play thouchy touch on wednesdays
223	0	a	Good: -Resonably good premise. -Interesting original Faction Storylines. -Unique Combat System.  Bad: -90% of enemies/zones/quest structures/character models are recycled. -Cliché telling of previously-mentioned premise. -Boring repetetive sidequests have you forgetting what the main quest actually is. -No interesting/memorable characters.  Sophisticated Conclusion: It's sooooo boring :'(
1525	1	a	~THIS GAME KICKS ♥♥♥ AND IS ONE OF THE FIRST TRUE AWESOME RIDES 
1527	1	a	Love this game, could have been amazing if it wasn't just single player.
1529	1	a	If you're bored as ♥♥♥♥ and like games with no choices but good combat, You might enjoy this
224	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning poor game. fix bugs.
225	0	a	It's as if there was a guy who had a rediculous amount of money, loved video games and had unlimited amounts of time to do absolutely nothing with got really really stoned in the midst of an incredible acid trip and thought to himself, '♥♥♥♥ I could do that.'  Then he sold everything he owned and tried doing exactly that.  He failed of course, but the manner in which he failed was so spectacular that it serves as a lesson to everyone in the industry: Rely on the foundation of money and you will fail.  Bottom line? GUI sucks my balls, story is meh and I was left in total dismay about almost everything in the game. Terrible. If it were free and I was paid $20 an hour to finish this game I would quit before lunchtime.
226	0	a	Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.
227	0	a	Early doors yet but this is trying to be Skyrim but Skyrim on drugs. Sadly the drugs have given you a bad trip and everything is so scary and disjointed.
228	0	a	worked on my old potato pc, upgraded and got win ten, now it will randomly crash everyonce in a while (15minish) making it unplayable. the only thing worse then a bad game is getting locked out of one you loved   EDIT: found that if you close tabtab.exe under details in the task manger is runs fine
1531	1	a	Maybe ill get 1000000 bad comments for this, but in MY opinion, this game is way better than The witcher 3,,,, (I had this game and i returned. Smooth gameplay, nice fights and lot of armors, upgrades, etc. Some ppl descrived this game pretty well, is a mix between torchilght, skyrim somehow, maybe WoW too, with a really good and interesting result. for me 100% RECOMEND this game.

236	0	a	I'd give this game a 6 out of 10, don't pick it up unless you can get it at a deep discount. A poor man's Skyrim, where the terrain is full of invisible walls. I thought having RA Salvator's name attached to it would guarrantee a dessent story line. I was proven wrong, game plays like an MMO or old school RPG. None of the quests seem to have any baring on the story line, and even though you become head of the society of mages or a king, you are still treated as a serf. Gameplay is enjoyable, I played as a mage and once you had meteor the combat became monotonous.
237	0	a	the story is boring
238	0	a	Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then. Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK. Even at its highest difficulty, 'hard', this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against. So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways. But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.

1535	1	a	Killed everyone in every town. not in jail. im rich. IGN 10/10
241	0	a	Very Bad Game!   Gameplay repetitive, story very bad, ONLY WORTH BUYING IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OTHERS RPGs TO PLAY
1537	1	a	Ok Everyone who loves this game and planded on Crytisysing me for my choice of words about this this game cuzz they knew what i said was rong. Fair game. I just started i got ahead of my self and jumped to conclusions story is anoying yes gameplay is good unlike what i said. It was kinda stuped at first but i gess it just took geting used to. But after a wile it actualy got me prity entressted. So those who love this game and knew my Revew was fals if u guys dident crytisys me for it out of kindness its open game for u guys. Everyone els who hasent played well u got no room to talk even less than me infact. lols Over all The combat is kinda Ify its hardly a challange unless u turn up the Difficulty but Even then it can be off ballance. Why u ask? The World in wich u are playing is desined like a MMO's world for some reasion. With areas stronger then others if u go to far out ur too week if u go to far in ur to strong. its rather anoying sence theres is not anyreasion the game cant ajust to one persons charicter becose its singleplayer. As for the swiming u can swim in certan areas. Agien i jumped to conclusions. For me its the Enteraction that makes a Openworld RPG and Tip Craft ur armor if ur a warrior. Oh shops do change once u aquier a home from a village being attacked by spiders ull know it when u see it. by the way. They dont change level just invintory. :)
1539	1	a	This game has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of content, many areas to explode, literally hundreds of quests that all take a while to complete and are fun, ♥♥♥♥ing great.
1541	1	a	This is an awesome game! kinda of like a singleplayer rift with better graphics and combat.
1543	1	a	one of the best RPG games ive played :) prety good
1545	1	a	If you like MMO's but are looking for something a bit different with an amazing combat system this game is for you. it is a bit repetitive but the character development is interesting and makes you feel very powerful. i highly reccomend this game for endless hours of fun  side note: the DLC's are worth it!
1547	1	a	This is an amazing game. It is too bad the company went under. I am super happy to finally see a sale for this game!
1549	1	a	I heard that this game was a classic Underdog: a game that didn't succeed commercially, but was a true wonder.  I heard correctly.  I rather suspect that its failure to sell initially was due to being released in the shadow of the Dragon, you might say; released one year after Skyrim, and that's a big name to live up to. Big enough now; bigger then, when it was almost new. Most of the people who would've jumped at Amalur then were probably slaying giants and stealing mammoth souls, and Amalur's graphics aren't quite as impressive. They about match SWTOR's graphics and movement mechanics for that matter, though the combat is... different.  Ehh, I'm rambling. Anyway I'm only just starting to figure it out, but I feel like I did when I was just starting to play KOTOR... and I should've been in bed two hours ago. That says something.
1551	1	a	Fun game, great combat, the story falls a little flat for my taste, nevertheless it's worth the buy. (Especially on sale!)
1553	1	a	A non-biased quick look @ the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQfMAdnF9Q4   I've spent many hours playing this game, decided to get the Steam version. The minds of New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore, Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston have combined to create Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, a new role-playing game set in a world worth saving. Build the character you've always wanted and continuously evolve it to your style of play with the revolutionary Destiny system. Choose your path and battle through a master-crafted universe featuring some of the most intense, responsive, and customizable RPG combat ever. - Highly Recommended!
258	0	a	Bought this game and couldn't even launch it. Google revealed many others with the same problem.  Not sure if this is an issue with installing it through steam or an issue with the game.
259	0	a	This is ♥♥♥♥, no longer works on my computer, uninstalling reinstalling verifying cache, backing up. Nothing works. dont get it will ♥♥♥♥ you over
260	0	a	This game works about as well as one would expect from a developer that released the game then promptly went out of business. 
261	0	a	Does not work properly with Steam's game streaming. The camera look is messed up when the game is streamed, does not react to mouse movements properly.
262	0	a	I gave up on this game. Just could not get into it. It just didnt make sense.
1555	1	a	TERA LIKE RPG WITH MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT
308	0	a	Great game but it keeps on crashing on my machine. The troubleshooting suggestions given by the forum and the support is a waste of time.
1557	1	a	All in all an underrated game. On the plus side:  - a very complex game world with a huge main quest and many, many side quests  - the writing is above mainstream  - a fluid, flexible combat system,  - a complex crafting system - an interesting skill tree which allows you to tailor your char to your wishes  - some good voice acting (the female lead character for example)  On the other hand it has some flaws: - the itemization is strange, probably you will find the best weapon or armor after 2/3 of the game and very mediocre gear after boss fights rather late down the story line.  - the crafting system is something for people who like spreadsheets - if you are doing most of the side quests you will be very overpowered after about 1/3 of the game and combat will become boring (for me as a wizard) - game controls: the game wants to be played with a controller, (well, you can do it with the keyboard, but it feels strange) - graphics shows the limits of the playstation 3 generation   All in all if you are into RPG with action then you should give this game a try! Certainly one of the better ones (metacritic of 81 seems about right to me)

1561	1	a	TERA LIKE RPG WITH MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT
1563	1	a	I played Dark Souls and i feel like this game has similar dodge mechanism but this game is easy. The first boss fight was too easy and the NPCs are easy to kill, that means timing or using your dodge does not mean life or death.  Although it is a good game i just don't feel like playing this now but for those  RPG fans this is a game worth a try.
320	0	a	I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring.   And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game.   Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive.   The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess.   So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.

322	0	a	Game breaking bug in the main quest. Awesome. Wow.
323	0	a	I would like to give this game a positive review. For all the good points, please go read any of the many positive reviews. I agree with most the other reviewers' points concerning sound, combat, UI, etc. There are two reasons this gets a thumbs down from me. 1) Remapping keys doesn't work. Well, it does, sort of. You can add new keys to binds, but you can't remove the old ones. The default key bindings don't go away when you make new binds, and there's no way I've found to fix that, and if you bind a new function to a default-bound key, you get the default bind plus the new bind. EG, by default SHIFT is used for blocking. If you bind sprint to SHIFT, it will now block and sprint, mutually exclusive functions since you can't move while blocking. Yeesh. And yeah, 'block' is on the SHIFT key and sprint is on the CTRL key. Double yeesh. You know what games use SHIFT for sprint? EVERY OTHER @#$% GAME EVER MADE. Fortunately you can use a controler, which is the option I went with, rather than messing with decades of muscle memory. The second reason I'm thumbs-downing this game is because, on Windows 10, on certain boxes, it crashes to desktop randomly and without warning. A search of the net led me to a horde of disappointed gamers with the same issue. The usual tricks, running in compatibility mode, disconecting peripherals (the game goes loopy if you've got a graphics tablet plugged in) didn't help me, and since the devs are no longer, there will be no patches. I'd hoped, in vain, for a 3rd party patch, but couldn't find one. From what I have seen during my anywhere-from-five-minutes-to-an-hour-before-crashing game sessions, the game looks great. It would be nice if it was playable.
324	0	a	Do not buy even if its on sale for a dollar! This game has silly cartoon graphics and is NOT open world. It is the worst game I have ever bought even for 4.99.   1. Not open world 2.Nothing to explore 3. Cartoon graphics   BUY SKYRIM NOT THIS GAME. While it may not seem fair to compare the game to skyrim the reason I do is because of how they portray the game when the describe it.  1. They decide to throw in a name from the Elder Scrolls 4. 2. on Steam this game is listed under 'similar games to skyrim or oblivion 3.There is no massive open world. In combat it basically closes you off into a small area of the map thats where I lost the open world part. 4.The graphics are not just differnt their pretty bad even for an older game  Below I have how they described the game.

325	0	a	Good game,   but need keyboard+mouse or 360 pad instead of a third party controller like x360ce.   
326	0	a	There is a game breaking bug that they know about and never patched. I knew it was an EA title and figured it couldn't possibly be a waste of money for six bucks. I was wrong. set your money on fire instead.
327	0	a	Worst 10.3 hours of my life, The game just got more lame the longer i played until i couldnt stant it anymore.
328	0	a	This game did not work for me. Constant freezing and stuttering, was basically unplayable. I know that this is a decent game but cannot recommend...I am reviewing this simply to warn those may consider purchasing it in the future. By the way, my system runs high end games perfectly, such as Doom, The Witcher 3, The Divison, etc...so my rig is not the problem.
329	0	a	Camera movement are very sloppy but combat is good not worth buying the full price so...6.5/10
330	0	a	Sorry, but I can not reccomend this. While it has potentaial, ultimately it was too much like on offline MMO, just tons of fetch quests. Also there are TONS of bugs that will never get fixed since the studio went bankrupy.
1565	1	a	If this game were a potato, it would be a good potato.
331	0	a	I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.  Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.  If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.
1567	1	a	i love this game
360	0	a	boring. its trying too hard to setup its fantasy world when it should just focus on being a good game. lore should be a background thing while this game throws boring ♥♥♥ exposition at your face
1569	1	a	90/100 in my opinion...
362	0	a	great combat bland world so so game find a diffrent time sink
1571	1	a	This game is actually really fun. As a massive Skyrim fan, I found myself looking for more games like it. I bought this game a couple months ago and have played it off and on since. Let me tell you something: this game is not skyrim. No game is skyrim except for skyrim. Keep that in mind as you play this game. For $6 this game is a no-brainer. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.
367	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing trash game 1/10 story line
368	0	a	I haven't played it much, but the emptiness of the dialogue, the lack of emotions or immersion in PNJ faces (or even though yours), made the game really feeling like a waste of time to continue.

420	0	a	this game is seriously TOO EASY WTH... combat is like your character in permanent GOD MODE. This makes customization of characters useless since hell anything will work against such weak enemies and bosses zzz
421	0	a	Played for half an hour. Game crashed twice. Can't really play it like this.
422	0	a	I've tried several times to play this, but I couldn't get far into the game without giving up. It's a real chore to play and not worth your time.
423	0	a	The game is more an action game than a rpg. And as such i can not recommend it. The fantasy is also quite thin in terms of story and lore, the scenery however is lovely.
1577	1	a	J I Z Z EVERYTIME pam/10 would c u m again
443	0	a	Trash in its purest form
444	0	a	I haven't purchased a game with the EA logo on it since BF1942 due to their underhanded practices, but a friend highly recommended this game and even paid for it. With that disclaimer out of the way, on to the review.  Overall appearance: 5/10. Standard, generic, fly by night MMO look throughout the game. It is vastly empty, with very specific paths to follow. This is reinforced with invisible walls everywhere which prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks like jumping over a log. This kind of unpolished short cut methodology is fine for F2P MMOs, but not for a single player game. The armor sets are frequently reused, so you can have 3 or 4 different sets, yet they all look identical. The developers didn't even take the extra day to retexture the pieces for each set.  Combat mechanics: 1/10. This game has hands down, the absolute worst combat mechanics I have ever witnessed in any game. Even Revelation 2012 was better in this regard. You go to attack a specific enemy, and are instantly, uncontrollably attacking something completely different. This can include other monsters, but also can include a rock wall, the ground, or even nothing at all. This unpolished, wonky mess of a system can and will get you killed by bosses over and over.  Camera movements: 2/10. You have no control whatsoever of the bouncy, rubber banding camera, which frequently pops underground and into trees and rocks during fights so you can't see what's going on. If you suffer from motion sickness, take your pills before attempting to play.  Questing contents: 8/10. There is a lot to do in this game. Nearly town NPC will have some kind of quest chain for you to accomplish. Not just one Fed Ex quest, but actual, multiple leg quests. This is a nice thing to see in this day and age of single mission, gofer quests that most games offer. This doesn't allow for a great deal of replayability though, since the quests and dialogue are identical regardless of character build.  In general, this game feels just like any other fly by night MMO, with the one exception that there is no one else around. The armor sets leave a lot to be desired, using the same pieces for several different versions. And with the horrendous camera whizzing around all over the place, along with your character randomly attacking whatever the game decides it should, make this an exercise in patience more than something fun to do. Even on sale, it's not worth it.  While there were a number of high profile names associated with this title, it is painfully obvious they were merely lounging while resting on their laurels as a handful of under skilled interns developed the game. Many cardinal sins were incorporated along the way, and while I really wanted to like the game, in the end just couldn't. If I wanted to pay money for this kind of frustration, I'd get back together with my ex.
445	0	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has the same pitfalls as most modern day RPGs. There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding. The story isn't interesting, and the levelling is lacks excitement. I give this one about a 3 on a 10 scale.
446	0	a	Get outta here.
447	0	a	For most intents and purposes, this game feels very much like a Skyrim clone. Regardless, it did keep me entertained for a few weeks. IF you haven't played Skyrim, I would recommend playing that instead. If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.
448	0	a	This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.
1579	1	a	high quality game for low quality people.
450	0	a	Won't load at going in to the Laboratory...
451	0	a	This game is the final nail in the coffin for Electronic Arts games. After paying! for and downloading this game it is impossible to play without apparently altering my root menu. I uninstalled Origin after it became apparent that they would not let my use the Origin store to buy new games/dlc, but had hoped that EA games on Steam would be better. They are not. EA has shown repeatedly that they do not care about whether or not you can play their games, mearly that you give them money. They are single handedly killing the gaming industry and I, for one, would not be upset if the entire company went bankrupt, went to jail, or were to be killed horribly. In fact I would shake the hand of anyone that did. EA has stolen money from me for faulty products like the snake oil salesmen they are. I wash my hands of them.
452	0	a	its not that bad but its not great, honestly its not worth buying it is a really difficult game not much of a learning curve and it gets boring pretty quickly.
453	0	a	Looks and plays great, but something is lacking. Maybe it's what theologists call 'a soul'. Everytime I play i get bored.   If you need a good exploration based ARPG, play any Piranha Bytes game. Even Risen 2 or Gothic 3.
454	0	a	Just couldn't get into it. Felt like it borrowed shamelessly from a few games like Fable &amp; Elder Scrolls for example. I wanted a new experience and got a cocktail of old ones. Not for me.
455	0	a	This game is pretty good. There is a lot to do, you feel like you are sort of making a difference, and the challenges grow with the character. Getting new gear is a treat as they are all visually more and more awesome. However, you need to save often! Not because you might die... lol... oh no... but because you might run into a game bug. So far I've found two and the second one actually disables fast travel entirely. The map in the game is big, but not too big, but the problem is just the annoyance of having to run everywhere. Then I found out when looking for a community to tell me how to get out of the bug, that the game studio apparently imploded. So, now I'm stuck, having to run around everywhere and the game is becoming more of an annoying grind than the fun questing adventure that I've been playing for hours. Big dissappointment and no chance of help. Get the game if you want, but read up on all the quest bugs first. You CAN get stuck. You CAN screw up the whole game. Gamer beware.
456	0	a	Gets boring quick.

460	0	a	If you're using windows 10 don't expect to be able to play for more than a few minutes, there's some awful bug that will crash the game, and the developer never ♥♥♥♥ing bothered trying to fix it.
461	0	a	A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didn’t have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but it’s surrounded by so many mediocre and cliché rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasn’t consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Don’t bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.
462	0	a	High production values are offset by a lack of overall depth.   Pros: Nice visuals, good voice acting, fun combat and a deep skill system that almost warrants a replay.  Cons: Mission structure is rarely more than 'run to location, fight enemies, collect item, backtrack'. It wears thin pretty quickly.   You can see where all of the individual influences have made their mark, but the end product is unremarkable due to 30-odd hours of repetitive and shallow missions. I'd recommend it, but not for $60.
463	0	a	Feels like an MMO both story- and contentwise. Combat is as boring as Fable.

479	0	a	The story was pretty good. Game tried to be like Dragon Age: Origins. I just gave up on it, bored me.
480	0	a	First off this is not a bad game, even still i wouldnt recommend going through it because it is just painfully average. If you expect some epic rpg then no this is not quite it, if you want some easy hack and slash game then yeah this might be it. What bugged me the most, speaking of bugs this game has very little of it, is the quests are just boring as hell and even though there is a lot of background story to discover but it just seems to matter so god damn little. Fighting is pretty cool though i would have liked to see a more diverse skill system or some sort of diversity that is not in the game. Also i finished the game and didnt even get my top sorcery card which means i probably didnt do enough side quests, but heck they are boring as hell. LOTS of walking during quests and in between makes it a bit stupid at times as well. Yeah so my final verdict is don't go with this game if you expect the next skyrim or some epic rpg.
481	0	a	KoA world is so boring and uninteresting. So many side missions to do but you couldnt care less
482	0	a	Im quite sad,,, i played this game and loved it, but it kept crashing every ten minutes.... i did everything i could to fix it but apparently certain computers with Windows 10 just dont work on certain games.. SAD
483	0	a	Just wanted to play single player and offline and yet needed to jump through EA hoops to make an online account for a game on Steam...
484	0	a	Fun game for the level or so I could play it. A couple hours into it I'm getting weird bugs where buildings render only half the time and the quests don't show up on the map anymore. I'd get a refund if I hadn't bought the game so long ago. It's unplayable.
485	0	a	It was too late for a refund when I realized it's a repetitive game with no detail work at all. It's very casual if you ask me(no one asks me but you know). There are much better games of this genre, I suggest you stay away from this one.
486	0	a	I have not played this game much yet, but it has a really bad camera.
1585	1	a	Hello there im BlueSkyKingDrago I have a youtube channel and I just upload a video but its 2 part video so please come check it out this game is really good I got the collection so I got all of the game and I have yet to play the DLC. So I hope to see people check it out. Oh and the youtube channel name is BlueSkyKing Drago
1587	1	a	it was fun but i ended up not being bothered to keep going.
1589	1	a	Not the most innovative RPG, put the gameplay is really good, so it will keep you playing.
1591	1	a	If you decide to play this, make sure you skip most (if not all) side quests. Otherwise, the story is too drawn out and the game becomes unchallenging from over-leveling.
1593	1	a	WOW solo player with R.A. Salvatore input?  Umm yeah, buy this game.  
1595	1	a	this game is definatly one worth buying especially if its on sale! buy it buy it now..... unless your broke then im sorry now off to play more of this game
1597	1	a	If you liked Fable but wish it was a tiny bit less simplified and had more elements of modern RPG's, this is worth picking up on a good sale.
1599	1	a	Destiny system OP. NPCs worship me as a living god.  10/10
1601	1	a	good game, lots of things to do, would recommend
1603	1	a	Have had this game on Playstation for years. Learning all the controls on a PC isn't too confusing. I Like how the spells are hotkeyed to the 1-0 keys and displayed on the hud.   The amount of sidequests in this game is fantastic, you can spend loads of time leveling up through grinding if you want or just complete quests to achieve the same. There are lots of items to collect (if your into grabbing every item you see:) There are also lots of items to steal, but it can be quite a while until you get to a place to sell them or level up enough in mercantile to sell to store.  This game has a lot of replay value for me as a quick 'have an hour, do some quests/kick some butt' fix. Fun enough I even got my husband hooked on it!  Also, the Legend of Dead Kell is worth picking up. You get an extremely cool castle with all sorts of perks. Plus, the whole pirate theme and design is very cool looking.  
1605	1	a	Amazing game, I didn't enjoy some RPG so much for a long time. The animations are beatiful, cartoonish graphics will not get obsolete by time and there is so many utility details, that will make your gameplay much more enjoyable.   In this game, you can truly see that responsible people (developers) made it with focus on player base, unlike Fable 3 - which was destroyed by utterly poor design decisions and which is in overal 'very similar' to this game. But those 'minor' decision makes this game so awesome in a large scale and also so much more 'different' compared to recently mentioned 'Fable 3' game.   If you liked Fable: Lost Chapters', you will like this one also. Good pick for good money, get it!
1607	1	a	While everything is passable, nothing was done exceptionally well, and the combat, character skills, loot and story and everything else gets a ‘B’ rating from me. In the end the world is static, just waiting for the player to walk past, unlike more immersive games that make you think the world keeps moving while you are not playing or while not in the immediate area. Certainly not worth 60$ unless you greatly value how long it takes to beat the game, in which case 60$ for 200 or more hours might well be worth it.   Overall, if on the fence play the demo, and wait for a sale. 
1609	1	a	This is an underrated gem of a game. While it is true that the developer went bankrupt, it wasn't from this game. The fact EA continues to publicise and sell this game speaks of its appeal.  With the use of Widescreen Fixer to adjust the over-the-shoulder viewing and the endless hours of content, this game is well worth playing. While the graphics are a little more World of Warcraft like than Dragon Age, there is some depth to the fighting system. I would call this an open world RPG that is a pleasure to explore. You can build your character as a pure warrior, a mage/warrior hybrid, a warrior/rogue, or go full fighter/rogue/mage. I am in the middle of a second playthrough and the last one took 70 hours.  If I were to list the cons, they would be that combat can get rather simplistic, the dispel mini-game gets old, some items in your inventory cannot be dropped permanently reducing your potential inventory space and a few dialogue timing mistakes here and there.  Since the item drops scale to your level, I don't recommend wasting money on the weapons and armor DLC since it matches the level you play when you obtain the DLC, which is level 1, and the items are mostly useless by the time you can access them.
1611	1	a	Its a good game, but it gets very repetitive, epescially if you like completing all the side quests.   The gameplay itself is very good (i'd recommend a controller, but mouse/keyboard works fine) as is the main story line. Character development is well tuned, pick your play style, pick your weapons and your good to go. Combat is fluid and well paced, and a lot of fun.  I'd recommend the base game, if you get to the end and want more get the DLC's but you may well have had your fill by then. Ultimately I got bored im guessing about 3/4 of the way through the main game and stopped playing, that was 80 hours worth doing most of the sidequests for the first half of the game then ignoring them after that. most subquest rewards are very generic, so dont burn yourself out with them. if anything look up a guide on character skill bonuses and just do those ones.
1613	1	a	First off I'd like to say I had no preconceptions before playing this game and I bought it on sale for $5 and I am going to keep this review short.  Good: -Neat story -Variety of classes is nice and encouraged -Variety of enemies  Okay/Bad: -Combat can be boring -Graphics are...like world of warcraft ish if you played that...if not they're not super detailed, not skyrim at all -Gear is varied but I always wanted more named stuff/good loot  This game is like if skyrim and world of warcraft had a (single player) child, if you get it on sale (less than $10 I'd say) it's worth it. It took me 50 hours for a playthrough (did most things that I could)
1615	1	a	One of the best RPG's I've ever played. 10/10 would buy again.
1617	1	a	Yes, there's a lot of (good) content to this game, especially with the dlc's. However, much of this content becomes repetitive because you will mostly be facing the same enemies over and over, with minor cosmetic differences. The fact that the difficulty level seems way too low, will not contribute to your excitement. Setting it to hard for a normal experience will help, but when your enemies are numerous enough, expect perma-interruption battles that leave you falling and getting up until you run out of health potions. At which point you won't get up anymore.  There's lots of running involved in this game, as you would expect from a semi-open world rpg. It's not so bad, though, due to the numerous quick travel options. Except, you can't quick travel in dungeons, not even after clearing it completely. The creators did their best to design a lot of the dungeons in such a way that you end up at the starting point, but you will often curse them for not applying that principle to the one you're in at that moment.  The 'rare and rarer' (a.k.a. 'unique') weapons are a joke. Put some points in gem crafting and you will be able to put actual useful stats on your weapons and armor. Sadly, this means missing out on some of the better cosmetic aspects of the game. I'm assuming, based on other reviews, that the same goes for armor crafting. Do not bother to skill the lock picking and disenchanting skill, as they will, at most, let you avoid minor incomforts (i.e. running to a healer or buying more lock picks).  Inventory management will, of course, be slightly tedious and annoying. But I've seen a lot worse. You will get access to a stash somewhere along the way.  Voice acting is decent, although repetitive as well. The storyline doesn't take much imagination to come up with, but now and then there's a gem in there (probably inspired by some folklore). Just be prepared for a LOT of storytelling. Skip at leisure. After a while, anyone will.  The camera is horrible and way too close to your character. The HUD is consequently way too large. I'm guessing this is because this game isn't an original pc game. This will be a major annoyance, until you get used to it (again). Just don't expect to be able to aim well, the auto-targeting system will not leave a lot of room for free choice. Also, melee attacks, especially, have elaborate animations and will leave you cursing your character for its lack of agility. Getting more agility will not change this. Luckily, the AI isn't clever enough to take full advantage of the consequent holes in your defense.  The skill trees are nice and contain decent variation, allowing you to effectively pursue any possible play style. I would advise you to experiment. There is even room for mixed classes, based on how you divide your skill points, which is a big plus in my opinion. This means there's an actual role-playing aspect to the skill tree. Skill trees are often mistakenly seen as something that makes a g an rpg.  All in all this game is fun, until you get tired of fighting the same battles. Although I usually want to do every possible mission, I would advise against taking too many side quests, especially when they seem to not add much to the story or your gear. Don't expect good graphics, even though this game seemingly isn't that old. Buy it on sale (for 5 euros) and you'll have a good deal.
1619	1	a	If you are ever bored and want a game to kill some time on, this one is definitely it. Huge world, tons of weapons and awesome DLC will keep you on this game forever. Yes the crafting can be a bit lopsided once you max out blacksmithing and sage crafting, but to challenge yourself, stick to finding rare unique weapons and you will be just as happy and also dont have to worry about looking at a crafted weapon that is not easy on the eyes.
1621	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is one hell of a fun game, tons of ♥♥♥♥ing loot, combat is whatever you wana do, and the story ain't too shabby either. Sucks that the company kinda went Bankrupt. Would have loved to see more from them. 
1623	1	a	Excellent and truly underrated fantasy RPG. Beautiful world, impactful choices and awesome gameplay. I would have loved to see a sequel on this one !
1625	1	a	It is a nice action-adventure with many possibilities to level-up your character. The story is quite good, the world big and the levels diverse enough to kepp you going. The outstanding thing about this game however is the fun in experimenting with all the equipment and weapons you find. I enjoyed this game for over 100h and hope you do the same.
1627	1	a	Just bought this on sale and im already amazed by the fluent gameplay it has similarities to skyrim except improves wherever it lacks in spell casting looting and combat.
1629	1	a	Its fun but you don't go fast enough for how gigantic the maps are. 7.5/10
1631	1	a	Excellent combat system, in-depth and interesting lore, and a solid character customization system. With the expansions there is around 100 hours of content. I highly recomment this game for people who those who are unsure about the RPG genres. RPG's are not my cup of tea, but I loved this game. I've played through it on my PS3 twice and again on my PC.
1633	1	a	KoA: Reckoning is about a guy who used to be dead but isen't dead anymore, that just woke up and was totally fine. In fact, he was better than he ever used to be, considering that he woke up from death with the skills of a warriorninjawizard. After very widely escaping from a magical hit-squad trying to make him re-dead, he goes on to wander into a guy that tells him he exists outside the system and that he can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he damn well pleases. He goes on to solve the problems of the people, killing the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that gets in his way one way or another, and occasionally breaking someone's fate, effectively changing it from “Happy life to “Brutal bloody death via me. because he can. After learning how to do this, he goes on to do a quest for Zelda for the woman’s equal rights movement. He's so awesome, animals feasting upon their prey completely don't notice him until he's stabbing them in the face. Anyone with a brain should not play this. 5/5
1635	1	a	The Attacks makes this game Fun but Running around attacking can be diffacult because camra views doesn't Auto move towards our backs right
1637	1	a	This game is very fun. Lots of stuff to do and tons of game time. Good story line, similar to dragon age 1 I like that you can reset and become any other type of class anytime throughout the game. This game also has very good controls.
1639	1	a	This game is AWESOME! I love the fact that you can upgrade your character as the game progresses and the scenery is awesome. I am a big fan of open world games and character customization! The DLC to this game is amazing as well. Easily a game you can get lost into. (^_^)
1641	1	a	Even though the storyline is stale and repetitive, I found myself quickly addicted to this game. The combat is very engaging and fun. You feel powerfull without truly being so. The game has its hard moments, especially during bossfights. But the overal challenge is low and has little replay value.   Very fun to play for an hour or 50, but after that it'll grow old on you quickly. Main quest had its fun moments, but in the end, I rushed through it to just be done with the game.  Would recommend rpg fans to pick this up. Because I've had hours of fun playing this game which is extremely engaging and fun for quite a lot of hours.
1643	1	a	It has a good history (very important for a RPG) the controls are nice. Not the best RPG I've played, but decent for good gaming hours.
1645	1	a	I've played this game before it was launched, when there was only the demo back 2 years ago and I don't remember why it didn't convinced me. It was probably the price, or maybe that I didn't hang off Skyrim, but on a sale I say it's absolutely worth it. I've played like 10 hours or so and I've been gratefully surprised. I've read some reviews and comments bashing about the combat system but it isn't bad at all. It's just a bit different, you have to imagine you're playing some of the Batman titles, dispatching enemies with combos and your muscles (also cunning and sorcery in this case), but at the same time you can decide how to build your hero almost completely, from gear to combat skills. And you do so by choosing among the many many choices you'll be given to build up your hero. Yes, only 3 spec trees, but as you skill up those trees you'll be given fates that will make your character really unique. Maybe you want to be the full warrior kind? go ahead, perhaps you'd like to combine the might of the warrior with the power of magic and make a powerfull hibryd? sure thing!, each one of the posible combinations has a fate that will reasure your prototipe hero's source of power whichever the tree/s it comes from. Also it has a crafting system which can be improved if you want to be a renowned artisan. So, in my opinion, the game is a mix between the Batman titles (has the agility of combat), Dragon Age (talents, specs and lore) Skyrim (the feeling of freedom/sandbox) and Diablo (the loot), this mix is, at least for me, a really good combination to renew the genre.
1647	1	a	Beautiful game, wonderful story. A great example of a classic open world RPG.
1649	1	a	Not perfect, but does so many things right. Combat is the right mix of strategy, tactics, and button-mashing, tons of quests, huge bright vibrant world, nice character building system with unlimited (but not free) respecs. This is a really good RPG that breaks from the mold in a lot of ways. Can't believe I waited this long to try it.  My biggest complaint is that this game is too long. I'm about 100 hours in and have started skipping all side quests, running through zones ignoring enemies, and will probably skip one of the two large DLC's entirely, just because I have other games to play (and I know if I leave this for more than a week I may never actually finish it).
1651	1	a	The game was a lot of fun to play - good adventure and quests. It would have been nice if the developers had included adjustable difficulty levels - it was a little too easy towards the end of the game. A sequel would be really cool.
1653	1	a	Story is ok. Items and fighting styles are ok. Graphics are descent and fluid. Overall its a bit generic as far as an rpg's go, but its still worth playing. Don't expect a whole lot of original concepts and you'll probably enjoy it.
1655	1	a	This game is a lot more fun than I expected it to be. The ability to pick your play style, and change it through out the game is very nice.
1657	1	a	This game is an amazing rpg that have great batlle mechanic. The crafting is pretty sweet, as you make your potions, shards, weapons and armors, the weapons and armors that you made can be name them as you see fit. Speaking of weapons and armors, you'll be getting cool one early on compare to most other rpgs. Plus you be putting a really long time into playing this game you be having a blast playing it.  I really love this game. I recommended to everyone who's a fan of Fable or any Action RPG games.
1659	1	a	Interesting game...very big world with lots of stuff to do...lots and lots of quest...
1661	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played.
1663	1	a	The game needs some polishing the diolouge and be a little wonky at times, and the vast number of quests get a little repetative. but the world is huge, open ended and fun to explore. the character building is amazing and adictive. The story could be a little more well explainged in the begining but it all makes sense after a bit of play and really picks you up and sweeps you along after a while. highly recomend
1665	1	a	Seemless sandbox with simply amazing enviroments. Captures that 'awe' feeling you might remember from your early days of gaming. Simply put, its worth the money in every way imaginable.
1667	1	a	This game is incredible and huge. Still working my way through (there are so many side quests!) I picked it up on the Christmas Steam sale for very cheap so, I wasn't expecting much and I was very happily surprised. I wish I had known about this game when it was new but for some reason it escaped my notice, otherwise I would have supported it. First impression, it had a play feel similar to Skyrim but, it isn't quite that either and this game has endeared me a bit more. The story is to me where this game shines and the voice acting. Kind of like the SWTOR mmo? The writing is great, the voice actors are wonderful - so if you enjoy listening to characters talk and stories with multiple choices and outcomes - this game might be for you. I guess if there are any negatives the battle system may seem a bit simple or repetative, but you can change with fateweavers at any time between different classes so you can spice it up. Would recommend :)
1669	1	a	This game is so good that there were times I just couldn't stop playing. You will love this game. It has a huge and mostly open world that should appeal to fans of The Elder Scrolls games like me. The combat is one of the best that I've seen in any rpg. The lore is also pretty cool.
1671	1	a	Addictive combat system, lost of quests. Solid RPG, it's sucked me in.
1673	1	a	Good campaign, I would put it up there with the original Fable and DA: Origins. Plenty of sidequests and lore to get caught up in, and a surprising ending. Worth a play for any fan of RPG's; just wait until its on sale.
1675	1	a	Combat dodging is somewhat janky, but otherwise a great game IMO :) Well worth it on a sale.
1677	1	a	Apart from reckoning mode and some combat aspects, this is just like a generic singleplayer MMORPG. It's sorta fun though and it looks (and runs) nice. Worth the money I guess.
1679	1	a	TL:DR, I gave this game a 7.5/10, it feels like Darksiders 2, WoW, TERA and Torchlight 2 had sex. Minus mounts (as far as my knowledge goes) and Jumping.  The game, to me isn't very immersive but addicting, sometiems it feels like one of those games that you need to force yourself to play, like Dota 2, it's not interesting you untill you force yourself to play it.  The game feels like it began as a third-person dungeon crawler RPG similar to Torchlight II turned MMO then reduced to a sandbox RPG that leaves the Dungeon Crawler and MMO elements.  The controls + camera movement gets disorientating sometimes, it's very 'woah duuude' if you haven't touched it in a while but it's easy to get use to it.  It's also very easy to get lost doing quests, the main quest and faction quests branch off all over the place leading you to more similar quests and it's easy to get lost in all of these quests, I haven't played long enough to see how rewarding faction quests are, I only have roughly 6 hours on record (I have about 4-5 or so hours in offline mode).  The skill tree system I find is a bit weird and hasn't got alot of variety but it's still good nonetheless.  The video options are a bit limited, I can't find anythign regarding resolutiuon settings so some menus stretch off screen but are still workable.  At the moment there's not a whole lot of armour variety regarding plate armour for brawlers, though i haven't progressed far, Not sure about the other classes though.  The stealth system, I haven't really explored it but from what I know it feels and seems like it's fairly decent, I never really did stealth outside the tutorial level unless I was stealing from chests.  Regarding some other things, the game world is VERY large, it reminds me of World of Warcraft but.. a little larger, a better example of this is, if you've played Darksiders, specifically Darksiders 2 you'd understand what I mean by how open the game is, by this I mean that it takes a fair while to get from place to place and I'm not sure if there's a mount system or not.   With leveling it's kind of? slow but not at the same time, my first 5 levels it felt liek I shoul've been a higher level because of all the crap I did before hand, yeah you can do ALOT between levels so sometimes it feels like you should be a higher level.   Another example of this is, some games, like, you don't normally find yourself killing giant trolls, ettins or whatever like the ones in this game till you're a higher level and it feels so rewarding yet it feels like you shouldn't be killing them in such large numbers. I'm a long term World of Warcraft user and a user of TERA, so, this will sound weird, this next part is a little hard to explain, In the likes of WoW or TERA most of these 'giants', when you kill them in numbers like you do in this game, in other MMO's or RPG's i've played they're usually scaled smaller then the others or placed in very thin numbers, I don't know this is what I mean by it feeling like it was made as an MMORPG then made singleplayer, the game is very unique and strange if you're like me and are use to games like WoW or TERA, A better example would be Darksiders 2 minus the mount and colossal gods, yeah that sounds like a better mechanic example mixed with TERA and WoW.  if you must know, I refer to games like TERA or WoW because of how 'loose' the game looks and feels and the artistic style is similar, it just isn't right to compare it to the likes of Skyrim because Skyrim is a fairly solid feeling game and is impossible to think of WoW while playing Skyrim unlike this particular game.  Another thing I will mention, it feels weird seeing an RPG with this artistic design style that uses Ragdol physics, imagine World of Warcraft with Ragdoll physics... yeah lol.. but it's still good, it's great that made the larger ragdolls interactible as well, like you can push Ettin and troll corpses around, another thing to not, the ragdoll physaics is hilarious sometimes when an NPC has a death animation then snaps to ragdoll, sometimes the ragdolls just freak out.  I can go on longer but the rest is just fiddly stuff, overall I give this game a 7.5/10, If you like open world RPG's similar to WoW, TERA and as open as the likes of Darksiders, I'd recomend you get this game.
1681	1	a	Hands down one of the best RPG games I've played - topping along with Skyrim and Fallout-series.  I noticed a lot of people comparing this to a Fable/Dragon Age-hybrid, however I think it stands out from either of those with its own unique style - still maintaining key elements to making the game highly fun.  All you need to know about this game is written below (you can thank me later...)  - The graphics are noteworthy for its 'comical' - even somewhat childish - scale, but that only sweetens the pot. - The gameplay (in terms of combat/skills/ability) it's fluently vigorating and superbly executed. Combining both weapon-combos along with spells/skills, you can create a butt-load of different ways to dispatch enemies. - Reckoning mode - enough said - Combine a great arsenal of skills and spells from 3 different class-types - Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue/ranger) and Sorcery (mages) - progess to the top tier of any of those 3 styles or even combine 2 - hell - even all 3 into a staff-wielding, trap-setting, Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Hook-pulling, Hammer-smashing God(!) of power - The loot - so many items, so many sets and crafting combos. Damn, son! - Voice-acting/sounds and music - it's solid, not anything revolutionary, but solid - Keeps track of how many chickens you kill    Highly recommended  9.2/10 
1683	1	a	This game has more content than the entirity of Burning Crusade era World of Warcraft, but with a more engaging combat system. Think Zelda 64 meets World of Warcraft and you've pretty much got it.  The major problem with this game is the difficulty. Even on the hardest setting the game is mind numbingly easy.  If you're the type of person who doesn't care about challenge or regularly plays with cheat codes just to have fun this is a great game for you.
1685	1	a	I just want to start off by saying that this is one of the most satisfying role playing games that I have ever played. I enjoy it more than Skyrim Chakrams OP
1687	1	a	A criminally overlooked game. For the first game os a studio, it's amazing and I'm sad they drowned in debt shortly after it. But, at the very least, we got this lovely thing. I wouldn't put it too high on your list, but it's one of the better action RPG's you'll find. A refreshing world that at least seems to try to weave some new dwarves/elves, and feels quite fantastic. It's also very colourful. Skyrim looks better, but this game FEELS better. (though they're both still 'alright/good') And... uhm... look up sometimes. There's more to those trunks than you think!
1689	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMEND -- LOVE THIS GAME.... It's a Must Have for RPGrs!!!  Honestly... I've never really been much into Graphics or Music... so for that I'm going to assume that both are fine. Personally, I don't see an issue there, but again... not really my thing.  Okay... no game is truly perfect, so I will make one complaint. Armour-sets, which are available, are a problem to attain before they become obsolete; unless, of course, you use the internet and try to find them early. I like having a well-dressed adventurer... so that kind of sucks, because I won't use the internet to spoil my game play.  Now with that said....  Game Play... beyond awesome. This game was created with ME in mind. I often restart a character several times before completing the game, because I'm curious as to how other builds would do in this game... in short... which would I truly enjoy most. With this game, you can actually re-set all your stats, for the most part, at any given time. Thus, if Warrior isn't floating your boat, become a Rogue... just like that; without having to start a new game.  The missions in this game is another point of great excitement. Besides the fact of being a completely NON-Linear game, there are tons of Faction Missions... Side Missions... and Others which can peak your interest, or even immerse yourself in your own Character's Story. Admittedly, all missions; Story, Faction, etc., are a bit linear in the sense that you complete the mission Their way or not at all... but if that's the only down side... I can live with that. As well, I'm finding the various stories of this world fascinating... like a really good book; Very Well Written!!!!  Combat is a whole 'nother story... or more like an Epic Tale. Besides the many many many diferent attacks that are available, I love the fact that it's not just about point and click. Timing makes a difference, direction makes a difference, distance makes a difference, reflexes make a difference. (just as an example.... Boggarts are one of the easy mobs in this game... I got murdered by 4 of them, because I wasn't paying attention and I got cocky; That's a Real Game).  Special Note: If you get and play the demo for this game, it really doesn't do it justice. If I recall correctly, it gives you a time limit, and an area limit... this is their mistake. It should be limited by a certain level... maybe 5 or 6; by then, you'll get a true feel for this game.  I easily give this game 6 thumbs up out of 5...and a Slap on the Hand, to me, for not finding it sooner.
1691	1	a	I'm level 4 and more testing is needed, but it's fun so far
1693	1	a	A straight up old school style one person fantasy RPG. Lots of fun, with decent graphics, great voice acting and music. A rich world with lots of deep back story. Tons of side quests: I have played around 40 hours and doubt I am half-way through...A few flaws, but over all a good game.
1695	1	a	Nice relaxing game. Lots of options to explore and many enviroments and characters to see!
1697	1	a	An amazing bargain at Steam sale prices. Feels like a MMORPG without all the annoying players. Easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or all day. Best game ever financed by the state of Rhode Island.
1699	1	a	Really underrated RPG, it does have some problems and its has that 'Fable feel' to it but still manages to give an amazing experience! TOTALLY RECOMENDED.
1701	1	a	its like a colorful version of skyrim....but easier and less intense.
1703	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. I can't rate it high enough.
1705	1	a	Well, you'll possibly beat some hours into this game... However I would probably not buy it at full price, I'd wait untill it is on sale.
1707	1	a	This will be a LONG review, so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an open(ish) world RPG. At least, that's how most people see it. The biggest downfall of the game is that the public image of the game is so far offset from what the game actually is. Many people dismissed it at first as a Skyrim-clone, which could not be any further from the truth.  Skyrim focused on having deep RPG stats, and sacrificed the prospect of having enjoyable combat to make sure the stats were deep and balanced. Most of Skyrim's combat boils down to 'run up to something and click repeatedly until it dies', which made the combat wear over very quickly on me. Instead, Amalur focused on having fun combat first and foremost, and as a result some of the stat building is not as deep or complicated as Skyrim's. Instead of having deep stats and simple combat, Amalur has deep combat and somewhat simple stat building.  Amalur's combat systems are inspired by character action games, such as Devil May Cry or God of War. You have a primary and secondary attack (which are determined by what weapons you have equipped. Different weapon types give you different movesets), a dodge, magical abilities, and a Devil Trigger, which is called Reckoning mode. You can juggle some of the game's smaller enemies, and there are some advanced systems in the game such as dodge cancelling, which will come naturally to any character action fan. It feels fun and genuinley rewarding to try out the dozens of different weapon combinations, though one of the most effective weapon combo is introduced in the game's tutorial -- Longswords have a built in juggle, and you can juggle enemies with a bow and arrow. It's a fun combination, but far better ones exist if you experiment with the combat system.  The fun combat is further aided by the fact that you can build your character in almost ANY way and it's valid. Wanna build a Rogue-Mage hybrid? It's a thing. Wanna do a boring, straight Warrior? Unimaginitve, but it works. Wanna be a mix of all three classes? YES, you can do that! This is one of the few RPG's I've ever played where you can build however YOU like and it'll work. Most RPG's have a feeling that there are only one or two classes which are the best, and you shouldn't bother with anything else. But in Amalur you're free to build however you want.  I also enjoy the character building more than Skyrim's because you get two different types of skill points every time you level up. You get skill points for leveling up combat abilities, and skill points for leveling up other abilities such as lockpicking or crafting. Remember in Skyrim how you'd level up and then you wouldn't actually get any more powerful because you put your skill point into alchemy or something instead of one-handed? That isn't a problem here. You will have constant character growth both in terms of power, and crafting abilities. I feel like you start out weaker than an average skyrim character in this game, but you gain power FAR more quickly. It's a rather fast and enjoyable pace for character development.  The enviornments are a little more of a mixed bag. They're far more varried and beautiful than Skyrim's enviornments, but you aren't allowed to freely explore them like how you could in Skyrim. Try to explore too far into the world and you'll be insta-killed by enemies who vastly overpower you. But, once you do get to those better enviornments, you'll marvel in their extreme beauty. Some of the vistas I saw were jaw-dropping.  The music is also an upside. Ever head of Grant Kirkhope, the musical composer behind Banjo Kazooie? He did the music for this game, and it's just as good, if a little more serious than Banjo Kazooie's wacky toons.  Now, for the downsides. You level up very quickly, and there's an abundance of side-quests in the game so you can reach max level without even trying. This is especially true if you buy the DLC's. The DLC's are very well made, but don't increase the max level at all, so it becomes even easier to overlevel if you buy them.  Remember those skills I mentioned which aren't combat oriented? Some are far, FAR better than others. Firstly, there's little point in leveling up lockpicking, because there are TWO lockpicking skills (lockpicking and dispelling). Even if you're a master lockpick, you won't be able to get all the chests in the world, because you're not a master at dispelling. Meanwhile, if you max out blacksmithing, you can make armor BETTER THAN A FULL LEGENDARY ARMOR SET GIVEN TO YOU RIGHT BEFORE THE FINAL BOSS. With blacksmithing AND sagecrafting maxed out, it's possible to have so much health regen that you can never see yourself take damage. Which brings me to the main bad point of this game...  The game is too easy. Play on Hard mode first. Even then, the game won't be especially hard. I've heard of mods that make the game harder, but I can't personally speak to their effectiveness. If you're here for an immense challenge, you won't find it.  Additionally, to those of you who enjoyed how open Skyrim was, Amalur is a little more confined. Instead of being a huge open world, there are about 20 or so large zones which're broken up by linear paths. Imagine it as a group of small, diverse worlds to explore, as opposed to one huge one which looks mostly the same. And exploration of some zones is locked off by main quest progress.  Speaking of the main quest, the story is rather run-of-the-mill. It has some very good concepts, but execution is rather lackluster. You probably won't care about the story much, for the main quest or sidequests. Though, it's worth mentioning that some characters are VERY well written. Your main motivation for reaching end game won't be beating the game, but instead to kill your nemesis who is built up very well throughout the game.  TL;DR  Did you think Skyrim could've used better, deeper, Devil May Cry like combat?  Do you hate when an RPG forces you to choose between leveling up combat abilties, or crafting abilities?  Do you like the idea of being able to build your character in any way and still having it be a viable build?  Are you okay with a game having amazing music and breathtaking vistas, at the cost of a little less of an open world?  Are you okay with the fact that this game won't be very hard, even at the highest difficulty?  Then Kingdoms of Amalur is for you.
1709	1	a	I have played this game with no steam and with steam it was fun better then Skyrim but this is just my opinion.  The only thing I hate is that there are no Japanese swords (Katana)
1711	1	a	Love this game! can play it over again and enjoy it as much as the first time. Enjoyed the story the characters, the variety of weapons are fun. Everything in the game is beautiful, i havnt tried playing with the keyboard and mouse but it works perfectly with the xbox controller.   The only thing i found annoying at times is the angle of which you play at. I feel as though it should have been more zoomed out. Sometimes whilst fighting multiple enemies i couldnt see the ones behind me. Oh and the ending of the story, not sure if i was expecting better that made it seem bad or because i was quessing the story line when it came close to the end.   But i still love it!!!
1713	1	a	I bought this because of the outstanding reviews and wasn't sure what exaclty to expect. I'm no game connoisseur but I can get lost playing Skyrim for 24+ hours straight and I have high expectations for a open-world/RPG type game...this hasn't disapointed me yet. It's has a complex system of crafting, abilites, classes, weaponry... The multitude of weapon choices is probably my favorite part. It's everything you would expect from a game of this genre and then some.  It has a fantastic story line that vaguely reminds me of lord of the rings. The graphics remind me of my WoW days with a hint of Fable III.   I love that fact that there is a quickbar (something that annoys me in many games), the ability to switch between primary and secondary weapons, an awesome skill build system, and really just the ability to take control of every aspect of gameplay. It's almost like a awesome marriage between some of the best games but with it's own twist. The lock-picking/stealing and sagecrafting is what really sold me as I started playing, this game really does have it all. There's usually issues with any sort of crossover to PC game, but this has handled wonderfully on my system (which is by no means a top of the line build) and I didn't have to adjust the graphics down to be able to play comfortably.   Just buy it. At times it can seem a little bit childish or PG but it's never long before something jumps out at me and scares my pants off. You really won't be disapointed by this.   As a huge skyrim fan: 8.5/10 As an ADHD kid: 10/10
1715	1	a	I was first hesitant about getting this game, but now, I cannot remember playing a single player game I enjoy more. I got it on sale, and decided to try it out. I had the DLC, so the start went reasonably well, but it could be a bit slow without it.   I would recommend this game if you enjoy RPG games in general, or just want to try something new. Pretty nice graphics, amazing combat interactivity among other RPG games, and a great storyline (If you're that type of person) which is kind of confusing at first, but then is grasped later on.  Overall, simply a great game.
1717	1	a	Utterly and completely AMAZING! Totally worth the money!
1719	1	a	Game Name: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning Developer: 38 Studios / Big Huge Games Genre: Role Playing / RPG   History: I first played Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning on the xbox 360 2 years ago about 6 months after it's debute. I loved it! I saw it on sale on here and picked it up. I had a blast playing though it a second time.  Story: You are the 'Fateless One' you start the game off as a dead body. You are dumped down onto a pile of bodies in what seems to be an incinerator room. Shortly after you wake up and find the place you are at under attack. As you progress though the story you find out how you came to be, and that you have no 'fate' and are able to change the fates of those around you. This leads you on a quest to stop the evil Tuatha Deohn, their King Gadflow and their God Tirnoch all of whom want you dead a second time.  Game play: This is where is game shines and also falls short. You can chose from any combination of three classes Warrior, Rogue, or Mage. You have many skills and a very well done progession tree. You can also redo your toon anytime you want at a fatewaver for a price. This is very well done to me it allows us the players never to be tired down to one class. If you want to be a mage and use a greatsword as your main weapon do it!! You also have a unique power to fateshift enemies. This grats an experience bonus and each enemy has a different fateshift death all of them are really cool. The monsters in the games quests level with you but, on the open world map they have set levels. This ensures that you can't get too far ahead as enemies will start to one shot you before too long. As for the games difficulty it's a very easy game. They made it way to easy to make your toon unkillable ( Unlike in skyrim where there is an armor cap making heary armor useless accpet for looks as you can never get past 80% damage reduction ) In this game there is no cap at all on armor or resistance. I had made my toon almost unkillable by about 20 hours into the game. That's where is falls short the first time. You should never have a 'no cap on armor or resistance' always cap them at least 80%. This also made to me all the sets of armor pretty useless. None of them could come close to what I could make just by socketing a few gems into dropped armors. This also sets the game up for you to have a lot of fun making your perfect unkillable toon though. By the end of the game when you have access to flawless blacksmithing you can in fact make a toon that cannot be killed. I had a great time making my unkillable mage with -100% mana costs. I had a blast just slinging spells left and right completely obliterating all that opposed my demigod powers!  Where is game really falls short is making the people and stories interesting. After the first few hours of gameplay I found myself skipping all the dialogue and just following the yellow circles on the map. The people are boring and the way they talk in that monotone voice set put me to sleep. Only a few of the main assist charactors have thier own unique models it. Everyone else in the entire game pretty much looks the same. I found this to be very boring. They could have used more soundbites as well... I hated running though adessa every single gnome says 'What!!' as you walk past and all the humans say 'yes, aye' just one trip made me mute the sound till I left the city. If they had made the toons more unique and added more soundbites it would have been so much better.  This game is still soild in the gameplay field 7/10   Graphics: The graphics are nothing special they seem to be really basic to me. They are cartoonish and fun. They don't try to make you go ohhhh wow..... they just do their job. That's really the best way I can describe them again just solid 6/10  Audio: This game is fully voiced although sometimes you mite find yourself muting the volume. The tones are so boring no emotion, everyone is like a robot. The soundtrack is decient The battle themes and town themes fit where you are and what you have doing. It's all really average. 6/10   Pro’s/Con’s:   Pros Wonderful combat system Very well done skill trees You can fateshift enemies killing them in amazing ways. many armors and weapons to chose from you can make your own armor and weapons (to Godly Standards if you want) many, many quests!! there are some funny moments with glitchs in the game, like people walking though or getting stuck in walls that'll make you laugh.  Cons   I can sum up the only real con with this game. I will not remeber anything about it other than combat after awhile. Everything not related to combat was boring!! Compare this to Skyrim where I can tell you the whole story and recall most of the peoples names even after having not played it for so long. With this game that I beat just latenight I cannot recall the names of any of the people accpet Gadflow, Tirnoch, Agarth and Alyn Shir. Everyone else I have forgot as it just didn't hold my interest at all.    Overall: This is a wonderful game to play just to pass the time. If you are looking for a game with a Story and Characters you can really sink your teeth into to me it's not this game. If you are looking for a game where you can kill all that oppose you or protect all the weak with your godlike powers this is perfect. To really sum it up this game has amazing combat and that's really it, everything else is just average.   I give this game a 7/10   I had a wonderful time killing each and every enemy with my fateshifting powers.
1721	1	a	Game looks nice, but it is made for playstation, so little bit worst controling. But it is acceptable. Game looks perfect, nice combat, and looks there will be lots of fun. I just gut bad luck, coz I already played TES: Skyrim, so I DONT RECOMMEND it if you already play that, coz nothing cannot be compared with that and others RPG´s wont be playable :) If you dont play skyrim I DO RECOMMEND for you! :)
1723	1	a	Highly recommended, hours of fun guaranteed. +++
1725	1	a	At first, I had a hard time adjusting to this game... And now, I am addicted.  Pros: - Excellent story lines (even with the side quests) - Very good combat system, you can mix up all of the 3 classes (warrior, rogue and mage), wich I personal find very useful.  You can also join all the different factions in the game, and even buy titles in some cities. - Every story and quest is voice acted, and they are fairly good acted as well. - If you like cartoon-ish graphics, this will be something for you. - Fast travel between cities and dungeons. - Maxed level at 40, wich I find good as this will keep the game balanced.  - 3 modes -Casual, Normal and Hard. - Cool looking weapons and armors. - You can alter your fate (specs) at any time in this game, just find a fateweaver (icon looks like a deck of cards)  Cons: - Main quests are done too fast, in my oppinion. - Sound is/can be buggy during battles and in areas with too many sounds at the same time. - After a few fights with the different enemies in this game, you quickly learn the way they fight, so they become quite  quite easy to kill. - Some of the side quest can be repeated, sadly this can be quite annoying as you can´t remove them from your list. - Only one quest at the time can be marked, shows a yellow ring on the map. The white rings are the other quests. - The 2 DLC´s are way too easy to complete. A max of 2 hours each. - Game does not seem to be supported no more.  All in all, this game is a really good single player RPG, and without a doubt worth trying.
1727	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is an interesting game. It seems like the developers of this game wanted to make their own Elder Scrolls game and built it from there. Rudimentary, shallowly implemented elements are present: theft, crime with the bounty system, personal homes you can upgrade and the like. However when it comes down to it the game focuses more on the combat and it does it pretty well.  Considering how much combat makes up these open world types of RPGs that's enough to buoy it to a tentative recommend. Much of the shortcoming of Skyrim and the like is the lackluster combat and this game certainly delivers. Everything else is just good enough to keep the game engaging. It's a fun game, although you can quickly grow overpowered. Worth a look when it's on sale, but I can see why it didn't meet its sales goal by a longshot.
1729	1	a	Best game i had right now yeah gonna end it
1731	1	a	Pros: 1. This is a long game, probably the longest RPG ive ever played at 100+ hours with the DLC (i bought as a package on steam)   2. Good world for such a large game, nice voice acting, face animations and the towns do feel lived in.  3. heaps of enemies, loot and quests. wonderful range of ways to craft items, one fo the best crafting mechanics out there.  Cons:-  1. the game is not well balanced, on hard, the second half of the game is a stroll. loot became redundant once you max blacksmithing, the items you create are few levels more powerful than legendary items.  2. quests are tedious, most if not all the quests are about fetching smoething or killing someone. pair this with the game being too easy, a lot of quests becomes very tedious.  3. story is almost non-existant, nothing really happens, even if it does you dont care about the character.  i would say that this game offers great value, you can kill a lot of things, loot a lot of stuff and have plenty of quests. Sadly this great value diminishes or dilutes the gameplay, its like drinking very cheap coffee during an event. you dont really like it, but it offers something to help you stay awake 
1733	1	a	Plenty of content, plenty of good, gritty fun.
1735	1	a	Such a shame that 38 Studios went down under after the release of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. I believe this is what Dragon Age 2 should have been, while it may lack in some parts of its narrative, there are all kinds of things that can get you immersed, I do believe this is a great game to buy, preferred when its on sale.
1737	1	a	This is the best single player MMO you will ever play
1739	1	a	I really enjoy this game. I tried playing it once shortly after it came out and for whatever reason I couldn't get into it. Tried again a week or so ago and I'm hooked. It feels very much like a Fable/Skyrim combo to me. It's very simplistic like Fable, and the graphics are more similar to Fable, but the open world aspects and a lot of the character design process feels more like Elder Scrolls (of course one of the designers is from Oblivion, so that makes sense). The game isn't complicated at all, but there's enough quest variety and the combat is fun to keep me from getting bored.
1741	1	a	I played the crap out of this on my console back when it very first came out. I saw it on sale and picked it up quickly. This game is amazing, and has so many hours you can put into it. I reccomend buying this, sale or not. Well worth the money (:
1743	1	a	started game not to long ago, and i love playing it. Loads of side quests, great graphics, great story. awesome fighting style.
1745	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has a rich lore, excellent combat (TIP: play this on HARD, normal is too easy), solid graphics, simple, yet deep and customisable leveling system, and TONS of content.   In fact, the amount of content is overwhelming, especially for a new IP. There are tons of armor and weapons and crafting items, and quests (especially with the DLC) that you will spend many, MANY, hours playing this game is you intend to do everything there is to do (I've clocked at over 230 hours).   I really can't recommend this game enough. If you like high-fantasy action-RPG's, you can't go wrong here.
1747	1	a	SMMORPGBNRAMMOGBISSPATBOTA: Singleplayer massively multiplayer online role playing game but not really a massivly multiplayer online game because it says singleplayer at the beginning of this acronymn. But seriously I played just the campagin with no side quests and my total play time so far clocks out at 27 hours. I played this in offline mode though so it dosent show up in the review.
1749	1	a	Very engaging RPG game. Lots of side quests to complete. Open world awesomeness, together with really great combat system. How many hours of sleep do I owe this game...  Overall, though bits and pieces of mistakes, it is a very incredible game, and a must-play game for all RPG-lovers.  9.5/10
1751	1	a	This is a solid RPG thats is a great addition to any game collection. If you enjoyed playing the original Fable you should enjoy this game. Very similar feel but on a bigger scale, with better combat mechanics and diversity of special combo moves.
1753	1	a	One of the best stories I have ever seen in a RPG. The combat is challenging and epic. 10/10 Amazing!
1755	1	a	I normally do not care much for the third person style of gameplay, but find myself quite enjoying this one. I would recommend it!
1757	1	a	This game is great and i have only played for a couple hours but those couple will turn into at least 40 because this game is a lot of fun. The combat is really good and fun. quests are good and plentiful there is always something to do. I like the art direction as well. This is a must have for any RPG fan
1759	1	a	Great Action RPG, filled with Fable-like combat, tons of content and great story line, doesnt offer that much replayability, but having the option to change classes in the same savegame seems to work like a charm in this game, it does have lots of quest and stuff, but if you are like me that enjoy doing everything in the first run then you wont have that much to do on your second run, if you have enough time to kill, this is a great game with great gameplay.
1761	1	a	What is wrong with this game? Well, so far, it's that it suffers from the crippling disease that Fable 2 suffered from...the company over-hyped the whole game idea and concept.  Also, Skyrim. 'Cause, let's face it, Bethesda has years of experience and an established engine they have been fine-tuning and improving for the better part of a decade. This studio didn't have the years, experience, or group work that Bethesda holds onto, but, as a Freshman release (this was their one and ONLY game), it definitely holds up a pretty high bar for first release. Nothing about the game is revolutionary...it is a pretty generic game overall. Open world concept (Elder Scrolls, GTA, Sacred), but semi-lineared (like sacred), high octane combat (God Of War, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta), a solid skill tree (Champions of Norrath, Dragon Age, Guild Wars 2), and a fairly vibrant world. Yes, it borrows elements from all of these, but it definitely does fall shy of any them in terms of the elements. The game is solid. Just, solid. It's smooth, has fairly impressive voice-acting, and nothing but the generic fetch and kill quests seem lacking.  That's is it's major pro, is that it is a solid action RPG. Champions of Norrath meets God of War in a semi-open world, and does it very well. The combat is fluid, the world exploring is fun. It isn't quite sandbox....your map isn't a giant square that lets you go wherever among the four walls that is the map. It's semi-enclosed, but still fairly large and definitely explorable. I've never been able to get engrossed in the Elder Scrolls or Fallout series for that reason alone...the map is TOO open...my OCD combined with my want to explore just get me frustrated in a few minutes of wondering what the hell to do. Kingdoms keeps the areas more enclosed and organized, while still leaving room for plenty of wandering and visiting.  I recommend the game for any RPG or Hack and Slash lover. It's foundation is solid. Very solid. It's a shame the game didn't kick off as well as it needed to for the company to grow and expand on the engine...it has major potential.
1763	1	a	This game is just superb. The styles of combat are so completely varied and intuitive that it almost holds it up on it's own. That, mixed with the gorgeous scenery, talented voice actors, and the sheer amount of weapons, armor, potions, and quests are what make it golden. The crafting is also quite in depth, you salvage weapons/armor for hilt, blades and various other things to make your own gear, and experimenting with different ingredients to make just the potion you needed is just great.   But honestly, this review would not be complete without Reckoning Mode; a slowmo, kill all, Bayonetta style super finish that just makes crushing your enemies a dream.   Though I'll say this, it's not   perfect.   The game itself can be somewhat easy at times, but fear not!   Youngneil's Amalur Mod fixes all that, and can be fully customized.  I'd rate it a 7/10 without the mod, but with it, I'd give it a   much   deserved 8/10
1765	1	a	Super pretty, super fun, and really dynamic. The story is really interesting and immersive. There's a ton of things to do too. One of the best story-driven RPGs to make my favorite list.
1767	1	a	Maybe one of the best games of the decade in my opinion. Story by some of my favorite authors (you can really tell in most cases), gameplay executed in a simple, easy to figure out setup, and visually appealing. I've put many hours into this game on the Playstation and I'm glad it came to steam for me to buy. If you're looking for a simple, story driven RPG with a customizable combat style, this is probably your game.  Just want to point out, though, that many people are put off by linear stories anymore with how many sandbox type RPG's are out there, but don't let that fool all of you. Get this game if you have a chance.
1769	1	a	So far, I am really loving this game! I actually prefer it over Skyrim, just because it is not as repetitive. The gameplay is simple, but not to the point of being a super easy kind of game, although, once you acquire the best spells you're a bit overpowered lol
1771	1	a	Buy this game it is amazing, lots of fun! was looking at this for a long time and not sure if i would like it, very happy i made the purchase well worth it, great game.
1773	1	a	One of the best combats in any action RPG.  The quest are a bit repetitive but the combat is just amazing.
1775	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Rektoning ( ͡º ͜ʖ ͡º) i r8 8/8 m8
1777	1	a	One of the best games I've played thus far from any RPG open world game I've played!! Really it's a must grab game!
1779	1	a	I dropped a meteor on a bunch of dogs. enough said
1781	1	a	Fully recommend this game, scored it during steam sale for next to nothing. Best way i can explain it is a more cartoonish/fable version of skyrim. Fantasy, lvling up, finding gear, questing to your hearts content through side quests or main story, mixing it up and creating your own character/class  Clocked about 10 hours gameplay in past couple day and loving it i do however get bored very easily and theres alot of running about but it hasn't stopped me happily playing yet!
1783	1	a	This is my first review of any game here on steam. I am new to computer gaming. Better late than never, I suppose.   Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was one of the first purchases I made. Having dropped WoW and recently completing a run trough of ESO; I wanted something more immersive. I was looking for something that was simple and fun, yet challenging in the sense of having a lot to do. I lucked up and found this game during the Steam Summer Sale.   I have only played about six hours so far. But already I am hooked. It is everything I was looking for. There are so many quests in this game that the main story line is easily overlooked. I love that you can set your own pace. Do what quests you like or want.   The combat and actions are relatively simple, but I like that about it. To me; games are meant to be fun. Don't get me wrong, I love to be challenged, and I have had moments where a preparing for a fight or a game has been more like homework than play-time, but this KoA: Reckoning is straightforward and fun. Simple as that.   One of the things I love about it is the art. I am a sucker for a game with not only good graphics, but the art behind the graphics. The style. I'm not good at explaining these things, but I'm sure once you start playing, you'll understand what i mean. It's really just a beautiful game all around. I love the world and the characters I have met so far.   In short; the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is well worth a spot in your library. I paid a small price, but even if I had paid in full it would have still been worth it.
1785	1	a	EA helped to make it so do with that what you will.
1787	1	a	This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Highly underrated. It is as good as Skyrim in its own way. I love the combat system and the story is engaging.
1789	1	a	Inventory system is a little bit clunky to use but once you get past that this game is damn entertaining
1791	1	a	This game makes me hard. 10/10 would bang
1793	1	a	To say this game is anything short of astonishing would be an insult. Yes there are some bugs still in the game but in my entire time playing the game I've only ever run into one small bug which had no impact on my playing at all. This is a game that gives Skyrim a run for its money and while I deeply wish there were more content in store for future releases it doesn't appear that will be the case any time soon. None the less the story is told brilliantly and keeps you on the edge of your seat and when you are looking for a break there is a plethora of exploration and side quests and stories you can dive right into. The DLC for the game adds all new paths to explore and things to do allowing you to become lost in awe and amazement at the world before you. With all there is to do in this game you can easily get a couple hundred hours of enjoyment from it and still come back for more.  If Skyrim is your cup of tea then I highly recommend this game as you will not be disappointed by what you see.
1795	1	a	Great game all around.
1797	1	a	Very fun game! This is the game that Fable 2 and 3 should have been.
1799	1	a	It's great, my favorite game. Massive open world with loads of quest and a huge amount of gameplay available. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit of money on this amazing game.
1801	1	a	This game is a 100% buy at this price. It's like a more combat-oriented Skyrim and I really quite like it.
1803	1	a	Truly an amazing RPG, one of the best I've played in years!
1805	1	a	While not being flawless, the game offers strong narratives and fresh concepts with regard to lore especially the different houses and not quite reincarnation the fae undergo. I found myself using the same few moves which by the end of the game had run their course, but respecing is painfree and easy so you are able to try all the skills without starting the game over
1807	1	a	pretty cool game all around. definately worth playing.
1809	1	a	I had waited to see how this game would turn out when it was in development. I was disappointed when I heard 38 Studios went under and that this might never be released but for one EA did something right and allowed it's release. I have been having a blast with it so far, it's similar to Skyrim in customization of play but the actual fights are more involved and alot more enjoyable.
1811	1	a	Pretty good game, sad that they couldn't make a multiplayer which would have made this game amazing. At least a co-op
1813	1	a	Save your money. Salvatore and McFarlane are hacks, and the sheer deadness of the story in this game + reptitive game play makes this game a waste of time and money.
1815	1	a	Imagine Skyrim stuck in third person and simplified.
1817	1	a	A pretty good action hack-n-slash game with a gorgeous world filled with some interesting lore. The game falls short towards end game because the player can be really overpowered and not much is challenging anymore.
1819	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time. Buy it.
1821	1	a	KOA:R looks like 'World of Warcraft' and plays like 'God of War'. Some reviews are billing this game as an underrated classic. That's being a bit charitable, in my opinion, but this is still a solid 100+ hours of adventure.  The world is huge and varied, with lots of real estate to explore and faction quests to pursue, but most of what you'll be doing is 'Go here and kill/collect X,' which gets old fast. The combat mechanics are fast and fluid, with many weapon types and skills to mix'n'match, but it is disappointingly unchallenging. Do yourself a favor and jack up the difficulty, especially if you invest in the crafting system, which utterly breaks the game.  A lot of thought was put into developing the Amalur setting, but I had trouble getting invested, as every character seemed to vomit exposition on me at the slightest provocation. I just stopped talking to people after a while. The last 20 hours of my playthrough was completed almost out of sheer stubbornness to not leave a game unfinished.  If KOA:R looks remotely interesting to you, then it's probably worth getting on sale. But there's nothing here that will convert newcomers to the genre the way 'Skyrim' or 'Dark Souls' can.
1823	1	a	Recommended.
1825	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥es on yo ♥♥♥♥ caz u got a big ♥♥♥ hammer!
1827	1	a	I enjoyed this game immensely. It has smooth &amp; fun combat, beautiful graphics, lots of quests and lore. You can craft and even buy houses. It is a very time-consuming game though, since the world is very big. The main storyline is pretty linear and because of that, I'd only play through it once. But I can definitely recommend it, if you have time on your hands. 9/10
1829	1	a	Heaps of fun, game looks nice and combat system is easy to pick up
1831	1	a	Good RPG, should of been Fable 3
1833	1	a	First part of the game bugged out. A gate would not open for me (The part where you get the bow and need to shoot the soldiers across the room). If anyone got a fix for this issue. please let me know. Love this game and it's kinda sad that I can't even get past the first part.
1835	1	a	It's kind of a cheap The Elder Scrolls title, considering the RPG elements they have borrowed. But: not so open world as much. For a few bucks it's recommendable though.
1837	1	a	I actually really enjoyed this game :) I'm sad not alot of others did. Still, I'm happy to have it on Steam. I hate Origin....
1839	1	a	I've only played a little bit of this game so far but I'm already loving it. I wouldn't really call it an 'Open World' like it says in the tag but the map does look pretty huge. I can see getting alot of gameplay out of this one:)
1841	1	a	Its like fable 2, but not crap
1843	1	a	Very underrated RPG. Totally worth giving it a play through. Has plenty of hours of gameplay and even more with the DLC. Thumbs Up.
1845	1	a	This is an interesting game. But doesn't have very much replayability. The game becomes repetitive and boring after a while. But the graphics are good, and the mechanics are solid.
1847	1	a	really good for epic RPG action adventure :p
1849	1	a	Nice game, good mechanics, interesting system with the fate bar.  Good story so far, quite good graphics. Fae Blades (Warglaives!!!).
1851	1	a	Not the best rpg, but still a fun time, get it while steam sale is on. Combat is great. only bad thing is im having a sound issue.
1853	1	a	I'm giving it a yes for now but I don't know what it is that bothers me about this game, the comabte , is good, the stories are interesting. I just don't know I feel like it's elder scrolls put into a fable game without the soundtracks. It is a good game don't get me wrong it's that I don't have a want to play it.
1855	1	a	This is one of those things... I like my ♥♥♥♥♥ and my god this has a lot of it. But it falls short in other points.  Story: Chosen one. YET AGAIN! Every ♥♥♥♥ing story with swords MUST have a chosen one. How about a character that's in a situation that rises above. Not preordained because then what's the ♥♥♥♥ing point if you're expected to win. Oh also it's very poorly written and dull. Dull missions. Very generic writing.  Combat: Nothing wrong with it per ce, but you'll find yourself repeating the same two moves over and over with no trouble pretty soon.  Skill trees: I have a real problem with skill trees with no commitment. I also have problems with skill trees with intentionally poor skills just so you have a tree. This has both.  Cosmetics: Universe is fine. Character is fine. Everything is fine. EXCEPT that some skills make you glow colours. So when you have puke green combined with deep blue and red it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. And the game is 3rd person so it's not like you can ignore that stuff. And it's not multiplayer so I have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea why they did it at all. It's not necessary to showcase your buffs.  Conclusion: It's okay. I've just noted the bad stuff. I put in 60 hours so it's not terrible. Also here's another thing. In that 60 hours, I did not finish the game. I was doing every side quest along the way but still...
1857	1	a	I'll never understand why this game wasn't more popular. There are so many hours of fun gameplay here. The inventory/item system is much like Diablo in that you're always looking for those rare items, and you can even craft armor and improvements. When you add gameplay which I find engaging without being overcomplicated, and this title should hold anyone's interest for hours.  10/10
1859	1	a	I have played this for many hours on my ps3, and still cant get enough of it. The developers did an exellent job on the storyline, and not to mention over 100s of side quests. if you think skyrim was awesome then i would HIGHLY recommend this i have over 50 hours of game play on my ps3 and have not beat everything in the game yet. THIS is one of those huge games that is full of loot, battles, and quests... GET THIS GAME! one of my favorites would be this game and im sure it will be yours too!
1861	1	a	While the story line and setting of Kingdoms of Amalur is cliche and not very gripping, the combat is very enjoyable, and it is a great smash and loot. If you like spending hours running around a huge world and killing things while trying to get the next best piece of armor, this game is for you.
1863	1	a	lots of fun
1865	1	a	Fun hack &amp; slash game xD
1867	1	a	This Game is actually really really fun, Combat, Weapons and Armor are too dope! Sucks it didnt do so well its a good game!
1869	1	a	For free game, this game is pretty damn excellent. I put a decent amount of time into it, the graphics are pretty amazing, and the storyline is above average considering it is a free game. It doesn't feel l ike it is Pay 2 Win.  It is obvious the developers and marketing team put a lot of time, effort and money into this.   The game has some serious flaws however, like not being able to drop unecessary quests for irrelevant factions, and some pretty serious bugs. ALl that can be excused when taking into account, yes, this is a free game.
1871	1	a	For it being such a nice game, it loads incredibly fast! (About 2 second load screens on my pc.)
1873	1	a	Good graphics, and so far a pretty good character building system. See the opportunity to play it a number of different ways. Been going pretty solid warrior (big surprise I know), but the lure to dual class is pretty strong. 
1875	1	a	[Ignore the time played on here, I have 100+ hours on XBox] I love this game so much and I think every rpg fan should play it, it breaks my heart there'll never be anything from this ip.
1877	1	a	10/10, tremendous replay value. It's like a Skyrim and God of War had a love child.
1879	1	a	I have played more than 300 hours on Skyrim, and I find KOA way more fun !, infact I have not had this much fun since Gothic 2...   I really don't get why this game got such a bad rap ? Love the quests, Love the combat style, Love the crafting system, love the world... Great game, my only wish was that the game was moddable, mainly because there will be no sequel and having a community putting out some unofficial content to keep the game going would have been great.   I rate this game a good 8 out of 10 which is pretty high, well worth the price for countless hours of fun.
1881	1	a	great storyline nice graphic!  11/10
520	0	a	Not even worth the 4.99 i paided for it when on sale. It's a pile of sterotypes and cliches in a mishmash yet some how boreing pile.
1883	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a good game. It took the direction Fable was suppose to take, and it did it quite well. The game itself feels like a cousin of Fable, but with more linear story.  Storytelling itself in the game is pleasant. Main story unfolds gradually, with little  twists and turns along the way. That being said main story is the only good quest line  in the game. Side quests are very repetitive and if you've done one part of it, most likely you'll be doing the same thing few times to complete the whole thing. One thing that  really disappoints me about the story part of this game is how unmemorable the characters  are, it's the lack of special features of the charaters that really blends them all together and in my opinion, it would've helped the story immensly if there was more variety with the character skins, and models. (Even humanoid bosses look just the same as any NPC of that race)  Main story line is quite lengthy, and it does offer good replayability value, so even if you were to skip the side missions entirely, the game still gives you enough for its price.  Dynamic and entertaining combat system which feels rewarding from the very start, allowing you to execute combo moves with quite a few different weapon kinds, each kind having their own moveset. It also handles the melee mix with spellcasting very naturally.  Class system is great, it lets you go a standard path of a Warrior, a Mage, or a Rogue, but also mix two, or even all three together to make some unique classes, and level them up.  If you're a Fable fan, you will most likely find this game enjoyable. I'd rate it 7/10
1885	1	a	i finished the first part of the game 'well of souls' after defeating the rock troll my next quest was to escape, by exiting the the door with a giant arrow, ive tried everything and the door will not open! im just stuck in the areas of the dead troll?!
1887	1	a	This game is absolutely fantastic! The controls are easy to use, quality character customization, great story, visually beautiful, and loads of fun to play. If you like Elder Scrolls Skyrim it's hard to believe you won't enjoy this game too (if it's possible, maybe even more).
1889	1	a	The game is better than I expected! It's very similar to Fable where the same character can change their combat role based on their armor and weapons. And the functionality of controlling your character is similar too. One thing I really like is that the battle system predicts which targets you want to strike, and as you turn the environment blurs to give you the illusion of motion.   So far I'm enjoying it a lot, and the featured price is a great deal!!!
1891	1	a	What they've done here is make an action-MMO without the MMO. Oh, and they hired Grant Kirkhope compose the game's brilliant score.  HOWEVER, after buying this game (on sale) I realized that I was duped! EA had their soulless paws on this! Had I known, I would never have given them money. YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS ROUND, EA, BUT I WILL DOUBLE CHECK THE PUBLISHER NEXT TIME! (here's hoping that the sequel--assuming there is one--won't suffer from EA's curse of ruining great series.)  In all seriousness, I love this game, and it will likely replace my copy of skyrim in terms of replay value.
1893	1	a	This game is on the same thread as Skyrim and Fable. If you enjoyed those you'd like it. You can really design a lot about your character; stealthy, sorcery, or a bad-♥♥♥ melee dude, up to you. The beginning is a bit slow and tedious to read, but once you're past it it's a lot of fun. There are talent trees and professions, so if you're used to that sort of thing you should do fine in this game.
1895	1	a	This is easily one of my all-time favorite titles. Perhaps in that regard I am easy to please. But the single greatest thing about this game is the combat, hands down. This is, to this day, some of the most tight and fluid combat mechanics you're gonna find in a game like this. Let me put it to you this way. and hopefully I won't have too many crosshairs on my domepiece for saying it...this game makes the combat in Skyrim look robotic and rigid by comparison. Really from a subjective point of view, combat is all this title has going for it. Everything else, beyond a particularly beautifully crafted world, is standard RPG fair. From the class system, to leveling up, to main and side quests, these are all elements we've seen again and again. Its the combat that keeps me coming back for more, and its likely that combat that's gonna hook you too.
523	0	a	This game is not worth your money. It is poorly balanced and it's more up to luck than skill wether or not you will become a wet stain on the ground. Combined with a louse save system this adds up to a lot of frustration. The idea of the game is good, and I do like the way you can specialize in several schools (mage, warrior and rogue) and pick skills from all three schools. But it's poorly implemented into the gameplay.
1897	1	a	Awesome game for this price. 93hrs on record and now my family are playing it. Will there be another one made ............. i hope so
1899	1	a	Found myself spending copiuos amounts of time playing this game, but towards the end I just wanted to get it over and done with as it started getting to dragged out. The main quests are easy to follow, but once you start going into all the side quests it takes forever to finish. Definetly worth playing though.
1901	1	a	Surprisingly fun to play =)
1903	1	a	Very well built, massive, diverse, at times hard, very enjoyable.
1905	1	a	Been a year or so since I played but thought I would do a review seeing it on sale. It's a decent action RPG with a fun combat system. Art direction is really well done; environments and monsters are all fairly original and very pretty. Story (from what I remember) is OK, better than the typical Elder Scrolls offering but not coming close to something like Planescape: Torment. Overall, I would recommend this game as long as you can pick it up on sale, currently less than £10 for the collection which is reasonable, for that price it's a good entertainment investment.
1907	1	a	This is definitely a hidden gem because I had no clue this game came out. The best way I can describe it is combine Fable with Dragon Age, and then update the graphics from both games. This game is amazing so far, only regret I have is not buying the Collectors Edition or the all DLC content edition. Please, you can't go wrong for $4.99!
1909	1	a	I had a lot of fun playing through, it was pretty long and I stepped away for a few weeks in the middle, but it was fun picking it up again. I wouldn't suggest trying to min/max, just play it how you find fun. This is a solid RPG with lots of lore, but nothing groundbreaking. It has the feel of a lonely MMORPG.
1911	1	a	Such a marvellous action RPG - it does have a few minor flaws, but the game more than makes up for them elsewhere. It's such a tragic shame that the studio had it's funding pulled at the last minute consigning this marvellous universe and gem of a game to the history books.
1913	1	a	From what I've seen of this game so far is if you like Fable, you'll like this.
525	0	a	It's fun for a while, but it gets powerfully repetitive. It just becomes the same thing over and over as the game goes on. It's pretty, but in an 'MMO' sort of way, where every model just comes in different colors, and divided up into zones with one or two distincitve features. It feels like a really well done single-player mod for an MMO. It's not bad, but I've tried four times to finish it, and I get bored every time.
1915	1	a	This was a really great game! The combat system doesn't have a steep-learning curve and becomes thoroughly enjoyable once you do. This game was originally going to be an MMORPG, which is why the world is so large and the quests are so 'MMORPGish.' If you're like me and find yourself soloing through MMORPGs (and confined to PUGs for dungeons and such), then you'll really like this game.   Pros: Great combat, good story, difficulty scales well. Cons: Sluggish story parts in the beginning, quests in the middle can be tedious, crafted gear can out-class loot at the end if you max out crafting early.
1917	1	a	This is one of my favorite games! If you like Fable 1 and 2, this is the game for you! Open world Hack n Slash RPG, free to make your class with the skills that you choose. Solid game play and mechanics, the lore is nice as well! Playd as Full Knight and Knight Mage hybrid. Its awsome to see how many combinations you can do!  If this game were online RPG i would have no life! Hoping that someday a second one will be released!
1919	1	a	Not sure how I missed it all this time. This game is great so far.
1921	1	a	DO YOU WANT TO BECOME A BADASS WITH A HUGE SWORD OR A SNEAKING NINJA WITH DAGGERS OR A NINJA WITH A HUGE SWORD?!?!?!!?!?!?
1923	1	a	Awesome combat and story line :D Definetly recommend buying it
526	0	a	It has a huge bug that does not allow you to complete the game. This bug is well known but has not been fixed. Keep that in mind if you purchase this game!
1925	1	a	Really enjoying this game ,snap it up on sale (something like fable)
1927	1	a	When I finally got around to playing this, I was pretty pleased with it overall. There's a vast amount of game content to get to and you can hit level cap with a good amount of time before you finish the main quest. The Destiny system is pretty neat with regards to rewarding how you mix the three main playstyles, and the combat is fairly nice (except when you're just getting interrupted everywhere. I'm looking at you, sprite hordes). It kind of boils down to feeling like a single-player MMO, honestly; if that's the experience you're looking for, then I definitely recommend picking this game up.
1929	1	a	Awesome game, I have played Skyrim, Dragon Age, The Witcher and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's with depth and good combat system and the characters are well thought out with good skillsets to compliment most play styles.
1931	1	a	The most under rated game of all time! This game is amazing in so many ways i cannot even begin to describe it! I don't know how this one went under the radar but it got everything right in terms of what an rpg game is. This game should be used as a benchmarch for any company that is thinking about making an rpg game. Simply amazing! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a rpg fan, you need to play this! :)
1933	1	a	Game Score 9/10 So much gameplay! So much fun! I play it with an Xbox 360 controller and it's just perfect. GET THIS GAME! Best Action RPG I've ever played!
1935	1	a	This game had a mixed a God of War meets Fable, and I simply loved it!!! It's a must buy and would highly refer this to any friends. Hunting for the secret armors alone was a blast and encountering each new enemy type and learning their patterns to counter was a blast. Graphics were colorful along with enviroments rich and plush. Weapon customization alone was amazing, having specialties from Chakara Blades to throw to hammers to smash each one having its own ability. I think this game didn't get enough credit it was worth!!
1937	1	a	Fantastic game.  Great story, very responsive controls, great graphics 10/10
1939	1	a	Buy this game. Buy it, or swarms of Scottish gnomes shall descend upon thee as Irish fairies complain about global warming.
1941	1	a	I had more fun playing this game than any other RPG since Oblivion. I thought the graphics, sound, NPCs, character development, and quest lines were great. I waited about a month after release to buy the game. I installed all the patches and had no issues with bugs. I was very surprised the game did not do better during it's initial release.
1943	1	a	Great game!
1945	1	a	game was fun, repetitive in a few places and i never finished it. But i dont believe that was the games fault, it was well put together and the classes felt different. Enjoyable 
1947	1	a	Good little game. Plenty to do &amp; explore with interesting stories. The talent system works well and can be adjusted to suit how you like playing the hero.  Especially good value while it's on special, wish they had it on when i bought it.
1949	1	a	one of the best combat systems i have ever seen in an rpg in a long time. the story is equally as good with very good an motivating characters and stories. like other people have this is right up there with other great rpgs. hope the make a sequel
1951	1	a	Absolutley recommend playing this game especially if you have friends to play with.
1953	1	a	This is a very enjoyable, well made, easy to play, and i highly reccomend it. It's currently cheap, and 100% worth it if you like the genres. 
1955	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a Good Rpg Game and i like it so try it out rpg Gamers ^^
1957	1	a	Highly recpmmend this game. It's not quuite as huge as Skyrim, but then, unlike Skyrim, it has very few bugs and flows much more smootly on half the machine. One delightful thing that I found is that it auto switches between mouse/keyborad and controller (if you have a controller for your PC). Just use the controller and it responds with the controller icons or use the mouse/keyboard and it responds with those icons, even partway through a multi step sequence of commands.  IMO, the combat is smooth and challenging enough to stretch your tatical skills even at medium difficulty. The quests. subquests and side quests come fast and except for only a couple of oddball scenarios can be done in any order regardless of who you choose to side with and without confusing the questlines.  The graphics are a little flashy, but who wants to see the twisted strands in their bowstring. I seriously prefer to get by on way less than the super duper graphics card that some other games require.  Character development is very inovative and you can switch from a super tank slash-n-bash style to a high powered fireball slinger any time you have the cash.  The two DLCs are well worth it and all together I have spent several hundred hours on a single playthrough. It's a shame there won't be a KOA-2
1959	1	a	Surprisingly excellent. Kind of a b-movie version of Skyrim or similar. The world building is quite different than the standard high fantasy you might be used to, and took me a couple of takes to get into but has a lot of depth. Combat is excellent, story is well-written and loooooong. Recommended :)
1961	1	a	great game. like GOW.. but a little bit less.
1963	1	a	Great game !   For all of you that are thinking of buying this game, do it !  It reminds me quite alot of skyrim and fable !   Definetly worth checking out !
1965	1	a	There's just something about being able to freely run amok and fight and explore without having the normal linear experience that follows with combat RPG games. Often I tell myself why they wasted the time crafting gear you have to blindly swap out for the next best things. (Or rip my hair out because of games that have 6 armor sets but enough quests to make you take a hiatus) If you feel that way about the typical Crawler experience, and games like dungeon siege, dungeon hunter, fable, God of war, and many other games on that front, this is worth your money.  The major selling point to this game for me is the perspective of gameplay. It's just you and monsters almost all of the time, someone who wants a quest, and a bunch of dead travellers everywhere. It's pretty much saying No one is strong enough to leave the city but the bandits or a few scarce soldiers around the game that want you recruited. It is extremely hard to explain without a video. So you should go watch a video review. And even with the reviewers saying, hey, it's easy, it's boring, I see the action And the exploration And it just became a sure buy in my opinion.  As for the difficulty. I started hard mode and felt right at home, I think you can change the difficulty at any time, but I didn't bother because the twists and turns are the same as Skyrim on adept. Though you'll probably die more here because they're more blatant on using combos to pressure you. You can do the same to enemies provided you have a weapon or spell that does enough raw damage.  Speaking of raw damage. There are disciplines. Might, finesse and sorcery I think... Or wisdom. Basically it's warrior assassin and mage. BUT these disciplines are based on ability point distribution. And the general number of the points spent in each one dictate the type of armor you can wear. Also, those points Also unlock a destiny card system that offers you all cards your points accumulate into. So if you had every discipline at 100 you can select one of any of the perk setups in the game. It is very rewarding to all play styles and I would have loved to see more of it. Some skills even come with evasion modifiers that help balance gameplay for you.  The quests in this game are very well done. Not in the skyrim sense of, there's a right way to do anything that isn't daedric, but in more of a, why would I help you steal something for what I think is No reason?, kind of way. If you're supporting a specific role in the game, it shows a lot of promise as you can easily find a few quests that have some odd bad alignment turns, though to the same event, it does lack motivation in how it doesn't explain why they want you to necessarily do these things, however I would think the game will feature the same dissatisfaction if you don't assume the role of being someone who has the power to change fate. And in that sense it may be entirely up to you to shape people and their, it was written so it is done, attitude. It's a very nice way to get you on your own two feet without direction.   I don't think I have done one story quest. I basically just help the people that appeal to me and move on. And it still manages to be enough for me as a game to recommend without knowing anything of the story. The game is just good looking. The combat is simple, yet fun, the skills and quests are very cut and dry, but remain relevant because they can be improved.   I personally think a lot of love went into the game. I don't see too many games that meet most of the expectations most people want and don't get out of games, essentially making them jump between several games to name a justifiable experience. With this game, you get combat, self implied story, open world, skills, magic, you can say it was supposed to be an mmo, and it does feel that way at times. You can even rag on the story, or repetitive quests that everyone seems to complain at. I guess they never played a real mmo. It's really not that bad, and I would have gotten the game during the summer had I known that. And I'm glad they made this game an offline game, so that even though they're gone, people can still experience it fully. Because it is really well made and quality driven. It's definitely not a purchase to regret. Unless you have a game just like it, and if you do, tell me so I can get that too.
1967	1	a	Great Game , Very addicting . The fight mechanics are excellent , to be able to switch weapons and hit with magic in such quick succession is fun to say the least. The inventory is a bit of a pain as it seems to fill up very quickly. Very few times the camera gives an unfortunate and annoying angle during a battle but like I said that has only happened a couple of times during the many battles. There are so many missions you could play this game for many hours and advance very little in the main quest, the only drawback i can see to this is that when you do go back to doing a main quest to advance your character will be much more powerful than needs to be for the missions. I would recommend this game without a doubt.
1969	1	a	Very fun game, The game is very detailed and has much story in it. Combat is very smooth and full of action. You can create your own class based on the number of points you spend in either Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue) or Sorcery(speaks for itself, right?). Depending on skills chosen you rise further and further into your skill tree. Hybrid class is also very possible.
1971	1	a	This is actually a really fun game. The crafted gear becomes the best you can get. All classes are fun and the story is good too. Sound fx and music are top notch.
1973	1	a	Fun game lots to fight for and plenty of cool adventures 
1975	1	a	It's a really good game, only problem is that it's terribly easy to cake walk through it.
1977	1	a	Nalif played this once and now he doesn't make videos anymore.   But he was good and this game is good so i'd give it a buy.
1979	1	a	A solid game through and through. It has all the elements in place that make an excellent RPG. Graphics and sound were straight on even if they did use the same voice actors over and over again. The combat system was well developed and thought out and the crafting system they have in place was also good although a bit simplistic at times.  The main story telling was a bit lacking to the point where I stopped paying attention halfway through. I did encounter a game ending glitch that I was fortunately able to bypass by going back a few saves but it ate up some time. Finally after I hit the level cap and got the best equipment in game I lost all interest in sidequests/exploring as I just didnt see the point. So I burned through the final quest/areas just to see the final contect and finish the game.  Its unfortunate that the company went under but I would recommend this game to any RPG fan.
1981	1	a	The awesomness of this game is endless. Surely gonna spend hours with that.
1983	1	a	-Good Gameplay -Sweet Moves -Good Armor,Swords,Shields and Race designs  Suggestions: -Multiplayer  Thanks for the sweet game.
1985	1	a	A good game !! i've played a couple of hours but i can tell there's lot of content and potencial !
1987	1	a	Really enjoyed the game, great scenery and great graphics, enjoyable and well thought out storyline. The combat isn't the most incredible or challenging thing I have ever played but it was still fun and is worth playing.
1989	1	a	This is a must get game, especially when it is on sale, you could not get more for the silly prices Steam sells it for
1991	1	a	This game is absolutely badass.   It has compelling quests that actually make me want to do them.   The combat is very fluid and even skill based to a huge degree which is awesome.  It has high replay value given the effects of different races as well as destinies.  If you want an awesome game with depth in combat, lore, story, and even environments, then just buy it.  
1993	1	a	I've played this before for the xbox but then saw it was on offer on steam, with its DLC and thought i'd pick it up. I wasnt dissappointed. The character creation in terms of the physical appearance of your face is rather simplistic in that there's only a few presets to choose from. Four diffference races to choose from determines the apperance of your character with each giving a starting bonus to some skills. From there you go to change hair, skin colour, eyeshadow, lipstick shade, tattoo and body jewelry.   The leveling up system is simplistic too. There are base skills like lock picking and blacksmithing which let you interact with the world better and the combat system is split into three sections, finesse, might and sorcery with players being allowed to invest in each one if they wish which really allows you to customise your playthrough; something which alot of RPG's tend to overlook, either you're an archer or a mage... you cant be both.  The open world means you can do as you wish, or not do as is my case sometimes. Each area is populated with monsters at specific levels so be careful to not wander too far out early on but then again, why not?  The controls are little fiddly to get a hang on first off and I would definitely recommend setting the 'run' key to toggle rather than hold.
1995	1	a	If you are unsure of buying this game, maybe i will help you with my review.  This game have one of the best combat I have ever seen in a RPG. There are lot of nice abilities and you can combine them as you please, so there is a lot of variety. Game is huge, so there is a lot of discovering and adventuring. Story is subpar, but I have seen worse, it is still playable. Music gets kind of repetitive, but you can just mute the music and play something on your pc, so thath is not a problem at all. Some quests are repetitive, but that is normal with rpg´s.  8/10 I would recommend this to my friends, this game is worth every penny.
1997	1	a	Initially I disliked this game - the camera was instantly annoying. As one reviewer put it 'Your biggest fight in this game is with the camera'. I found myself doing 360 degree spins just trying to view enemies. The auto aim with ranged weapons was unsettling and took some getting used to. I also found multiple clicks to navigate through my inventory painful - perhaps there's some shortcuts I'm missing. I found some aspects of the game could have been documented or explained better, like how best to use reckoning mode.  However, I persisted through these minor issues and have ended up enjoying the game. Things like the auto aim that I initially found unsettling turns out to be quite useful when attacking multiple enemies. I've gotten used to the camera. There is reasonable graphics and music. Some of the game areas remind me of areas within World of Warcraft - there is a fair amount of scenic detail in the game world.   The story and quest lines are quite in depth. There's plenty of equipment, spell and ability upgrades to keep one interested, plus crafting. You can choose to pursue the main quest line or build experience via various side quests.  I've found the combination moves with fights are interesting and entertaining. Sneaking up and backstabbing opponents is a quick and easy way to take down an opponent.   There's enough variety in this game to keep any gamer interested. I'm changing my initial opinion to thumbs up.
1999	1	a	Very nice combination of action and RPG forms gameplay that you should try and master all skills and special moves. This is NOT 'just another RPG'. I put it on the same shelf with WOW and Skyrim.
2001	1	a	the best of fable and oblivion, and none of the dissapointment of those series' sequels
2003	1	a	If you like talking to a NPC with overreact expression when another is whining in a inappropriate way on the background, then this is the game for you. 100/10 - ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!
2005	1	a	This game is like the Fable series but without the fart jokes and done right. Also, it is now property of Rhode Island due to some wacked-out legal battle nonsense, so that's weird.
2007	1	a	RPG fan? Got some money to spend? I'll say buy it..try it.  I love this game. The story is quite nice.  There r so many Side Quests(pros or cons,up to your opinion). Crafting gears..gems to slot into gears. The monsters..the skill tree.. NICE! but Caution! - if you do a lot of side quests..you may end up be an OP.  Which is nice to end the storyline...but the fight would be less action.  if u know what I mean.  Worth my money on this game.
2009	1	a	Surprisingly enjoyable. Easy and fun to play with fantastic fighting moves and a good story. Love the Fae Blades
2011	1	a	Super Generic Game but it is Really Fun
2013	1	a	I wasn't expecting much when I went into this game, given its lackluster reviews. Ended up pouring almost 100 hours into it. The story isn't amazing, but not bad. The exploration and gameplay are great. It plays a lot like the first fable as far as combat goes. I probably wouldn't recommend it to a non RPG fan, but if you're looking for something to fill the gap between TES/Dark Souls/Dragon Age type games, this will do the job well. It's a shame there won't be a sequel.
2015	1	a	Much replay value in this game, and the DLC is excellent! Worth every cent!
2017	1	a	I love game same oblivion IV and mass effect. great game!!!.....
2019	1	a	I am really enjoying this game. It kind of reminds me of an MMO but completely solo and reminds me of Fable too.
2021	1	a	One of the best games I have invested in. 11/10 :D
2023	1	a	It's like a MMO without the thing that makes a lot of MMOs horrible to play, the people.  They took one bit of dialogue from Terminator 2 and made a whole game based on that.  10/10 would run around as Commander Shepard again.
2025	1	a	A very good and addicting game had Dark Souls 2 not come out when it did, I may have spent another 200 hours on this game that I instead spent playing Dark Souls 2, Definitely worth a buy expecially if you can get it on sale.
2027	1	a	One of the most underrated game. I ♥ this game since it have deep grinding system and great story.  8/10
2029	1	a	Great main story line, the battle/invasion of mel senshire feels like a real invasion filled (unlike ESO's deadra invasion). Three main different type of play style, Might (ignores damage, stuns, and cleaves through everything), Sorcery (fragile yet massive AOEs, and has a friggin chkram), and Fitness (nimble, sneaky, high dps, and utilizes poison). Also from this three main play style you can mix them up to create a might/sorcery, fitness/sorcery. might/fitness, might/fitness/sorcery. Great combat system, hacking and slashing with combos are addictive, and to inhance combos you can switch weapons in the middle of a combo you make your character look flashy.  However the graphics are not the best, but average. Side quests tend to get boring and can not select multiple quests at once. There is a lot of walking involved. Also the auto aim function ruins your fighting style, and the camra angle ,at times, is not the best. Overall this game is a must for RPG lovers... but can have it's moments of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players off.
2031	1	a	I like this game, I really do, its fun. It's got fantastic combat, a great loot system, a inventive and unique crafting system where you make your own armor and weapons and ♥♥♥♥. The world is beautiful and the soundtrack is really good too. It's downsides are lack of character developent and likeable characters and it's story is kinda boring/weak. It can be hard to get into when you first start, but don't give up, it gets fun. Otherwise this is an example of a good RPG. Final Score 8.7/10 with a badass seal of approval
2033	1	a	You absolutely should give this game a try. It does so many things very well, and is a lot of fun to play. I have played most of the popular, recent MMOs and RPGs, and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning holds its own, and ranks among the best.   Story The story is very well written, and wonderfully intertwined throughout the game. The authors did a great job of telling an epic tale, and keeping the story interesting and engaging for its entirety.  Graphics The graphics are just as good as any AAA game out there today. The maps, scenery, characters, and animations all look great. The interior spaces such as houses, castles, and dungeons are very detailed and finely crafted.  Setting The setting is more of a fantasy setting, as opposed to a realistic setting as in Elder Scrolls. It feels like its filled with magic with a lot of graphical touches that look magical.  Quests Quests are given by voice acted interactions with NPCs. The quests are story driven, and closely related to the overall story and background of the world. Every quest you do seems to have meaning, and is important in some aspect of the game. There are no junk “kill ten rats quests. Instead the quests either further the main story, or provide interesting background to the characters or world.  NPCs The NPCs have interest, character, and look great. I think every single NPC has a different look - not like the cookie-cutter clones in so many games today. The faces in particular are very detailed and show character.  Voice Acting This has got to be the best voice acting of any game I have ever played. It is outstanding, and gives the quests that extra ambiance.  Classes You can mix and match your class trees as freely as you wish between magic, melee, and stealth skills.  Combat Combat is a blast. There are dodge, block, and combo mechanics. You can cast spells, use ranged weapons, and melee weapons. If you play on hard mode, then fights can be a good challenge, and you have to be alert in order to survive. The combat is easy to learn, but takes practice to master.  Leveling I took my time, and had so much fun doing everything, that leveling happened naturally at a good progression. There are 40 levels total.  Crafting Crafting is pretty simple and basic. The good thing is that you can craft some of the best items in the game yourself.  Character Models The character models are actually better than many games out today. The faces are very detailed, and there are many varieties of armor.  Music Like everything else in the game, the music is top notch.   Length It is a big world with lots of stuff to do, and will take a good while to get through everything.   The game is awesome, and I highly recommend it.
2035	1	a	Slightly repetitive, but the game is polished and rewarding enough to keep you playing. Interesting lore helps build the atmosphere, along with a nice soundtrack and art direction. Voiced dialog is well done, and there are always topics to ask about for more information, or personal perspectives. Player character's not voiced, though. Skill trees are modest but they can be combined for specialized play styles.   Worth a look if you're itching for an action-RPG fix.
2037	1	a	I played a bit of this on Xbox when it came out and enjoyed it quite a bit. While it would be better for the PC if you have a controller the keyboard/mouse combo is pretty simple to use and get used to. The game itself is a little buggy on occasion but it's nothing bad (definitely not Skyrim status buggy). The storyline is fun and it's an exciting game but it doesn't have much replay value to it, even if you choose a different race. Character customization is limited but not bad. Character classes are enjoyable throughout the game, and there's a decent variety of weaponry and skills. The fateshift thing is pretty cool. You can basically dual spec. as well. The crafting skills are great. Cinematics and character/NPC interactions are entertaining. Overall I feel it would be a better game if there were different story paths, or if it were more in-depth in general to go with the amount of time it takes to complete all of the side quests + the main quest, but for the type of game it is and how it plays it's about an 8.5/10 for me.
2039	1	a	I always love great styled RPGs like this and even tho atm ive never finished the game its one of those where there is so much to do that it feels endless. that can get tiring but it also gives more then enough opportunity to maximize your experience.
2041	1	a	Being an avid RPG player, I can assure you that this game is a great buy. I spend hours collecting loot from the bodies of fallen adversaries, completing quest after quest as my character become more rich and powerful. The hours turned to days as my total immersion into the game increased and my GPA plumetted accordingly. I needed excellent grades, no longer, for I was Sparkles the Destroyer and Amalur, my kingdom. In short, I recomend the game.  Pros: Solid RPG experience.  Cons: The story was a very basic experience and your decisions did not have much of a ripple effect through out the game.  This may be a pro or a con to different people, if don't like to see your smallest actions (You Kamehameha'ed a chicken out of existence with your magic when you were at level Two) having long lasting effects (Eight levels later you find out the chicken was actually a local deity that provided sustenance to a small village, who will now starve, and it's your fault.) Then this game is for you, if otherwise then please, cringe in terror of the chicken deities.
2043	1	a	I like this game for its game play. There is a richness in the depth, both linial and lateral, of terrain and buildings. There are the usual class of characters that you would find in a RPG. That is a bonus if you want to learn the basics of the roles before stepping up to harder RPG's. In saying that I found it difficult to follow my character in battle when the camera is hidden behind bushes/rocka etc. I would highly recomend this game to anyone.
2045	1	a	Great game. Brings back what Fable used to be and adds it's own touches.
2047	1	a	Loads of quests and good story line. Recommended
2049	1	a	I'm upset with myself for one reason: I hesitated to buy this game. On sale for $5 and with an 82 Metascore, I was still a bit iffy on the game, even though it happends to be an RPG, of which I love. I shouldn't have wasted the time thinking about whether to buy it.  To start, if the game is ever on sale for 5 dollars and you like RPGs to any degree, add to cart.  About the game, you are the reanimation of a fallen soilder from a battle against a new-found enemy awoken from the chaos created by a new Emporer. You first see yourself as a dead body being dropped into a pit, but soon enough you awake atop hundreds of dead who where like you. The story then takes off, introducing you to what will become an exponentially more intense battle style and to a wide system of freedom and choice.   You choose what to say in a ring of different phrases you may speak. These phrases can start quests or make enemies depending on how you choose them, a feature I enjoy.  The system of battle is intense and never gets old. Dodging, shield parrying, and combos all mix to create a battle style I hate to stop playing. You choose, through unlocking powers, active and passive, in one, two, or all three trees of skills. Melee, Sorcery, and Finesse are your three skill trees, with different powers and skills for different playstyles. You can also mix the three trees' skills to create your own style. This customization is wonderful and fun to explore, and I've only scratched the surface.  All in all, 9/10 at least, I am very happy with where my 5 dollars gave me, and the full price is fairly reasonable for such a game. As I said earlier, if you enjoy or respect RPG games in any way, this is most definatly a game to try out.
2051	1	a	easy to play rpg
2053	1	a	This game is a sure fun and enjoyable game.   Kingdoms is sure one of the better RPG typr games i have played as yet. The pure fantasy and interactive npc's on here makes every story line very intresting.   i suck at reviews but i would take this game over many other games any day, i have played a few RPG's.   There is a downside or two in the game, the sound tracks used seem to not fit in the game too well but still acceptable. amount of side quest that cant be completed is rather high as well.   Buy the game and find out just how wonderful the gameplay is, some might not enjoy it and some will. The prefrence is in your hands.
2055	1	a	Very good game. I recommend it for people who enjoy games such as Skyrim and Fable. This game is very similar to dragons dogma so for people who enjoyed that game on console, this is the game for you. 8.5/10
2057	1	a	Very likeble RPG! momvent on PC is fluid + combat system is very effective love it!
2059	1	a	This game is pretty fun for the first 30ish hours, as the faction quests give you choices to make at the end(do you want to save the person you're supposed to kill, or simply do as you're told and kill that person?) and the world is varied enough with side quests dotted throughout to make the game a fun experience.  however the game outdid itself in terms of size, it's too big. The story is very linear and the ending is very unsatisifying, so the only thing that kept me going was the DLC and sides quests. But after you finish the 'fun quests' and the main story line, the game just doesn't have anything more to offer. The combat is stall, the side quests are mostly fetch this kill that, and you really feel no sense of joy playing this game past the ~50 hour mark.   conclusion: this is a OK game, there are enough to do to keep it fun for the first 30-50 hours, but anything after that the game just gets boring.
2061	1	a	Great storyline and lots of fun. Graphics have a certain charm to them, though I feel they area remniscent of World of Warcraft's art style.
2063	1	a	A hidden gem of a game! The best part is the action oriented combat!
2065	1	a	I like this game. Is really nice but when you play it longer it will be all the same.
2067	1	a	I really enjoy kingdoms of amalur great game, has a fairly decent combat system some abilities could be expanded though. I like the storyline of the game and the amount of sidequests available to boost your levels and coffers. Both the DLC's are good to i have completed the teeth of naros, and almost done the dead kel. Unfortnately was not able to due to a certian glitch and me not saving several (11) hours of gameplay, and do not want to redo all i did. even with that set back id say a solid 8/10
2069	1	a	Single player MMORPG.
2071	1	a	8.5/10 Grabbed this in a sale, have to say best 150 hours of gameplay so far. Completed the main storyline &amp; I have to say all skeptism about this game was eliminated past the first hour playing. I love the amount of flexibility given to build my character &amp; how the option is to switch between 'classes' is readily avaliable.  Visually the game looks awesome, gameplay is pretty awesome as well seeing how it got me hooked for more than 100 hours. If you're a fan of fantasy RPGs or just RPG fans in general I would definately recommend buying this game.  The only thing I had to nitpick was like every other RPGs (looking at you TES games) inventory management is a ♥♥♥♥♥.
2073	1	a	Imagine an MMORPG action game that is only playable by one person. This is that. It feels like it should be an MMO but it isn't. Combat can be frustrating in that every little attack will stagger the character, regardless of potency, potentially hitstun-locking the player. Stealth is noticeably less viable than outright confrontation due to most enemy spawns (both regular and quest/dungeon spawning) not giving the chance for stealth kills or bypassing. It's a fun game if you like gearing a character, collecting and/or forging loot, and running dungeons.
2075	1	a	Borrows mechanics from all sorts of games: hack-n-slash, RPG, etc. Plays it very safe by following formulas closely without being a mere copy. Visuals aren't too spectacular and there are some bugs. Voice acting is very solid. Overall a good game, but it honestly doesn't do anything special to make it memorable. Which is a shame, because its concept of controlling one's own fate and affecting the fates of others sounds like it'd have amazing potential. If you're looking for a fun but extremely generic action game, Amalur is for you.
2077	1	a	This is what happens when fable, god of war, and wow have a child.
2079	1	a	Great Game. Tons and I mean TONS of side-quests to keep you entertained.
2081	1	a	This game is almost criminally underplayed and swept under the rug. DO NOT miss out on this fantastic title.  Think Fable+Elder Scrolls Good: Wealth of Content (50+ hours) Diverse Combat System Gorgeous World Strong Loot/Customization Fun Crafting System Bad: Quests can be repetitive at times Often too much empty space between objectives (running simulator a little) Sub-Par Scripts/Dialogues (Not always, but worth mentioning)  In short, a few flaws, but definitely a great game and very hard not to recommend, especially at its current price point.
2083	1	a	Awesome game, spend many hours exploring the world. Different ways to engage combat is also very fun, making the replay value good.
2085	1	a	One of the most satisfying combat systems I've seen in a long time, but I can't imagine playing it without a controller.
2087	1	a	if u love RPG like fable u must play this too
2089	1	a	Its like skyrim and fable had a baby. It takes a lot of skyrims open world stuff but waters it down and it takes fables combat but makes it unbelivably better. The combat is godly as long as you can handle the camera right which can sometimes be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the start of battles as it has a habit of not zooming out and next thing you know you have a spear up your ♥♥♥.   Downsides are there is less extra stuff to do as there is in skyrim or fable and the side missions for the most part the same old kill x to get y and dont get me started on how ♥♥♥♥ing annoying it is to do a 2 hour quest only to get about 2000 gold ♥♥♥♥ YOU RANDOM NPCS ILL TURN OFF SAFE MODE AND KILL YOU ALL.  Overall a good game  12/10   
2091	1	a	No need for me to be fancy... this game is great. If you don't have it, buy it. 9/10.
2093	1	a	Good game if you want a single-player mmo. Do wish it had some multiplayer with that said though as the game has a very, very large feel of an mmo.
2095	1	a	Think Skyrim meets WoW and action is like Dynasty Warriors. Awesome game.
2097	1	a	Really enjoyable so far. Reminds me a bit of Fable to be honest. Oh wolves sort of at the begininng..... really annoying!
2099	1	a	really really good game highly reccomended.
2101	1	a	Similar to WoW in many ways. love it!
2103	1	a	I bought this game online and paid for all the other items that could be added. Unfortunately non of the added item were there so I played the game anyhow and I really liked it; I liked it so much that I bought it again through Steam and all of the items that I was cheated out of in the last purchase were in the Steam version with a DLC added. I wish I purchased it through Steam the first time around because I have never been let down by this company and I have a library of 28 games to date.  Sincerely,  Kathaleen Wood
2105	1	a	Just brilliant. 8.2 / 10  I have played this pre-steam and purchased again out of a little bit of nostalgia. I dont remember anything bad about Kingdoms at all, and it is nice to see that I can still pick it up and feel like I never put it down. Great character setup, inventory setup, crafting and magic array. The graphics are still a little on the 'cartoony' side in comparison to Skyrim for example, but honestly I prefer that. Its nice, pretty, but a well-polished beast of a game. Get it got.
2107	1	a	A lot of people will call this generic and boring. It's not, it's like Oblivion with better bosses, like skyrim with better item drops, like dragon age but with cooler weapons. The only problem is no mod support so the graphics are a bit stale and users can't add anything cool.   8.25/10
2109	1	a	If you're a fan of RPG's your only issue with this game will be that you haven't played it sooner. I have been a long time RPG fan and claim Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate, and Elder Scrolls to be among my favorites. Now KoAR joins that list. It's well worth the price and while its not without its flaws, it is a must play for anyone who enjoys action gameplay and in depth storyline.
2111	1	a	 An Amazing Game With Only a Few Shortcomings
2113	1	a	I'm pleasantly impressed with this game. It feels a lot like Fable to me, but much more finished, larger, with better control, depth and... okay nothing at all like Fable.   The reviews I see here compare it a lot to Skyrim. Mostly in that people hate Skyrim but love this. It's really apples and oranges. They're both very good games, but for very different reasons. This one is a lot more traditional at its core. There are main quests that advance you through the maps and local side quests for each area. I honestly haven't tested if maps beyond my current exploration are leveled higher, of it it's all matched to my level. I'll have to look at that later.   The combat system is pretty enjoyable and works smoothly. There is a huge benefit to blocking, and skills to make it even more useful as you progress. There are enough skills and the skill points are few enough to make you make tough choices how you want to build your character. I'm playing a straight fighter and enjoying the hell out of it. But from what I did on the starting missions, both mage and rogue seemed like they'd be fun as well. From the fate system, it looks like it's designed for you to be able to mix and match fairly effectively, so you could do a fighter/mage/thief and not completely suck.  Con: The only real con so far is that the main quest line holds absolutely no interest for me. Actually, I can't really tell if there is a story yet. None of the other quests seem at all tied to it. People mention a faraway war a lot and there are some quests relating to that, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with your character's story. You mention the Tuatha, and the only response people give is, 'That's weird, the war is far away from here.'
2115	1	a	Nice game, Best killing moves, yet bad map and okay story. 8/10
2117	1	a	Fun game, very expansive world. Great graphics and combat style. You'll love it if you like RPGs.
2119	1	a	very well done---awesome gameplay--:)
2121	1	a	Awesome game, quick pace fight, magic, ninja or just run with a giant axe slahing trough 20 beasts, worth the buy
2123	1	a	I disliked no autorun feature the biggest. Other than that the game is completely and utterly awesome
2125	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur, also could be called the poor people's Skyrim. The game itself is decent at most. Not a game to buy at full price however, wait for a sale is my suggestion in the highest form. HOWEVER, the game has it's pros and cons, as does even the best of games. Here's my review in my, now normal, manner of doing this.  Character customization: The character customization is limited to really race, gender and face. Very little body change outside of gender. You have two versions of human and two versions of elf. You have your face changing and your tattoo, piercing and hair and hair color. The usual facial change. Now, the difference is you can change it any time outside of console commands after you get your first 'home', which is nice.  Gameplay: Gameplay for combat is general hack and slash, not much to say about it, only distinct feature is pressing X or whatever the console equivalent is to trigger fate mode at full bar where you deal extra damage and can kill a person for extra xp after a QTE which is also used in boss fights. Otherwise, hack and slash with bow use. The leveling system you gain three trees: Might, Finesse and Intellect. Honestly, this is basically Fighter Mage Thief tree. Finesse for thief, intellect for mage, might for fighter. You can multiclass as well up to all three trees being used. The more points in a tree the better stats you get for it. You also have your general skill points in other professions of sorts. The armor is restricted by level and tree so you can only use an armor if you have so many points in a tree.  Story: Haven't finished the game but the story from what I played is decent at best, some plot holes like HOW you got the abilities you have and it starts with the entire bit about you dying, it can be assumed you being brought back is how, but doesn't really explain it much.  Graphics: It's cartoony looking. It's much less graphically intense, so might be easier to run for the comps without a good graphics card. The sights are decent as well as character design.  Difficulty: The difficulty never changes. You have to do it manually. You get higher level and it never gets any more difficult. After awhile, you get so high level, it doesn't even matter anymore.  Over all. There's not really a way to recommend or not recommend KoA. It's a decent game if it goes on sale, but not a game to invest too much time into.
2127	1	a	Such an underrated game, the combat is fun and challenging and the environment is mysterious and deep. Feels slightly linear from time to time, but i dont see that as a bad thing. I often get distracted to easily and end up spending many hours doing f**k all :) worth a play. Real shame it got overshadowed by the release of skyrim back in the day.
2129	1	a	6/10, but a fun 6/10.  Mechanically, the game is perfect. Combat is way more kinetic than other rpgs. Weapons are creative in conjunction with abilities, especially the Chakrams. The game world is huge and every area looks epic. Story setup is great. I loved the direction they took with it. Your character is a god because they have no fate.  Now for the bad stuff. There are many elements to combat, and fast-paced mechanics and a couple of fun weapons are only part of that. There is a good variety of enemies, but I never found myself having to change tactics for any of them. There are only 2 cool boss fights. Final boss sucks. It's not hard, it just sucks. Random looting system sucks. Game would have been better with predefined loot. Game has horrible difficulty scaling, and gear level balaning is way off. I'm using end game weapons which requires level 18, and my armor requires a finesse skill of 25. I'm level 35 with a finesse skill of 102. There is no better gear.
2131	1	a	This has to be one of my favorite fantasy rpgs. I highly recommend this game to anyone else that loves rpgs.
2133	1	a	Great game. Amazing combat system, plenty of quests. Easily a 60+ hour game. Recommended if you liked Oblivion/Skyrim/Fable.
2135	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I've got it on Xbox 360, Origins, and Steam. Author R.A. Salvatore's brilliant mind for fantasy (Forgotten Realms Drizz't books) coupled with Todd McFarlane's (Creator of Spawn) designs make a breathtaking experience. A great rpg for anyone who likes story and gameplay alike. Play it ASAP.
2137	1	a	You can see the Salvatore influence in the storyline, and gameplay is heavily remnicsient of the Elder Scrolls series, both of which count as positives in my book. Hours of content, and a genuinely fantastic game.
2139	1	a	Great Fun been plaing it for months and still haven't finished it...The DLC's are awesome also but wait for everything to go on sale
2141	1	a	For a game that nearly bankrupted the state that did not sign the constitution it was pretty good. 7/10
2143	1	a	Open World RPG in the same vein as Elder Scrolls meets mostly competent writing meets character action game combat meets Diablo-style loot. And while all of this is done competently, it often feels like the game suffocates under the amount of ideas and things to do the developers wanted to put in. You certainly get your money's worth. When I reached the maximum level I hadn't done even a quarter of the side quests and the myriad of stat bonuses from loot, crafting, collectibles, quest rewards, leveling makes the game unchallenging even on the hardest difficulty.  Get the Widescreen Fixer to adjust the FOV to non-console standards, set the game to hard, try to play as a non-mage or at least avoid the one-hit-kill spell meteor. Don't grind, don't do tasks, avoid side quests aside from the faction ones.
2145	1	a	The game has held up over the years and still looks great.
2147	1	a	This game has great art work and lots of adventure in it.if you like single player games and rpg's then this is the game for you.
2149	1	a	Excellent open-world action RPG with a fast-paced and visceral combat system. The world is vibrant and colorful while the characters and storyline are well-developed and interesting. It essentially combines Skyrim's open-world with Fable's joyful graphics and God of War's action-oriented combat. Highly recommended!
2151	1	a	Worthed Game for that value
2153	1	a	My brief take on KoA: I recommend this game if you enjoy action RPGs in fantasy settings. Having said that, I should point out that I haven't actually finished the main quest, and have been on a hiatus from the game for a couple of months, but I am looking forward to getting back to it in the not too distant future. I've started the game with a couple of different characters in order to see how different choices and character builds affect progress, and I feel like doing that has been reasonably rewarding, although there are not many choices with significant ramifications (they typically relate to which reward you get for completing a task or side quest).   I do recommend you wait to get it and its DLC on sale.   My less brief take:  For me, this game's strengths are an open world that's fun to explore and nicely designed, a combat system that encourages players to try different combat styles, fairly engaging stories within the main quest and the factional side quests, and some interesting/funny NPCs, particularly in those factional side quests. I'm sure I could have finished the main quest in the amount of time I've played, but I really liked doing the factional quests and spent a lot of time on the Legend of Dead Kel DLC. That was among my favorite storylines in the whole game, at least so far, which is why I recommend getting the DLCs in addition to the base game.  The most noticeable weaknesses are that the simple side missions can get repetitive, inventory and crafting could have been designed better and crafting is not very useful until you've leveled your crafting-related skills up somewhat, and there'll come a point where your character and weaponry is leveled up past the point where combat is very challenging in most instances. (On that last point, take a look at the article on the Amalur wiki that describes the 'Area-Level Cap' - apparently you can compensate for this to some extent if you want to amend your play style to do so.)  I bought a discount bundle containing Steam keys for the base game and the two story expansion DLCs from another online retailer; I paid about 25% of the current full price of $40 for the collection. I certainly feel I've got my money's worth so far; I'm not sure I'd recommend paying full price for it, but it does go on sale on Steam pretty often, and it's definitely $20 worth of entertainment if not a bit more.   If you're considering buying the game, you may be wondering why the game doesn't have a great deal of name recognition, and whether that lack of recognition reflects the overall quality of the game. While it has shortcomings, I think the game was unlucky in that (a) it was somewhat overlooked upon release because it was viewed as competing with Skyrim, though the two games are pretty different in terms of tone and overall experience and (b) the developer went bust in a very public fashion not too long after release, which I think cast something of a pall on the game's ongoing reputation, or at least did not help it any. If you like open world action RPGs and are willing to overlook some minor flaws, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this game.  If someone buys the game's intellectual property, I'd love to see either a sequel in similar format, or further development of the idea for the MMO that was supposed to succeed KoA.
2155	1	a	One of my favorite games I have ever gotten in a Steam sale, and well just an awesome game in general! Would definitely buy it again.
2157	1	a	Really loved the action on this RPG. Story gets you involved. Controls work well. A few glitches but easily 8 out of 10. Get it on sale and love it
2159	1	a	Lore galore, with Fable like combat!
2161	1	a	It is very good RPG I have beaten the main game: 88 hours
2163	1	a	One of the utmost fantastic hidden gems you'll ever scavenge upon the Steam marketplace. Besides the graphical and narrative flaws, this piece of buried legend is a definite collector's piece for the true action-rpg fans out there.  ░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄░░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█░░░░░░░░ ░░░░░░░░░█░░░░█░░░░░░░░ ███████▄▄█░░░░░██████▄░░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░ ▓▓▓▓▓▓█████░░░░░░░░░█░░ ██████▀░░░░▀▀██████▀░░░░ ...For Amalur! &lt;3
2165	1	a	69%
2167	1	a	In the words of my favorite youtuber northernlion... 'It's real good'
2169	1	a	I say things like fallout, skyrim, borderlands, or other really good RPGs are my favorite but the truth is as a realization I've just had. Kingdoms of Amalur (KoA) is by far my favorite game.  The company that produced this game had little expirence when they were founded, but persued there dream and made there amazing dream game!... But guess what. They went backrupt and had there company taken by the state of rhode island. So if you're looking for a game that will continue with a sequal. I suggest you leave now.  This game features a third person, button mashing, combo breaker, combat system. The map is extreamly large, has hundreds of thousand of little hidden treasure spots. It has more uniquely designed weapons and names then any other game has. It incorperates a nearly flawless blacksmithing system which is my personal favorite. Amazing worth while DLC, and one of the few story lines ive never been able to predict (Note: I predicted most of mass effects series story) They multitudes of characters you create is amazing. You can make a mage, warrior, rogue or all three for all the game cares! Theres a lot of quests. Amazing effects. Good graphics, and mostly smooth gameplay. If the company werent bankrupt id suggest they fix some of the issues when it comes to not being able to walk onto the ground when you're only a inch up on a staircase... and maybe incorperate a system which actually allows mods into the game considering It starts to get boring on your 9th playthrough. (I know this from expirence being on my 13th)  Anyways Id say this game is by far the best of its kind and I hope it makes you as happy as it has made me. Ill make a short pros and cons list to sum it all up!  Cons: Despite having a Havok engine, this game pretty much says ♥♥♥♥ you when you attempt to jump so much as a inch. (unless its a designated area to leap to the ground) The company is bankrupt. So if you fall head over heels for this game like me you're ♥♥♥♥ed asking for a sequal. Moddable = False.  Pros: Good gameplay (Combat, running/walking, Fast Travel, Dialouge, Character Creation, Etc). Good Variaty (About 9 Weapons, 70+ Skills, High Level Cap, Lots of lore specific enemies, useful and useless lore items). Good DLC: Id rate Deadkel: 9/10 and Teeth of Narros 7/10. (Decent Stories, Repeating Combat) Very Clean (Almost No Bugs). Great Story (Lots of side lore and quests, Like game of thrones you cant expect most things) Detailed NPCs (Between designs and there story background, Id say 90% of NPC have some kind of backstory and quest)    BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  
2171	1	a	for something that has EA's stamp of doom... it was pretty good..
2173	1	a	Simply amazing! Best single player RPG I've played. Great voice acting. Good graphics. Interesting and fun quests with immersive story telling. The combat is awesome. If you love single player fantasy RPG games you won't be disappointed.
2175	1	a	Awesome art style and some really great story telling.
2177	1	a	nothing terribly original here. but the foundation is solid and everything from the questing to the combat is tight and fun. i found the story to be rather compelling as well. definitely pick this up.
2179	1	a	An excellent game, although the gameplay it's kind of hard to master it's quite enjoyable.
2181	1	a	very good game so far and its worth the money it costs.
2183	1	a	This was a surprise hit for me. After countless hours of game play (and I still have loads of side quests remaining) I can say that this game was excellent. I enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed the mechanics: -hud and interaction don't get in the way of the action, - character progression is detailed but not overwhelming, - maps are huge wth loads to explore with tons of side quests, - storyline is very good and I found the voice acting to be excellent, - grahpics are solid although at times jumpy (but my rig is begining to show its age). All in all this was a good, solid game. Well worth your RPG gaming time. 
2185	1	a	I'm loving this game. It plays similar to Dragon Age, but in a prettier world that's rooted in Celtic mythology.
2187	1	a	Perfect RPG game! The only thing (2 actually) I hate is the Environment limit and Items Durability.
2189	1	a	best game ever, your power depends on your playstyle and whether or not you stay true to that, i did amazing with a sword, shield, heavy armor and crafting.  i died repetedly, while relying on magic, and i had no fun as a rouge.  however, that is because of how i play, not how the game is balanced, which is what really makes this shine to me
2191	1	a	This game is like Skyrim and Dungeon Siege 3 in one game. I love it!
2193	1	a	I bought this bad boy soon after release for PS3 and beat it soon after that. And I loved it so much I knew I'd have to buy it again for PC so I could give it another play through.  There's not much more I can add that the top reviews haven't already covered. In short, it's just a really, really solid action RPG.  The amazing thing about this game is it does no one thing especially well. But it does a lot and it does a lot pretty darn well. The combat is fun. The classes are awesome (I really enjoyed how they did the progressive skill unlocks based on what you specialized in). The world is pretty gorgeous. The music is good. The lore is pretty cool. And the story is alright.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find this much fun for the price in many other games on steam.
2195	1	a	THis game is great! Pity the developers went bust. It plays similar to Fable and has hints of Dragon Age in it as well. The story is engaging and there are tons of side quests which can seem daunting at first but I would advise playing it like you were savouring good wine. The visuals are spot on and with the exception of a few glitchy scenes (especially when talking to people), the background and setting is a delight to watch and observe. The voice acting is great too if you don't mind the occasional echo in the background. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves Fantasy and action RPGs.  10/10
2197	1	a	The best combat system ever.
2199	1	a	Like skyrim with colours, badass sh!t everywhere. Awesome weapons. Unique combat. The bosses are somewhat challenging, but that's where the challenge ends. Cool story. Good graphics.  BUT YOU CANT JUMP! ;_; 45+ hrs and I was 3/4 to the end of story.
2201	1	a	It has Demo, just download it and play. I do not Regret buying it
2203	1	a	Excellent story, excellent character development and customization, mid level replay value.  Playing this made me think of Fable 1, Mass Effect and basically any Medieval RPG that won't let you jump.
2205	1	a	Very good game. Wish skyrim had a similar combat system for melee combat
2207	1	a	I really loved how much there was to do in Amalur until I realized the side quests became tedious after leaving the starting area. The main plot has gandeur moments that rivaled my Skyrim experience, but just like Skyrim the game has an ocean of content but the depth of a puddle. Overall though I would say this RPG is worth giving a shot since it allows customization and a wide range of classes, which I find are usually restricted in other RPGs now for the sake of simplicity. The one thing I wanted more of in this game was the potential to have romance partners considering how many player homes your hero can have, and unlike Fable you can't marry a peasant or quest giver and use that house to its fullest extent. However, I enjoyed it a lot and reccomend it to anyone that wants that God of War feel to combat with a comfy RPG environment.
2209	1	a	What a surprise of a game. A bit of a gem.
2211	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is in all aspects an average RPG.  it's not bad, it's not really good, but it can keep you decently entertained for a while.  Pros - graphics are decent and it seems to run smoothely even on my encrypted laptop - world ... it looks good, has a unique feel and every now and then there's a real eye catcher somehwere - combat and skills ... easy to learn, not much fuss or complexity  Cons - weak story - combat and skills ... too easy for anyone looking for a challenge. - too monoton - cut scenes are really bad   if you're looking for the next Skyrim, this is not it. but if you want a solid action RPG, this might be your choice.  get it if it's on a sale :)
2213	1	a	with a fun and quiet friendly color palette this is a great way to kill a few days :)
2215	1	a	If you like God of War you'll love this game! Buy it!
2217	1	a	a great game. It stole my life, but I don't want it back.
2219	1	a	This is a game i go back to over and over when i want some good story and combat in a rpg, i highly recomend this game since i have played this completed this 3 times. Don't note my gametime on PC cause it was on console. If you are a fan of good combat, RPG, exploring with wonderful story and side quests this is a amazing game to get. Buy it on the price it is or just wait for sale, either way its worth it! 9.5/10
2221	1	a	A very solid and underrated game, great character system, and a decent story  8.5/10
2223	1	a	I kinda surprised by this game it has good level designs, scenery and vibriant colors that screams classic fantasy game. The number of quests in this game(for a single player game) is huge, the main storyline is also pretty good as well. The combat system in this game was also something I really liked, sometimes it's just hack and slach and sometimes you have to be strategic.  The only problems that i had with this game was the poor variations on character design on NPC's, they differ but not much. the seccound thing is that you don't realy seems to be able to connect to any other NPC's then those in the main story line, which i find a little bit dull. Why that is can maybe lay in the fact that even if there is a massive account of quests there is only like 3-4 quests per city and almost only one per quest giver, which results in that thier gratitude seems less appreciated.  But overall I liked it :)
2225	1	a	This game is so addicting and I'm sad that there won't most likely ever be a sequel.
2227	1	a	The Best game I ever Played .
2229	1	a	I say this game is great, took me awhile to beat but still great. Some bugs like some annoying bugs, but not game breaking. The DLCs are worth it except the items, not worth getting they suck. 8/10 for items stuck in my inventory forever bug.
2231	1	a	great game in the true rpg genre of games
2233	1	a	I really like the game! I've never really been into RPGs, I played a little Oblivion &amp; a little Skyrim, but thats mostly it.  But for some reason this game just sucked me in. I can definetly recommend this game if you like lore, and side quest and just in general way to much to do.   Only negative point is the inventory space, see I'm a hoarder. As soon as something is rare I won't throw it away. But there is an easy way to work around this problem. Google is your friend.
2235	1	a	i dunno, but i think i should buy skyrim :(  *edit June 2015 Well, i'm trying to re play it again. Afterall, not soo bad.
2237	1	a	Bought this game on a Steam Sale for $4.99 and it was well worth it. I have seen the game before was a little hesitant to purchase it at full price. I would recommend this game highly though.  It a good action RPG with nice combos and a good skill trees. The feel of the world sort of reminds me of a single player world of warcraft. Lots of quests and places to explore.  As of now I have only played the Fighter but I plan of going back and playing a rogue and spellcaster type.
2239	1	a	Graphics: colours are very beautiful, visual effects are vivid - they aren't that realistic but they have a nice style. Modelling of faces could have been done better, but it isn't that much of an issue. Weapons and armour designs are very nice, too.   Gameplay: It's fun. I played this after Dragon Age, and while it took some adjusting, I found it enjoyable. Also, there are SO MANY side quests.   Story: I mean, it isn't a masterpiece. Story isn't as good as the bigger games like Mass Effect or Bioshock or the MGS series, but it's not ♥♥♥♥.   Overall/my comments: I'd give it 7/10 because I'm the kind of person who really enjoys an amazing story, and well the story wasn't that amazing (but good enough). I mean, you get to play as a dead person brought back to life. It's pretty cool. Usually when I play games, I'd have one that really requires more concentration and one that's just a little more casual. When I was playing this, I had Mass Effect as the 'concentrated' one and this was the more casual one. It does it's job as a video game, it's entertaining and it isn't at all boring.
2241	1	a	excellent, i enjoy playing this type of game
2243	1	a	This game is fun, just plain and simple. The mechanics are simple to learn and not overwhelming. The graphics are pretty decent and it's very engaging gameplay.
2245	1	a	Have you ever played an MMO and thought to yourself 'Wow I hate these other players in my MMO. WIsh I could play my MMO without another player bugging me'?   If this describes a thought you've had while playing mmo, Kingdoms of Amalur was made for you. Kingdoms can be summed up the best as a single player theme park MMO. You wonder from hub to hub, collecting quests, becoming overpowered and collecting gear.  The story is pretty generic, you are risen from the dead as the 'Chosen one' go save the world because I said so.  The story kinda just rebounds you from place to place, serving to keep you somewhat on rails like a parent who tries to keep their kid in line but then gives up and returns to ignroing them and drowning their sorrow in a bottle of cheap wine.  You won't get to drown yourself in cheap liquor but you will get to drown yourself in cheap side quests! While some of them can keep your intrest, most equate to fetch this, or go collect 20 bear arses. The lore waivers from being strong to repeating eveyrhting we automatically know. Spoiler alert: Elves are somewhat Immortal ♥♥♥♥♥.   Combat is a thing, half way between really fun and annoying which equates to this weird outcome of 'I like this in short bursts'. You won't get it in short bursts, you'll get a lot of combat. You can't stop the combat. Your choice of combat is magic combat, sneaky knife combat with some bow, or Imma SMASH IT combat. If you want you can make all combat happen at once by becoming a jack of all trades or you can focus down on your role of combat. So you can be a Archemage or god king fisty mcpunch guy.   The graphics are pretty, the world is bright and colorful, and ruins and swamps are dark and spooky. One of my fav. parts of the game is the Crafting system. It's pretty standard but each weapon you craft is truly yours. You select the parts, and then get to name it. It adds a personal touch to the game and can draw you in.   So should you buy Kingdoms of Amalur?  If on sale, Yes, You can easily get 20 hours of fun out of it before you get burnt out.  If for full price, No unless you really want a single player mmo. 
2247	1	a	Its a fairly fun game with a lot to do. I still haven't finished the main questline yet. Not as immersive as Skyrim, but has a really rich world-a lot of history can be discovered. Combat is fun, and its freaking awesome to be able to reckon someones fate, gives you a lot of really cool death scenes for bosses and minibosses.  8/10, will continue to WRECKon.
2249	1	a	The short and skinny: This game features the art style of World of Warcraft with the open world and quest style of Skyrim. It has huge replay value and is immensely enjoyable, even with some bugs here or there.   Kingdoms of Amalur is both a unrivaled triumph and a missed opportunity. As you play the game you can easily fall in love with it and you'll find an absurd number of things to do in the open world enviroment. Truly there are maybe 5x more quests than you'll need to move through the main story and level up. This allows you to the freedom of turning down quests you dont think would be fun or a waste of time. Or it lets you focus your efforts in a few places and save the other quests for another play through. This really lengthens the replay value of the game. Really the only thing that prevents this game from being as good as or better than skyrim is the absolute zero mod support. Unlike games that don't fully support modding, Amalur simply locks it out without heavy hacking. In that regard the game has no longevity like Skyrim. Which brings me to one problem: the game is buggy and the company that made it has gone bankrupt. There will be no patches to fix anything as even the rights to the game are in arbitration in bankruptcy court. If the game had mod support, players could have patched the bugs, but without it...you have to live with them. Some are more annoying than others but what can you do?  Over all the game is amazing. It really makes me sad to know there will be no sequel as the state of rhode island owns the rights to this title while trying to make up for losses from the bankruptcy. You can google the details on it if you like. The end result is no sequel and no future for Amalur. Its such a good game too... its maddening. It has some quirks and so on, but over all the game is amazing. I can't believe I waited so long to try it. I felt like I missed out. I guess better late than never, right?
2251	1	a	An 3rd person RPG lacking a good storyline; reminiscent of something fail. On the contrary, despite it's rather feeble attempt at immersion.  Good fun all around, no forced classes, variety of weapons/play-styles, graphics are good, stable and no bugs.  7.5/10
2253	1	a	I think the best way to describe this game is that it is a single player MMO. This makes it sort of a mixed bag. The world is large and the story is epic, but the combat is simple and often dull. I often felt like my character didn't necessarily matter at certain points. I also lost interest towards the last 20% and did not complete the main story line. Overall I liked the game enough, it just failed to keep me all the way through. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a long and easy RPG experience.
2255	1	a	This is a great action RPG game. It sort of feels like an evolution to Fable. I love the extra missions and the story line, there is quite a lot of weapon and magic variety and the interactions with the people are great, a lot of dialog and text for those that enjoy reading a game's lore.  I think they did a great job with the voices and the overall feel of the game play. It never becomes dull, you tired of playing warrior style? go switch to wizard for some gold. How about some Thief sneaky action today? Mix them for more fun.  Too many things to explore, many side missions, all of them adding some background story, more lore, more jokes. All of them very enjoyable (and yes, I did ALL of them)  Its a shame the studio went bankrupt I would have loved this to be a series of games.  10/10
2257	1	a	First thing to say. This game is loooong. I played for 36 hours till now and I only completed first part of the really massive map. I'm not sure if I finish this game because of that, but whatever. What I've played yet made me staisfied.   What really stands out here is dynamic and fluid comat system. There are lot of ways to wreak havoc among your enemies which makes this game really enjoyable and keeps you playing over and over.   The other nice touch is the possibility to completely rewrite your character on the fly. Bored with your rougish, sneaky archer? Spend little money and make yourself a tankish, badass hammer-wielding paladin. You can make all sorts of builds but the game focuses on versatility. You can play as standard RPG mono build but You can also excell with a character based on every class available.   The game engine is more than competent. I experienced no hang-ups, glitches, stuttering or framedrops which is really something that makes this game stand-out in comparsion to some recent big game releases.   Graphic style is inspired by the works of Todd McFarlane and if You have seen his comics and figures, You know what to expect. I really dig this set-up and it really helps to enjoy the fairy tale fantasy world that was created here.  What I don't like about this game is the writing. Dialogues are rather boring and I skip them most of the times. I'm not sure what is wrong about them but they seem pretty generic. All the lore that consists of books, lorestones and ballads are really forgetable. The main plot is pretty generic either. Your standard nameless-hero-saving-the-world kind of thing. That's probably the reason why this games didn't receive that much of attention since it release.  Anyway this game is more than decent and if you have abundance of time to waste, this game is more than capable to make you satisfied,
2259	1	a	kind of like Skyrim - alot of fun so far about 20 hours in.
2261	1	a	Opened secret door.  Found chicken overlords.  Attacked chicken overlords.  Chickens fought back. Died fighting chickens.   10/10 - Would hunt chickens again!
2263	1	a	PROS:  Very close to true open-world with rewards for exploring TONS of quests and sidequests including multiple faction lines Visually pleasing Fable-like graphics Combo chain attacks Crafting system for equipment and potions Usual thief/mage/warrior options as well as some minor encouragement to try duel-specing Interesting NPCs with really fantastic voice acting Really fun story  CONS:  Not very well balanced Buggy: some repeating crashes, quest marker glitches, etc. Download the widescreen fixer if you want to save yourself from getting dizzy Overabundance of quests+respawning mobs+in-game mechanic to increase xp+not great scaling system = you can easily overlevel yourself Stuff that feels unfinished: quest items that get perma-stuck in inventory, can't craft accessories, etc. Equipment crafting system at higher levels requires a lot of luck (read: quicksave/reloading) but even at highest levels can't beat found/bought equipment in all cases   OVERALL:  If you want a game that will absorb you for a good number of hours as you run around talking to a million people, navigate massive towns, do crazy numbers of sidequests, and get immersed in a fantasy world that's a little less Tolkien and a little more Fae, you'll enjoy this game.  However, those who care more about mechanics will have complaints. It's very easy to get overleveled, which can make all those many quests feel a bit like dull repetition. I discovered that I'd missed a whole faction quest at low level because I didn't realize I was allowed in an area, but because scaling maxes based on area, I spent the whole time OHKOing everything and then didn't even make enough money to offset my equipment repairs.  Speaking of equipment:  So, you can craft equipment out of pieces you buy or salvage by breaking down other equipment. Salvage works on a somewhat random system that can require dozens of reloads to get what you want. At high blacksmith skill, you can work an enchanted gem into an item so that, when you salvage it, you MIGHT get a crafting piece with the stats of the gem (or a little better).   However, you can find and buy equipment with gem 'sockets' which allow you to freely (at a small cost until you max gem-crafting skill) swap gems into and out of that equipment. And those pieces can also have inherent bonuses of their own. There's also a top-tier rank of gems that only fit into a slot that can only exist on a chestpiece, that can't be crafted into a homemade armor.  So, you could spend a ridiculous amount of time crafting items, reloading until you salvage what you need, and then crafting your masterpiece equipment, but it would only get you close - not all the way - to the best armor you could find just by getting a lucky loot from a kill. And the 'unique' and 'armor set' items can't be salvaged and don't have gem sockets, so while the gimmick of the set bonus might be nice in early game, by halfway through the game such items are just money that's taking up inventory space.  I have a LOT of little complaints, which by themselves don't seem like much but added together feel clunky: - The lockpicking minigame has only a few preset unlock positions, but the 'wiggle' time on a wrong position is so low that you still need to stock up on a million lockpicks to play a broken minigame - Repeatable sidequests ('Tasks') can't be turned off, so the quests markers will always show, the items will sit in your inventory, and they'll take up space in your quest log (and I've run into bugs that seem to trigger on having too many quests currently open) - You can't change the game resolution unless a character isn't loaded and you're at the main menu. This is never explained anywhere and drove me crazy. - The game is ridiculously dizzy with the spinning camera in close-up. If you get this game, check the game guide with information on downloading the free widescreen fix utility because otherwise you won't survive. - Walking back through entire dungeons because there's no shortcut back to the entrance, or, worse, when there's an exit into an outdoor space for the boss fight but for some reason you can't fast-travel from it.   THE BOTTOM LINE  I could go on for a while about the issues I have with this game. I think that if EA took the time to release a patch or two, this could be a really great game. However, when I hit post, I'm going to go back to playing (and finishing) this game, so overall, I recommend.
2265	1	a	I plaed this game for like 15 minutes i run up the hill at the start and i look at the PC screen and wonder wtf i am doing then i turn it off and i havent played it since     10/10
2267	1	a	Got this game while it was on sale. No regrets. Really great game. As of typing, I clocked in 42.6hrs already and I'm not even halfway done. I give this game 9/10  Cons: - Difficulty is easy even on Hard Mode - Quite easy to level up (even on higher levels) - Crafting at Master level gives you godly equipment. Seriously. - The amount of side quests in this game is overwhelming - Day/Night/Weather is really bad. It almost never rains and I can't tell whether its day or night unless I check the time.   Pros: - Fluid control options. You can switch between keyboard/mouse and controller instantly.  - NPCs actually do move around and do their own things. Enemies have a predator/prey relationship. - Although repetitive and generic, the environments are lovely. - Love getting into in-game lores? This is the game for you. - Exceptionally long play time
2269	1	a	This game is very good. Graphics are amazing and runs very smooth. Music is so-so. I liked the every dialogue is fully voiced. Plot is quite interesting. Game works great with x360 gamepad. It's nice you can have 2 weapons equipped and reset your skill trees. The best in this game is combat. I liked the reckoning mode with cool violent finishers that gives an exp bonus. 
2271	1	a	I love this game, it's the RPG I have wanted for sooo long. Everything about the story, the characters and the world are just lovely, not to metion the level progetion, stats, and questing all just feel so right if i had a complaint it would be that the lockpicking is boring and not worth putting any points into because there r only 3 possible locations to put your pick to unlock it, item crafting could have been more polished and the items needed to craft could have been more plentiful in the world because when you buy the parts you end up spending more on the parts than the worth of the item crafted, and a person problem i had was with the dispelling where i could not even do an easy one so i pumped most of my points into it so i could just auto dispell. over i love this game
2273	1	a	Fantastic RPG, only gripe is it went on sale 2 days after i bought it full price.
2275	1	a	very fun game that is full of loot and is similar to dragon age.worth the price!
2277	1	a	This game is filled with exciting missions and combat and is sure to entertain one such as myself for many an hour!
2279	1	a	Great game, own it on PS3 and XBOX 360 and still go back to it when I have nothing else!!
2281	1	a	It starts interestingly enough, then story rises with the amazing seamless settings. I could not stop taking pictures with the screen capture function of Steam!  The way you handle your weapons, awesome. Until you realize that enemies can, and usually will, be able to interrupt your attacks.  Then it gets old. Quests become formulaic.   You realize that if you put your gemmed items in your house's stash, you will lose the gems when you quit and continue the game. And some items can't be placed in your stash at all. This is important since the nature of item-drops in the game will quickly deplete your personal inventory space.  So, the game ends up like this: Quests are pretty much the same in principal. The fighting gets old, and rather frustrating later on when enemies interrupt your attacks. You pick up items, then sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items (from chests, treasure piles, enemy loot, etc), and sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items, and sell them, then resume your quests and exploration, then pick more items, and sell them...  ...and so on and so forth.  90 item spaces for your personal inventory is not enough.
2283	1	a	I'm downvoting so more people would read it: -Wait for the 75%-90% discount; it happened before and it will happen again -It's a GREAT RPG with complex story and dynamic gameplay -Worth full price, but if you can wait you won't be dissapointed -If you're not sure, they have a Demo  Edit: My soul won't let me downvote it.
2285	1	a	Amazing RPG. Beautiful world and the combat is super fun. Dialogue and story are engaging. Found this game more enjoyable than most of the popular RPGs out at the time.
2287	1	a	Probably one of the best combat rpgs, however the story isnt interesting, the game seems to have you run around quite a bit and do nearly the same quests, collect this item, kill these guys. And you wouldn't really expect much from any OTHER game, but the thing is that this game is so lacking in the story department, even in repetative quests there could be a wonderful story much like TW3:WH where every little detail that can be added to any quest, any mission, any character you speak to, is added. But this game I feel like is good if you really enjoy a nice challenging battle, 'bosses' are cool becasue it is just a big monster you run into, they don't really hype it up at all. And finishing moves are interesting as well, though with some enemy types they become stale, but you don't use them too often so I guess it is fine, all in all this game is.  overall - 7/10  combat - 7.5/10  story - 5.5/10  might not seem like much but it is a good buy on sale. not worth 20 bucks I'de say.  again, don't go out of your way, however the game is a good game to buy for an ok rpg fan.
2289	1	a	Had a save with 60hrs in and maybe 70% done, decided to replay to remind myself what's the plot, now 15hrs in and still having metric sh**tonnes of fun. One of the best RPGs I've played
2291	1	a	I enjoy this game because of the character costomization and wide veriety of weapons
2293	1	a	Very Good
2295	1	a	This is one of the really enjoyable games I have played and am just playing it for the second time. It kind of 'grows' on you the longer you play. I started it again and first thought hmmmmm and now an hour later I don't want to stop lol
2297	1	a	Actually a really good RPG with classic elements and multi-colored fantasy. An in my opinion very good and consistent art style, a bit of exaggerated gore and a really nice skill system with balance issues. Too easy for most people, even casuals but with enough motivation to keep playing and wrecking enemy bones.  In KOA:R you create your own character who dies at the beginning of the game and gets revived, only to now that he is now free of any limits set by destiny and that he is the only one to bring victory over the big enemy over-boss. All classic fantasy cliché so far. The story is neither the weakness nor the strength o this game, it just fulfills its purpose.  What stands out is the really well designed world with its races, different areas and effectful beauty. KOA has its own way to it and thats good. From an artistic point of view everything is worth seeing and the lore-stones that are spread throughout the world are also worth searching for because they add a great deal of well voice-acted immersion to the world.   Combat reminds me ratgher to a fighting game. Daggers, chakrams, bows, swords, the faeblades, hammers. Melee and ranged combat, magic, everyone gets served. There are 3 skill trees you can progress in, there is no class binding. Depending on what you choose you can activate certain perks that improve your powerso r give you additional abilities.  So far so good, but why did this game sell so badly?   There are some things that keep the game from being the epic must-have it could have been:  Questing: On one hand you can quest as much as you want, there is always something to do, skillbooks to find, treasures to hunt, bosses to kill. The different guilds all have their own quest-lines. On the other hand however you will not be able to do even half of the quests without being brutally overleveled, meaning the rewards you get will suck. Luckily there are some perks you can get by completing a quest-line. The DLCs are also worth getting, new epic landscapes, weapons and loot await, however they suffer the same problem. Quest rewards are also mostly random and most quest objectives are just the standard roleplay chores Kill X or bring me Y.   The second really bad thing about this game is the difficulty: It is just way too easy even on the hardest options. Sure, you feel epic. But it just gets boring after a while. Additionally there could be more enemies. If you played the Witcher 3 you might know it, there are maybe 30 different enemies but most are just remodels or retextures and can be taken out the same way as all of their kind.  Some skills are just overpowered or not strong enough. A mage for example will be able to pawn enemies with an epic elemental combo (and I mean epic, ability effects in this game are first class and superb) while warriors will have something similarily epic looking but way weaker.   Summing all this up I still think KOA is worth playing and worth your money, it's a shame that it has not reached the perfection it could have reached but that still does not make it a bad game.  8.5/10 I can impale my enemies with pure faith essence, never gets old.  
2299	1	a	Takes some of my favorite elements from Skyrim and World of Warcraft and mashes them together into something new. Play this one with a gamepad on the big screen if at all possible.
2301	1	a	ONE SENTENCE REVIEW:  Kingdoms Of Amalur Reckoning may look generic on the outside but deeper in the game is a good/deep combat system with an interesting story with enough originality to keep you interested until the very end.  LONG REVIEW:  Looking at Kingdoms Of Amalur you'd be forgive for mistaking this as a single-player WoW game. As the biggest flaw in this game is sadly everything looks too generic. And this is a problem as the world being shown in the game is very interesting filled with good voice acting, and a main campaign thats original enough to keep you interested. Without spoiling any of the plot, the game revolves around you (named The Fateless One) who is revived from death by a machine created by the gnomes, and is said to be a detriment to the plan's of the Self Proclaimed Leader of the Winter Fae. Sounds cliche? Don't worry without spoiling the plot I can tell you that this game offers enough originality keeping it from lingering into cliche territory. The lands you explore in the game are actually a mixed bag, The first town you get into is fine and all but sadly feels small and unlike Skyrim or Oblivion, it isn't really that populated. The game does make up for me for having interesting Side Quests (ranging from find the traitor and the cliche, 'Go to Point A then Point B then Go back to me' quests).  So now you're probably asking is it better than Elder Scrolls? NO, Of course NOT! Does that mean you shouldn't buy it? NO, actually if there's ONE THING this game does better than the ES games is that it knows how to do combat well. The combat is primarily simple at first (using default controls) left click to attack, right for spells, 1234567890 to switch between spells. But then the combat goes deeper as the game progresses with the game encouraging you to mix between either Mage, Rogue, and Warrior and getting your own set of perks as you level these 3 Classes up. A thing I have to bring up would be the weapons. For the first time, from the moment you get out of the tutorial you're automatically presented with High end cool looking armour and weapons. No there's no tier 1 2 3, etc. And it gets better that when you craft something they allow you to name it. Sadly though unlike Elder Scrolls ( a game similar to this ) the game feels small. As there are no mounts in the game travelling from Point A to D felt more like a 5-15 minute chore not a badass journey.  So overall yes I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning for its combat, even if the game isnt as good as Elder Scrolls.
2303	1	a	Muh.... This game is OK.  I made a character who looked like voldemort and named him voldemort... Voldemort simulator 1983.\  The gameplay is a bit sketchy , but the story is OK.   This game is a Open World RPG. So you can travel to many different locations, do side quests, kill basicaly anyone you want, and do other stuff.  ^^^^ Talking about killing anyone you want, i kinda killed a whole village! ^_^  
2305	1	a	Game is fun if you like a hack and slash. Somewhat repetative but enjoyable. Lots of quests and will take a while to finish.
2307	1	a	This game is like a cross between Oblivion, Fable and Two Worlds.
2309	1	a	great game has all of the componants of a solid RPG fun abilities great crafting system lokst of dropped fun loot and an unique skill tree setup great game!
2311	1	a	Interesting game, lots of content and such with a great combat and leveling system. This game is unlike other RPGs due to its unique combat system that actually requires a skillful player to succeed in battles. In other RPGs it is simply a button mashing and xp grinding game of frustration but with KofA: Reckoning the player needs to strategically level their character and manage the weapons they use. Overall this game is quite fun and the combat is definitely the highlight.
2313	1	a	This is a great game, the story line is amazing. Enjoying it very much.
2315	1	a	One of the finer and underrated RPGs I've played in a while. Got this and 3 DLCs together for about $13 and had a blast my entire way through. A lot of people like to compare this to Skyrim because they came out around the same time but they are actually very different games.   This game is more cheerful and vibrant like Fable, and its gameplay has all your usual RPG outings (quests, levels, loot, etc.) infused with the flashy combat moves of a Dynasty Warriors game--although I did very much enjoy the stealth gameplay as well. The dual daggers sneak kill never gets old, especially on bigger enemies where your avatar does acrobatics on their back while slicing and dicing like a pro. Overall I think I completed about 203 quests, most of them were 'go here, kill that,' or 'go there, fetch this' type. Yet I didn't mind it since each quest just gave me more reason to go out and enjoy the excellent combat system this game is praised for.  If you haven't tried this game yet and you like RPGs, this one is defintely worth getting.
2317	1	a	like it, good action base rpg.. not good story line, only one direction narrative. but it is unique, and it is also the last, dont expect a sequel. i like it enough to recommend, but sales, and reviews were not good judged otherwise.
2319	1	a	Has a bit of a linear feel to it like most games. Very unique combat system and while the story isnt too interesting the fact you can take off safety mode and slaughter entire villages is pretty awesome.
2321	1	a	I know this is an older game but I just wanted to let everyone know who may not have the pleasant expirience of playing this game yet that it is AMAZING. They did exactly what every single player rpg should do. They have a MASSIVE story line that does manage to keep you interested in it if you dont mind some reading. They have a great leveling system thats comparitive to other major titles. They also did great with the overall feel of the game whether its fighting one of the many different enimies in the game or trading with merchants or even the side quest usually nobody cares about they managed to keep things clean and fun. There are A LARGE amount of different weapons you can choose from depending on whivh suits your fighting style better not to mention the custom weapons you can create. I would really recommend this game to anyone even though its 'an older game' it still has things that rpg's just seem to be a bit lackluster with, Try it out I promise you wont regret this gem.
2323	1	a	Very fun game! Wish they would make another!
2325	1	a	8.8/10
2327	1	a	What a great game! It may have its flaws, but what an well done main quest and fantastic characters. Pity is would have been a fantastic 40 hour game, the last couple of areas really dragged the entire thing down. Think of this game as a single player MMO.
2329	1	a	Love the art style and the story. Combat was ok but not extrordinarily deep and a little repetitve by the end. Overall had a blast!
2331	1	a	Interesting progression system on top of hack-and-slash styled combat makes for a pretty great game overall. The story keeps your interest while not going too far outside the boundaries of your standard RPG. Overall a solid 8/10
2333	1	a	amazing game. im probably going to play it as often as i play skyrim
2335	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur I am in the middle of playing and here are some thoughts on the game. The world is visually beautiful, it is well detailed and has that 'magical' feel. The monsters are well done and the AI controlling them is not too bad, sometimes the monsters just stand there and let you pummel them to death. The NPC's interact with you well and give you several options for tasks. What I like: The visuals The moves Crafting Alchemy Sagecraft Blacksmithing What I do not like: No jumping (really?!?!) Main character does not speak Camera control is odd Some dialog is too fixed Magic seems limited so far
530	0	a	If for whatever reason someone out there would like to play a MMORPG, but without the 'multiplayer' and 'online', this is the game for you.  Also the field of view is balls.
2337	1	a	I really enjoy this game. It almost seems endless! The world is huge, the story is interesting and there are more side quests than seems rationally possible!  Pros: The graphics are bright and colorful, the items and weapons are plentiful and I'm still seeing new enemies! Getting around is esay with plenty of teleport spots available. And the location variety is amazing, I'm often awed by how creative and beautiful the environments are!  Cons: The side quests get repetitive; a lot of them are fetch quests. Not enough puzzles, they pop up here and there but not often enough. Inventory is weight based and I'm constantly returning to towns to sell stuff! It's like freaking Torchlight levels of item management! :)
2339	1	a	While this game was a simple impulse buy, it was one of my best. This game is the Fable 2 that should have been. I've beaten the game twice and I still dont know the plot. But you know what? That's totally OK for a game that brings the nostalgia of Fable 1. I dont remember if you CAN skip the dialog, but since i dont know what the story is about, you probably can. Thanks for satisfying gameplay, Devs.
2341	1	a	Fantastic game although it's heaps short. It's not open world like Skyrim and other RPG's but it certainly is addicting and it provides a great overall gameplay experience. It's only flaw is that is is SUPER easy so I suggest you play on hard if you actually want a challenge. Best RPG I've played so far, 10/10
2343	1	a	One of the best single Rpgs i've ever played. Worth a buy
2345	1	a	I needed something to kill time waiting for Fallout 4, so I played this game that had been hanging out in my library for, I don't even know how long. But I wasn't dissapointed.  Pros -Decent Graphics -Fluid Combat -Huge World -Complex crafting system  Cons -No real challenge (On the plus side I wasn't in the mood for a challenge when I started playing) -Crafting creates seriously over-powered gear -Reakoning modes makes Bosses pointless, not that they were tough before -Did I mention the game was really easy  All in all, not a bad game. Everything looks cool, which was all I wanred out of this game, If your looking for a challlenge, I suppose a few small self imposed rules would make the game harder if you wanted to go that route. But honestly I really enjoy taking the time in a game to craft gear that basically makes combat a walk in park.
2347	1	a	This is a worthy buy if you ever see it on sale. Very rich lore, skill system gives you flexiblity in your playstyle, freaky challenging enemies (lots of variety in enemies, too) and a seemingly endless world to explore a loot. Sometimes it can get a bit tedious and not all of the side quests are interesting but overall you'll find something to sink your teeth into.
2349	1	a	8/10. You'll need to stick with the game for a bit as I didn't find any of the initial story line quests all that interesting. That being said there are a few fairly interesting side quests and advancing your character and combat in general can be fun. Blacksmithing is definitely OP if you max it out as soon as possible though. Im probably 60% through the main story (mins DLC which I have) and my crafted gear is far superior to anything im finding. I'd definitely recommend the game though. I say 8/10 because I think the game was designed around multiplayer and that isnt present and also because there are a lot of stereotypical fantasy genre things in the game like annoying british voice acting etc.
2351	1	a	Awsome game!! Its like a way bigger FABLE with more hours of gameplay.
2353	1	a	Nice game to play, its not a must to play but a nice rpg if you have been missing some rpg action
2355	1	a	The game has a great storyline, a big world, and a lot of quests. Good combat, nice unique wapons and armor.
2357	1	a	I really enjoy this game. Similar in play style to Warcraft, Rift and others, without having all the griefers, trolls and fails to deal with. Plenty of questing to keep you busy (if that's your thing) for many hours on end.
2359	1	a	its addicting for the first 50 hours... then it gets boring and repetitive.  If it's ever on sale for less than 10 bucks... GET IT. This game has more items than skyrim (i feel).
2361	1	a	this is a great game. realy enjoy not being tide down to one set of weapons, and that you are able to equip all available weapons in the game
2363	1	a	if you like Skyrim you will definetly love this game! definetly buy it, though for the price it could be a little cheaper its the same price as Skyrim, it's probably still worth it but i would recomend picking it up on a sale like i did. but its ♥♥♥♥ing AWESOME!!!
2365	1	a	Solid gameplay and expansive lore, like Skyrim with an actual combat system.  Only thing is, the button to run and talk on a controller are the same, so when you go to run away from an npc you just talked to...
2367	1	a	A very under rated game. An Open World RPG with the combat mechanics of an intense action game reminiscent of God of War. If you happen to see this game on sale pick it up, it's definitely worth the 5 bucks!
2369	1	a	Actually a very solid RPG. Not the best, but still very much worth your time.
2371	1	a	I heard that this was at first going to be an MMO, but turned into a single-player game, which is good as far as I'm concerned, because I held off on playing this for a while. It's a pretty standard open world action RPG that stands out for its combat and personalized feel, but it drops the ball in a few places that certainly hampered my enjoyment.  To get the basic stuff out of the way; The visuals work. Subpar texture quality is masked with a cartoony art style and lots of visual effects. The music is memorable, but repetitive, as is the nature for these games. The voice acting is excellent, although sometimes it can be difficult to tell underneath sometimes cringey writing.  The combat is the best part of this game. The best parts of RPG character building meet the scale and feeling of spectacle fighters. Fast, fluid control keeps the battles from feeling too clunky, and the player is given a wide variety of choices with which to handle fair challenges. There is no artificial difficulty here...  Unless we're talking about the camera, one of the game's biggest flaws. The only way to properly target enemies requires moving the camera onto them, and since most enemies come in groups, this means that a large portion of the action will usually be happening off-screen. If I decide to keep the camera focused more on them and less on the enemy I want to hit, my attacks automatically gravitate towards these other opponents. Sometimes, the camera follows an enemy that I knock off a ledge and glitches out for a few seconds. I can't begin to explain how many fights took a bad turn because of crappy camera angles. It ruins what is otherwise a perfect combat system. What this game needed is a targeting button, or attacks that prioritize movement direction over camera control.  Another issue the game has is atmosphere, in the same way Skyrim did. At first, this may not seem like such a big deal, what with the various skills and crafting and unique customizations, along with that huge map. However, scale and robust character tailoring are only half of what makes depth in an RPG such as this. The other half is an immersive game world that both makes sense and is fun to spend time in, and that's where the game loses its footing.  For example, it's nice that the player can rent beds in the various taverns throughout the world. It fits in with the rather generic RPG fare, which is fine, but how often did I end up actually using this feature?  Once. I used it once in the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, plus the expansions, plus a second playthrough. The only reason I used it was because I had to kill time until night so that I could do a specific quest. Otherwise, if I needed a bed, I could just go to one of my houses, which also provided several other helpful services. Even then, most of my visits were simply about inventory management, as the game is extremely generous in keeping the player alive and well anywhere.  The fact is, 99% of the time, the taverns have no reason to exist, which is funny, because I can think of several ways, off the top of my head, how they could have been put in the game while still being useful. How about giving the player a temporary bonus for staying in a rented bed? Or charging gold for fast travel, to perhaps make the world seem a little bigger? Or having more quests that demand completion at a certain time of day? Granted, none of these are perfect solutions, but they have been tried successfully in other games.  There are plenty of other things that make this game feel a bit hollow, like the faction 'system' that is clearly just an excuse to have long lines of sidequests, instead of factions that actually interact with each other and treat the player as more of a group member than an inevitable hero (coughElderScrolls2cough). There are also the characters who are supposedly so important but never need to be spoken to more than once or twice, which could have simply been expanded upon with a few extra sidequests. I could go into more detail about these, but this review is already getting too long.  My verdict: It's still an okay game, despite its glaring flaws. It feels average, even mediocre at some points due to the lack of depth that I already touched upon, but is otherwise a most enjoyable waste of time that went all-out in terms of player customization.
2373	1	a	Simply put, game looks great, story was alright, but the item progression REALLY killed it for me. The world was pretty big with plenty to do, but I didn't want to carry on because I don't feel excited about the gear I get, especially when what seemed to be epic bosses dropped.....blues, just like every other monsters. Also, the special moves are not always valid, so I felt like doing basic attacks the whole game  But it's a pretty good filler if you are running out of RPG games to play  pros - pretty nice art-style - fluid gameplay - 'cool to pull off' combo attacks - large variety of weapons - good enough story  cons - un-interesting quests - EXTREMELY boring items
2375	1	a	Really great game if you just want to sink time into playing a beautiful world. The story is kind of bland but the voice acting is pretty decent. Listening to the fae voices alone makes it worth it. This game has a ton of flaws but is overall good. Don't buy this game expecting excellence. It does everything it set out to do well, not great but well. It's a really decent game and if you don't go in with high expectations you'll be pleased. The breadth and variety of environments is great. One of the best things this game has is that it looks great and there is always minor backstory to be found while exploring giving a little more depth to the world. This game is kind of like that netflix show you put on when your bored but not really paying attention, its fun, doesnt demand attention, and you walk away satisfied. Get it on a sale and you have great ROI, a completionist could easily put 60 hours into this game. At a 5$ sale your only paying ~ 0.08$ per hour. More cost efficent that netflix! (Maybe) Go buy this game and enjoy yourself! 
2377	1	a	Very fun, but is sadly underrated
2379	1	a	I'm not going to say that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, because there are issues that prevent it from earning that but it is a good game.  The character creation tools feel lackluster to start but the system of choosing your class and being able to respec for fairly cheap makes one character incredibly replayable on top of the many paths availible in the game to all kinds of playstyles you can easily swap character abilities to meet any challenge.  Combat feels boring because you kind of just mash the attack key and you either infinitely hitstun your opponent or they do the same to you. The fancier things you can do come from things like spells or abilities that, while flashy, never do as much damage as a basic attack with a good weapon.  The story is amazingly well-written and going out of your way to find more Lore is actually fun to do with the Lorestones. I enjoyed listening to the stories they told and the setting is a certain kind of western fantasy that hasn't been touched on a lot. Faerie lore, the Sidhe and other such things I mean. The main cast is mostly forgettable except for Alyn Shir (the dark elf you're trying to bed) and Agarth (your best bro). I'd say the voice-acting is a B+ at most with some cringe here and there.  There's a lot of potential in this game for enjoyment but it is by no means better than games like The Witcher but it does offer an interesting 30-60 hour experience (depending on how side-questy you feel).  I give this game one thumb up, one thumb sideways, two potatoes, some spare change and a nice country cabin in Yorkshire out of 10.
2381	1	a	One of my favorite action-rpgs of recent years. Lots of side quests, brutal combat, easy customization.
2383	1	a	Gothic 3 should look like this one. Game after little camera fix program is nearly perfect!!!
2385	1	a	Great game!
2387	1	a	Massively underappreciated game. The visuals aren't something to super brag about sure, but the mythology is gorgeous, and map is gigantic, and the combat is really fun. Plus, the option to combine the three skill trees in any way is fantastic.
2389	1	a	This game has so much too offer,hours of exploring,and hours of combat. I recommend this highly.
2391	1	a	Not bad, but not great. Does enough good to be worthy of a playthrough.
2393	1	a	Bought it on sale. The game is really nice with good fighting animation. A lot of classes (inluding hybrids). Character can wield two sets of weapons with no class restrictions. Totally worth of purchase.
2395	1	a	Irish accents for the win.   'Dher Haouse of Weenta!'
2397	1	a	One of the best games ever on the pc. Combat is fun, customization is freaking nice. I originally played this on the xbox360 but was never to fully commit. graphics are nice. performance on my is nice too.
2399	1	a	the game is sort of odd in the beginning, you arent sure the base of how it plays and the story isnt so clear. once the intro and first few side and 2 or 3 main quests are completed the game falls into a comfortable setting and environment to play. it runs very much like a baby of skyrim and world of warcraft. there are a couple of classes and races to choose from and a distinct definition is given for what class uses what type of armor and weapons as you find the items throughout the game.  i would definately recommend this to someone who is starting out in an open world RPG as the mechanics of the game play easier and you will most likely not want to stop after the first hour or so of playing. I found that the game ran smoothly at around 60 fps around high and i have a gigabyte nvidia gtx 650 1gb GDDR5 card. i guess you can say the game is value for money  6.5 / 10
2401	1	a	My verdict: Its not a skyrim, but it had its own charm that made it a good game. there were a few booboos but also skyrim have had thsoe. A huge world to explore, a nice combat system, not to mention the amazing crafting possibilities. Hours or rather, DAYS of fun. :3c
2403	1	a	(played it originally on ps3) A very time consuming, but awesome RPG. 9/10 ( would not recommend more than one playthrough)
2405	1	a	Awsome game. Enjoyed it very much :)
2407	1	a	An extremely solid and polished RPG with almost zero original features.  It's really great, and nothing special at the same time. I like it a lot.
2409	1	a	I enjoyed this game a lot with its beautifully crafted open world.. Mechanics not perfect to me but still was nice experience. 8/10
2411	1	a	I dont really have anything helpful to say except that I loved it so much Ive played it through 3 times!!!
2413	1	a	Very fun game with easy to learn controls and interesting story line.
2415	1	a	This game is a rare piece of RPG. For me the most amazing thing among the others is landscape and design of the creative environment. There are cities, villages, caves, underground castles, jungles, deserts... list goes on. Depending on where you go, you see unique things. Graphics may not be much realistic, but its cartoon-like graphics are still looking good. Ambient lights are also effectively used depending on the location. Game uses a wide varity of colors to bring places to life.   At the start, you are not forced to pick a class, instead, you can change your game style as you wish. There are 3 ability trees: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), Sorcery (Mage). Class system is a destiny cards based system where you pick a card depending on the total ability points you spend in a tree. If you want to play in a different way, just visit a fateweaver and reset your points. Any skill points learned through books or trainers are NOT LOST during this process. It is possible to max skill points with training books and trainers but ability points are limited (Max level is 40). One of the nice things about the class system is that you can create hybrid classes and if you want, you can create a combination of all three classes.  For gameplay, depending on your class, your gameplay will alter. You can use dodge or block as your defense. Although mages can block with talismans, they cannot use parry (Blocking right before enemy attack so you can counter attack). If you can reach high destiny levels, you can even get short range elemetal blinks. You can use any weapon without restriction but to be able to use weapons' special moves, you need to unlock them in ability trees. Only armors has requirements (Such as having 12 points in might tree for warrior armor). There are many creatures in Amalur with mostly their own unique fighting styles so you have to adjust your strategy for them at the beginning.  Among the things that could have been better, I can easily show the journal where you keep track of your quests. All the repeatable quest are located in 'Tasks' section which is very nice yet they still show themselves in the minimap. I wish there was an option to lock-unlock them in the minimap.   Now, let's come to the thing I hated about this game: Dialogs! SO MANY DIALOGS! You may be thinking 'It is a RPG game, of course there will be lots of dialogs' but it is not about that. For example: There is a city called Rathir. When you go and talk to a NPC with a special name (you can only start conversation with those ones), there is a dialog called Rathir that the person tells you something about the city. When you go talk another NPC, he has the same dialog with the same script. (Only it changes some words but idea is the same) Now think like that: there are more than 30 NPCs you can talk and I am just giving an example about the word 'Rathir'. Those NPCs share more than 1 dialog (If you are in a city or village, you will see NPCs sharing at least 4-5 dialogs.). It is not over yet. I just gave an example about one city and believe me, world map is enormous. So my advice is that get familiar with your 'space' button :D It will be your savior.
2417	1	a	+ Bright, colorful world reminiscent of WoW + Real-time combat is fluid and flashy, generally quite satisfying + Flexible class system with hybrid classes, can change any time + Can re-spec at any time for a small amount of gold + Can tweak character's appearance at any time for free + Solid crafting system with smithing, alchemy and sagecraft (make gems to slot into weapons and armor)  ~ Some QTEs. They're minimal but if you really hate them be warned. ~ Story is kind of interesting, but lacks any memorable NPCs and I was never really invested  - Minimal role-playing, conversations have 2 responses, nice guy or ♥♥♥♥. - Combat is not challenging, even on hardest difficculty potions heal instantly with no animation and are easily crafted in bulk or bought cheaply - Although there is fast travel, you will still have to walk long distances some times, and there are no mounts - Dungeon design is uninspired, and they pretty much all feel exactly the same - Skill trees are hugely underwhelming, mostly passives with a few uninteresting abilities. The fun in combat comes from the weapon skills and combos   All in all it's a pretty solid single player RPG. The world is pretty to look at and the combat is fun enough to keep me playing. Do yourself a favor and play mage- Chakrams are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.
2419	1	a	fall 2016: it took me roughly 100 hours to complete the game along with both DLCs and 'most' of the side quests. Overall I really enjoyed it.   The fighting mechanics are definetly a high point of the game for me. If I compare them to let's say Skyrim's fighting mechanics, these are more arcady and unrealistic, but they're just so much more fun. You have more weapon types and combos to choose from and you can cast all kinds of spells at the same time. You can combine skills and have a warrior/mage character for example and let me tell you, roughing up a group of enemies with a greatsword and then finishing them all off with a lightning masterspell without having to switch to it in some menu feels really good :) The story and characters are interesting and the voiceacting is on point. DLCs are worth getting in my opinion as they give you new maps, item sets and stories.   The two things I can imagine players not liking are that most of the set items drop randomly so you're gonna have to grind in said location if you wanna complete that awesome looking set. and that if you play the completionist style when you're doing all the sidequests and exploring everything, you're going to reach the max level quite soon and you might find the game a bit dragged on towards the end. Neither one won't really bother you if you enjoy the game though.  A BIG YES FOR ME! ..the company that made this no longer exists which is a real shame cause I loved it
2421	1	a	Played it before on my old pc, now again on my new one. KOA inn my opinion has one of the best combat in rpg games second only to Dark Souls series. The game while fairly easy is very fun to play and you will likely have less frustrating time compared to other rpg as it's a really smooth and well polished game (even during it's original release). The weapons and armor set is fun to collect too, the quest while consist a lot of fetching but if you do the faction quest it will be quite interesting. The enemies have quite some variation too, but at the end game part the enemies become quite repetitive. Speaking of end game part that is where this game fell short of, as you can feel thaat the devs rush the ending part and it becomes boring. But either way it's still a really great game and i hope someday it will get a sequel. Oh and one more thing the character models and voice over kinda sucks too as it has almost all the same models in each races.  My rating : 8/10
2423	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a standard hack and slash RPG. It is a game developed by Big Huge Gamers (the company name) &amp; 38 Studios.     Pros:    - Gameplay is great, the game involves around leveling up your character and completing quests throughout. There are a lot of sides quests to do, lot of equipment, and a lot of leveling up. The game is open world you can do what you please.  - Graphics itself is very nice too, not outdated for todays standards.  - Combat is pretty good itself, you find new weapons and new equipment to become more powerful throughout.  - Story line is ok, you're this character waking up from a tomb, you discover that evil villians has taken over the land, your job is to save the land from the evil and become the hero.   - There are 3 DLC's to this game, which adds on to the game and makes the game longer, you may buy the whole pack  here.     Cons:     - Camera is terrible, the camera is very sensitive and sometimes uncontrolable. You can assign the controls in the game, however it is very hard to control it when you are in combat.  - No multiplayer, while the game doesn't need multiplayer, the game could have been better with multiplayer in the game. The single player gameplay is good itself.  - Controls are sometimes confusing, however you can assign the controls to assign to your comfort on the keyboard.    Is it worth buying?    If you are a fan of these type of games, go for it. If you are confused whether to buy this game or not for full price, wait until it goes on sale for under $15.00,    I bought this game for $6.   
2425	1	a	Amazing game. Absolutely love it! The art style kinda reminds me of Torch Light 2. Huge world to explore as well.
2427	1	a	It has a really good story line, very well made characters, super fun combat style and crafting options. Only thing that I belive truly piiss people off is the jump option, but I think they did an AWESOME job with the game anyway.  It's sad that this game didn't get as popular as it should. I think it's underrated, I love fantasy RPGs and I can say I had loads of fun playing this game. I wont lie, it has a lot of thing that most RPG fans would hate but worth it in the end. It's fun and I say, get it and play, now more then ever because EA games has announced they will release a KOAR 2. So this one first.
2429	1	a	Very underrated game but - after finding out how to respec; I didn't touch it again. Not sure why I just lost all interest in the game.
2431	1	a	This game is quite the amazing. The combat is what drew me into this game. The best chakrams swirling, Faeblades slicing, daggers dicing, long swords ♥♥♥♥ing things up, shield bashing, mallet pounding game you will play. The combat is so rich and it's really easy to switch it up. I really hope of kingdoms of Amalur 2 is coming out because I will be very interested to see it.
2433	1	a	'Warrior build is bad,' they said.  'Pick a composite class,' they said.  Well, after finishing the game easily with a hammer I got at level 14, I can safely say that Warrior builds are not, in fact, bad (git gud??). Danke writing, (R. A. Salvatore) and acceptably danke combat, making for a pretty danke game overall.
2435	1	a	I had this titile in my library for a long time and finally got around to trying it out. This game is FANTASTIC! The combat system takes a little getting used to and I'm still trying to get acclimated, but I am thoroughly impressed. The story is engaging. The graphics look great maxed out on my gtx 970.  How did this game manage to fly under the radar for so long?  I recommend rpg fans give it a look
2437	1	a	This is a good game to try at least one time in a life.   Cool scenario, cool design and great costumasation of your caracters.  :) Great deal when in special.
2439	1	a	Kingdoms of Amelur is one of the best if not the best RPG game ever made. It has everything you could ever ask for and more.
2441	1	a	A wonderful game. Skyrim but simplified a bit. Good storyline, awesome gameplay. Finished it 3 times.
2443	1	a	Really nice graphics, huge world, and lots of side-quests. The combat is pretty cool too, the way you can mix the types and choose what suits the best. All in all, I'd totally recommend this game.
2445	1	a	Still a great game. The combat system is still better than most fantasy RPGs being created today.
2447	1	a	It may be a button-mashing bit of nonsense as far as combat goes, but the animation style for the combat is so fluid and lovely, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. I go back constantly when I want flowing combat no matter the style of fighting. This is a game I wish had been entirely completed and still had support, or at least the easy capability to mod because it has amazing potential (I believe the company that made it went bankrupt?). So, the voice acting is pretty lackluster, the plot has an interesting idea, but it's the movement that happens while fighting that makes me love this game. If you ever just have a ton of time to kill and want to fill it with interesting and beautiful combat, maybe have a good laugh or two at the voicelines on top of it, this is your game.
2449	1	a	WOW, stumbled upon this game, took a punt when it was on sale and was nervous as the demo didn't work, but it is amazing, loved every moment of the main quest and 2 DLC's, more please.  if you liked skyrim i 'RECKON' you will like this, super pretty,, nice music, not as free roaming, but way more stable, well done big huge games.
2451	1	a	This game is simply excellent. From about five minutes into the demo, I knew I was going to buy this game. Everything about it has drawn me in and kept me playing so far, from the combat to the scenery to the very rewarding loot and all the different quests to choose from, everything has been even better than I expected. Something about being able to equip any weapon and armor combination when you want is extremely satisfying after so many other games restricting your options based on your class. I HIGHLY recommend this game!
2453	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. I've finished it a month ago or so and it has become 'The game' for me. Now it's hard for me to find a new game like this or better :(  If you ask for my poorly 5 hrs of game... I've played on my boyfriend's account, that's why I can say it's good. (so I can play it again on mine)  Anyway if you're interested in good RPG, give Amalur a try. You won't regret it.  Finally Games like this are rare to find nowadays :( .... For me
2455	1	a	Ok. So this game has its issues, however who doesn't?  It has a nace graphical outlook and great large spaced environments, althout a little restricted on exploration compared to sandbox games. However it compensates this with a great and deeply thought out storry that just drags you in and before you know it, the strange names of people and places have become a second nature. Even the side quest, of whic there are plenty and in a way toooo much, feel as a part of the grand story arch. Mechanic wise it has an interesting battle system that allows you to make the aproach you want and the role/class is only restricted in words. On the more negative side, it is made too easy. Even the hardest difficulty is a slight challange. You are littery burried with loot, crafting matterials, etc. Leveling initially is way too fast and before you know it, you are overpowered for the area of which you have explored about 50% and done about the same amout of the quests.
2457	1	a	Love the game!   Positive:  - Awesome graphic art style  - Great gameplay / combat system  - Really good story  - Very fast loading times  - Big varied world  - Extensive crafting  Negative:  - Level cap too low (DLC included)  - Re-spawns are a bit too frequent - Some quests don't get marked as 'finished' / Some quest items get stuck in the inventory.   All in all: Highly recommendable RPG! :)
2459	1	a	This review is certainly a review I should have wirtten long ago, but here we are now.  This game is brilliant, and I loved every second of this expansive game. The design of this game (Which comes from the narritive mind of R.A Salvatore, and Oblivion's director) is an overarching theme that all life is dictated by a thread of fate when they are first created or born; and the protagonist cheating fate and forging a fate of his own that affects the fate of all. The concept is one I've really not seen before in a video game narritive, and it definitely soothes my ache for strong philosophy and writing in video games. The story seems to lack a bit though.. You do meet a few characters througout the story, but they feel more like pieces on a Chess board than breathing individual (Besides one you meet towards the end of the game's second act), but I enjoyed their presences when they were around.  The art is great, I love all of it. It evokes many different vibes, and the environments are lovingly crafted, despite the way each area on the map is segmented out, giving a weird map design in an otherwise fluid game world. Klurikon will forever stand in my brain as a testiment to how much focus a narritive design can have on the impact to the world around the player, while still delivering tight gameplay and fantastic visuals.  The gameplay of Amalur is very reminiscent of the Fable series, giving open variety to the player, and rewarding the player for switching up their moveset and exploring the way to game works. In combat, the player may have two weapons equipped at a time, free to select either with the press of a button; while magic spells are always available to use, and can be selected via the keyboard, while the UI shows any macro'd spells. Fighting enemies offers the players points towards their fate bar, which builds up and allows the player to trance into a state where they can unleash their true awesome power and deliver satisfying finishers to enemies for extra exp, which is a fun treat to watch and revieve; performing well in fights (eg. not taking damage, varying up attack combos) will earn the player more points for the bar.  The DLC is a whole review in itself, as it offers dozens of hours of fresh, new content, so I'll leave this review concise enough. Amalur is a grandly underrated game (I presume due to lack of marketing during its release) and deserves full attention of the gaming audience, please give it a chance to play, you won't be let down-- Look at my face, would I lie?
2461	1	a	Get the camera fix and don't mind the few bugs you come across.  This game is great..
2463	1	a	Very good game, it is often overlooked and that is the bisggest problem with it.
2465	1	a	fun game needs more hype
2467	1	a	Not as bad as people think it is. There is some fun hidden in this game
2469	1	a	Thoroughly enjoyed every last minute of this story and world. Wish there was more to come as was originally planned.
2471	1	a	Super game to enjoy for hours
2473	1	a	I love this game! Played it 5 times through on xbox 360, then another 3 times on pc. Can't get enough of this one. I am sad that the chances of a sequel are slim to none, but that just means more time for me to master this one. Anyone out there that enjoys action RPG games should give this one a go.
2475	1	a	The best game ever that failed due to consultant greed,(skyrim developer) It's just the soundover for the elves should of been done by English actors in English not English actors putting on a fake Irish accent. Like we do when we are taking the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Irish.
2477	1	a	Excellent story, fantastic scenery, and as large as Oblivion. The game is third person and totally scripted but has a large open world with plenty of side quests. The only problem is the final battle; which in the PC version becomes impossible to beat because it switches to a long view with large crystals blocking the view. This seems to be a major coding error and there is no work arround for now. As long as you don't mind not winning the Final battle the game is an excellent value.
2479	1	a	For anyone considering picking this up on sale, I highly recommend it. It is a nice open world RPG in a stunning world. The game mechanics. Combat, and even AI are top notch. It is a shame the company had the issues it did. The best abandoned IP out there, in my opinion.
2481	1	a	One of the best underrated and overlooked RPG Gems , if you liked elders scroll oblivion, this game is going to give lots of hours of joy.
2483	1	a	This game has its flaws, but it sticks in my mind as one of the most underrated RPGs I've ever played. A well-crafted world with fascinating lore, fun combat, and loads of places to explore and quests to complete. A real gem.
2485	1	a	One of my favourite games ever made, NPCs and some side quests are boring but everything else is just good fun.
2487	1	a	great gameplay. combat systems, leveling up, armor and weapons and design top notch. but super sad that there wont be a sequel, but it just makes Kingdoms of Amalur one of its kind. played this in every platform.
2489	1	a	This RPG occupied a lot of my time when I bought it for the Xbox 360. It has the ability to fit whatever combat standard that the player wishes to use. I wish my character would talk but otherwise it has all the trappings of a great fantasy world. I remember listening to Kurt Schilling on The Instance Podcast talking about the direction that they wanted to take the world of Amalur. I believe that it would've been amazing. It's a shame the studio went bankrupt...Sigh.
2491	1	a	Old but gold: One of the best RPGs I've ever played.  Totally worth it, even with some bugs and no support.
2493	1	a	Not the best game I've ever played, but then again it's not 100% my cup of tea. It is a good game with a so far somewhat expansive history. IT seems to be quite long considering I have played for about 48 hours and I think I'm nowhere near even the middle. All in all it is a game worth playing if you want to spend days emmersed in a world whose people act more real then I have seen in a game for a long time.
2495	1	a	Awesome game. I played it on PS3 and Xbox, and now, rule the game again on PC. All is perfect
2497	1	a	A single player version of World of Warcraft.   The good points -Combat it plays so smoothly and nice that I could use the exact same attacks for hours and not get bored by them -Total freedom to choose any combination of skills -Exploring it may be cartoony but it still looks nice and there is a lot of it. -Nice interplay about fate and freedom of choice -Voice acting -Very very long game  The bad points -NPC's are forgettable as in the two main npc's are so forgettable I don't remember them already. -Foreshadowing and RPG tropes run very strongly making well everything very predictable. -Obvious port from console meaning very tiresome inventory/map shenanigans. -The company went bankrupt just before an important patch could be made leaving obvious imperfections. -Subtitles are very unsynced -When talking with someone it can be unnerving to look directly at NPC's. -Not so difficult I played my first try on the hardest setting and only one DLC boss gave me some trouble only because I was underleveled the rest wasn't that challeging.  All in all if you like the typical RPG and enjoy the combat system then this is the game for you because the combat system is wonderful. If on the other hand you want an interactive world, intriguing storyline or an a typical RPG then this is not for you.  That said this game take a long time to finish so I'd advise buying it in a sale and play it in a vacation.
2499	1	a	Overall a fun game, could have been one of the best to have out of 2013, has some great graphics/modelling and battle scenes are good to play in, excellent story line with interesting characters, these are the PRO's  Some of the CONS are some quests have missing links so you can't complete. I've got Nvidia surroundview as my PC set up and I cannot get a chase camera set-up to follow my avatar, had to get used to diferent way of playing. The biggest fault for me was during the Finale [I'll try not to give too much away, don't want to spoli anybody's fun] got to the point where I was in a postion to kill the Big Boss and I couldn't complete because of a fault, in fact my avatar became so far in the 'distance' I could hardly see him and he wasn't able to use the intended technique to finish off the Big Boss.  Would have not recommended this game because of it's faults, but generall it's such good entertainment that could have been unfair, been trying to see if the Developers have got an Update for it,couldn't find one on EA [no surprise there], but hopefully one will be put out through Steam
2501	1	a	Immersive, open-world action RPG that's well worth the money. The combat, skill tree and crafting mechanics do enough for you to overlook the story's shortcomings.
2503	1	a	JUST PURE AWESOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 
2505	1	a	This is game is great, you can buy it if you like rpgs. 20€ for this is nothing ^_^.
2507	1	a	The combat is incredible. This is what the Fable sequels should have been.
2509	1	a	About a year ago I was introduced by an old friend what this game was and didnt want to play till I watched him play, well I fell in love with just how epic the it looked and how the beginning is. I believe everyone should try this game out and see how it is for themselves they might be obsessed or just feel like they are playing some of their fav games but combined. Atleast that is how I feel, I love this game and always lose track of time from how many possibilities of a storyline that this game has, it definitely keeps you moving and in a storyline.
2511	1	a	Mix fable with skyrim and you would get this game. It's pretty fun and the 360 controller works with it. It starts out fun but gets really good once you get to higher levels and you get your higher skills/spells.
2513	1	a	For the most time this game can be extremely fun. The faction quests are interesting enough, the rewards can be very useful, and some NPCs are very likeable.  The graphics are amazing, the Reckoning mode animations make the player feel like a badass. Most of the achievements are quite easy to get and your character isn't constricted into a class at the beginning. (Also your chara can be a male or a female, and there is a character creation sequence at the beginning, so yeah, that's a plus in my books.) You can choose abilities from whatever ability tree and play however you want and if you rethink your 'class', you can use a Fateweaver to respec (for money of course, but at the end of my playthrough I had more than 7 million coins).  The DLCs have their own storyline, with level scaling loot, so that's a plus too.  Problems imo: -Sometimes the camera just flies away when you are fighting. I don't know why (my bet is on its' console port origins), probably watching something more interesting, bc it clearly isn't interested in me dying because I can't see what the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing atm. -Probably connects with the previous: auto-targeting system. It can be nice, but most of the time, it will randomly change targets while you are in the middle of finishing an enemy or get stuck on a downed enemy in Reckoning mode. -Level cap at level 40. The problem is that I haven't even came close to finishing the main questline when I hit the level cap. I haven't grinded at all and used Reckoning mode sparingly (it builds up extra XP). Reached it with just finishing every faction quest and every sidequest I could find (minus the DLCs, bc I did them after the endgame). (After reaching the level cap, I just bulldozed my chara through the main questline, and the DLCs. Almost no enjoyment.)  So.  Pros: lots of loot, interesting stories, nice environment, lorestones, Reckoning mode, some NPCs (Cydan, Secandra, Dren etc.), crafting system, ability trees, destinies, factions, Twists of Fate. Cons: sometimes wacky gameplay mechanics, occasional scream-worthy bugs, LEVEL CAP @40 (!!!), enemy respawning on top of you, not that wide variety of monsters (in the end I got sick of Jottuns, Leanshes and Sprites).  I wouldn't regret buying this game, bc it was awesome. Till I hit the level cap (never going to forget this!), after that it was still exciting but has it's 'meh' moments.  (Also I would like to add that the jumping out spiders almost made me ♥♥♥♥ myself a few times, because that freaking noise is just really over the top when you are concentrating on something else.)
2515	1	a	The beginning of the game was almost unbearably slow, and I absolutely do NOT enjoy the fact that each area you enter is level locked (wiki this for more info). After some progression and crafting starts to take off it does start to shine, but many game aspects are too simplistic and did not live up to it's potential. Not much replayability value.  In the end, I'd recommend this game as long as you can catch it on-sale. The story is okay and it will definitely keep you occupied for a couple days.
2517	1	a	Outstanding game. Reminds me of how charming the original fable was. Combat and magic system is top notch. Enviroments are nice but the cartoony style actually ended up grating on me a bit. I am more of a Witcher style RPG fan but this game was definitely worth the money. So weird that Curt Schilling's 38 studios made this, it's really good. Who knows what they might have made as a follow up. I hope someday someone buys the license and makes a proper sequel. Could be great.
2519	1	a	An amazing action RPG with a lot of things to do. The combat is very action oriented and you are not restricted on what skills you want to use and sometimes you can perform awesome kills when you use Fateshift and you can craft weapons, armor, potions, enchantment gems, and more
2521	1	a	Fun game, only gripe being that the unique items are all so low level, so there's no gear to get once you get past level 20 or so. I don't want to have to use Prism Weapons, they look terribad but you don't get a choice because the crafted stats are OP :T
2523	1	a	A mixture of World of Warcraft, and Fable type gameplay, with Mass Effect style Dialogue options, all set in a game world that surpasses most other RPG's in size.  However, with no Multiplayer (even LAN), many may find this game lacking in the Depth that an MMO can bring.  That having been said, for those who Love WoW and Fable, this game can be a pleasant diversion from the MMO grind.
2525	1	a	This game athoghe Single-player is amazing. The story was made by R.A Salvator the writer of many hit fantasy novels,i'd love to give details on the story but i'd probley give most of it away so i'll i say is, your the only one who can save amalur.
2527	1	a	Great single player RPG Action game - Loved it on Xbox got it again for steam.
2529	1	a	I have this game for Xbox 360 but decided to also buy it for PC along with all the DLCs since it was extremely cheap and a great game that I enjoyed. The gameplay felt so live and fun with all the cool combo moves you could perform with your weapons. The gameplay was very smooth and I enjoyed the fact that you were able to customize your own skill tree and pick your own destinies/faes according to your class or just for fun. Storyline, quests, animations/effects meshed so well together thus this game is definitely my most favorite RPG. Big Huge Games and 38 Studios did a wonderful job creating this well-developed and in-depth game. Surprisingly, EA took part in this and lately their games have been somewhat a big huge pile of failures and unsucessful games. However, KOA:R gave me a wonderful gameplay experience that I will always love, it's just so fun and awesome. I definitely and HIGHLY recommend you to get this game.
2531	1	a	like skyrim, but with better hair.  also I havent left my house in days.
2533	1	a	Amazing! Picked it up on sale, £7.50 with expansions, turns out its worth the £25! The graphics are good, the fighting is engaging, the scale is beyond belief, but best of all, the game runs at a steady 30+ fps on my laptop using a Dual Core 2.0GHz CPU and an Intel HD 3000 graphics card! Well worth the money, seriously recomend for everyone, especially those who like me are stuck with a weak Intel HD graphics card!
2535	1	a	Even for the short time I've played the game I got all the DLC and base game for $9.99 via amazon. But doing the research and finding reviews about the game from the community there is nothing to go wrong with this game!. A mix of skyrim gameplay with some action/adeventure/rpg style makes this game amazing! Not to mention how long of replayability this game has to over makes this one of the best action/rpg's out there to offer and the price was a plus! 2 thumbs up! *HIGH REC*
2537	1	a	HUUUUGE world to explore, hundreds of quest and content to keep you busy.
2539	1	a	Most 8/10 game I have ever played
2541	1	a	The game has a huge amount of immersion, the combat is interesting and engaging, and the customization is different from any other RPG I've played (and the genre dominates my collection of games). I paid the full price for this game when it came out, but if you can get it for a lower price now, absolutely do it.
2543	1	a	Just overall blew skyrim out of the water. the monsters and combat system are just way better.
2545	1	a	It's a Single-Player MMO game
2547	1	a	Initially this game seemed like a forgettable generic action RPG, but as I invested more time into it I discovered that my initial impression was very, very wrong. I think the most accurate description is a combination of Elder Scrolls and God of War. I know that sounds crazy but sink a couple of hours into it and you'll understand. 38 Studios only existed long enough to create one game, but they most certainly made it count.
2549	1	a	Can't belelieve this isn't way more popular. Solid graphics, good story, great gameplay and customization. Defintitely reccomned this game.
2551	1	a	The combat is a blast but the game relies heavily on 'Tell, don't show' to explain its expansive universe. It's also a bit easy.
2553	1	a	Plays like a single-player MMO. There's frankly a lot one could complain about - but the game itself is pretty solid. Sure, the story is forgettable, but the combat is fun and very involved. When I was playing it, I couldn't help but compare it to Torchlight 2 - both are action RPGs with cartoonish graphics and engaging tactical combat. Compared to Torchlight, your hero is a lot more customizable - the ability trees in this game (and destinies) are pretty neat and provide a variety of colourful ways to beat generic monsters up without locking you into following the same specialization/class. Not a whole lot of depth beyond that.  Probably worth it if there's a steam sale going, definitely not worth 20 bux. Maybe if they bundled all the DLCs together...
2555	1	a	Yes I do! It´s a Nice Game!
2557	1	a	Story isn't the strongest but exploring the world and gameplay is solid.
2559	1	a	listen up this is a great game except for 1 thing the moving cam angles suck donkey nuts u either see too low or very high and it makes seeing your surroundings impossible
2561	1	a	Love it.
2563	1	a	This game is a bit under the radar considering I'd never seen nor heard of it until it went on sale, but don't let that disuade you from buying it - it's every bit as good as the other top tier open-world-fantasy-RPG-ish games available.   In a nut shell it feels like 'Elder Scrolls meets Darksiders 2' with the fantasy art style, combat, epic story and equipment/looting systems. Definitely worth the sale price, and I even came back to buy some DLCs which are worthy of purchase as well. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 it would be a solid 8.5 or 9.  Also, if you are like me and don't like the zoom level of the camera you can download a program called Widescreen Fixer and this game is auto-listed in it. Select, set it up, and you can set the zoom as far out as you want.
2565	1	a	I got this game a day ago I have played a total of 1 hr so far. Hardly enough to know much about a game or its story. yet it beat all 3 fables in that hr and its even on par with how much I enjoyed skyrim. Such an underated game. 10/10
2567	1	a	Great RPG game for this small studio. Too bad they went out of business. Good quality game. Slightly easy but a lot of fun and definately worth playing. Originally got it on my 360 but the sale here made it worth getting on my PC too. Good story, Decent combat. Chakras are fun.  I do wish they had full controller support but it is definately doable.
2569	1	a	Great Game, remind's me of Skyrim. Very well made, lot of quest to do with all kinds of different stories. A good open world to explore with hidden tresures and stuffs. The levling system seems good, not the best i've seen but good with some path's you can choose. Overall it's a must play game, addicting and fun. If you love RPG, don't miss this one.
2571	1	a	Slipped under my radar, great game with refreshing combat and visuals. I recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the fantasy RPG genre.
2573	1	a	This game is very good. If you played the demo and were turned off by the controls I have good news. The game itself so far is pretty awesome. The controls work very nicely on a mouse and keyboard (and I also believe gamepads, but I like mouse/keyboard). The graphics are nice, the combat is very nice, the loot is cool, story is nice, side quests, and exploration is cool as well. Two thumbs up. :)
2575	1	a	Excellent. Despite a few rough edges here and there, Reckoning delivers alot. While it's roots in fantasy story telling are apparent it tells a unique enough story anyway. All the ways you can build your character are both fun and viable. The biggest plus for me personally was the fact melee was more involved than in the Elder Scrolls' series. You get a huge world, fun action combat, crafting, and a well written story. It's nice that the writing is consistently good all the way through instead of falling off in the last act.  The games flaws mostly stay out of the way of having a good time, but the lack of control over the camera is dissapointing. You'll often wish you could zoom out more or expand your field of view. I experienced some odd render problems where menus would render off screen or item windows would not display in the right place. This didn't keep me from having a great time but it is indicative of shoddy console ports. It's a shame this studio didn't get more time to polish, or the chance at a sequel. Even with it's flaws this is Elder Scrolls' equal.
2577	1	a	One of the best RPGs I have played in a long time.
2579	1	a	A decent port of a very underrated game. The combat is fast and fluid, the voice acting is of a decent standard and the graphical style is charming. The storyline has a few interesting points to it and the premise as a whole intrigued me. It's definitely an RPG to play if you enjoy the typical mechanics of the genre. While it has a few mechanics that are poor copies of other more established titles (notably The Elder Scrolls) the game does enough on it's own merits for me to recommend it.
2581	1	a	So far I'm really impressed with this game, the interface is simple, much like the Fable series, but it doesn't feel so limited, I always feel like I have everything I need to survive an encounter at my fingertips. It doesn't feel 'clunky' with a mouse/keys like the Fable games do either.
2583	1	a	A wonderful mishmash of Dragon Knight Saga, Skyrim, and several other good RPGs. Special powers are beautifully rendered, combat is visceral and enganging. The story thanks to Salvatore's background is enganging, and enjoyable. If I were you I'd take a closer look at this gem of a game.
2585	1	a	I've been playing this game like an hour, can't believe this game is awesome! Although many of them of is running.
2587	1	a	I sunk around 100 hours into this on the ps3 when it came out and decided to buy this again with all the DLC during a summer sale. Unfortunately for some bizzare unknown reason, you can't change the key bindings which makes it awkward to press some of the keys in my opinion. I binded these 'awkward' keys to my mouse so I don't mind this flaw (that, and to me hard difficulty isn't that hard). The combat is great, it's what makes the game. Feels like a single player MMO for me with housing and housing upgrades you can purchase, factions, being able to respec into any talents you want to along with professions, and a vast open world to explore.
2589	1	a	This game is everything that the Fable series promised to be, and so much more.  The combat and character customization is varied enough to keep your attention, and even provides some replay value. The skill tree is immense and gives players the opportunity to try different approaches. Maybe you want to try out a sorcerer? Maybe stealth really is the way to go? Mix things up a bit and find out.  All of those skills and weapon options provide for some interesting combat. Some may say it's a little 'hack-and-slash' but what fantasy game isn't? Luckily, almost every weapon and skillset offers something different, and the game allows you to switch between two different weapons, allowing for a little variety in your combat.  The game itself is enormous. I've read that with some dedication you could beat the main story line fairly quickly, but there are easily hundreds of hours worth of sidequests to play with. Also, keep in mind, the exact same thing can be said about games like Morrowind, which someone can technically 'beat' in seven minutes.  All in all, I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for some good old fashion fantasy questing.
2591	1	a	THIS GAME IS  HUGE . And this is still an understimation! If you want to explore every corner of this really big world and want to do any side-quests, then you will easily be busy over 100 hours. With 58 hours of gameplay I completed the quests in 4 of the 7 areas, where 2 of them were small DLC areas. With this hugeness of the world I had the problem, that I lost interest in the story and the side quests - it was simply too much. I have to admit skipped a lot of text messages within these 58 hours.  This is a really solid RPG, with a lot of monsters to slay, a lot of people to help and traditional character progression by experience gaining and a skill tree. All messages are with sound files, which is a really nice thing. The story is interesting, the characters varying. I wished for more diversity with the monsters and the battle system, especially in comparison to the hugeness of the world, but it's endurable. The game gets too easy if you spend effort in a good armor and weapon, especially when you use the blacksmit skill.  Overall I'd say: Play this game if you have a lot of time and like vast fantasy worlds!
2593	1	a	The studio that created Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning may have gone out of business, but they left behind the legacy of a terrific game.  I first bought KoA for the XBox 360 a few years ago. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy playing in the living room where the console was (I don't keep a TV in my room), and didn't make much time to play the game despite having enjoyed it immensely.  When I saw it was on sale for Steam about a month ago, I decided to buy it.   I played it frequently over the following few days after the purchase, and fell in love with it all over again.  The main aspect that drew me to KoA was the combat system. The combat system is incredibly fun, and there's plenty of variation. Would you like to be a mage, a warrior, or a rogue? Well, you certainly can be any of those. Or you can be a combination of them. Want to be a warrior-mage with the ability to swing around a giant sword or throw chakrams and magic in enemy faces? Or a warrior-rogue that can sneak up behind people for stealth kills, but still turn into an armored killing machine in close quarters? You can be anything you want to be in the KoA world. The possibilites are seemingly endless.  There's also an entertaining skills system, which allows you to become an expert blacksmith (make your own weapons and armors, sagecrafter (gems for gear), or alchemist (potions galore).  Unfortunately, while this game had an engaging combat system and hours of game play to be had, there were some flaws.  You don't feel very invested in the lore or the characters. Quests are unremarkable, and you'll only do them for the XP most likely.  The game is easy, and doesn't take all that much skill either.  There's also a lot of glitches. I've had items stuck in my inventory that cannot be deleted or deposited. This sucks, since you only have a limited amount of inventory space.  There's little-to-no replayability. I love the fact that you can customize and respec your character however much you want, but this means that there's no incentive to repeat the game by making another character.   Despite these complaints, there are several hours of excitement to be had. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good RPG game. Just don't be too sad that there won't be a second.
2595	1	a	Extremely underrated RPG. Imagine skyrim, with a slightly less interesting world and slightly less immersion but formidable combat.
2597	1	a	Its a fun game, until you realize that its super hard with a play style that doesn't involve shooting fire from your hands and poses no challenge when you do.
2599	1	a	I actually found this game quite enjoyable and very well made. A large scale world with more than just a couple hours to complete. The landscapes are excellent, the game play quite well done, with a variety of choices in the character make-up. A game they actually spent time on to produce. A game made properly, and much more to play than most games that come out today that only take a few hours to complete or if your lucky a couple days. I'd recommend buying it with the add-on packs so you get the full world of play. Companies that make games today should look back on these games to learn how a real game is made.
2601	1	a	Great value for the price, haven't finished it yet but it's a good game so far.
2603	1	a	The gameplay is pretty fun! Unfortunately, mages are underpowered (IMO!). Lots and lots of quests, factions and although the world map seems small at first, it really isn't. You'll be able to pull many hours out of a good RPG, which is a nice change from the 16-20+ hour storylines you constantly see in other games nowadays. Downside is the silly movement you'll experience sometimes: you can't jump and you won't be able to jump down ledges (when there's no jumping point) so sometimes you'll be stuck at an invisible wall that actually is an elevation of the floor. Ahwell. It's still a good game!
2605	1	a	Great game. Huge map and the combat is not limiting at all. The combat becomes more expansive as time goes on, so a first impression during the tutorial part may be a bad one.
2607	1	a	Very satisfying and rewarding to play. If you love RPG's and a good combat system, you'll enjoy this game. Voice acting is not that great and such, but the gameplay is very customizable. Strongly recommend.
2609	1	a	I bought this game for about 12 dollars on a weekend deal or something. It included all of the DLC. The game was well worth it. I spent nearly 80 hours completing this game to my satisfaction and it was pretty fun. If you plan on getting it I suggest you plot getting your trainers early on and make sure to plot how you will get your backpacks as soon as possible. I didn't attempt the DLC until I was max level. You should be aware that if you do not plan your training you will not max every skill, but it's not terribly important. The game is easy street even on hard to be honest.   It reminds me of Fable a little bit as far as difficulty and game style, but it has a little more depth. If you enjoyed any of the Fables, then you will likely enjoy this game.
2611	1	a	This game has a huge amount of similarities to Bethesda's Skyrim / Oblivion and Bioware's SWTOR / Mass Effect in my opinion, with familiar voice actors from these games, and a crafting system that seems like a mashup of all the games' systems (I really like the crafting system). The storylines have a distinct Bethesda feel to them, and the graphics and music have the recognisable Bioware signatures  Overall this is a really great game with well written storylines, stunning graphics, beautiful music, very nice voice acting, and hundreds of hours of playtime. The DLC's are equally as great.
2613	1	a	Good game! Mixture between Fable and Dragon Age: Origins.  Pretty epic ! Try it out !
2615	1	a	Wonky Camera at times, fun combat, and much more content then I thought. A good buy if you can score it on a Fire Sale.
2617	1	a	A large, engrossing RPG world that features excellent combat, but eventually loses its luster because it becomes rather boring. You power up so significantly in this game (even more so with the armor DLC which I purchased) that it's just too easy to clobber everything in your path. Professions are an optional part of the game, but I just blaze on through with the found gear. Best absorbed in small doses.  7/10 Would purchase again (maybe not the armor DLC though)
2619	1	a	If you ever wanted a 3rd person Skyrim with actual fun melee-combat and not powered by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GameBryo, then look no further! While I do agree with the common criticism that the story is very generic, and that the side-quests gets VERY MMO-like (especially near the end), I did overall find this title pretty damn good. Combat flows nicely, the stats and crafting is just complex enough for this type of game, and you can easily regulate how easy/hard the game is by doing or not doing sidequests. Highly recomended!  It's so sad that the studio got disbanded though, I would really love to see a proper sequel to this made by the same team.
2621	1	a	It's like an MMORPG for people that hate people. I ♥♥♥♥ing love it.
2623	1	a	For those who try to compare it to Skyrim.....don't. If you can do that, you will probably enjoy playing this game. And for those that say it's a bad port.....it's not. I played with and keyboard and with a controller.....it plays better on the keyboard. They've create a nice fantasy world.......Give it a try.
2625	1	a	far better than most sandbox style games. tons of fun.
2627	1	a	Solid game, entertaining story and lots of additional content for extended play. Game felt like a mix between Dragon age and old school Might and Magic.
2629	1	a	Graphics are excellent - Gameplay is smooth. Been awhile since I had this much fun in this style of game!
2631	1	a	It is simply vast, but this is a two-edged sword. It is awesome to have so much to do, but it can get overwhelming. It would also have been cool to have some more weapon variety, but it is a simply awesome game, with the best RPG combat I've seen.
2633	1	a	What you wished Fable 2 and 3 were actually like.
2635	1	a	If you actually play this game all the way through, doing all the side quests and such; you get more than your moneys worth. This game is like Skyrim in the fact you can easily put over 100hrs on it and not even notice it.
2637	1	a	I was hesitant in purchasing this game with EA having their hands on it, but I was surprised to have a pretty fun and exciting game in my hands. The major point that really drew me into this was the fact that R.A. Salvatore created the story at large. While the options in selecting your responses is limited to black and white with a dash of gray, the plot itself was amazing. I found myself constantly drawn into not only the main story, but the side quests littered around the entire game. Overall, it was a wonderful experience with replayability.
2639	1	a	This game is FN sweet, a excellent cross between skyrim and other rpg games like prince of persia. its very cool with the builds, and also the effects are amazing. I would give this game a 8 our of 10 for playability and give it an 8 out of 10 for graphics/environment. The only negative aspect. is not being able to jump from any ledge in the game or no climbing. If it had those factors. I would have given it a 10, also the bows having a limited number of arrows that take over 10 secs to replenish is a bit silly, if your going to do something like that make the shot capacity larger than 10
2641	1	a	For anyone who wants an involved RPG with a million NPCs to talk to, a vast and lush landscape to explore, and PLENTY to do (105 hours so far, and while I've finished all main quests, I still have plenty of side quests and several achievements I could still work on), I fail to see how you could possibly pass this one by. I will admit that, since I do tend to do just about every quest there is and, thus, rise in level rather quickly, I was already nearly at the cap (lv40) by the time I did the last of the main quests beginning with the Siege of Mel Senshir, had already found all Lorestones up to that point, and so there was absolutely nothing challenging from that point forward, even if I ran my toon around in nothing but his underwear and boots: he had simply become too powerful for anything thrown at him. The Balor, for example, I defeated in about a minute (if that). But still, it's an awesome game I would highly recommend to anyone who loves RPGs.
2643	1	a	Really enjoying this so far - looks and feels a bit like the WoW universe, but with much more dynamic combat. The usual 40 billion side quests (most of which are quite interesting) but a pretty interesting main quest too so far. Plays really well with an XBox 36 controller, not sure how it is with a mouse + keyboard.
2645	1	a	Easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played, doesn't take itself seriously, and is very easy to spend hours playing without realizing how much time has passed. 5/5
2647	1	a	Amazing game with a ton of content. You wont get more gaming for your money than this game as to offer from any other game out there.
2649	1	a	Got this on a Steam weekend deal. Got a totally unexpected gem of a game!
2651	1	a	All round solid RPG, allows you to combine range/rogue.warrior/tank/mage hybrid in a very nice blend, brilliant lore and in depth story makes this game a must play for any RPG fan
2653	1	a	Fun game. Would recommend, but it has its flaws.  It's tempting to compare it to Skyrim, and I've seen many reviews do so. There's a big open world to explore, lots of locations, NPCs to talk to, fast travel, the ability to smack around some townsfolk if you're into that, etc. But Skyrim is a game about freedom -- you can go anywhere, do what you like, and there will be level-apropriate challenges waiting for you. Meanwhile, Kingdoms of Amalur is a very linear game. You go to area 1, complete the quests for the NPCs with exclamation marks above their head, and by the time you're done, you have outlevelled the random mooks in the area and you should move on to area 2. Lather, rinse, repeat. The main story quests take you through each area in succession, helping to reinforce the 'I should be in this specific area right now, and nowhere else' feeling. You are free to go anywhere else, but there's never any real reason to do so.  About halfway through the game, it starts feeling extremely samey, and it feels like you're just going through the motions. By the time you reach the last area, it starts to feel like the game should have ended a couple of hours ago. There's a lot of running around involved in the game, with some stretches of the map having no enemies for 2 or 3 minutes. This, combined with the fast paced combat, can make the non-combat part of the game feel very tedious.  The combat is fun and extremely well done. Your hits have a lot of weight to them, and allow for a lot of free-form comboing. It is fast paced, and visceral, and you feel like a powerful character.  The story kind of fell flat for me. I never really got into the game all that much, and didn't care about any of the characters. One thing that really bothered me is how the story is about how you are an agent free from fate, and how you can change the fate of anyone you come into contact with. This was extremely contrasted with the actual game story, which was incredibly linear and didn't give you any options, and saw you slave to the game's story. In different hands, I'm sure this could have been raised as a point of discussion, and could have been woven into the story -- If you are free from fate, was that just part of a different fate? However, here it just felt like bad writing, and like no one stopped to think about it.
2655	1	a	one of the best RPG. 
2657	1	a	If you loved skyrim and oblivion and want something similar then this game is amazing. needs another 3rd person camera angle though.
2659	1	a	I love this game, If you like the game Fable The Lost Chapters You would love this game. It gives the same feel as Fable Lost Chapter did back in the day.
2661	1	a	One of the 'Awsomest' RPG's ive played recently!  Unlike most RPG's lately that are somewhat lacking in terms of combat, im thinking Skyrim, but make it up with plot and character progression. Kingdoms of Amalur has an awsome combat system that reminds me of Darksiders or Vindictus (without the smash attacks.) The plot itself was pretty cool but the random sidequests picked up in towns or out and about were somewhat lackluster and usually involved a lot of running to get to your objective. However, Kingdoms of Amalur also has what is called 'faction quests.' As the title suggests these quests are a chain that are issued by a particular group, think thieves guild or mages college and I definately enjoyed doing these.  All in all i'd give Kingdoms of Amalur a 7-8/10, take that how you will.
2663	1	a	This is a superb single player RPG. Excellent storyline and brilliantly done visuals combine that with a very nice skill and combat system. Runs very well even on fairly low spec PC's.
2665	1	a	This game is filled to the brim with incredible adventures, quirky and humorous dialogue, fantastic visual combat &amp; spell casting. The downloadable content does not disappoint either. The tale of Dead Kel and the Teeth of Naros set you upon more questing fun in which you learn more about the wonderful lore of Amalur. If you want an rpg game that won't dissappoint you and that will give you at least a week's worth of game time, Get this Game!
2667	1	a	easy game but has amazing story and tons to do and the game makes you feel very important and special
2669	1	a	Anyone who enjoyed fable 1, or Ninja gaiden black will love this game.
2671	1	a	Get lost in the interesting world of Amalur. Have the freedom to roam around, fight on your own term, craft your own weapons and armor, unlock skills, magical spells and bend fate to you will. Your will be pulled into the story and the world. A game worth having.
2673	1	a	It's like next-gen Fable. Molyneux eat your heart out.
2675	1	a	Awesome game! sad to hear about the launch fail. WIsh i would have been more aware of the game i would definitely had bought into it. Great Game
2677	1	a	It may seem a bit dull at first, but when you get enough levels and skill upgrades, this game really begins to shine!
2679	1	a	I've spent 7 plus hours on this one and so far I really like it. It works really well on Windows 8.1. It's well worth the price in my opinion.
2681	1	a	The combat system is very satisfying (seriously, it's great). However, the invisible walls needs getting used to and the world seems small. Regardless, it's much fun. Highly recommended. Just don't expect something massive like Skyrim.
2683	1	a	I just finished the main game and am working on the first DLC. My impression of the game? It is seriously and extremely above average! It is somewhat near but not at 'fantastic'. The game is fun, engaging and very entertaining. If you like fantasy RPG's...then get this game! You will not regret it.
2685	1	a	This game is awesoe the combat system is great the story line is great the game overall is great beside the glitches and some other random stuff i give it a 9/10 because it reminds me of skyrim a little
2687	1	a	Love this game. I got into Dragons Age while I was in the desert and completed it pretty quickly. This game reminds me of that, but it is far more vast. Combat is fun, hack and slish style with some spells. deffinatley playable for several hours, if you catch it on sale, it's worth it.
2689	1	a	The fight system is really nice. Alas, the game is a bit too linear. It's like long (very long) corridors linking different arenas. But even so, the innovative fight system and the nice illustration are worth playing. Game difficulty is not a challenge. It is perfect for casual gamers but for players who like some challenge, it can be disappointing.
2691	1	a	Great gameplay, storyline, graphics. Feels MMO-ish, in a way. That is a good thing
2693	1	a	Much fun, very combat, wow.
2695	1	a	Superb chill-out RPG for the couch and a gamepad.
2697	1	a	This is an amazing game. One of the first games where i actually enjoyed the crafting system. Story is amazing and the side quests are not repetetive. 10/10
2699	1	a	Well, Kingdoms of Amalur. Great game, great fun.  First of all, this game is huge. I've already spent like 27 hours, and I'm not even close to reaching halfway. There's always something to do, some generic quests, some different.   I truly enjoyed the art style in the game so far, giving me a shiny world, dark dungeons or maybe an outburned village. Nothing out of the ordinairy graphics wise, but still fine looking.  Combat is fun, it's easy though. If you don't put any limitations on yourself you will just rush through it. The last time I died was in a boss battle I was underleveld and equiped for. But combat is quick, and has a good amount of different options to it.  A giant plus is the story, it is understandable, has some different sides to it. And from the point on which I'm right now, it seems to become quite the adventure.  Last thing, it's overly generic. EAesque. Nothing really new, but still fun. I really enjoy playing this game, so give it a go. If you are looking for something groundbreaking, start browsing the indie section.
2701	1	a	I've played a few hours of this game and it is a single player mmo basically, with crafting, loot, skill trees (and ability trees, you get to spend 3 points on combat-related abilities per level and 1 point on a non-combat tree per level, each), tons of quests, a combo/charge system for weaponry depending on how you spend your skill points. Keyboard/mouse controls work just fine, but personally I am liking using a wired xbox 360 controller much more, haven't had to change any button mapping it's nicely laid out for the controller. If this game lasts ~60 hours total (it's open world so I imagine it will) it will have easily been worth the price. Very fun game if like the mmo/skyrim/rpg/fable genre of games. Try the demo (but either/or turn off post-processing,or force 2x aa through your video card or you'll get black screen during cinematic/gameplay; fair warning for the demo any settings you change will not save). Full game has no blackscreen or settings-saving issues.
2703	1	a	This game is a hell of a lot of fun to play. I recently went for all the achievements and it didn't feel like a grind. I find myself continuously creating new characters to wander through those starting areas as a noob again, planning out my character's levels as I go.  I love how at any moment in-game you can visit a Fateweaver and change all your stats and abilities for a small fee relative to your level. If you're unhappy with your current build, bam, make a new one! I had the most fun with a mostly Warrior longsword / greatsword with some Finesse thrown in.  Combat is fun and rewarding in that you unlock combos as you level up so you can hit off a dodge roll, combo after parrying, delayed attacks etc. Each weapon has unique attack patterns and it's fun to experiment with all different types of weapons.  Don't even get me started on the amount of content. Jesus God. There are 5 faction story lines in addition to the main questline, and then add the *awesome* DLCs and all the side quests ... if you like finding new things to do, Amalur will always have something ready for you. Honestly I liked the DLC storylines a bit better than the main storyline.  It's easy to feel overpowered as you can craft pretty epic equipment for yourself and if you go back to do earlier content you completely destroy. I went around this by creating new characters all the time but I know the feeling of being too powerful. Another way around this is to play on hard &amp; limit your gemcrafting and blacksmithing.  I really had a lot of fun playing this and I highly recommend giving it a try if you like action combat and if you have an xbox / ps3 controller (I find it more fun to play using one). I bought this game 2 years ago for $54 with both DLCs and I have found it totally worth it. After 100%ing the achievements I still want to create a new character and jump right back in!  9.5/10
2705	1	a	This is a good solid third person over the shoulder RPG. It is similiar to Oblivion and Skyrim but not nearly as complicated nor as long. The humor is quite good and the story is interesting. The animation is a little colorful for my tastes but still less cartoon like than others. It doesn't take long to level up so that means it can get too easy when it comes to the fighting. Best to change your fate and try different classes in order to freshen up the game. Or change weapons as there are several different kinds. I would recommend paying no more than $20 for it as it is a little short even with the two DLCs. But I definitely recommend the game as fun and enjoyable.
2707	1	a	I've played this game on 360 and I have to say, I absolutely loved it. The graphics are gorgeous and the game play is -very- user friendly. It's got a great storyline, customizable features, enough looting for any avid gamer and the armor upgrades make me drool. When I saw Reckoning was on steam (and on sale), I knew I had to have it!
2709	1	a	I've had a lot of fun with this game. Definitely didn't get as much attention as it deserved. It went in the direction I always felt Fable II should have gone, and for me is a great spiritual successor to Fable. The story was surprisingly good as well, which seems harder to come by these days. That being said, the game's combat is simple as hell and doesn't take long before it starts to feel really bland and repetitive.   7/10
2711	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a game the like of which we don't see often. With more lore, backstory, quests and tales than we have seen today. If you are an RPG fan, who doesn't want to finish a game after 4 hours, forget COD or BF. Kindoms of Amalur is your game to play! This is what a game is supposed to look like.
2713	1	a	ABsolutely fantastic game from start to finish. The combat is smooth, clean, and the combos you can make are visually-pleasing. All the armor you equip looks badass, and the weapons are player-preferred. Although there are only 7 different weapons (sword, two-hand, hammer, chakram, staff, wand, sylvan blades), the combos that can be made with them (along with mixing the weapon combos together, such as switching from a sword to chakram mid-combo) is extremely satisfying. The three skill trees are wide, with several tiers of skills. The game, in it's simplest form, is an outstanding hack-n-slash game with endless forms of combat. Want to launch enemies into the air with spikes just by punching your fist into the ground? Want to pull enemies towards you with telekinesis? How about tearing your enemies to shreds with chakrams and sylvan blades? It's all in this game. You have to get it. I haven't even mentioned the other awesome things that are in this game, but I extremely recommend that you get this game right now. If it's on sale, it's a must-have.
2715	1	a	Great game, crafting is a little simplitisic but overall a good well rounded game.
2717	1	a	This game is Fable... the way it was supposed to be made.
2719	1	a	It's everything you can expect from an RPG.
2721	1	a	Ok, this game is simply amazing, i dind't really played that much through the other classes elements, but as a rogue-ish thieve-is archer, is just awesome, the story is great, really nice time shifting stuff, and the way the story runs arround the main character is also really great. The way you manage your inventory, your skills and your abilities is very complex, yet simple to use. Well, i really like open world RPGs with nice story, so i might be overestimating this game, but i think it really is superior to similar styled games.
2723	1	a	I like it a lot, haven't quite finished it yet but it is still good. I wouldn't compare it to Skyrim or any RPG that released around when it did, because they aren't like it eachother too much. It's art style is kind of like Fable, but other than that they don't really have much in common. Combat is really fun, RPG elements are pretty good, and exploring the vast colorful map is really cool.
2725	1	a	R. A. Salvatore created the game universe and it is a BIG. HUGE. GAME. Todd McFarlane stepping in to design and direct the incredible artwork throughout. All the gameplay is driven off of those 2 efforts and it bests Skyrim and Witcher in many ways, in my opinion.  The only single negative I have is the inability (with a regular keyboard and mouse) to easily switch-to and fire your magical abilities...(you have to tap the ability mapped number key and then right-mouse click - 2 hands, so firing off 3 magic abilities requires 6 strokes) But no problems with other methods of combat. If you have a macro-capable RPG controller like a Logitech G13 or programmable keyboard method with software, than it's fine.
2727	1	a	While not perfect, this actually turned out to be a pretty fun RPG. The main story is a slow burn, be patient. Overall I'd say this is an underrated, overlooked gem from a doomed studio.
2729	1	a	love this game, very addictive
2731	1	a	I honestly didn't expect much out of this game. But once i started palying it i found my self in a trace. This games is really fantastic.
2733	1	a	Well, I don't know much, if anything atall about the company, or anyhting to do with its production. But this game is pretty damned good! It's got a very large world to explore, a lot of side quests, a lot of levels, enemys, and choices. Along with various skills you can chose and can help you progress in the game. There is quite a varity of weapons, and you can even make a hybrid character in Magic, Finess(Stealth, Bows, ect) and strengh! All of them are very viable choices. All in all, I've give this game an 8.7/10. My reasoning. Its pretty, it had a nice varity, and it has give me around 6 hours game play with just 5 quests compleated. Not even main ones! The only drawback is the dumbass AI with the stealth mechanics. Even worse than Skyrim.
2735	1	a	To everyone involved in making this game, thank you for crafting such an immersive joy ride. This 'playable novel' is inventive with careful attention to detail (and vast amounts of it--far above average).  Those who merely want a twitch game might be disappointed; it's not very challenging once the character becomes developed, but that is part of the story design (and only those most afflicted with ADHD will be negatively impacted). Anyone who wants a great fantasy story to live will not be disappointed. Kingdoms of Amalur sets the bar very high in both quality and quantity: huge lands with tons of distractions (from hidden nooks to intricate side quests), interesting character skill development options, colorful variety and careful backstory for both characters and environments (wonderfully realized lorestones!), loaded expansions (even more value and variety), and for the most part, the best voice acting I've ever witnessed (now with 100% more real feelings!). Trust me when I say that you cannot fairly judge the game based on its tutorial phase.  So much detail has gone into the storytelling aspects, that it approaches the lofty goal of suspending your disbelief, a power that only the best movies and novels have. The main hurdle to this is the often terrible dialog options for the main character, though they are not nearly as moronic as some games. Any good storyteller will agree that clever-yet-realistic dialog is key to believability (and fun), and by doing shortcuts (shoddy, creativity-devoid choices), the designers damage the immersion they work so hard to build in other areas. If you are picky as I am, you will find yourself not choosing certain options simply because they make your character sound like an imbecile. Roleplaying/design still is in its infancy, and I hope it will improve as writers realize the importance of dialog that works both ways.  Gameplay is not as smooth as it could be in some cases, but by the time you reach the astonishing city of Rathir, you should hardly notice it. I look forward to seeing how the genre can top this gem of a game.
2737	1	a	Enormous world to explore
2739	1	a	Fantastic and tons of content. I put in well over 100 hours and maybe did half the missions. Lots of build possibilities though the missions and baddies do get repetitive after a while. Well worth the money, especially if it's on sale.
2741	1	a	Great older RPG! It reminds me a bit of fable but with better combat and much more to do. Levelling up seems to take forever but that's okay. Overall great!
2743	1	a	Reckoning is really one of those games where you, as a player, are encouraged to enjoy the game however you want to play it. No matter how you distribute your talents, there's a destiny (set of class related perks and bonuses). Truly a fun game, and the plot is actually pretty good.   Side quests galore, spent 110 hours playing this game and I didn't even finish off some of the secondary plot chains. Even the side quests have plots. It's a great overall experience for an RPG, it plays like a hybrid of Fable and Dark Souls with the difficulty at manageable to easy and adds in a pretty good amount of lore and story to keep you interested but not bored of the plot. It was enough story for me to read what NPCs were saying, and Lorestones give you some quick story bits relative to the area.   Weapons are really satisfying when they connect with opponents and vary greatly in damage, range and speed. Combat can be fast paced or you can take your time getting just the right moment to strike. Spells offer limited variety in the elements (Earth, Lightning, Ice, Fire, Poison) and have some interesting mechanics.  Resisted buying this game for quite some time, I don't like to support EA, but it was a worthwhile investment.
2745	1	a	This game is packed to the gills with content and has to be one of the best open world RPGs I have ever played.
2747	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning will always been one of my favorite games. It was not perfect, bugs, and unbalalnced attributes will allways be a part of this game but for some reason I keep coming back for more. Here I am, a years later still redownloading it on every computer I come by to play it again and again.
2749	1	a	KOA is an amazing fantasy RPG. The immersive story is well told and fun to follow. The game is blessed with an impressive and multi-aspected leveling system. Easily possesing one of the best combat systems in a Fantasy RPG I have ever personally experienced.
2751	1	a	Its a pretty solid open world RPG that is worth 20 bucks. I'd easily pay 30. Its promising a lot of play time, has a decent crafting and character development system and has a nice combat system.  The graphics are alright, the voice acting is pretty good, and the combat has some issues but is something I find enjoyable.  I'm running as a warrior/mage on hard mode and so far its kept me entertained.  My only complaint so far is that the user interface is kinda crappy and a pain to work, and blocking in combat is just odd. Sometimes combat feels a little sticky, but I think thats just me as a player. I have trouble blocking an dodging incoming damage sometimes because breaking out of a sword swing isn't instant.
2753	1	a	This games story was actually not bad, the main draw to this game is the combat though. The combat was always fun, if you got bored with a certain type of weapon you could just swap. The level up system was also fairly interesting, but there were a few things that were odd with it. Mainly how capping works, as you get gear and finish faction quests(for the twists of fate) you get stuff like +1 all acquired might abilities, however its not until you get to +3 of said ability tree that you see that it caps out at +2(Such as 7of5 or 8of6). Another complaint is that the item effects are never listed anywhere in the menu so its up the the player to infer them(assuming crit chance was addative i guess i had about 65%). The worst part about the game was the side quests(not facation quests), i found myself doing all of them at the start, but they quickly got boring. That said, i never had to grind and i hit max level before going to the last boss, so the pacing was actually pretty good, and the ability to respec at any time made it easy to change my playstyle if i was starting to lose interest(such as fighter to mage). I would say this game is worth playing, just skip the majority of the side quests as they generally have very little to do with the plot.
2755	1	a	THIS IS WHAT FABLE 3 SHOULD HAVE BEEN! so with that buy it.
2757	1	a	Fable and The Elder Scrolls all rolled into one
2759	1	a	Not even an hour into playing this game you can tell that it is a collaboration from the minds of fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, comic book legend and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, and the team behind the Elder Scrolls games. This is a long game set in an immense world. It is so long and has so many side quests that after finishing the main story line and the end credits scroll, the game isn't over and you can continue to explore the world and finish the rest of the side quests.   The style and gameplay seems like a combination of the Fable series and the Darksiders series, but without an emphasis on morality, and a wider array of weapons and armor. The crafting system in the form of blacksmithing and creating socketable gems is useful and easy enough, but seems relatively moot when more powerful items can be found in looted chests or dropped by enemies. The class system is interesting in that you don't have to choose one skill tree over an other and you can mix and match skills as you see fit. This leads to the game's 'Destiny' cards that serve as the game's classes based on how skill points are invested. It is basically different combinations of warrior, mage, and rogue; and even all three.   The game maintained my interest throughout the whole play through, but I will admit that the side quests started feeling tedious and I started to ignore them all together in favor of seeing how the main storyline plays out. If I want, I can still finish the side quests since the game continues after completing the main quests.   I recommend this game if you are a fan of the Darksider or Fable style of action RPGs that are controller friendly and take the time to flesh out a storyline and develop an immersive world.
2761	1	a	Overall I find that this game has been everything I had expected it to be. The graphics style is stunning and for me personally one of my favorite aspects along with the quality of the voice acting which is above par. The combat is definitely interactive compared to other RPGs, depending on what difficulty setting you play on and with regard to your class (mages are complete faceroll at end-game). The 'Reckoning' mode in the game is bitter-sweet, the slow-mo and brutal finishers that it enables are well and good, but by end-game you're just using it for its massive damage increase as you will have seen the finishers by this point a million times. Some people find the camera angles to be frustrating in the game and I admit on occassion they can be, but for the most part they are forgiveable. As for controls, the default keybinds for this game are decent/good but there are some tweaks that you will likely want to make. The main quests are decently written, however the side quests typically offer mediocre background info into the world and are often the generic, 'Find and Return 'This'', 'Kill 'X' amount of this', etc. The map is fairly large with varyingly unique regions and if you purchase the DLC then even more so (naturally). You are presented with the oppurtunity to own I believe 3 different houses within the game, with at least 2 of them being renovateable. Overall, the game is definitely classic as a standard for an RPG, with the few things hindering it being some 'bug' and game mechanic nuisances. There were on a few occassions places where the music/audio seemed to drop (usually during combat if this happens). Your pet/familiar (if you have one) is registered as a physical entity and sometimes it blocking your movement can be annoying. Leaving a dungeon can be annoying, as sometimes you may have to loop ALL the way back around to get to the exit (you can't just fast travel to leave). The most annoying mechanic in the game, THE USE OF 'Jump Points'. There is no true 'jump' button in the game and this means that in some instances you will have to 'walk around' edges etc, instead of just jumping off a slight ledge. Finally, the weapon/gear itemization in this game sadly is mediocre, if you don't craft your own weapons you will likely go large intervals before finding upgrades.   My final comments on the DLC and game in general; the DLC provides new quest lines,map regions, and access to a pet stable, but is absolutely by no means crucial to the game experience. The Legend of Dead Kel DLC was completely underwhelming in my opinion. However, the Teeth of Naros DLC does have an interesting quest-line and introduces you to the race known as the 'Kollasae'.  ***Personally, I would only buy this game and the DLC if it were on sale. The game is worthwhile if you're a fan of RPGs in general, but otherwise there are definitely better games. ***
2763	1	a	Defintely a lot better than most people made it out to be although main story wise it is VERY SHORT. It took me less than a day to complete the main storyline. ALTHOUGH with the DLC and side quests it does make a longer experience. Definite buy if it is on sale.
2765	1	a	It's a good game. It has it's faults such as glitches and the graphics, but on the other hand the combat system is awesome, between the ability to choose how you play in fights to reckoning mode it's too much fun. Overall it's a imperfect game that's still fun if you want to have some fun combate and a rather interesting world.
2767	1	a	The first and only massive RPG from 38 Studios. This game will take you on a long ride that i personally enjoyed every minute of. With deep class cusutomization and quests that never end, this game is great for long breaks (summer, christmas, ect.) The game is an amazing cross between open world and action RPG elements that create one of the most fluid combat systems ever. I adore the graphical style, music, arrmor sets, abilities, ect. Worth whatever price it is set at. Played over 200 hours with my 360 copy and steam combined.
2769	1	a	Its pretty solid so far on hard mode. Lots of action - the combat is tight
2771	1	a	One of the best sandbox games I have ever played. If you like games like Skyrim then this is definitely worth the $.
2773	1	a	wow awesome game! i wish i could see the true completed version but we may never get to see it. overall this is the baddest 1 player rpg hack slash / loot game ever unique items are epic .
2775	1	a	Aside from the limited gamepad configuration that only allows you to have 4 skills on shortcut (compared to 8 skills if using keyboard and mouse), this is actually a nice little gem of an action RPG. I am not really enthusiastic about digging through the whole main story and the history behind it, but generally find it as solid. I was a bit disappointed that no matter what race our main character is, no changes of plot are given. Your human character starts the same journey and ends it just like your elf character.   The main feature that pulls me to this game is its gameplay. It has a tight control in movements; attacking and switching between weapons are fluid; the battles are fast-paced enough that u will be thrown frantically many times, especially if set to hard mode. Although for more action-oriented gamers, this game is still assumed too easy.
2777	1	a	fantastic graphics that oftentimes remind me of looking at Kinkade paintings. I would recommend the price point on that point alone, but the combat system is a lot of fun, the questing is non-linear and abundant, the world is huge and traveling it with the simple teleport system is genius. If Skyrim hadn't come out, this would be the number one game on the RPG shelf.
2779	1	a	great game beat on the ps3 awhile back got a descent laptop and have turned my head against systems , i have beat the game two times on old ps3 now beating again on laptop so yeah its good
2781	1	a	There is ALOT of game here and definitely worth the price when it's on sale. I am enjoying it. Tip: Play it on HARD - it's really more like 'normal' for any other game.
2783	1	a	This game has a lot quests and great graphics, I would recommend this game for anybody who enjoys RPGs like me ;)
2785	1	a	Play this game!
2787	1	a	Great RPG
2789	1	a	First off, if you look at my hours played that included just letting it sit. I probably played more like 50-55 hours. The game started out strong but within the first 5 hours or so I started listening to podcasts instead of the game dialog or music, because it was super repetitive. In fact that is the story of the game, repetition. It isn’t a bad game, but I wouldn’t say it is good. I would only suggest playing it if you have played something like Skyrim or Dragon Age.
2791	1	a	This game is the middle ground between Fable and Elderscrolls, with a closer focus on combat. That is prob the best way to describe it. Expect far more depth than Fable, but far less than Skyrim. Less liniar that Fable, far more so than an Elder Scroll's game. Graphics that kick Fable into the mud, but are not up to the standard of Skyrim.   Combat has far more depth than both in complexity, but is essentually button-mashing that requires timing.   The main Quest has more of a story and lore than Skyim, but the side quests are all 'Go here, kill, come back' and predictable with no NPC depth like Fable.  Overall great fun, easy to get 30 hours from a playthrough, but the repetitiveness means it is not really worth the cash when you could buy Skyrim instead. Wait for a sale and grab it.
2793	1	a	I PUKED RAINBOWS!!!! ITS BEAUTIFUL!!!! ITS FUN!!!! ITS GOD OF WAR LIKE!!!! NARWHAL BACONS!!!! OH YEAH!!! C-COMBO BREAKERR!!!!
2795	1	a	One of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing. It has great replay value, and it seems you'll never run out of quests. Hightly recommended.
2797	1	a	Not so bad, pretty fun &amp; a hell lot of things to do. Graphics aren't that bad, there's side quests and the storyline is pretty fun, a pretty big map, lots of things to explore, the combat system is good, you can craft potions and your own armor, &amp; then rename it which I think seems, awesome. Lots of different unique armor and weapons to find, killing innocents ;D, breaking out of jail, stealing, pickpocketing, lockpicking, dungeons to complete and a crapload more. Overall, I'd rate this game a..... 6/10 Not the best game in the world, but i'd reccomend you to give it a shot
2799	1	a	One of my all time favorite RPG's ever. It actuallty is my favorite game. And for the game and all DLC's for 11 dollars..you can't go wrong....BUY IT
2801	1	a	Wow! I was most pleasantly surprised by this game, probably about 25%/35% in. It resembles Fable (in a good way). Its quests embed sufficient story to obscure the foundation of any mission ('find/harvest/kill/visit X'). The story itself is quite adequate: multiple faction story lines, sufficient missions. Weaknesses: graphically unimpressive, no party system, dialogue menu options often uninspiring, awkward controls.
2803	1	a	This game is as fun as you'd want your RPG. IT has all the clasic elements of a good RPG, but at a quick pace where it makes you feel like you are conqueering the entire universe with the with only the tip of your own ♥♥♥♥♥. This is because you have that power. Only you.    In all seriousness, it is actually different from the normal boring RPG where you are some orphan or something and you find out you ball have some special power. YOU DIED. Thats how the game starts. i am addicted to this game and I'm about to go play again. Click buy. beleive me. don't be a wimp  
2805	1	a	Excellent game, Crafting was amazing, gameplay was fantastic, Only downside was lack of a multiplayer mode.
2807	1	a	Good times right here.
2809	1	a	This game is what most RPG arent: Awesome, and have their own style instead of the repetitive questing and mindless button mashing most RPGs are. If only it had multiplayer...
2811	1	a	Trust me,you want to play this awesome game.Its full of great challenges and its replay ability is huge.Character building offers many choices and gives you the ability to create a truly unique protagonist (or anti-hero if you really want :D ).Soundtracks and music throught the game is stunning and epic.Absolutely reccomending it to everyone,trust me its worth the money :) 
2813	1	a	This game is seriously underated. I found it scolling for a new game and it was on sale. Jackpot. It is hands down one of my favorite games in this genre. The combat system is smooth and fast. The graphics and animation have a glowing beauty to them that leaves you staring at simple ponds in awe. The character creation is satisfiying and in depth enough to make a fairly individual charater. I bought this game last time it was on sale and would have gladly paid full price for what I got. The game as mentioned previously is huge and leaves you as skyrim does wanting to play a second or third game through with a different class/race of character. I wish there was a sequel or expansion but it seems that shipped sailed long ago. This game is definetly worth your time and more as its carefree enough to not soak up every ounce of your mind but still get the whole immersed world feel.  Sure there are a few flaws like the armor system could use some fine tuning. Some of the story lines could link up a bit better. And yes there are a few gliches hidden throughout, but nothing detrimental to the game. Since the developers are no longer it won't be getting fixed, which is sad because this game is worth every second. I have no idea why I only heard of it this past year because put simply...... its awesome. Buy it. Now.
2815	1	a	I've actually changed my mind about this game. I initially didn't recommend it, because I was playing it 'as intended'.  My view of the gameplay is pretty much unchanged. It starts out fun, and gets old fast, and is never challenging. This is because the game was initially an MMO that was just revamped for single player, so the devs could get some quick cash. Looking at it from that viewpoint, this is a massive game with hundreds of hours of gameplay.  However, I have found that the game is much more fun, and maintains a reasonable level of challenge, so long as you skip the side quests. Side quests pretty much ruin this game. They are all the most inane, and generic MMO stereotypes, and there are literally hundreds of them. Even worse, if you actually do them all, you end up severely overpowered, simply because of the massive amount of killing involved, and thus you outlevel the content.  Focusing on the main story, and the factions, while skipping any side quests you don't find interesting, cuts this game down to a nice 40-ish hour experience. You're in each area just long enough to enjoy it, and do some exploring.  If you play this game in a completionist fashion, you will hate it by the 20-40 hr mark, unless you actually get your jollies from doing the same action for the same result endlessly like a factory assembly line.  That said, I recommend it keeping the above in mind. I wouldn't pay $50 for this game, maybe not even $20, but if you can get it on sale for less, jump on it. Go through it like a buzzsaw, and try to play it like Ninja Gaiden, rather than Skyrim, and you'll have a good time.
2817	1	a	it's everything wrong with fable 3 made right and better
2819	1	a	awesome so far
2821	1	a	This game is a straight up fable clone. I really enjoyed Fable, and it's been a while since I played it, so I'm really enjoying this game too.  The game mechanics and fighting work very well, which is important for this type of game. I've only had it glitch a handful of times, and none that it didn't recover from or destroy my gameplay.  There's a fair amount of storyline for players that want to dig deeper - you can interrogate every person about just about everything going on in the game. I skip about 60% of that, but I dig in every once in a while and it's nice that it's there when you want it.  There's an array of different weapons to fit your play style: sword, hammer, wand, staff, bow/arrow, daggers, and more. There's 3 main charater types, but best of all, you can mix and match their tech trees! What a great feature for an RPG - it really let's you play HOW you want to the max!
2823	1	a	A classic RPG single player game. Lots of fun with quests that keep getting larger as you do each part.
2825	1	a	Absolutely amazing, it plays like a AAA flagship game.  I can't believe how beautiful the maps are, and they're so big you find yourself getting lost again and again (but it's really fun to get lost in this game)  The thievery system of this game is super addictive, and while combat is easy it's still exciting. It's definitely casual gaming but sometimes that's what you want, right?
2827	1	a	This is a great game, Reminds me almost exactly of Fable 3 (but better). It has quirky characters, a fun story, and lots of side quests. And the looting is maybe one of my favorite parts so far. The combat is amazing and intricate, every battle feels intense and theres plenty of room for different stratigies. A must buy for RPG fans. KoA is making a name for itself, that is for sure! Try it, it won't dissapoint :D
2829	1	a	Two words: Stun Lock
2831	1	a	I bought this game on sale for 11 dollars, DLC included, and I must say this is a game I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did. I can't point out any major flaws. The graphics are cartoony, but the game really makes it look better than that. The combat reminds me of my old childhood days playing Fable and other old school RPG games, and this game is just that- a modern old school RPG. I haven't beaten the game yet, however even as far as I am into it the story is very interesting, and you always want to find out what happens next, and it always brings you back in. With many side quests, and countless smaller features such as the leveling system, this game is deserving of a 9/10 in my book. I can compare it mostly to the Fable series, with it's cartoon/fantasy graphics, it's UI, and combat. I'd reccommend this to anybody who is nostalgic of the RPG games of the yester years. Would scrape and lick.
2833	1	a	Amazing Game, rented for xbox and did not believe it was worth full price. Once i saw this game 70% off on steam i decided to buy it, and it was a steal, this is one of the pest pc rpg's i have played, the story is greatly interactive and you can make it your own. Do you play the Heroic character, or one who is not so great with their morals. Do you play a Warrior, Mage or Assasin type class, or mix them up to create hybrid classes. Overall this game has been phenomenal for PC and i would reccomend this game to anyone who loves a great fantast RPG -Nnairasor
2835	1	a	Would you look at this little hidden gem! I find it incredible that games like this aren't more talked about. It has a wonderful fairy-tale style that plays like a Fable/Elder Scrolls mashup. I spent about 10 minutes on it and was immediately hooked. I love the gameplay dynamic, the immersive storyline, the storybook appearance and just about everything else this incredible game. If you like TES:Oblivion (or Skyrim as well) or the Fable series, I highly recommend you give this one a try. Even if not, I'd still give it a shot. It's familiar, yet somehow unique.
2837	1	a	For those of you having issues with getting the game to start - bombing out after the little screen with the orc comes up, try disabling virtua mvp control panel (or similar apps that 'optimize' use of both intel processor based graphics AND discrete graphics on Z77 chipset etc. Worked for me.  Fun game thus far.
2839	1	a	Fun, but littered with annoying bugs. even some game breaking bugs if you do the wrong thing at the wrong time, or keep an item longer than you should in which case it will get stuck in your inventory.
2841	1	a	My GOTY for 2012. The setting reminds me of a dark Fable (and Fable is already a dark series to begin with!) and the story is great. Combat feels very fluid and you're able to go as you wish.   Want to use giant blades? Do it!  Shoot magic at someone? Go ahead!  Hell, want to kill everyone in a village 'for the luls'? Have a go!  It is a shame that the company went under, as we will probably never see a true sequel to this amazing game.
2843	1	a	The biggest plus of this game is the combat. Smooth, fast paced combat in a fantasy RPG is rare. Though I was a bit let down by the skilltree abilities. Another great feature are the Chakram weapons, a weapon type missed in most other RPGs.  The downside is the lack of an inspiring world and story. It's all very colorful but feels very generic. Because of this, quests soon felt like chores and I skipped most of the dialogue.
2845	1	a	After playing this on xbox I decided to try it on pc, and i'm glad I did, the graphics are amazing. the game plays like dead rising but has the rpg elements of skyrim 10/10 must buy.
2847	1	a	This game is a great, no further words.
2849	1	a	it is a really fun game worth playing if you run out of bethesda's RPGs but after you beat main questline and are over level 40 it becomes near unplayable still a great game though try to buy when on sale I wouldn't bother full price, just not enough stuff to do some may disagree since it claims 200hour of gameplay but more like 45hours for me. 6/10
2851	1	a	Brilliant game, and worth any price, it has great mechanics and systems in place to enrich your RPG experience, vast lore and sidequests to explore. Truly a glorious addition to steam, though some disagree and think this game is a blight i see no reason to think so. It has a strong and entertaining story full of moments where you will assuredly gasp with awe.  I Nayphun recommend this game whole heartedly.
2853	1	a	If u like RPGs then this game is the game fr you. PS tis game is best played with a gamepad or a Xbox controler 
2855	1	a	Really awesome and under appreciated game, since it was released around the same time as Skyrim it didnt sell as much as it could have.  The combat is one of the best I've ever played and the lore is very immersive.  It's definately worth it's value and I highly recommend it.
2857	1	a	Awesome game, really fun. To bad the company no longer exists
2859	1	a	Great GAME lots to do, lots to find, lots to KILL, lots to explore. Metascore rates it 81, I think at least a 95.
2861	1	a	I bought this game and all of the DLC today for $12... Couldn't be happier, it's got a skyrim feel to it, but feels more compact (less running around aimlessly). I've already logged 6 hours and will be logging plenty more in the future. I would/ and have already recommended it. Well worth the $12, and if you're thinking of buying it when it's back to full price ($40) still worth it, I paid $60 for skyrim and although I don't know yet if this game would be worth a full $60 I do believe it's worth $40! The combat is super cool and it just feels like there's so many fun different quests.
2863	1	a	I was excited about this game when I first heard about it coming out and I was just plain ready for a fresh and new RPG game I could put many hours into...and let me tell you this is deffinately the game. From the huge open world to the vast variety of weapons you can find/make this game offers so many quests and tasks to do to keep you occupied for hours.
2865	1	a	This game is alot of fun. Simple, yet fun nonetheless.
2867	1	a	This game...  Such a great time-waster RPG. Great batttlesystem (remniscient of Zelda-styled autolocking) with fun weapons and skills.   I have tried to playthrough the game on two separate occasions. Both times I quit for the same reason: GAME BREAKING BUGS.  If you want to play this, make sure you have a save for every hour, in 3 different saves. Also, be prepared to search the internet in HOPES of finding a glitchy way to overcome the bug.  I wish you luck, friends. F**K you devs for not putting out a hotfix for the insane number of well-documented bugs that RUIN a player's expeierence and fun.
2869	1	a	very good and quite beautiful game. Graphics is very solid and the wold is very charming but there is something missing
2871	1	a	This game has diverse and immersive landscapes, a creative assortment of factions, and a top notch combat system. I have been playing this game almost continuously since I've picked it up. There is a lot of character customization, a plethora of quests to do, and thus far I've thoroughly enjoyed the quests. The character speaking animations are sort of hit and miss, but that's the worst I can say about the game in my experiences thus far.
2873	1	a	Fun game. Good story, enchanting graphics and the music is AMAZING.
2875	1	a	lots of stuff to do, much fun.. though the demo was crappy and totally bugged
2877	1	a	Its a good game
2879	1	a	Having just finished the main story of this game i can honestly say that without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Some may say that i clearly havent played that many but i guarentee that if you buy this you will not regret it.  The story for this game is unlike any that i have experienced, it is rich, full of life and constant twists and turns. The amount of side quests in this game is astounding! And the graphics although taking a more cartoony style look beautiful.  All in all if youre a fan of RPGs then buy this game. If youre a fan of great story lines buy this game. If you are a fan of games BUY THIS GAME!
2881	1	a	On a scale from 1-10 I enjoy this game.
2883	1	a	Hello community,  This game is, to me, a strong fusion of World of Warcraft (with quests similar to SWO), and a build system like skyrim. However, the hack and slash combat system eschew the traditional grindy bordom of this style of game.     Pros:   good mechanics,  very customizable,  overall fun game.  Upgrading wepons almost always feels rewarding with the large number of unique epic idems to use.  (note* the weapons pack for the game is very well handled, you get a bunch of really cool looking starters that dont wreck the reward feeling when you get your first natural epic idems)   Cons:    Terrain is a bit awkward with things like small ledges.  Interaction in dialoge feels non-impacting to the result of the dialoge.  Something of a 'casual game' (not really a pro or con) 
2885	1	a	One of the BEST RPG game !!!
2887	1	a	A remarkably fun game. It's only failing is it's timing, in that it came out almost at the same time as Skyrim, making it largely overlooked.
2889	1	a	This game is amazing, I am having tons of fun. It is worth it on sale for sure.
2891	1	a	Fairly solid entry into a world of Western MMO's. Fluid combat and an alright story, I'd give it a B.
2893	1	a	Absolutly fell in love with the game. The fighting style is like god of war, yet free roam. Maps are HUGE and just worth every penny. I seen it was on sale and just HAD to get it again. 9/10
2895	1	a	I bought this by recomendation from another player. It has been an exciting purchase. RPG, FPS all in one. Who could ask for more?
2897	1	a	Well... I'm sure it's a great game, I was sooo looking forward to playing this game for a long time till i discovered you can't bind the WASD keys to something else. So please allow me to flip the bird to the devs for a crappy port ╭∩╮(-_-)╭∩╮
2899	1	a	Great game if you like a game that crashes constantly. Ive put in a lot of hours but be warned this game doesnt work well with all kinds of computers.
2901	1	a	This is one of the best RPGs I've played in a looong time! Great level up system and combat is really cool! 10/10. Would purchase again!
2903	1	a	It's a shame the studio was sunk by their failed foray into MMO development. This is a very enjoyable game that does a number of things very well, and I would have loved to see a sequel. If you enjoy RPGs at all, there's a lot to like here (and there's a demo if you just want to test it out). Particularly if you pick it up on sale there's a lot of bang to be had for your buck.   The array of weapons and skills and the mobile combat are quite fun, and I enjoyed playing the various classes, particularly mage/rogue.  I'm going to pick on the flaws, here, however: 1) Dungeon design vs. fast travel - the fast travel system in the open world mostly works well, except for the few places where you can't use it and running back out of a long dungeon or building is quite tedious. To get around this, a lot of dungeons are designed as a one-way loop, and that repeated design eventually wears a bit thin. Though it beats having to run all the way back across a dungeon you just cleared. 2) Combat isn't particularly well balanced. Particularly as the mage, most trash fights were stupid easy after the first 10-15 levels. Likewise, if your Fate is topped out, you can ez-mode almost any fight. But a few of the boss fights seem designed such that they're very hard at low levels if you don't have Fate to unleash, but too easy if you do. The concept of the Fate skill is neat, but it's a bit too powerful. 3) You will reach max level long before you've done all the side quests, and probably before you reach the final boss 4) maxing out the talents (smithing, lockpicking, alchemy) requires knowing where all the trainers are, and carefully leveling and exploration to access them at the right times 5) in that same vein, gold is very tight early in the game compared to what you'd want to spend (when 45,000 to visit a few trainers would be very handy), but you'll likely end the game with millions of gold you have no use for. On my second run through I skipped most looting, particularly chests that needed me to waste time lockpicking/dispelling for what was likely to be vendor trash anyway  Of the DLC, Dead Kel and Naros are both very enjoyable and well designed questing areas and well worth the $3 each if on sale.  
2905	1	a	Great combo-based combat, large maps, and vibrant environments make this game a pleasure to play; story's also not half bad. I really wish that somebody's able to pick up this IP and run with it for a sequel. I recommend this game for people who like Dragon's Dogma.
2907	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: reckoning is a great RPG experience with rocksolid gameplay and lots of loot it feels like a mix of Skyrim Diablo and World of Warcraft the world is very immersive and beautiful and it has a rather interesting story line.  +World design +Questing and rewards for doing so +Combat system +graphics and modelling for the gear +Loot and lots of it +Junk bag system +Gorgeous skill system and crafting system +Fast travel to places you've been -Long walks from place to place -Non changable FOV -No mounts :( -Not able to see full stats on stuff you buy -Sometimes hard to differ light from heavy armour  8.5/10 Great game go get while its cheap played it all morning :D if its not on sale you can get the collection for 4-6 TF2 keys
2909	1	a	Think Elder Scrolls, but with a much more MMO feel to it. Reccomended to anyone who enjoys RPGs with a lot of free world exploration and customization.
2911	1	a	A hybrid between World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls. Having plenty of quests makes this adventure seem robust, however as with all things, quantity over quality seems to be a true balancing act. The quests are not as interesting as Elder Scrolls, but you do find an occassional gem. This is a good game that I can recommend, but you'd be better off than me if it manages to hold your interest and spark your imagination.
2913	1	a	I really like this game... Drangon age meets Skyrim. I had no idea this ever came out. It is a huge open world and has some interesting stories. Tons of side quests that are not fetch 8 bear ears. 23 hours in and I have done NOTHING on the main quest line, just reputation group quests and side quests. Some small bugs, so save often... easy to do. There is an auto save, a quick save and a hard save. I have only had one bug where I pickpocketed daggers off a elf before I killed her and then it was stuck wanting me to take the daggers I aleady had. My bad for fiddling with the quest chain. But I had saved! Went back and did it in the right order and it was fine.
2915	1	a	for $6 bucks? What a steal!
2917	1	a	This game is like World of Warcraft, but single player and not stupid. I give it a 9.1/10, but I heard there are some compatibility issues. I run this game fine on my Windows 8 so I don't know what the problem is. I would make sure you can run it before you buy.
2919	1	a	Fable meets elder scrolls. Since I really like both I recommend this cartoony rpg.
2921	1	a	Plays like fable, minus moral choices/appearance effecting things. Pretty well balanced game, decent-ish story line.  Sort of amusing that the description of the game notes, Todd Mcfarlane as Spawn creator but only gives Salvatore 'NYT best-selling author' rather than mentioning Drizz't.   Lotta Irish folklore influence, sidhe, elves, brownies, boggarts, leanshee.  Pros: fable-like gameplay--martial &amp; magic skill-trees. Rogue/Warrior/Mage, with ability to multi-class. Can sneak, pickpocket, lockpick, pass persuation checks, and sneak assassinate enemies.  Cons: honestly the only cons here are the level cap at 40 being hit a little early, but thats a somewhat known issue and you can't really expect that to be fixed by a defunct game dev. studio. Never really feels too grindy, but there are a lot of go-fetch side-quests...pretty sure you know what you are getting into though, if you are looking at this type of RPG/fantasy genre in terms of that.
2923	1	a	This game does not do anything amazing new to the genre. However, it takes the best of any other game of the genre: Graphics of World of Warcraft, huge world and travelling system of modern Elder Scrolls, fighting system of Fable 2, item system from Dragon Age and the quest system of about any western RPG. But this not a bad thing, because this means that even though the formula is not experimented with, it's well executed. The game contains loads of quests, monsters, an intriguiging lore and a very open world just inviting you to explore.  The only new element of gameplay is the Fate system, something I quite welcome. It allows you to re-arrange your character entirely, reset every skill and ability. For someone that likes to experiment with play styles, this is great. The fighting system is very fluid, the weapons feel different and the moves allow for many different strategies. Whatever your preferred fighting tatic, Reckoning has you covered.  The game's story line is good in two regards: If you follow it, it leads you into a completely new worlds of Fae, Fate and War. Though it suffers a bit from the 'Our Elves Are Named Differently'-Syndrome, the world has an unique lore that often makes you think about event in different lights. However, if you are the kind of player that doesn't care much for lore, the game's quest system always gives you enough information that you can skip any dialog without missing much.  However, no game is entirely perfect. The biggest gripe with Reckoning is the menu system. It seems to come from the late 90's, not a modern game. Menus seem tedious and uninspired, but they work. Skyrim does a much better job here. Switching from map to quests takes a long time. Other problems are about the lockpicking system. While the game uses a similar system to Skyrim, you often just leave locked chests alone. They never contain anything interesting and lock picking is just a waste of items, as there's not skill improvement from trying it. Same goes for the cursed chests, which have to be opened by a reaction minigame, which just always seems to tedious and brings no reward.  Also, it is quite an easy game. There's not really a challenge here, I must admit. I finished the game on the XBox, and when I can finish a game, it's definitely a very easy game. However, casual gamers will like it. I recommend playing the game on Hard mode at least, because anything lower just allows you to breeze through it.  But I would say this game is an absolute must for every fantasy RPG fan. The game is all in all well executed. No bugs, good graphics in HD, you simply cannot go wrong. Though it brings nothing new to the table, it just combines everything you like about the genre. Plus the world is huge, together with the DLC you can have hours and hours of gameplay ahead of you.
2925	1	a	A lot like the Elder Scrolls games, and just as awesome.
2927	1	a	Amazing combat system and overall huge and fun game.
2929	1	a	Very Good RPG game, I recommend this game anyday.
2931	1	a	It's a fun single playthrough. I tired a bit of the constant, repetitious fighting. I guess that's what large scale RPG's are nowadays. Feels too much like grinding on an MMORPG. I have to admit that the fighting system is very satisfying. The combo moves, the various and well thought out ability types give you a very satisfying experience.   I think what kept me playing was the story. Such a large and well thought out storyline gave you the feeling of playing through a living, breathing world. Such a vast array of quality characters that you either love or hate. If anything this is a game that makes you feel like your playing through an epic tale.   Great story combined with a polished combat system makes this a must have for all you RPG'rs out there.
2933	1	a	Great game, fun. Can't wait to see more of it.
2935	1	a	Freeeakingohmaigahd! XD Wow, this is... Okay, let's breathe for a second...  Okay, so Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is quite an experience... And I mean that in the way that says... Well what I said above. It is an amazing game, definitely worth a look if you got 6 bucks, or 12 if you want all the dlc, because EA LOOOOOVES money. XP It's still a well done game, not as open as it could be for being a 'open-ish world' game, but that does not detract from the game itself. This is truly a game that should be enjoyed by all RPG fans. THIS NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR LIBRARYIFYOULIKERPGS!  *takes a breath*  However. Despite the amazing combat and weaponry, there is a downside or two that I can think of... One, it is a bit... Cartoon-y for how serious it is taking itself... It should be more Dark Souls-esque if it wanted to really be all 'badass story-ness-ess-ess-ess...-ess'. Two, the story itself, fairly weak, but also perhaps that is the fault of it being so long, and needing to spread out it's luscious goodness of combat and stuff all over the place. Three, if you watch The Angry Joe Show, you know this next one. The characters are all... Pretty average. No real deep, meaningful connections like in say, the Fallout series, or the Elder Scroll series, or otherwise.  Another upside that I forgot to mention is the arcane and the regular lockpicking systems. They are actually pretty challenging, and you will find yourself getting cursed or locked out of chests often if you are not careful with your timing/placement of picks.  Overall, this game, as Joe said, is a great game, just needs some more backing to help with it's look as well as it's feel. But so far, this is looking like an amazing game. And with only a bit of time left for the sale, I would say at the very least try out the demo, if there is one avaliable, or if not, then watch some reviews and see if you like it. Quickly. Like right now. X3 Anyway, I found my newest game addiction, and if you are a fan of actual control of your character, a host of secret places, tough fights, easy money, and Brownies, then this fantasy title DESERVES your attention. ^^
2937	1	a	Really good Third Person Action RPG. Shame it went unnoticed, I'm really enjoying playing this game with a controller. Vast world, good mechanics, and great combat. I assume the downfall of the game was due to its $60 price tag at release, and being released at the same time as skyrim. Anyways, its a fantastic buy at its current price, and I highly suggest picking it up.
2939	1	a	Wonderful game that was extremely underrated in my opinion. The size, stories, combat, and graphics all make this game worth every buck.
2941	1	a	It's close to Skyrim, but with a Fable type gameplay and story. Don't really care if it's made by EA, was worth the sale. The customization is vast and the combat is adequate. Starting with 3 classes and can mix em up as you progress is very interesting, even though im starting out all Sorcerer! Money well spent.
2943	1	a	this game is a must for any RPG fan! one of the best games ive played in a long time!
2945	1	a	This game is well worth the $12 price for the game and all the DLC.  Hack a slash RPG that gets everything about the combat correct.The story is a little bland,but still well worth playing with how massive it is.
2947	1	a	Best RPG GAME  I had it it the xbox 360 when it came out but its so much better on pc Must Get
2949	1	a	I played this on the PS3 last year for the first time and from start to finish it is - without a doubt - the best Arcade Action RPG I've ever played. The whole scenario, story, backdrops, characters and playability are totally immersive and had me putting in countless all-nighters of play. I was going to buy the add-ons but since Steam are doing this whole collection pack for the same price of the Teeth Of Naros DLC on PSN I thought I'd go for it and I'm glad I did, even though I still remember the plot, Amalur is a great place to revisit especially since I've got two new maps, an increased level cap and some weapon/armour upgrades all in the mix. Obviously check the specifications first, I'm running at Ultra level on my PC and everything is....sweet as!  Totally Recommended to any and all RPGers out there!
2951	1	a	There are already a dozen reviews that'll tell you how good this game is, how it was overlooked, a hidden gem, etc. So I'll skip that and just say that it's a great action RPG and well worth the price, especially if you can nab it during a sale.  However, the main reason I wanted to write this review was in regards to the DLC packs. They won't let me review the DLC on their own, so I'm tacking it on here. I've yet to play through the Teeth of Naros or Legend of Dead Kel packs, but from the looks of it, it seems they add some decent content. The Weapons and Armor bundle, however, is worth skipping. It's all level 1 gear, so you're going to replace it an hour after you get it. Ultimately it doesn't really serve any purpose other than giving you access to a full set of gear and a choice of weapons right away. Not really worth the cost if you ask me. So, I'd recommend skipping the Weapons and Armor bundle. Everything else though seems great.
2953	1	a	After playing this game for a few hours I came away very impressed with the pick up and play style of the game. Think of it as Dark Souls but the game isn't trying to kill you. The game is a couple years old but it still looks pretty good with awesome lighting. The best part of the game is the combat. Its fast and very responsive to button presses. There isn't any lag when switching weapons either. No matter what the enemy is there is a move with your shield or a roll away that can get you the advantage. Leveling up and upgrading your talents or armor is very accessible. The week end sale ended but its still a great game to get at its current price.
2955	1	a	Nice Rpg game.
2957	1	a	Honestly.....100% the best RPG I have ever played. It is amazing and fun straight from the get go. I absolutely love it. I bought it just cause it was on sale for a great deal. Turned out to be the best money I have ever spent! This is a must get for any gamer!
2959	1	a	Don't believe all the negative publicity this game got. Unfortunately, it was released around the same time as Skyrim which overshadowed every fantasy RPG since launch. Fantastic game with great and unique combat system. Possible the best magic-user combat system of any game.
2961	1	a	Best RPG I have ever played. If I could describe it in one way, it would be that the creators took all the best elements from WoW, Fable, and TES and put them all in one game. amazing game.
2963	1	a	Buy this freaking game so they can make a second one. Do it as a personal favor to me.
2965	1	a	a good game! Kingdoms of Amalur : Reckoning is for sure a good RPG, made at the near time of skyrim the game itself resemble its brother-competitor a lot...but doenst even scratch its nails. Amalur is a joke near skyrim, so lets no go there. Lets talk about a game that by itself is very good and worthwhile. My gameplay was about 100h ...i did everything possible(almost) and more....gameplay is focused on the action-rpg style with few elements of path choosing, which means is a open world but straightforward game, with systems similar to crafting, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing and more. The lore is HUGE, everything has a tale behind and a good tale that is. Overall the game is good, i feel it lacked some 'GOOD MUSIC'(ost is very...dull). In the Pirate's DLC we have a gamebreaking bug that was NEVER CORRECTED, for that i wont forgive EA since i almost lost my game when i was on 70h .  Overall Amalur must be bought and has a 9 of 10 on score. Compared to Skyrim its a 4 of 10 score.  Which means, an amazing RPG, but stop comparing it!(like i did ) to skyrim lol!
2967	1	a	A lot of damage types like bleeding piercing poison fire lightning ice. All of these are useable in forging your own weapons and armour.
2969	1	a	just finished this game it was a good game really enjoyed it but its quit similer to skyrim :/
2971	1	a	I really enjoyed this game a lot, but once i completed the main storyline quest, I lost all interest in it. So great game, but little replay value for me.
2973	1	a	Plenty of content makes Kingdoms an alluring option for a frugal gamer, but none of the content rises above competent. This is a wholly too long adventure with a bland world, no memorable characters and no quests worth mentioning. Still, for dollars paid and time spent in the world this game does stand out. I just wish it were more fun.
2975	1	a	One of the greatest RPGs I've ever played. The world is beautiful, the lore is amazing, and the storys are interesting. Everything i see and do makes me want to see more of the world, and extremely sad that there won't be anymore of these. First game where i ever tried anything different than magic rogue, and i couldn't have chosen a better game to do so. The fighting is fun, the magic makes you feel powerful, and the stealth is very believable. Honestly, not even Skyrim could match the magic, as despite having more, i never felt truly powerful unless i was using a shout. This game lets every blow, strike, blast, and arrow loosed increase the feeling of power you have. And i wouldn't have it any other way. Not only would i say you should buy this game, i would also say buy it for all your friends and family. Make everyone play this.  To put it another way, i bought this game on disc twice before, and lost both of those disks before buying it on Steam, and even if i somehow lost it on Steam, i would still buy it again. This game deserves to be in everyone's library.
2977	1	a	Really enjoyed this game and the expansions.. Wish someone would take over and start the next one / more expansions. Only issue I ever had was with my assasin-ish char. Went to dead-kel and got the cave bug. No biggie just re-roll. Love the replay ability as well.
2979	1	a	Fantastic game , played it for a bit now .  i have only a few cons on that ,  first and most obvious is the jump problem , is such an annoying thing to not be able to jump !@#% next one is the lips of the NPC's , theyr almost not moving at all whilr you can hear them tallking . the camera is another thing , sometime shile tallking with an npc its just moving , which leads me to another cons , if you enter a chat with an npc while attacking ( or a scene ) the sound of the attacks or running is plaing all through the chat or scene , now that's REALLY annoyng ,  but mostly , i enjoy it , you can overcome the cons with thr pros .
2981	1	a	If you are wondering 'is this worth my money' The awnser is an undoubtable yes . This game is a rpg lost to its time. A creative story created by great authors, and a fast paced unique combat style that speakes for its self. This game uses a difrent aproch to classes. The game allows you to create your class any way that you want. It has a similarity to D&amp;D type of custimization, but is far more simplified, and dosn't lock you in a decision. If your playing as a rouge and want to change it, you can, and still be just as deadly. You can even blend skill type; like a warrior and rouge, to unlock awsome hybrid classes. This game was way ahead of its time. The only problem was that it was released at the same time as Skyrim, so no one heard about it. This is not a cookie cutter hack and slash. Its like fable, skyrim and D&amp;D all put together.
2983	1	a	I fell in love with this game as soon as i started to play it. Now i know the quests are super boring anmd generic but i just love games that let you be anything and dont penalize you super heavely if you want to be a magical swrodsman or theif that can toss fireballs like a mofo.
2985	1	a	if you like RPG its cool and funny
2987	1	a	Get it, its best played on the PC version very smooth.
2989	1	a	Awesome game, simple fun and adictive
2991	1	a	Awesome game but it could be much better if it has mounts in it and a little bit support from ea but its cool anyway 8.5/10
2993	1	a	[I'll add more to this review once I play a bit more] If you have played Fable(1,2,3) then this is the game for you. The freedom to do anything in this game is just unbelivable. The character creation scheme could of been better (IMO), but overall still lots of stuff to customise your hero/heroine. Tons of side quests (maybe like 300 or so) to go run around in the open world.
2995	1	a	I haven't played for to long but i actully im injoying it
2997	1	a	Well worth it, especialy when on special, good Combat RPG it strongly reminds you of Fable and God of war cross breed with some Darksiders for combat, very big world to explore especialy with the good DLCs, you'll get at least 200 + hours of fun from it without trying to clear everything there's up to 400 to 600 hours of content if you want to clock Everything. The RPG system is very felxible and interesting gear/ enchanting/ ect Crafting is well done and fun. The only downside of this game for me is maybe the fact that the characters in this game tend to feel like generic fantasy and the story line kinda feel this way as well but for 12 dollards on special with all the DLC WHO CARES ! :-) have fun OH yeah GAMEPAD not neccesary BUT STRONGLY RECOMANDED FOR COMBAT!
2999	1	a	Its pretty good, 8/10, combat is epic... story okay..
3001	1	a	This game is One of the best Rpgs I have ever played. In my opinion it's better than Skyrim because of one thing, Amalur's amamzing combat. The combat is so fast and fluid it's not even funny.
3003	1	a	Note: I haven't sunk too much time in to the game so far.  I bought this on a whim, like a lot of people probably did. Having knowledge of the people who worked on it I figured I'd be in for a blast. KoA:R is usually referred to as a single player MMORPG, and it fits, but that's kind of what's making it fun. You just sort of zone out for a while, have some really fun action packed fights, similar to Zelda or Fable, and go on your way. The quests play out almost like an MMORPG or an Elder Scrolls game, and to those used to the formula it's nothing too amazing, but nothing too grind heavy to put you off of it.   I'm only 3 hours in, but the game is so far pretty enjoyable... I mean I assassinated a dude while he was peeing Tenoutaten.
3005	1	a	lots of fun
3007	1	a	This game is easily one of my favorites. The combat is astounding. When you're wailing on an enemy and you time that dodge or block just right, you feel like you are a fighting god. The whole game, from the atmosphere to the conversations, it has that feel of the original Fable minus the marrage system.  If you like the action styles of Darksiders, but with actual story not blocked buggy puzzles then check this game out.  Download the demo if you're not sure and give it a shot.
3009	1	a	Worth a second look. I just purchased this game on a Flash Sale. The sale will last till Monday 2/3. Download the demo if your not sure. Compelling story line, graphics are fine, give it a look. The time you spend is well worth the adventure gained.
3011	1	a	good game as long as you die few times or save alot.
3013	1	a	this game shouldnt be overlooked i just started playing and already i love it.art style, combat. for 5.99 you cant beat this .give it a try youll love it. post more when im further in!!!
3015	1	a	Very under rated...this is a really fun game.
3017	1	a	Surprisingly a good game, but sadly not giving the recognition it deserves. The gameplay is really fun and the story is not that bad. Just got a negative light put on it due to EA and the capsize of the studio who made it.
3019	1	a	Fable and Skyrim had a long, romantic night together and cranked out KoA. Take Skyrim's massive map and varied locale's, stories, and peoples with Fables aesthetics and impressively smooth combat, then sprinkle in a little Dark Soul's difficulty and you get one slick game.  Pros: Its pretty. That's not saying much nowadays, but the world designer and art team need their props on this one. The combat is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfying. The effects are excellent. Its easy to pick up, but its difficult enough so getting it just right is embarassingly satisfying.  The side missions are interesting enough. Like most RPGs, its mostly 'kill stuff' or 'kill stuff and retreive this', but that's not a bad thing. That all just gives the combat fun times more time for fun. HAVE NOT FOUND A 'GRIND' MISSION YET. Grinds are my biggest turnoff to MMORPGs and RPGs. Good riddance and hallelujah: they are nowhere to be found. The game is almost frighteningly long, or so it looks. I've only been in about 1/8 of the map, and I've played for 15 hours. With one character. I'm positive I'm going to be playing this again, so that means over 250 hours for me. Excellent. Cons: The voice acting is downright bizarre. The dwarves are British, the Elves are Scottish, and the people are... I don't even understand. Not exactly a bad thing, just weird. The Elves, or Fae (whatever), speak so slowly *I* get tired of it. This is coming from the man who was enraptured by Paarthunax's dialogue in Skyrim and the Oasis Tree in Fallout 3. The combat is a *little* blocky, like a speck of paint missing on the side of a yacht little. Nothing that would break the game. Lastly, the main story is not particularly bad, it just doesn't really grab me.   If you like Fable, but want about Buy it when it goes on sale. Seriously.
3021	1	a	All I can say is 'OMG amazaing.' 3000/5 stars or whatever. I just want to get back to playing.
3023	1	a	beautiful game but a bit easy on finding good armour and weapons
3025	1	a	Seems quite nice. Large open world, craft system, and other nice things that I would not explicitly state here to avoid potential spoilers. The game has its spirit. If you liked Gothic series - this is The Game!
3027	1	a	Impressed with sale price, a fun little game.  bit weird at first, but you soon get into it.  well worth the 5.99
3029	1	a	If you don't have this game yet...it's on sale...get it! It's hours of fun in a beautiful world.
3031	1	a	Goof fun for no money . Buy it on offer.
3033	1	a	Like a mix of Fable, Skyrim, Darksiders, and World of Warcraft.
3035	1	a	It's a mix of Fable 3, and Skyrim. I ♥ both of those games, and so far this is pretty fun.
3037	1	a	This game is in my top 3 RPG's of All-Time. Insanely good story and beautiful visuals. The gameplay is one of the most fun I've experienced with a rewarding climactic ending to each fight. Utilizing 'Reckoning Mode' makes you feel like you can best any foe in battle, and surely that is also the truth. The game's enemies are challenging when playing on normal, if you're planning on playing on a higher difficulty than that then you'd better get ready to rage a lot and use up all your gold on healing potions!   The 1!! thing I have a problem with in this game is the lack of a JUMP button.... All you can do is dodge but whenever I want to pass like 3 flat rocks on the ground I can't because I can't jump :(  9,5/10 [Must Play!]
3039	1	a	This is obviously the best game I've ever seen before. Too bad it was released right after Skyrim so nobody ever heard of it, or if they did the title was too generic sounding to remember. It's also too bad they went with EA as a publisher so it never recieved the attention it deserved. Now the MMORPG version they were working on is scrapped as the company went under. Such a shame.
3041	1	a	Wow! I Was quite surprised when I started playing this. I was expecting the same cookie cutter formula as every other game of this type. Even though my initial thoughts on the game were not that far off there is enough variety and lore packed into this game to make me forget the 'standard' format it follows. Worth my $12 so far as far as time played per dollar spent and I have just started.
3043	1	a	Pretty good game. Like a pretenda WoW 
3045	1	a	Great RPG; beautiful and sophisticated.
3047	1	a	This is a decent action RPG, and the sheer amount of content for the price can't be beat.
3049	1	a	THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOUR D!CK HARD. (WELLL ATLEAST THE 1ST HOUR)
3051	1	a	ifgu love skyrim get this its skyrim with a bettere combat system
3053	1	a	This is My second play through off this game as I played it back in 2012.. Back then I thought it was a great game... Now in 2014 its even better with the sad state of unfinished, unpolished and generally who cares attitude off Alpha/Beta games. Combats fast, fun and fluent with great RPG elements to boot. The quality of this game shines through from animations and attention to detail. Thanks Curt Schilling :) PS: Download Sweet FX and boot the game through this.. Does a nice job on overhauling the graphics
3055	1	a	Awesome game, must play...loved every bit of it.. PC controller would help.! :)
3057	1	a	played on another console and enjoyed most of what came through, so i decided to buy it on stam
3059	1	a	Well if you liked Fable you'll probably like this. Apparently it's a large game since people are putting 100-150 hours into it. I'd say it's a great game. I got it for $12 for the whole collection. I kept passing this game up before the sale and now that I have it I have no idea why because it is a great game.
3061	1	a	Alittle bit fable, alittle bit skyrim, alot bit addicting.
531	0	a	Starts off strong but quickly loses its allure. The combat is fun and unique at first, but the inability to switch weapons mid-combo removes absolutely any level of depth. The combat wants to be Devil May Cry, but it's like they forgot to finish programming the combat half-way through.   The characters are entirely unlikeable, and the game tries to force-feed you lore through them at any moment that it possibly can. The story's forgettable, especially when you stop and think, 'Why am I helping these people again? I don't like them.'  The world is technically 'open', but the leveled mobs may as well make it entirely linear on that front. As well, there's really no point in the world being open, since past the vistas that they front-load into every new area, the world feels completely dead and drab.   The game also lacks a deal good deal of polish in certain areas. As an example, if you're using a ranged weapon and fighting an enemy who is uphill from you, you will attack the ground in front of you instead of attacking towards the enemy that you're targeting. Often, when this happens, your attacks will fly through the ground and clip out of bounds until the animation finishes.   Ultimately, Kingdoms of Amalur, falls short everywhere that it had potential to shine. If you can get it cheap(and I mean really cheap) and you're willing to overlook a good deal of flaws, it may be worth your time.
3063	1	a	Fantastic RPG Game! with alot of contents! I luv it! Highly Recommend it! ;)
3065	1	a	Good looking art style, excellent feel, and a lot of choices in combat. I am definitely happy with this purchase.
3067	1	a	Very very fun and i'm glued to it! Cant stop playing. I love this game! Beautiful game and love the combat.
3069	1	a	Great RPG, There's loot, story, and lots of weapons magic, crafting, lore and killing. What's not to love?
3071	1	a	Underrated game, better than buggy skyrim in some way.
3073	1	a	The most fun combat I have ever experienced in an action-rpg. I had great fun trying out the combat styles, and the rpg element of the game is pretty decent too. Def recommended, especially if its on a sale ;)
3075	1	a	Nice game:)
3077	1	a	This game is too pro, just like me in League of legends or me in general within gaming. It's like fabley. Such gameplay Much time.  Wow
3079	1	a	This game is a lot of fun if you want more of a casual type of RPG. The music from Grant Kirkhope is fantastic.
3081	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of skyrim, mixed with torchlight. Although i had a couple of issues with the gameplay (such as the one dimensional npcs and the lack of choices in dialogue, the world has been very cool and the lore engaging.
3083	1	a	It is a very simple RPG, and the fighting get a little repetative...I still found it very entertaining though.
3085	1	a	Worth your money.
3087	1	a	Like Fable, but with more depth. An excellent light RPG.
3089	1	a	Great game with alot to do, if you can get past having to do some fetch quest youll enjoy it. Its got around three hundred hours in it and a fast paced combat system.
3091	1	a	Great game
3093	1	a	ive been playing this game a big ive just scratched the surface of the game really so far im liking the mage skill the best lol i give it the highest raiting possable
3095	1	a	i think is a game one can get into for long time ,so far i like it a lot .. go for it it will make our day /andy
3097	1	a	I can't recommend this game highly enough. It's a Fable, Dragon Age and Guild Wars fused together to create a hidden gem that is called Kingdoms of Amalur. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!
3099	1	a	Games ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Fable meets diablo
3101	1	a	I love this game. It is really fun. The combat is smooth and engaging. The world is absolutely beautiful. The weapons are interesting. I have never seen any other RPG that allows you to use Chakrams as a weapon. I would give this game a 9.5/10. It's not absolutely perfect. But I love it nonetheless. Definitely would recommend it to any fan of RPG's.
3103	1	a	Play this game with the difficulty mod, very entertaining.
3105	1	a	The story is deep, but I found the world a bit lacking considering how much went into developing the universe. The combat is quite fun. Very underrated game in my opinion!
3107	1	a	Amazing Game! Time consuming, but what do you expect from an RPG.
3109	1	a	Game is worth. Very nice graphics, and a really huge map! Endless hours of fun. Strongly recommend the game.   I have only 5 hours on this game on record on Steam, but outside of steam, I have like close to 100+ hours.   BUT... I would NOT recommend buying the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning - Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle. It gives really low level items. I opened it for the very first time with a level 40 character, and got items fit for level 22.   I wanted to post this on the addon page, but for some reason, this review box isn't present there. So putting it here.
3111	1	a	Righ now this weekend this game is on sale. Very rarely does it do so. I give it a 8.5 out of 10.  This is a vast open world rpg that is .....did I say vast. It plays and reminds me of vanilla WoW.  It has a deep and vast story. Decent combat system for melee. And so-so crafting. I highly recommend . The cons of the game are: Your toon has very little facial anamation in dialog scenes, camera angles in dialog scenes are sometime at odd angles.  
3113	1	a	Bang for bucks this game is off the chart!  100+ hours for the cost of lunch.  Game mechanics are good world is big  quality RPG!
3115	1	a	EA level console port (translation: Pretty ♥♥♥♥in' bad ok?), I hope you got your gamepad! ... Gameplay wise? Eh.
3117	1	a	another great action rpg noce this time i play like mage lets burn this weekend!!!
3119	1	a	Worth getting for under 7$, or if you have a teenager as this will keep them occupied for a VERY long time. Now onto the detailed review:   It's important to know what this game is and of its origins so that we can judge it correctly. When I started playing it I thought 'gee this world seems huge!', as it turns out it's no coincidence - the game was originally developed as an MMO.  Second this isn't an in-depth RPG with a lot of strategy involved in every decision. It's a button mashing Action RPG.  As such, the game does alright. The button mashing class-mixing you can do is very fun... up to a point.  *Customisation - in skills and abilities is probably one of its strong points. Combined with the Tarot style 'fate' system, things are easy to plan out. 'I'll start with sorcery, but get those might talents to beef myself up along the way.' or 'The greatsword sounds promising, let's grab a few crazy passives from the finesse tree to ensure devastation'.  Every battle feels challenging, especially on difficulties medium &amp; hard settings. The art style is cartoony, but not necessarily bad. There are many epic fighting situations due to clever camera shots and animations.   And now for the bad:  - No jumping! What is it with some of these developers? Is it too much work to make sure that there are no exploitable areas due to jump bugs? SADLY this game could have really used jumping to minimise the travel times. In fact the more I think about it the more I can say this is the biggest issue (which amplifies all the others) with Kingdoms of Amalur.  - The game is too big, I can't believe I'm saying this but... yes it's too big! It relies on constant monster smashing for fun and when you're not doing that you're running quest errands. Or going to the next encampment/city.  - For some ungodly reason there is one big design flaw as far as skills are concerned in this ARPG... the skills which you've placed on the hotbar get 'equipped' i.e. you press 4 to equip the spell and then right click to cast it. Isn't that unproductive? Again this is a button mashing game and even in an mmo doesn't make sense.  - The quests/dialgoue and voice acting is pretty bad. Full of cliches, nothing new, but not a biggie considering what the game is.  - All of the combos are executed the same way with different weapons producing different results, not a problem. However given the fact that you'll be killing A LOT of trash-mobs (MMO remember?) you'll quickly find yourself bored. Sadly there are some fantastic fights in this game which many people may not wait around for!   I recommended it if you have children because such flaws for us snooty gamers didn't exist when we were younger and in combination with just how massive the game is (literally an MMO turned single player) you won't get much more for your money.
3121	1	a	A deep RPG, which will keep the hardened role playing fan busy for a while...!
3123	1	a	Amazing game. I recommend this game highly :)
3125	1	a	Awesome, this is game is a steal! Although i am getting tired of the WoWish graphics plagueing most mmo's these days, this is definitly a great game!
3127	1	a	Bought for 19.99, sale for 6, 20 minutes later.
3129	1	a	Love, love, love this game. Where to start.  Storytelling: This is THE reason to buy this game. Lore, quests, even random NPC chatter is amusing, interesting, and energetic. I went into the game as a fan of R.A. Salvatore and came out very happy that his style and creativity translated really well into the video game world. 10/10, 5 stars, and *confetti explosion* for this video game's writing and dialogue.   Combat: This aspect of the game I felt was it's shortcoming. Any weapon and path you choose always ends up the same. You can take on monsters 4 levels above you without effort pretty early into the game and storyline bosses are extremely easy. That being said, there was a nice feeling of impact with large weapons, but little to no impact with small weapons or magic. 4/10 (no confetti explosion).  Zones/Ambiance/Leveling: I group these things together because, to me, they all mean the same thing. If you like the zone, you will level faster, enjoy the quests and leveling process more and feel more 'in tune' and immersed in the game. The zones, frankly, ranged from unbelievable fantasy art with such attention to detail I couldn't believe it wasn't a cinematic... to utterly dry, boring dust bowl that I had to slog through and couldn't spend one more second in or I would quit. The variances of the zones ensure that anyone who picks up the game will have a good time, but I wish they hadn't sacrificed quality for variety. 6/10   DLC: I only bought 1 DLC, Legend of Dead Kel, and it was a good bit of fantasy candy to spend a couple days on, refurbishing a home, getting ridiculous gear and generally exploring a small private island you can put your personal touch on. Definitely a good pack for the cost. 8/10  Overall: 28/40 (70%) I really enjoyed this game over the course of a couple months. Casual player friendly and incredibly fun backdrop for an RPG adventure.
3131	1	a	This game is an overlooked gem. Fantastic gameplay, and immense campaign. The game is almost too large.
3133	1	a	The best action-Rpg I have played in my whole life.Never played before a game with so beautiful graphics and generally the landscape of every town you visit.A variety of different type of weapons that will make you very busy trying to find better and better weapons in the very big world of Amalur.But best of all the story is so great that it will keep you busy for 100+ hours,leveling up with an advanced level up system(including the choice of the fate you want).The game is excitting however you play it or the choices you made.If I was a critisian,I would give this game 10 out of 10. :*)
3135	1	a	The best action RPG that PC ever had.
3137	1	a	Quietly one of the better Action/RPGs to come out in a long time. It's like Fable, but for a more hardcore crowd. Well worth picking up.
3139	1	a	This game for some reason cought my attention when it was announced, i actually purchased it at full 60 dollar price (pre-order) I played a fair ammount of this game due to its fantastic combat system and mechanics. I spent hours playing this game just killing mobs because it was so satisfiying, the story was not bad either sometimes it felt awkward and wierd but it had great story telling and writting. This game felt like what i wanted the fable games to be but better, for 20 dollars its more than worth it and if it goes on sale you should at least give it a chance.
3141	1	a	Good game great action and tons of fun with the customization. Story line is done well to a point but all in all very fun...
3143	1	a	This is an amazing action rpg game that never get enough attention from the media. Please support this game. Though I heard that the developers already closed down, I still hope there would be a sequel.
3145	1	a	Having player many rpg this would be my brieg initial impressions.  Simply put this is a very casual game in my opion. The skill tree is engaging, there is going to much fun in exploring the options and getting to craft my own style and build. The avatar creation was nice as well, but my biggest pro for this game is visuals. Right from the start the game looks wonerful, and the bgm is very enjoyable as well. While not the most challenging game it's certianly one worth looking into. The combination of engaging story telling and wonderful musical scores and visuals are more than enough for me to confirm this purchase!
3147	1	a	You might as well buy it now while it's cheap. As an RPG, it fails. As a pale God Of War imitation, it fails. As a jack-of-all-trades mashup of the two styles, it mildly succeeds. Decent enough for the time investment, and the story's not bad, considering R.A. Salvatore had a hand in it.
3149	1	a	One of the best RPGs I've played
3151	1	a	BEST........AROUND...NO ONES GONNA EVER TAKE YOU DOWN!!
3153	1	a	Huge game with hundreds of quests. I did every quest in every town and I was totally overleveled by the time I was 50% of the way through. Played it right when it came out and thought then it had good graphics and a great story. That said, I completed it and have never picked it up again, so replayability was not there for me (also due to the huge size of the game -- I really just needed a break when I finished). I had a ton of fun with this game and would recommend to anyone looking for a big, story-driven RPG. However, Morrowind (or Fallout 3, etc.) it's not. Feels lighthearted and graphics are bright and a bit toony. If you are on the fence, try the demo as it's pretty representative of the combat and story you'll get in the full game.
3155	1	a	The game has great gameplay mechanics and it's alot of fun to play. Cool fantasy/magic/goblins story.  One of those games you can play for 100+ hours. I played it on PS3 when it came out and loved it. I'm starting it back up but this time on PC. After a couple of hours on PC I think I prefer the keyboard/mouse play. You have better control of the camera and your character.  Purchase it if you like action games, fhantasy themes, and games that you can put lots of hours into.
3157	1	a	like fable with out the bs
3159	1	a	After 2 hours - one of the better RPG's, addictive and wildly customizable, i love it
3161	1	a	this game kicks ♥♥♥, yes it had no multiplayer option but if you are just in the mood for killing and looting and slaughtering then this is definatly the game for you. -TZS DrunkRussian
3163	1	a	Ermagerd I love le game! :D 15/10 Coming from x-Box to to PC. Still feels fantastic :D
3165	1	a	Good RPG.. Very Injoyable.
3167	1	a	Great Game! feels like fable and elderscrolls at the same time.
3169	1	a	A fantastic game it has so many missions around 60 or more very good color alot better than Skyrim which is more Black and White. The only problem with the game is the monstera are every where it gets old after awhile. But the missions are fun and there is a Cheat code for the game. Thai game is a real steal at this price and the 100 hours or more to play it. One of my favorite games.
3171	1	a	I am actually pleasantly surprised by this game. I had heard pretty good things about this game a while ago, but never got around to picking it up. The one thing that turned me off was that I felt it was too generic. But I'm glad I decided to pick this up regardless. It's not the most original setting, nor is the gameplay too different, but the combat is still satisfying, characters speak with pretty convincing accents and voices, and it looks really quite nice graphically. Plus, the third-person view really brings you into the world and it feels great. The combat here is exactly what I thought I would get with Dragon Age, and I was sad when that wasn't the case. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is worth it.
3173	1	a	Very good RPG game. I complete this game 3 times with 3 differant classes (mage, warrior, rogue). This game is very interesting, also the expansion packs are worth buying.  What I find unique about this game is the combat system. imo it is very tought trough!  Just check some gameplay videos and I hope you guys enjoy this game just as I did!
3175	1	a	Wow meets Skyrim? Close enough and no worries about raid-♥♥♥♥♥ screaming at you when their carefully crafted plans fall apart LOL
3177	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is simply a joy to play! The combat is smooth, fast, and fun. The storytelling is great and easy to understand. The amount of quests is nearly endless. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone, new or old gamer. The only downside of the game is the difficulty. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, the game still doesn't have much of a challenge.
3179	1	a	i highly recommend this game to lovers of RPG style action games. The only thing is that its not multiplayer but thats fine. The combat is amazing, the loot in the world is between good and awesome because sometimes you find crap you don't need and sometimes you find that one thing you were looking for.   The storyline is well built around the main characters and his/her allies, the final battle is one of the best I've ever seen from a PC game. The whole concept of 'fateshifting' is awesome. I give this game a 9/10. Only because it could have a higher level cap, but thats about it 
3181	1	a	Great Game
3183	1	a	Why cann't I stop playing this game? I mean, the graphics are not amazing - and the game play is rather simplistic - and the quests are average though vastly numerous - and the mobs are standard - so if all of these items are 'average' why can't I put this game down?   For the 5 dollar price - I feel like I helped bankrupt Studio 38.  
3185	1	a	Really fun game.. it has a Fable like combat system but was a more fun game then Fable 3. Graphics are good, not the best and a little 'cartoony' at times, but they serve the purpose. The fun in this game really rests on it's combat system and story. There is a lot of lore, story is deep and well done. It's really not a very hard game, I have played a Mage and a Melee Warrior and while the Mage is powerful, the Warrior is downright unkillable. If you need a fun game to sink a lot of hours into, this is a good choice. I dig it.
3187	1	a	Requires extra authentication. And I tried to create an account several times and failed. Total failure.
3189	1	a	witha few mods this game has gone from a good game to an excellent one. Love all the combat moves/combo's
3191	1	a	a good RPG overall, too bad combat gets too easy at high levels, even at the hardest difficulty avialable  main storyline is nice, not great but definetely enjoyable, and there are dozens of side quests that can really keep you busy for some time  7/10
3193	1	a	While not quite to the level of an Elder Scolls game, it still is quite fun.
3195	1	a	I am completely rewriting my review. After about 20 hours in this game my initial impression was that the game world lacked depth, the combat felt stilted and too easy, and the crafting system was made pointless by the gear given to you in the first town by the DLC. However, after completing one of the faction quest, and leveling out of the starter gear, this game has become nearly an equal to oblivion for me, and in some ways beats skyrim, though Skyrim's world is more complete, and the combat is more challenging, KoA's combat is fun and the crafting allows a lot of customization. I also really like the fateweaver resets, so you can, for a cost, completely change your character. This probably limits replayability a bit, but with all the side and faction quests, as well as the straight forward way that the main quest fits into them, there may be quite a bit of replayability.   Where KoA beats Skyrim:  - Combat is fun and feels action packed, and not so much thought is required. - Side and faction quests are much longer in general, and once completed fit into the story. - The consequences of your sidequests and twists of fate that happen once they are completed feel more weighty. - Less glitchy, but I like TES glitches, they give the world character, and make for fun stories.  - Far less essential NPC's: You can hit H and kill nearly anyone. Not that I did.    Where Skyrim is better:  - Skyrim's graphics feel less like a console game. View distance is poor on KoA and there is a bit too much pop in.  - The combat on KoA is pure console style, which is fun in short bursts, but little stratedgy is required. - KoA has people sleeping and waking BUT NO DAY NIGHT CYCLE and no weather. - Skyrim's character customization beats KoA hands down. In KoA armor options are limited in style, and crafting doesn't allow for very much choice in appearance. faces are all perfect, exfoliated, and glowing with health. Characters are all buff and tall, whether you are a mage or a warrior.   I still feel like the interface on KoA and a lot of the features are better suited to a MMO than a MSPRpg, and it is kind of annoying to have a hotbar that is locked to only changing the spell active, but you can get used to it. If there was a touch more customization, and a modding community, this game would be equal to skyrim in my mind.
3197	1	a	Never finished it. Plan to. What I did play of it was great. Great visual style and a huge (almost linear) world. 9/10
3199	1	a	There are few games out there such as Kingdoms of Amalur, the Combat is fast and fun the skills unique making each and every potential class interesting. The story is very well written and leaves you wanting to keep going to finish it. Alkthough there are some immersion base failings and some minor consistency issues overall there are not many RPG's out there that are anywhere near as good.
3201	1	a	The combat. Good Lord, the combat. Polished, slick, and smooth with just the right amounts of visceral brutality. The Destiny system allows for less restriction between magic, melee or ranged archetypes and allows for great customization options. While the storyline is a bit cliched, it possesses a quaint feel, and it, along with the charmingly designed overworld, makes you feel like you're the star in your own Disney Pixar movie. Well, one with copious amounts of blood, that is. GET.
3203	1	a	cracking game! Love it 
3205	1	a	A lot of fun and easy on the eye. Great story telling too.
3207	1	a	The review of Fable x Skyrim is spot on. The game is a little easy.. but it was relaxing. It is very linear, combat isn't bad.. too many quests at times. I skipped all the side quests after a while and just had to focus on the end game.   Yeah.. hack / slash / loot.. and repeat. Overall, a solid 7/10.
3209	1	a	I just love this game! Lots of action, but you control the pace. Great RPG game
3211	1	a	Huge world, lots of content with epic and smooth combat that could've been taken straight from an action game. I could never wish more!
3213	1	a	This game easily earns its place among the best fantasy RPGs ever made!
3215	1	a	This game is not a revolution. However it is well balanced action RPG and fun to play. I like how this game manages to avoid most mistakes that similar games make. Well done. :thumbs up:
3217	1	a	A really fun timesink. I'm 70+ hours in and I've barely scratched the surface. Fun game.
3219	1	a	Great game. Very much like a cross between Skyrim, Legend of Zelda and Fable.
3221	1	a	this game is awesome, no clue why it sold so bad,  IMO its better than skyrim (which sold great) honestly, I feel like the devs of this game gave it their all and got nothing in return... do your part and buy this game and play it for atleast as long as i have (Right now im at abuot 20 hours with no sign of slowing down)
3223	1	a	Awesome Game, great single player RPG, shame the company went broke but still well worth your time
3225	1	a	Awesome game! Great combat system and huge world to explore. Everything that Fable could have been, but never was. Well worth every cent
3227	1	a	Not the greatest game by any means, but it's definitely worth a play through. The best way to describe this game is a hybrid of God of War and Borderlands IMO.
3229	1	a	It's truly sad to see a game go without recognition such as this one. Any RPG lover should have this hidden gem in their library. The combat is fun and fluid. The weapons are unique and stylish. The character design is well made and the voice acting is good. The world itself is stunning, and although graphics wise it's not Skyrim on ultra, it still grabs serious attention in its beauty. The only true complaint i have with the game is it's armor, as i thought the majority of them were pretty ugly. I recommend this game to the RPGer, as it's truly perfect and fiercely under-rated.
3231	1	a	A very deep often overlooked game. This game takes the best part of fantasy lore's found in top notch RPG's, as well as a good action based combat system typical of hack and slash games.... oh and of course loot.
3233	1	a	Holy crap this is what Fable III SHOULD HAVE BEEN! This game rocks socks!
3235	1	a	Great game if you love RPGs. Think Elder Scrolls meets Fable, then throw in a combat system like something from God of War or Darksiders, plus lots of great loot and the ability to craft your own armor, weapons, potions, and gems. Highly recommended.
3237	1	a	Suprisingly good and really fun
3239	1	a	It's funny I actually prefer this game over Skyrim. The pacing is good and combat just feels MUCH better while still having a large world and a lot of character specializations. Skyrim just feels like it takes its time with every little thing and I found myself getting bored pretty quickly. I'm glad I bought it super cheap so I don't feel too bad about it. The only reason I haven't finished Amalur is because it's a really long game, especially for the 'do everything'-type of person.
3241	1	a	Though it is a bit repetitive, this is quite a fun role-playing game. Choose any combination of character skills (from might, finesse, and sorcery branches) and highly-customizable items to travel through the massive world of Amalur. As previously mentioned, the sidequests do become very repetitive - but the main storyline is fun to complete. Similar to Skyrim, but with a more fluid combat system.
3243	1	a	Most assuredly a sleeper-hit! With all the drama surrounding this title, I kept my distance, waiting for the inevitable Steam Sale that would bring it down. When I finally caught it, I was VERY surprised! The gameplay is fantastic and engaging, the storylines aren't bad at all, and the loot is powerful--all the makings of an incredible RPG! I would DEFINITELY recommend this to friends, particularly anyone who likes RPGs but isn't real happy with the combat in a title like Skyrim.
3245	1	a	A bizarre mix of Skyrim, World of Warcraft and Bastion - but somehow it works. I would give this game a 8 out of 10.   The best about this game is the combat, which heavily smacks of Batman Arkham Asylum.  The bad is the generic high fantasy story and the limited possibilities of actually exploring. Nonetheless a fun game, though a bit steeply priced at 59 dollars.
3247	1	a	This is going to be named 'Best RPG of the Year' hands down.  Fantastic story, in-depth customization, and a gruesomely awesome combat system all packed into one amazing franchise. Seriously, if you thought Skyrim was good, then you have no idea what you are missing!  Only thing this game needs is co-op features and modding support, and it will be MORE than perfect.
3249	1	a	A great Action-RPG that was only happered by its $60 initial price and bad timing with a release so close to Skyrim. Amalur is a fun little game that works with Big Picture. I would have liked a bit more fine tuning for the 360 remote. I find it sad I can't have all my abilities when the smple use of a toggle button would have sufficed. Reguardless the game is fun to play. Nothing here will shatter your perception of the RPG experience. Just good ol' fashon killing.
3251	1	a	A great action RPG. Though it went with a more MMO style of approach to a single player title, the customization was grand, the story was interesting and well written, and it was a worthwhile title to play despite a few small issues (odd facial animations and dialogue at times, very limited crafting system, etc). Probably not worth 60$, but anywhere between 10-25$ is good for any RPG enthusiast.
3253	1	a	Had my doubts around this one even after looking at all those positive reviews. Finally took the plunge and glad I did. Still playing but loving it every bit!
3255	1	a	This is the RPG you have been waiting for. Graphically similar to Fable, without the annoying Disney-esque character dialogue, deeper statistics and abilities, with exciting loot and crafting trees. If you like RPG's GET THIS GAME!
3257	1	a	Best thing about this game is the combat and the art style; amazingly fun combat with a versatile class system, you can pretty much play whatever you want without problems. Tad too easy even on Normal/Hard. Feels like an offline MMO, every quest is kill X or fetch X and the plot is generic. Lack of graphical options but still runs very well even on low end systems. Huge world but as stated, quests are the same throughout. Worth a buy when on sale, requires an EA account if you plan on redeeming demo items/buying DLC.
3259	1	a	What can i say about Amalur, it is a RPG but one different from everything you have seen before without forgeting the true nature of RPG games. Recommended to all those looking for something new. 
3261	1	a	Think the fluent combat of God of War, packed in with a tiny bit of Fable, and a dash of Morrowind. This is far from perfect, but after a few hours in, you'll get immersed in the quests. Unfortunately, the story peaks unevenly, going from surpreme creative genius to ludicrous, but overall KoA:R delievers what it can from a new studio, and stands well as an RPG in a tough crowd of AAAs.
3263	1	a	Fantasic game, great depth and visuals, topped by a thrilling storyline and compelling battle system
3265	1	a	The game content seems to be really huge so you will have lots and lots to do. I have spent quite a few days with this and generally it is a nice game to play.  Pros: - Big map - Lots of quests - Easy to play, easy to get into - Very much voice acting and lots of lore - Graphically appealing if you like cartoonish look - Cool monsters, cool effects, etc  Cons: - Annoying combat controls with both controller and mouse&amp;keyboard (turning in mid-combat and throwing spells in different directions are very unreliable and half the time you don't have idea where the next spell or hit is gonna go) - Camera with controller is way too slow in combat making you die just because you can't see what's happening - Camera overall is so close to you you have no idea what's going on - All other kinds of camera problems during the whole game
3267	1	a	One of the best RPGS I've played in my life. Only 11 hours into the game and haven't even explored half the map yet. Just loving it to the bits. Buy if you can, you won't regret it if you like RPGs.  
3269	1	a	KOA is a good RPG at the start you’re drawn in by the fun combat system and good writing but by the end you’re just a little bit bored and somewhat confused about it all. The problems the game faces is that it’s difficulty curve is too shallow which coupled with a fixed level world means that exploring becomes a moot point as you out level the content very quickly. If you’re looking for a RPG to run with for a couple of weeks this is for you there is plenty to see and do then get this game but wait for a sale.
3271	1	a	Having spent 100 hours playing this game, completing everything this game has to offer (including DLC), this game is unbelivable. The amount of details and stories within are fantastic, plus the opportunities to change it up when tired of playing as one style are many.  Now, playing this game on a much harder difficulty will increase a playthrough dramtically, however it is worth it.  Only you can decide your fate when it comes to this game, but it well worth investing in.  BUY IT NOW! GO ON! DO IT!
3273	1	a	Amalur could've used a bit more polish before release. It has its ups but the downsides keep it from being awesome. If you're a fan of western action RPGs, chances are you'll get some enjoyment out of this, but for it to be considered great, takes a certain type of personal taste. Kingdom's of Amalur isn't a masterpiece, but it's not god-awful either, thankfully. Perhaps most of the issues could be fixed if a sequel is ever made, though that seems unlikely with the developer having gone bankrupt.  Mind you, I'm still going through the game so some of these points may change.  The good:  + Customizable combat. You can switch between a mage, rogue or warrior or a combination of any of them pretty easily, and there're multiple weapon types in the game, which feel varied enough to keep things interesting. Bonus points for making Chakrams NOT SUCK  + Executing entire packs of enemies through Fate is pretty fun to watch  + The atmosphere &amp; exploration. I've rather enjoyed running around, discovering hidden loot caches and secret rooms, and the world's varied enough for me to enjoy exploring it  + The music. I found it rather relaxing in downtime, and exciting enough to fuel the fights in combat, though more variety would've been welcome  + The lore. I find this concept of a 'Fateless' person that is able to stand against the pre-determined destiny rather fascinating  The Bad:  - The graphics are a bit dated, even considering that the game went for a bit cartoony appearance which tends to age well  - Using Fate in combat is a quicktime event. I hate quicktime events. But at least it's brief  - Some weapons are broken, chief offenders being the bow and chakrams. You can completely stunlock some, if not all, enemies with them  - The inventory system is complete ♥♥♥♥. Each new thing takes up a spot and comparing items is a pain. And it takes ages to vendor everything, and you will be doing this a lot because most of the loot is completely useless.  - Money drops left and right. I haven't managed to drop below 60 thousand gold pieces yet, and it just keeps building up. And I'm not sure what there is to spend it on aside from inventory upgrades, since I've found all my best items  Personal pet peeves:  * There is no jump button, and jumping around in RPGs is something I rather enjoy * Default controls use Shift for Block, not Sprint, unlike pretty much every half-decent game made since the late 90ies.
3275	1	a	Contains many quest really kills time
532	0	a	Was this game supposed to have excellent narrative from some impressive famous author? The first hour or so of dialogue is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a professionally made computer RPG.
3277	1	a	great game, great crafting. im really enjoying the story!
3279	1	a	Much better than Witcher 2 and other similar titles. The graphics are a little ''Childish'' but the gameplay is so addictive I have spend hours upon hours playing this title. I feel bad for the company who did a good job and went bankrupt while others sell us crappy titles and because of the hype everyone buys them and they get rich!
3281	1	a	If you are willing to overlook some annoying quest breaking bugs that will NEVER be patched this is a game any rpg lover can enjoy.
3283	1	a	Third person action rpg with more focus on dodging and type advantage than actual roleplaying. Most choices in the game are fairly black and white, but with a wealth of alternate solutions in the faction quests - one quest has the player able to skip most of the fights if they have a high enough level in Dispel.  The DLC, while not bad, isn't worth getting unless the price is right - they introduce some entertaining characters and a few good items, but overall are short.  The game has a level cap of 40, which is very easy to hit before you get far in the main plot, so it can turn into a chore to advance the plot rather instead of exploring side quests.  Get it when on sale - there's a lot of content, but overall it is fairly linear - not that being linear is explicity bad.
3285	1	a	10/10 Belongs in the Hall of Fabled RPG's
3287	1	a	Pretty nice fable-like rpg, recommended if u like quests equal as grind. be aware of location level system.
3289	1	a	Really good game with beautiful graphics and good story. Nice RPG where you can spend many hours palying.
3291	1	a	Got an achievement for speaking with someone while naked.  10/10
3293	1	a	Great, great game. One recommendation though - go for melee build, especially daggers. The melee combat in this game is close to perfection when it comes to fun.
3295	1	a	better than skyrim. It's a must, even though it's not first person
3297	1	a	Fairly good game...with lots of contents...but kinda linear  Could have been bit more non-linear...
3299	1	a	Great game 
3301	1	a	A bug just killed several hours of gameplay for me and possibly the game itself so...  This is sort of a love letter to role playing games. It follows many tropes and sticks to a familiar atmosphere of RPGs. If I was still a kid I would find the game way more entertaining because ultimately it does get tedious at its core.   The story is actually interesting and the narrative from individuals is lengthy and will tie into the overall story. Sometimes non-playable characters will even have new dialog unlocked by actions that involve other NPCs. Unfortunately even with a well known author penning each character's thoughts, their words become droll when they are essentially the same thoughts reworded for a different face.   The combat isn't as varied as I'd like but it is also an action RPG. Having a single button for each weapon and using timing to pull off combos sounds like a good idea for an ARPG. But because the different weapons don't chain into each other and the combos themselves are largely generic gameplay turns into pressing one button repeatedly to attack and then dodging or blocking when needed. The enemies movements are telegraphed and while this is generally a good thing in video games, the weak A.I. and terrible combat scaling makes every fight with less than 10 enemies routine. Most enemies fall into the same 'type'. The three most common types following the same lines as the player; rogue, mage, or fighter. Because most enemies share similar move sets and strategy the fights feel the same no matter where you are in the game. I was actually amazed when I had an enemy flee for the first time. Fortunately it was because they were under a bleeding status effect. Unfortunately even the weakest of mobs will attack you aggressively despite being killed in a few hits. Most boss fights play out like ordinary combat except that the game will throw more goons into the mix and the boss might actually be on a level playing field with you statistically.   The 'Reckoning' feature ties nicely into the lore but is so overpowered that I only saved it for bosses. Of course the meter fills fast enough that I could have used it frequently, I just never needed to.  If this game had less content, it might actually be better. But my overall experience from the game was really feeling obsessive about having more loot. This is a loot driven game and I frequently found myself staring at item stats in order to sort out the gems from the junk. Luckily you can instantly junk most items and mass sell junk items. Without that option this game would be unpalatable. Unfortunately the bug that killed the game for me was having several items stuck in my inventory. Worse than that, I've been carrying around 5 of Brother Til's books for most of the game and all they've done is sat there.   I'd like to end this by talking about crafting but I didn't really craft anything beyond basic gems. When I had the basic levels of all the crafting skills unlocked the weapons or armor I could make were nothing compared to what I could buy or find on a corpse. Fortunately all of those crafting items don't take up space.
3303	1	a	a game full of fun, flash and adventure. i had a great time playing this game, reckoning is one of the greatest rpg's that i've played in a long time. it's big open world helps for hours of playtime even after you've finished the main story line. sure it's no skyrim but think as if dragon age and the elder scrolls had a baby, this bad boy would have come out. thats not to say there arent some problems; almost all the characters look very similiar, there were some click in's and outs and the game suffers a few other glitches. but its nothing that takes away from the feeling of imersion, this game is great and the small bugs really dont bother all to much, sometimes not even at all. in total I'd give this game a 9/10. great game with an amazing story, i loved every minute of it.
3305	1	a	I have this on my Playstation Plus account, but never got around to playing it. Recently bought it and from the get go, I was impressed. It looks quite nice, handles quite well and gameplay is very solid.  I must say this, the voice acting so far has been very well done, a few iffy bits but they have done a superb job with that.  I've played more hours than listed as I play offline sometimes.  For $20, it's a great game. For $10 or less, it's a MUST.
3307	1	a	There is a VERY good game here. It has all the hallmarks of a class action rpg, but I just CAN'T get into it no matter how many hours I put in or how much I want to. Its missing something but I can't put my finger on it or it has something thats off putting like this fantasy game obsession with including elves, fantasy games have done elves to death and I'm getting sick of seeing them in EVERY fantasy game, film, or book. That said if you can get into it and put up with yet more elves stealing the spotlight, this game will rule.
3309	1	a	amazing graphics although the dialogue can be a bit overdone i love the game overall 4/5 worth the buy especially on summer sale
3311	1	a	Beautiful graphics and amazing story make for a epic game and adventure! The gameplay is wonderful as well with a great combat and well done classes Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that all RPG fans need!
3313	1	a	Amazing game, ruined by a glitch which makes your character stop and start when running. A pity as I throughly enjoyed it up to this point.
3315	1	a	I write this early review (only 8 hours in game so far) for the summer sale: buy this game while it's on sale, you won't regret your 10 euros (or 20 with DLCs). I'm gonna buy the DLCs right away.  The game has its flaws though, the biggest one being the UI which looks like a 2004 hardcore RPG. This is quite of a pain to go through the inventory (and you'll have to use it quite often). There are also some issues with the camera that sometimes goes in your way during combat. And the graphics may look outdated but I don't think it's most important point for an RPG (some players have a different opinion on that). I have this feeling looking at the final result that this game could have used a little bit more polish (budget?) and that would have been one of the greatest RPGs on PC.  But if you can forgive those - minor IMO - flaws, you will enjoy a deep ARPG with a refreshing, dynamic and interesting combat system. There are a lot of ways to build you skill tree, and the moves you can unlock are really visually cool. The crafting system offers a lot of possibilities, but it seems to me at this point that materials are hard to come. There are of course lots of quests and side quests, a lot of lore and hidden objects to find, and litteraly tons of loot.  The voice acting is very good though a little bit overdone sometimes, the only thing I regret is that your character is mute (some voice presets would have been welcome).
3317	1	a	This game's all that Fable 3 tried to be and much more! EXCELLENT! /Mr. Burns on
3319	1	a	So far I can see potential but it's clear that it just hasn't got the budget of something like Skyrim. I like the world and the idea of completly custimisable levelling but I don't think it quite delivers. 7/10
3321	1	a	Awesome. Great storyline, and ♥♥♥♥ing amazing combat.
3323	1	a	If you like third-person adventure RPG's, enjoyed Oblivion and want a different kind of story, then get this game. There are some similarities to Oblivion especially the way the fae in this game look like elves from TES, but most of the art is Todd McFarlane. The game has a type of perk leveling system that allows you to freely swap points so you can change how you want to play. There seem to be lots of side quests to keep busy exploring. My only complaint is the FOV is way too close, but I was able to fix that with Widescreen Fixer. Great game. Been having lots of fun.
3325	1	a	Fun game so far, but one thing should be mentioned: This game is annoying without a controller. The combat system seems to have been developed for twin-stick controllers, and is terribly clumsy with the default settings on a PC. It also suffers from a few other simplifications common when making 'rpg's' for consoles. All in all a decent game, but not in any way great - not least because unless you're plaing with a game pad, you're playing a Special Olympian.  In short: Perfectly passable, maybe even worth the full price. Play it with a twin-stick controller or give up on any dream you might have had of changing facing in combat when you need to.
3327	1	a	really fun game, lots of differnt choices to make with talents
3329	1	a	Excellent Game! A dream to play! Very well polished, beautiful and awesome gameplay. So many weapons and magics. I am overwhelmed with all the great stuff :D Challenging on Hard difficulty. It takes a little while to get stuff and to get into but once you get going you won’t want to stop playing!
3331	1	a	Cute little fantasy RPG, has all the cliche's stiched into it (including the rats in the tutorial level :) ) and the mainstory is very predicable. Pretty brainless gameplay but very amusing none the less. I will probably never play it again after i finish it, but I am enjoying it ATM. Overall not a bad game. I give it 3 cooky's out of 5  sincerely, your old pal...  ...Palantir 
3333	1	a	This feels a bit like someone took (a slightly improved version of) the combat from Fable, the randomized loot from the Diablo series, and crammed it all into a semi-open-world Elder Scrolls-lite. Graphics are cartoonish and dated, even on highest difficulty it's still pretty easy, the story is pretty generic, and crafting amounts to tearing apart all your junk loot into a mountain of spare parts and then cobbling a new item from the few good ones in the heap, but despite all that it somehow manages to be a lot of fun. The combat feels fluid and has a nice element of timing in it for special attacks, blocks, and dodges, the various enemies generally feel distinct and have their own quirks and patterns to learn, the skill tree is varied enough to enjoy fiddling with different builds, some of the boss fights are pretty good, and the different regions and environments are all distinct and have their own feel.   Imagine an over-the-shoulder Diablo with slightly more in-depth combat, no classes, a semi-open world, and crafting, and you've got a pretty good idea of what you're getting with this.  Definitely not a groundbreaking or genre-defining game, but it takes the good bits from a bunch of others and puts them together into a generally entertaining package. If you like carving your way through hordes of enemies while collecting loot and chasing side quests, then it's definitely worth picking up whenever it goes on sale.
3335	1	a	Multiplayer please!!! will be the besT!!!!!
3337	1	a	A truly amazing game. Beautiful graphics, intense gameplay, vast open world, and incredible storyline.
3339	1	a	wtf went wrong? this game is actually enjoyable. it has an mmorpg feel to it without the mmo to fit the story: that you are some one important. this could have been amazing if it was an mmo though. combat is smooth and fast paced, but simple enough to understand, similar to the witcher series. exploration feels like you are actually in a vast land. only question is what happend? this game definitely looks like it was meant for the mmorpg player.
3341	1	a	For the record, I got this game for 66% off.  This game is awesome. If I had to compare it to another game, it would be Fable. I'm not going to say its better or worse than fable.  This game isn't worth $20? But goat simulator was totally worth it huh? What a joke. Its worth the $20. And if it goes on sale, you would be foolish to not give it a chance. 
3343	1	a	If you're looking for an open world combat and loot game, you've come to the right place. Amalur manages to do exploration and gameplay pretty good.   If you're looking for a game with a good story and fun quests, look elsewhere because it lacks either of those.
3345	1	a	At nearly 100 hours into this near perfect game, I feel qualified to tell you that if you have ever enjoyed a game like legacy of Kain, or Balder's Gate, and you like a game that progresses smoothly so that you can develop with the world as you are introduced to it like Morrowind, or any Elder Scroll, then this will light game you up from the inside out.   From the start you are assaulted with colours in a rainbow that never gets old, and is constantly changing. The world around you from the deepest caves to the highest mountain tops, to the shores of a distant sea, is stunning. The best way to describe the style of this world, and the game play would be to simply say that this is Fable with a map/compass system that is actually helpful (sometimes dizzying, but so very helpful).   The game play is perfectly lain out for you across a vast world with mountains, and swamps, and deserts, and all other manner of locations that you would expect. Your character is completely up to you to design, then to build, and even to level up. You can reset all skills at any time for very little, then rebuild your character any way you might want for a new battle strategy if things are not working out one way. There are more varied quests in this game than you would expect, and the dialog is mostly very smart. The repetition of some quests in is really hardly noticeable as you can just go do something else then come back to that quest later if you want. The entire world is open for you to explore, though like most open world games you do have to progress through certain parts of the story to open up tunnels, or sea passages.  The DLC is really nice, and both the Dead Kell story, and the Teeth bit are great, and provide very different locations to explore, they also offer new weapons, and armour for you to find, or earn, and new permanent perks that you can earn by completing the side quests.  This game is just a total winner all around. You might even surprise yourself by spending more time in Amular, than you did the last time you visited Cirodil.  Enjoy,   Jesse of  www.Jesse.ca 
3347	1	a	Love the game really great rpg game
3349	1	a	This game is highly under rated.
3351	1	a	Great game, good graphics and gameplay. Could play over and over again.
3353	1	a	This game has plenty of quests and tasks to do, you won't get bored with this one.
3355	1	a	Super fun sandboxy game that got completely overshadowed by Skyrim, alas. As someone who loves different character builds, being able to change abilities/classes at will is awesome. My only complaint is that there's almost too much game for the level cap, which is very easy to hit significantly before endgame if you, like me, feel compelled to do every sidequest you find.
3357	1	a	I love this kind of game. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. This game is a fantastic RPG. The combat is some of the most fun I have ever played. Graphics are good, world is big, and story is....Okay. The Story is...OKAY because I couldn't relate to ANYONE. But it was about as good as any standard MMO story, even if this isn't an MMO.  Like I said the Combat in this game is very very fun, there are combos that you can do like in a fighting game, there is magic and stealth if you like those things. The boss fights could be better, they all have a easily found pattern that doesn't make them very hard. But when you are fighting the actual enemies and not the boss fights, it becomes a lot more diffcult as you progress in levels. And the loot system is the greatest part. When you complete a quest almost always you will get a great reward, unlike some RPG's that I have played.  The Open world itself is very pretty, but nothing we haven't seen before. If you have played world of Warcraft then your jaw won't be dropping at the sight of this world.  Overall I would say that this game is very fun and worth the money. Gameplay: 9.5/10  Graphics: 6/10  Story:6/10 Final score: 7/10 I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a good hack and slash RPG
3359	1	a	Great game, good graphics, very long gameplay but it hasn't gotten boring after 24 hours of ingame play. I would definitly recommend this game if you like RPG'S.
3361	1	a	This game is simple, beautiful and so much fun! I recommend it to anyone looking to play a grind away RPG!
3363	1	a	I adore Kingdoms of Amalur, let me start by saying that. The game is entertaining, the combat is engaging, and the world looks pretty decent. There are a few glaring issues with the game, though; it's not without it's share of problems. So to help speed this along, I'll just rattle off the good and the bad.  The best thing that Kingdoms had to offer is it's world. It's massive, with optional caves and quests at every corner. There is a ton of stuff to do in the game. I have what, over a days worth of playtime, and I haven't even touched the main quest yet. The world is also nice looking, and while not as nice as say Skyrim is, the world feels more fantastic and mysterious. I have a genuine giddyness when traveling to new areas, as each new area is vastly different. It makes me feel like I did when I played games like Banjo-Kazooie, as each area is different and exciting. The combat is engaging and can be difficult, especially during boss fights. The best way to describe it is and Oblivion style world and crafting mixed with Dragon Age syle conversation and Dark Souls-esque combat.  Now for the shortcomings. The most notable and prevalent is that the game's difficulty drops off drastically as you play. Your character becomes the most OP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing in Amalur, and that makes the game become a lot less fun. Because of all of the optional side quests and fights, your character levels extremely fast. before I left the first area I decided to do every side quest, but by the time I left I was already around level 10. The next areas don't scale well enough for the amount of exp you have if you do everything. Not to mention a lot of quests just seem annoying or dumb when they all basically boil down to 'go and kill certain things for me and i'll give you gold'. Speaking of gold, the economy in this game is super strange. you can get a ton of money just killing things in the world. Now to offset the amount of gold you get, the game makes repairing your weapons cost more and more, but the price of repair kits never changes. It's easily exploitable, and you can hoard gold the entire game. I literally don't spend gold on anything but curse removal and repair kits. Finally the combat is engaging only at first, after you've done every combo and tried all of the weapons, you soon tire of the combat system and each character can get the same combat maneuvers which means one character is enough to try almost everything.  That said, I really do like this game, I just think they messed up a few things along the way in development. The game is fun and exploring the world is charming (though I would like to hear more music) but the lack of difficulty scaling and over saturation of side quests makes this game easy and repetitive. But I absolutely reccommend it to you guys because there is a certain charm to Amalur and the game is an epic RPG that manages to be a relaxing experience throughout.
3365	1	a	 KoA:Reckoning  is a fantastic RPG. Fans of Skyrim and the like will probably be somewhat irked with it, as it's not open-world and the quests tend to be rather repetitive in their layout, but it offers a lot of things that are brand-new to the RPG scene, from entirely new perspectives on characters (like Fae and the four varieties of giant-kin) and exceptional game mechanics both in leveling and playing.   That said, the storyline is amazing, the lore is rich beyond belief (I'd say it's about as deep as Skyrim's - and Bethesda has been working on TES for a lot longer than this game had), and the combat system will simply blow you away: It's fast, fluid, intuitive, and fun. I, for one, have not been able to play Skyrim after playing Reckoning simply because I get bored with Skyrim's mechanics. It has a feel that, I agree with 38 Studios, there is no better word for than 'storybook': Where Skyrim is a gritty reality, Reckoning is a land of fairy tales none of which you know and all of which are fantastically created. And yes, fellow Grimm's fans, not all of the stories are as light as Disney; in fact, almost none of them are. If you're a lorehound, be sure to get the DLC; when it was clear that the game wasn't doing well enough, lore got packed into both the DLCs, though 'The Legend of Dead Kel' got most of it. And there is a lot of lore to get, even huge amounts hinted at having been fleshed out without being actually explained in-game like the Dverga and Varani societies.   More minor issues with the game are mostly things like not being able to jump except at certain jump down points (though the jump down points become a fun mechanic in a lot of places), not being able to collect all the unique armor pieces or weapons or all the armor sets (though the DLC both adds more and helps a lot by adding more collection opportunities), and the fact that even though the game was clearly designed for it and it's even mentioned in one of the opening cinematics you can't actually play as a giant Jottun (though you do get to fight them and it is fun). Also, the storybook nature can be irritating to a lot of people; you will recognize every character in the game from somewhere else, including the hypersexualized elf chick with a confrontational attitude.   Overall, not The Best RPG Evar, but worth a helluva lot more attention than it has gotten, and even if you're not a fan of its style worth at least one playthrough. It's certainly  my  favorite RPG.
3367	1	a	I have only put about 15 hours into the game so I will probably update this later on, but I feel I have seen enough to have a pretty decent idea of the game as a whole.  In theory this is the best rpg in the world, huge crafting systems, freedom with playstyles, world full of characters and quests, and the potential to stick well over 100 hours into it. In practice this game is extremely generic. That isn't saying its a bad game, or that its not worth the money just it isn't anything you haven't seen before. It takes the good parts of all the action rpgs you have played and puts them all together in one package, except it doesn't innovate on any of those elements.   The combat is pretty weak overall, its very repetitive and one dimensional, playing as a sorcerer you pretty much just use 2 attacks and then throw in 1 or 2 spells (out of a small handful). Dodging / blocking in the game is slow and inconsistent to the point where it is better to remain on the offensive and try to stagger / stun your opponent out of their attack than it is to actually block or dodge it. The camera angle and unit targeting is also equally inconsistent, trying to target the right unit seems like 50% luck which can really hurt when you are trying to incapacitate a strong foe in a battle.  I also have a huge problem with the controls. The keyboard and mouse controls suck, especially in menus, so I play with a gamepad. But there aren't enough keybinds on the gamepad to use all of my abilities. Even worse, there is no way to use one of my abilities without binding it.   These are the actual steps you might have to take in a fight to use an ability that is unbound. Pause game &gt; navigate multiple menus to find the skill &gt; bind it to a key &gt; unpause and use the skill &gt; pause game again &gt; navigate menus to skills again &gt; replace it with your more frequently used ability &gt; unpause and continue playing.  If that sounds ridiculous that is because it is, I have actually set my gamepad down on my lap, used the mouse and keyboard for 1 ability, then picked up my gamepad to continue a fight. I feel like that was actually necessary to complete the fight too, to the point where I don't think I could have done it without that ability, but I had no easier way of using it at the right time.  A lot of my problems with the controls come with the games difficulty, playing on hard the game doesn't present much of a challenge until you get to the bosses. The reason the bosses are difficult though is because they use attacks that are extremely difficult to avoid and will almost 1 shot you if they hit you. The game can be extremely frustrating when you die because you weren't able to target the right enemy quick enough and then he hits you with an ability that stuns you just long enough for the boss to 1 shot you. Or getting 1 shot by the boss because you were staggered by an enemy that spawned 2 feet behind you, but because of the camera you had no idea they were there.  I don't feel like I am far enough into the game to comment on the story too much, as I have spent most of my time doing side quests. I am hoping this will be a redeeming quality for it though. Currently I am finding it hard to care about the story, though that may be because I have spent so much time doing other things between completing main quests.  As it stands if someone asked me to recommend a game to them, this wouldn't be on my list. Though if they asked me to recommend an RPG that they can sink a ton of time into, I would consider telling them about this game.
3369	1	a	world of warcraft and fable had a baby and its kingdom of amalur
3371	1	a	A solid action RPG in all respects, Kingdos of Amalur is a fun little gem that gives you a nice big world to explore, a big pile of questlines and sidequests to get on with, a few interesting pieces of DLC and nice, smooth combat. It brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, but if you're an avid fan of smacking loot confetti monsters in the face and scratching a completionist itch, you could be doing much worse than this.  The story doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around. It right up shows you the main antagonist laughing on his evil throne of Anal ♥♥♥♥ of the Innocent, you've got your snobby immortal elves, clever tinkering midgets, and bigoted, dumb humans, all the good stuff. Little story arcs and points of interest meet you on your travels and characters are likeable enough. Again, it's cliche, safe, but executes what you'd expect just fine.  The crafting system is simple enough, letting you customise gear you want based on what items you have. Loot comes in the WoW-esque colour branded system where you'll stick to your PRECIOUS PURPLEZ even though they're for characters ten levels lower than you. Levelling up is braindead basic, with three talent trees (Roughly fitting into the categories of punching ♥♥♥♥♥s in the faces, zapping ♥♥♥♥♥s in the ether, and stabbing ♥♥♥♥♥s in the back) and upgrading some skills you require along the way, like lockpicking, aforementioned crafting, persuasion, yadda yadda.  'Open world' is perhaps a little bit of an oversell. You can run around all the lovely locales at your own pace, but if you do venture a little too far, you will end up getting one-shotted by the most common of enemies if you're not quite up to standard in level and gear. The areas are at least pretty for the most part, but you might get sick of seeing the same generic caves or mines over and over.  It's got better combat than The Elder Scrolls games, and goodness knows people need to be yanked away from sucking that schpinter perhaps just a tad. I did find myself getting just a little bit bored of performing the same patterns of attacks and dodges, which whilst felt lovely to execute, you wish maybe the enemy AI would spruce things up just a little bit.  Perfect and new it isn't, but I picked this lesser-known title with all of it's DLCs for a tenner and it's eaten up plenty precious hours of my life, and I haven't even completed it yet.  (Of course, in typical EA curse fashion, despite this game getting plenty of good reviews, the company behind it went bankrupt and the brand is six feet under, so if you don't feel like feeding your hard-earned cash into their stockholder and executive board, maybe you want to pass up on buying this straight from Steam. You stay classy, EA!)
3373	1	a	If your looking for a Skyrim like game you found it. In my personal opinion this one is better.
3375	1	a	If you want a time sink that's not Skyrim this game may be it. 5 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface of the man quest, but have done at least 20 or so side quests. Plus the combat kicks ♥♥♥.
3377	1	a	Buy it. Its Good.
3379	1	a	Pros Highly addictive. Beautiful graphics and engaging story line. It has a ton of side quests so you'll never be at a lost for something to do. Easy leveling, so no need to grind. Diverse builds make you really feel that the character represents your fighting style. Questing is non-linear early on in game, thus increasing the replay value.  Cons Maps are not as big as they look. Once you clear an area, you feel little need to return until mid to late game if you're a completionist.  Dungeons are a bit repetative in appearance and structure. Think Mass Effect 1. I'm a jumper...there's no jump :(.  Fast travel is nice, but sometimes you wish you could just move faster on foot (no mounts so far...). Physical appearance of character is not as customized I would prefer. But hey, it's not an MMO and it's not the Sims.   8.5 of 10
3381	1	a	I love every minute of this game! I have beaten it about five times now. It's a very long game, especially with the DLC. 60+ hours. KOA has most beautiful graphics of any game I have ever played. Perfect combat. I love being able to create my own weapons and design them to my liking. My favorite weapon is the Chakram. The Balor in Mel Senshir is the best BOSS battle I have ever played, and that's in the middle of the game!  If you're looking for a serious (and time consuming) RPG, I definitely recommend Kingdoms of Amalur! 
3383	1	a	(writing this only 8 hour into the game) From what i played , this feel complety like a universe to explore , there is alot of backstory and content and it is interesting to discover . There is alot of side quest barely touch the main quest yet , but that mean a good thing , it is a full game where developer did not rush the game . For gameplay it is perfect , it feel rewarding , you got plenty of choice as for combat as rogue,warrior and mage but you can also combine them as for warrior-rogue or even warrior-mage whicht can lead to interesting mechanic of combat . If I should recomment this game? Definitely a buy !
537	0	a	Having STUPID sound issued and not a single way of fixng I can't recommend this game...  I thought this kind of issued had been solved but nope...   
538	0	a	It is possible to change the play styles you use so it wont become boring too fast but I feel this was the only thing that allowed me to continue playing. It is not very user friendly because majority of the times when completing a dungeon you would have to run back to the beginning yourself and shortcuts were rare, though it is not a problem it is time consuming. I also do not feel that the levelling system was well balanced because as soon as you get the hang of the controls it gets easy real fast, even if you are playing on hard difficulty. It was not very rich in story either. I found it to be a very generic, something you can find in any RPG and doesnt really make it stand out. The fateshift feature is pretty much a berserk mode, which is very overpowered and very easy to fill up. Not only are you overpowered on your own it also alows you to use potions to temporarily increase your stats during combat and also permanent boosts known as twist of fate. To summarise it is a very generic RPG game.
3385	1	a	Pros outweigh the Cons: 7.5/10 (maybe 8.5/10 better if you don't care too much about story &amp; lack of difficulty).
3387	1	a	Highly recommended! This game is a lot of fun to play, there is lots of things to do, the game world is enormous, and the combat is very fast. Put about 30 hours in so far and only finished half the main story lines (guessing) and only 2 of 5 faction quest lines. Story is very strong in this game, as it should be considering the writer. A must play if you love Elder Scrolls games and wished the combat was better.
3389	1	a	I really enjoy this game, it's got a fun story line, and reminds me of the first Fable game mixed with world of warcraft.. but in a completely single player style. You have to play on the hardest mode if you want any sort of a challenge though. I hooked my x-box remote up to my pc, and it plays pretty fun. :)
3391	1	a	If you like playing MMO's but actually hate interacting with other people then this is just the game for you!   Leveling, fetch-the-bearass quests and smash-a-button combat al packaged in a single player MMO game.
3393	1	a	A lot of fun if you're looking for a hack and slash. Highly customizable classes... for example, you can do a hybrid rogue/mage, etc.
3395	1	a	Game is amazing. Get it. PIck magic. Have fun.
3397	1	a	If you like TESV this is an amazing game. Very much lkes Skyrim but more steamlined combat....
3399	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of my favourite RPGs of the last few years. It has everything what a good and solid role-play-game needs: Interesting and complex story, nice graphics and there's even a housing system! It is definitely worth its price - buy it, play it, keep it and play it again.
3401	1	a	Fun RPG with aspects of other RPG games, as well as the standard classes 'warrior, mage and rogue' there are muixed classes that combine the base ones together for some interesting gameplay.
3403	1	a	Very fun game, definately many hours of fun to be had on here especially with the DLC as well.
3405	1	a	Strange game but a tad interesting, feels like it was not fully polished at times. It feels like 'Fable' but without changing your avator and no worrying about food so it seems a bit water down for a game. If you can get this cheap enough and want to mess around and do quests, it is good for a weekend time waster if you find yourself bored.
3407	1	a	Action packed but the combat is very simple, just alot of mass clicking. very good story and cool weapons/armors.   7/10
3409	1	a	This game is incredibly fun. It came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. I love the class system, and how it enables players to play 'pure' classes like the typical mage, warrior, and rogue, or blend them together to better match your play style. I also really liked how each class had 2-3 weapons they were able to use (or 6~9 depending on blended classes), and I think that made combat even more versatile. (On this note, I really surprised to find that mages had access to a non-staff/wand weapon for offensive, physical attacks and I loved that.)  KoA:R has a fairly decent storyline, too, and definitely a boat-load of quests to do. I think the only issue I had with it was that I reached the level cap (40) fairly early on, or maybe about halfway through the main questline so I couldn't get all the skills/upgrades I wanted.   But overall I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy open world RPGs.
3411	1	a	I bought this game cheaply during the Summer sale and I must say I'm extremely happy with the purchase. So far the game has been very entertaining and I can imagine myself playing this for a long while.
3413	1	a	an awesome game if its mmo it would be legendary
3415	1	a	Huge, rich open-world RPG whose aesthetic masks nuanced storytelling.  Pros: Deep, original world Great suplots/faction quests Flexible leveling options  Cons: Disconnect between R.A. Salvatore's writing and art design Loot system Overabundance of 'meh' quests  It's a shame that 38 Studios fell to pieces, as this IP could have taken off with tighter direction. The setting is much more fresh than it appears at first blush, and the world is littered with great moments and locations, with a few quest series that on their own would have made for the entirety of lesser action-RPGs (House of Ballads, I'm looking at you). The leveling system is more robust than seems typical of the genre, and it isn't difficult to reset and reallocate skills as equipment and playstyle preferences shift.  The biggest problem for me was also a completely subjective one: that the art style didn't fit the content--it was way too colorful for how often the writing explored gray areas. I could understand if this was intentional, but it sometimes felt like watching Papa Smurf support relative morality. The more objective issues were the annoying loot system (they had to give away good stuff at the start of the game via DLC to make up for it) and the massive volume of filler quests. In theory, these solutions should work: (1) don't micromanage your gear; (2) ignore inconvenient side quests. Of course, I can't quite get the knack of either of them.  Overall, the game is a steal in terms of $/hr. It's like going to an estate sale and buying a plaid recliner for peanuts to fix up, and then finding out it's got a built-in massager no one noticed till they tried to lift it to your car.
3417	1	a	this jame is good
3419	1	a	Amazing graphics and a fast enough pace to keep you engaged but not fast enough to make you feel like it is going to just be a hack and slash.
3421	1	a	im addicted to this game it reminds my of my first time playing fable 3 :D
3423	1	a	Pros: Huge world, fun fighting mechanics, beautiful graphics and good story  Cons: At times repetitive
3425	1	a	Not as pretty as Skyim - But still pretty LOL Just as immersive but with better combat moves (Than Skyrim) Lore is very extensive as well  An absolute steal at the price  Suitable for Skyrim junkies like me -har
3427	1	a	Fantastic game i only wish there was a sequal, Always in my thoughts 38 Studios you guys could have been big and a major competitor to Bethesda game studios. Anyway back to the game beautiful cartoony graphics but not too cartoony,tons of side quests,fantastic gameplay, but what shines the most about this game is the combat its awesome especialy when you enter reckoning mode.You can also choose any race you can think of do you want to be a rougesage a battlemage battlerouge you can and lets not forget the huge open world its simply beautiful. Final thoughts this game is confident flashy and beautiful pick this game up if you want a solid alternative to TES4 Oblivion, great game solid 10/10 from me.
3429	1	a	Great game, 60 hours of fun playtime.
3431	1	a	'Do you reccomend this game?' there should be an inbetween button for games like this.  I'll start with the good points: -Your character has an interesting reason for being the protaganist of the game.  -Personally I love the combat, the choice of weapons and elements that come with it. -Dynamic locations. -The destiny options are pretty cool. -Wide range of skills and abilities to level up -Can play for hours. -The locations/magic/abilities/weapons are beautiful.  Then there are the negatives:  -By the end of the main storyline I had no idea what was going on. -I became way too overpowered and combat got a little boring. -Boss Battles were hardly boss difficulty (far too easy). -The final boss was WAY too easy.  -Personally I thought the storyline was a little boring. -Relationships with NPCs were boring and almost non-existent.  Overall, I would have been a little annoyed at myself if I had purchased this at full price, luckily I didn't. I would reccomend this game to people who prefer an easy RPG game and little strategizing in battle. Currently I have played around 39 hours worth of the game and have completed the main storyline and both the DLC add-ons and a moderate amount of side quests and still have plenty of exploring, leveling up and other quests to do. This game is a hell of a lot of fun nonetheless but It really lacks an immersing storyline which I really love in RPGs.
3433	1	a	Great game! It is like God of War, Skyrim and WoW had a mutant baby. Overall game is like Skyrim, but in third person like God Of War, also has the same battle system as God of War, but has skills like WoW.
3435	1	a	Just look at the number of hours I've played....speaks for itself.
3437	1	a	Very well made game. I think it was released too close to Skyrim, so no one noticed it. Feels like Fable, but much better.
3439	1	a	Kind of has that fable feel to it
3441	1	a	Love fantasy mmos but hate playing them with other people...well this is the game for you then hours of great gameplay and go here then go over there quests and yet somehow it never seems to get old . 
3443	1	a	I was honestly surprised how much i enjoyed this game. It's basically a more open Fable 1.
3445	1	a	This game is amazing. It at first may remind you of skyrim. It was a competitor, and (in my opinion) surpassed skyrim in the following criteria: -World Color: The game world is colorful, vibrant, and lively. Skyrim tends to be dull and gray. -Combat: KOAR blows skyrim out of the water. Think God of War style combat. -Menus: The menu system in KOAR is clean, easy to navigate, and isnt terribly confusing. Anyone that's played Skyrim knows how poor its menu system is.  If you can find this game on sale, get it. It's worth the money, and it's a shame that tools for modification werent released for it.
3447	1	a	Very fun because you get to choose your own playstyle on the fly...even in the midst of combat
3449	1	a	A really good game, with a somewhat similar feeling to Fable 1. Features a simple but very nice character creation (Gender and race options included), with a levelling system which relies on skills rather than raw stat numbers, and allows you to go with the three regular play styles (Warrior, Rogue, Mage), mixing them up or just focusing on what you want.  Only downside is the game requires an EA account.
3451	1	a	It has an overall feeling of an mmo but with a better combat system.
3453	1	a	Solid rpg with a heap of content, good combat system would certainly advise rpg fans to give it a go!
3455	1	a	This game is really good! Highly recommend it. 10/10. Love the combat and the story line.
3457	1	a	great combat system with varities of weapons and skills to choose from. nice story too. my only problem after playing for 50hours++ of KoA(haven't finish) is that i kinda getting 'tired' of too many side quest. now i just feel like doing the faction and main quest to finish the game. 'side quest fatigue' syndrome i guess? :\  i still do recommend this game for open world rpg fans out there though...
3459	1	a	Only been playing afew hours, but I played the demo quite a bit, but to be honest I didn't know they actually released the game. Looking forward to this game.
3461	1	a	This game has the best combat system I have ever seen. I'm not just saying that. I've given this some thought and I can't think of a game where combat is more fun. There's something very satisfying about finishing that boss with a massive, glowing, magic weapon. WHile the visuals aren't absolutely breathtaking, they are fairly pretty, in a Torchlight kind of way, and give a nice break from the dark realism of RPGs like Skyrim and Dark Souls.  9/10
3463	1	a	Such a great game! Super Huge map
3465	1	a	This game is huge and every side mission is like a different game with pretty environents. I didn't play Witcher 3 yet, but this game beats Witcher 1 &amp; 2 and Skyrim. AWESOME. 3D is amazingly beautiful with a Mod fix.  I totally reommend it.
3467	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME!!! SKYRIM + FABLE + MASS EFFECT = NERDGASM
3469	1	a	Graphics: Amalur has a very vivid, cartoonish style that looks quite nice and suits the story well. It's nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad either. Think along the lines of WoW rather than single-player RPGs.  Story: Everything in Amalur is bound by destiny except you, and that gives you unique powers. A very interesting concept is how fate is a real, tangible substance that you can manipulate to great effect against your foes. Despite this control of fate, you really have no options on changing the story, which is slightly dissapointing. The concept for the story starts to grow a little old by the end and I never really ended up caring about the main characters, much less the ones in side quests. Despite this, the narrative wasn't particularly bad, and I enjoyed it for what it's worth.  Gameplay: A blend of The Witcher 2 and an MMO, where you can cut and shoot and dodge your enemies, but they only aggro at a certain distance and the difficulty is almost entirely level based. It's actually a lot of fun to go slashing up your enemies (I preferred a two-handed sword), and the combat really kept me wanting to go back to this game. If you decide to complete as many side-quests as I did, however, you'll lend up being rather over-leveled for the end boss fight, making it much less epic.  Conclusion: A very good game with a lot of content. I picked it up on sale and i'd highly recommend you do the same.
539	0	a	Everything about this game is just pretty bland, I stopped paying attention to the plot after a half hour, which is really sad for an RPG. itemization is poor, I spent 7 of the 10 hours played using the same weapon, which was a 'green' quality weapon which for some reason was better than some blue or purple weapons I found. The music was forgettable, as were the characters that I ran into, the world, and the writting/dialouge.   The combat isn't bad, but it lacks a lot of options you would normally expect to find in games like this. You have a melee/range attack button and a magic attack button and that's about it, melee combos act the same nearly every time with the same weapon and in the first 10 hours there were 3 attack spells, 1 of which was worth using. There are some other melee abilities if you invest in them, but they never appeared to be any better than just using a normal 3 hit standard melee combo.   This is essentially a single player MMO, with a more active combat system but without a lot of the things you expect from MMOs, but at least there's a lot of quests and a bit of grinding, so if you're into that, this game will give you some good play time but otherwise I can't recommend this.
3471	1	a	More of a casual RPG that has pretty decent story and not a bad leveling system. This game was originally supposed to be an MMO but was modified part way through the development process into a single player game (and it shows from level design and region/zone layout and parsing, to combat, to the inventory system, and so on). Overall an ok RPG that leaves you with a somewhat positive experience (not as bland or trope heavy as Dragon Age but no where near any of the Elder Scroll games).
3473	1	a	A tremendously fun game. It's priority is enjoyment. Some games give you dead spots or areas to attempt to get through so you can get to the good part. This is not that kind of game. The combat is responsive and quick. The adventures are of every type but not repetitive. If it does become repetitive for you just switch your character to try a new build or new class. It is worth the money and would have been worth the release full price but I didn't discover it til the latest steam sale. It is the best of all the great RPGs I have played. Probably the best realization of the paper and pen originals.
3475	1	a	Having tons of fun switching between weapon styles and the fast combat. Reminds me of Fable and WoW mixed?
3477	1	a	After the headache of installing and reinstalling the game just go get it to work, I can say that I'm glad I did.  I have put countless hours into this game and there is still hours and hours to go. I would describe it as singe-player WoW/Fable hack-and-slash hybrid. The story is interesting (if not confusing at times) and the ability to customize and recustomize your character allows for a lot of variety in the gameplay. The skill trees provide unique experiences depending on which path you take, the weapons and armor are varied from one to the next, and all in all you can truly play this game in whatever way you prefer. And then if you change your mind, you can change your character around and try it in a new way.  I really can't say enough positive stuff about this game. It has been endlessly entertaining so far.
3479	1	a	I am a little disappointed in this, not because the game was bad but because there won't be more. With just a few tweaks like removing the amount of running and more varied quests, this game could've rivaled The Elder Scrolls series. For what I paid during the steam sale it was well worth the purchase price. I haven't started the DLC quests yet but I just finished the main story and although it was a pretty generic story I still enjoyed it. The world that was created was really deep so I felt the story could've played more on some of the more intricate subjects. If you like controller enabled games this one is for you, the controller settings and the keyboard and mouse were both good (although on controller you have less spell hotkeys).  8/10, pick it up during a summer sale!
3481	1	a	A great RPG game that reminds me alot of World of warcraft!   Would really recommend this game to all RPG-lovers out there!
3483	1	a	An amazing and fast-paced combat system, holds together an otherwise mediocre story, and the fun easily manages to shine through.  The customization offered in being able to pick and choose what style of play you will pursue is absolutely thrilling. One of the best games I've seen when it comes to approaching hybrid character builds. As in, you can start the game as a rogue, then about 10 hours in, realize that there are some really badass spells. Next thing you know, you're an Arcanist (Mage / Rogue combo) and you've never had so much fun backstabbing one foe, only to teleport into a group and EXPLODE WITH FIRE!!!  It's a commendable and definite must-have western RPG, and whole-heartedly gets my seal of approval.
3485	1	a	A lesson on what action RPG's (and RPG's in general) should be.  A beautiful, enthralling world, that beckons you to explore it. A fun and balanced skill system and an incredibly fun crafting and resource system are just the tip of the iceberg.   The story is deep, and is given to you with just the right timing. The factions, the struggles among the different races and kinds of living beings, is just so intense and you get to play a huge and interesting part on it all. You are special, and the game makes sure that you know it and that you act accordingly, for good or bad. It lets you take part in your own fate, in a way I've only ever seen in Elder Scrolls games.  Anyway, if you love RPG's like I do, you should play this game. Period.
3487	1	a	well created. i have enjoyed it a lot so far &lt;3 all shuld try it 
3489	1	a	Very entertaining RPG. I got the 4 pack on sale and its def worth the money. I play with a 360 controller hooked up to my rig and love rolling around saving the world and such. Interesting storyline, fun gameplay, varrying levels of difficulty, flexibility in your character (might, finess, sorcery, or a combo of two or all three!)
3491	1	a	Very underrated game, definitely worth a buy.
3493	1	a	very fun game i enjoy there take on magic, heavy quest based game but you can free rome. main problem is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of spiders and my lady has severe arachnophobia, other then that i recomend this game very fun
3495	1	a	I went into this game with no expectations; its been in my library for quite a while, now, and I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it. The customization and character progression that KoA:R offers is near unrivaled in the industry currently, constantly giving a feeling of excitement when you level up. Then comes the combat: imagine the combat system of a generic MMO. That is also KoA:R.   On top of that, the quest lines make WoW look imaginative: expect a lot of 'kill X many guys,' or 'go into this area, and interact with this object on the ground. Sweet, now come back.' When either the combat or questing becomes interesting, the other is there to pull it down, and back to mediocrity it goes. Until you level up. Then it becomes exciting, until you get your next quest.  If there was a neutral recommendation, this game would get it from me. Too many kinks to pull me in as mod-friendly games have, and the MMO questing is fantastic for putting yourself to sleep.   I recommend getting it during a great sale, just to see what Big Huge Games offered to levelling up, and crafting.  
3497	1	a	Its a real shame that this game franchise and the studio went down the drain, as this was one of the best RPG's I've played in recent years and the only major problem with it is that since the studio that made it went bankrupt there are a fair amount of bugs and gliches (that quicksaving and loading normally fixes) that could have easily been rectified if there was a studio to rectify them (the permanent one are annoying but not game breaking - ie. objects that can't ever be taken out of your backpack taking up space and making finding stuff REALLY ANNOYING and time consuming). Another problem i have is the sheer length of it... I'm all for games that give you play time for your money, but with the DLC, doing a 100% run looks like it will take me around 120+ hours for all main and side quests + finding things like lorestones and around the 90 hour mark it starts to feel like a chore, especially since your probably at the max lvl and can wipe out most things in a few seconds...  But seriously, get the game - it's fun
3499	1	a	Underrated RPG. I played the demo and did not really care for it at first; yet when it was on sale for dirt cheap I decided to buy it and give it another shot. I am glad I did. This game is full of content. It is like playing a mmo without the other people (because of the amount od quest and that is without counting the DLC).
3501	1	a	An excellent game, kind of a fusion between Fable and Skyrim. The world itself is massive, and there's a nonlinear progression built into everything, from questing to character build.  Only issue seems to be a relatively low level cap, I've only cleared about a quarter of the game world and I'm about 10 levels from max.
3503	1	a	A joy to play, and one of the best 'offline' games to play.
3505	1	a	5.5/10 Not the best, but not the worst either.  Pros:  Really fancy graphic and animation. Fun and detailed combat animation. Cartoonish feeling might not appeal to everyone. Game could be fun for a couple of hours. Crafting. Beautiful music.  Cons: Unintuitive and boring story, feels like a mmorpg. Game engine/physics feels a bit outdated. Combat could feel repetitive. Hard to finish since the story is mediocre.  Summary:  Game gives a good first impression, feels like a Witcher/Fable mix. But it gets boring after a while. Worth $10 during sale just to kill time.
3507	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a rather slow paced RPG with an open world just waiting foro a brave soul to explore it! Though the combat system is rather strange, in my opinion, there's alot of different things to do and to find in this game - and the DLCs are good, too!  I've spent quite some time playing this game and still haven't finished the main storyline yet as I am too busy exploring jsut about everything.  If you're a fan of open world RPGs in third person perspective, you definitely should give Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning a shot, I don't think that you'd be disappointed with it.
3509	1	a	WHY THE F*** Arn't there any mods for this game?
3511	1	a	A good role play game.
3513	1	a	I played this on Playstation and it was soooo good I just had to get it on PC too!
3515	1	a	I've played this game on PS3, and all I have to say is that is an all-around great RPG. The story line is very immersive, the characters are unique and have a lot of story behind them, and the ability to choose whatever play style you want is the best. EA really hit the nail on the head with this one.
3517	1	a	Good game too much running
3519	1	a	Really nice RPG game, everyone should give it a try! :)
3521	1	a	Lots of fun to run around in and explore. Just wish there was some level of co-op.
3523	1	a	10/10 Love The Elder Scrolls franchise? Love the Fable franchise? You'll fall in love with this game! It's built with Fable-like graphics and overall feel of calming and atmospheric fantasy-based scenery with jokes included. This mixes with Skyrim's open-world and seemingly never-ending space and quests alike!   Fighting is Fable-like and uses two main hotkeys to interact with two special weapons. The greatest part of the weapons is the amount! You can use a scepter, or a sword, or even chakrans-and each set includes cool-looking moves as well. The background story is nice, and you can change your character as you go instead of commiting to just one type of hero. The dialogue is remnicent of Oblivion, but is skippable if you get bored easily. The add-ons are funny, and overall this game is not to be taken too seriously.   It's easy-going and relaxing, what more can I say?
3525	1	a	This is like...the best thing. You should get it.
3527	1	a	Cool game with nice controls for keyboard/mouse. Try it at harder difficulties and different playstiles.
3529	1	a	i lack the attention span to play this game
3531	1	a	I love this game! Very underrated rpg with excellent combat. Highly recommend.
3533	1	a	Now this is a fun game. A bit limited compared to an open world like Skyrim but these two can't be lobbed into the same category. Kingdoms does do a good job at blurring the lines and so you feel the play area is larger than it is. I've played this game a few times over, so it's worth having in your lib. Needs COOP though!
3535	1	a	Underated game. Not a must play or anything (Ex: skyrim). But it's a good rpg with its very unique style to it. 
3537	1	a	I'll keep it simple - solid game with lots to do, lovely world and nice combat system. Definitely worth it.
543	0	a	THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.
3539	1	a	Great single player rpg
3541	1	a	You can use the Chakrams, THEY ARE AEWSOME! (Why don't other games have these things?) A very nice game, sould've used more customization options.
3543	1	a	This game is an amazing RPG that not only gives you skill and spell choices, it gives you various weapon types. The amount of selection that you have is honestly a little overwhelming but still fantastic. It has tons of sidequests and an awesome main story! I highly recommend for anyone that is willing to kill some epic monsters and get awesome loot! Rate: 10/10
544	0	a	I picked up Kingdoms of Amalur with high hopes from the reviews and screenshots. It looked pretty and promised things like an open world, a well written interesting story, and dynamic combat. Sadly, it was bland and left me with a bad taste as it failed to deliver on many of those promises.   Impressions
3545	1	a	great graphics unique atmospere and a solid story the voice acting is very well done and the immersion is good too. its also easy to run, computers from 2010 up should run it perfect. i definently recommend this game if your new to steam and you don't have a lot of dough also if your a fan of the Fable Franchise, and especially if your a fan of fantasy RPGs swords and magic and all that. So if any of this applies to you buy it. i would give this game an 8.5/10. So have fun!!
3547	1	a	amazing game. you get far more in this game than other games in the same price range. I highly reccommend rpg fans to take this game and it's DLC for a spin. not only can you choose from four races for your hero to be, you can also choose gender and even do some pretty in-depth customization. and for those who enjoy crafting their own stuff, you are going to drool over how indepth the crafting system is. Now why are you still reading this and not playing the game?
3549	1	a	Great game, i am happy that master Salvatore helped to make this game, you can do anything to everything and make your own story, you can be hero you can be the villain or just be yourself, it is in your hand
3551	1	a	Fantastic game. Feels like a Fable game, from a time set before Fable with a great story, graphics, and gameplay. Definitely recomend to anyone who is looking for a good game to play in their down time!
3553	1	a	I just got 100% of the achievements in this game. I'll be completely honest, the game itself RHEALLY likes to drag itself on, and on, and on, and on. The story progresses about as fast as an MMO. Which is not too surprising seen as it was first developed as an MMO. Alledgedly ( and kinda jokingly ) the people developing KoA got scared when they saw the half digested corpse of many-a-many MMO's lying in front of the cavern called 'World of Warcraft'. As such The caracters are non memorable to me in the slightest, then again I had the same problem when I was playing Skyrim, so I am not sure how they could have done this well in the first place. Sadly, the main story is somewhat of a joke and you are actually off way better digesting or reading a good book.  Sadly, there is not much in the way of challenge either, you have to make your own challenge I am afraid ( while still keeping it within boundaries of 'achieveable' ( phun intended ) ) Play this game on the hardest difficulty, and whenever you think you are dying too much go invest in some new clothes and/or weapons. I went though almost the entire game in a yellow armour set I think I got from the warsworn campaign, mirrorknives with a lvl requirement of lvl 9, and a set of chakrams. That is, untill I ran up till one of the last bosses and found myself running back to a forge ( I have been hoarding weapon materials like a true hoarder ) made myself some better armour and a shield that could actually block his magic attacks. and... well I pretty much wasted him, also because on the way back I seemed to have picked up some allies which actively fought with me against this big ♥♥♥♥ of a boss. ( did I mention that this boss kept sending waves upon waves of normal foes at me if I took away 15% of his health when I was soloing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ? I did not have much of a hassle with those extra adds when I was not alone on the field, go figure )  'So, what was your reason to play this thing then ?' I wanted to see if I could, simple as that. I got the game a while back and I decided to go actually play something start to finish ( including achievements if possible ), I made a list, and asked a random number generator to tell me which game I should play.  Needless to say, I won :)  Do I recommend this game ? yes, with a big pulsing asterix. That is, if you can actually stand free to play games and do not mind that they do not have a true ending, I would go play that thing. ( I heard Wildstar will be free to play soon enough, I can recommend that I guess, but I am a sucker for space-themed-fantasy )
3555	1	a	
547	0	a	.
3557	1	a	it whos feited to be
3559	1	a	Game has stood the test of time fairly well,, I like the elemnents of fate that the game brings to the table, however the character customization into skills and such falls fairly short in context to the size of the areas that you will explore for fun and, in conjuction with your reckoning mode that gives double exo for kills, you will find yourself vastly overleveled for each areas 'Fae' or wild creatures to destroy and this will make you push ahead to the areas that you are leveled to be in, thus missing some quests here and there, or missing a twist of fate.  This game is like fable, in that you can basically walk around very early in the game and kill basically everything at your level with ease, even on hard mode. The enemies themselves have these mechanics, like some will take more damage from back attacks or an elementally charged attack that they are specifically weak to, however you will find yourself not even using these strategies and instead just blasting through them with whatever you have, which will probably be more than easy enough to do; in conjection with the depth of the character leveling system, this game just falls short of a great experience, but is still worth playing!  Buying this game for $4 was probably one of the best buys that ive made on steam to date and not everyone will like this game, but for $4 everyone shoulld own it. 
3561	1	a	Solo World of Warcraft with less grinding and better graphics, highly recommended if you don't want pubbies ruining your solo MMO experience.
3563	1	a	PROS -Massive amount of content. -Beautiful world. -Fun crafting system. -Smooth, satisfying combat. -Extreme flexibility with classes and skills, including the ability to rewrite your entire build at any point in the entire game.  CONS -I leveled way too fast. I know I could have upped the difficulty to balance the effect of that on combat, but I spent far too much of the game wishing I had more improvements to make to my equipment. It capped out too early. -Repetitive monsters, you fight the same 15 things throughout the entire game. -Monotonous voice acting - everyone sounds the same, especially the Fae. -Never developed any kind of emotional attachment to my character, or any of the characters in the world around me, to the point of having little symathy for those who died. That's very rare for me. -Very linear.   It's certainly worth the buy, especially on sale, but in the end it was not a riveting, lifechanging game. Just fun for a long time. I'd buy it again!
3565	1	a	In short, a mix of Skyrim (open world RPG) and Diablo (Hack'n Slash), with some inspiration from God of War (combat action) ; very well and cleverly done!  I was expecting it to be only average from the trailers, and I stuck 75 hours on it (without DLC). It is just a perfect mix, and you can feel that the team tought about a lot of details; a lot of energy has been put into this game.  A bit easy thought, even on 'hard'. You might want to avoid the crafting skills too for more challenge.   A co-op mode would have been awesome, but does not exist.
3567	1	a	A very underappreciated game, fun story and the DLC's are actually worth it.
3569	1	a	Pretty good game. Nice gameplay. The story is not that good, though.
3571	1	a	Well done Action RPG. Great story written by one of the best fantasy writers ever, R.A.Salvatore. If you enjoy a good combat and fun RPGs then this game is well worth the price of admission.
3573	1	a	Really fun and interactive combat system as well as great exploration elements and DLC.
3575	1	a	A great action adventure role-playing game with a vast open world to explore and many quests to complete. Plenty of skill trees to try out and crafting to do, from potions to blacksmithing to enchantment. Suffers from clunky interface and at times it can feel grindy. All the characters are however, well voice acted and can bring a lot of life to the game. Finally, all cutscenes (and dialogue) are skippable. So yay to that. Worth purchasing during the sale, at $10 for base + all DLC.  Perhaps the greatest cons that are holding this game back in my opinion, is the very clunky interface when it comes to inventory and quest management. Instead of pressing, say, 'I' to open up an inventory screen, you have to press ESC to go to the menu and access your inventory from there. You can also only track one quest at a time, and can only view other quests on your local map provided that you're in the correct zone (this took a bit to figure out, but once it was figured out the single-quest tracking no longer posed a problem). Any other quests outside of your zone will not show up on your minimap. The game also has lots of loading screens, though they are rarely more than 10 seconds each, split between instances and interior / exterior transitions.   The game's combat can be very fun, a hack and slash sort of feel, with contextual 'moves' to use (i.e. pausing just before a second attack and you will launch enemies into the air) and the variety of skills to invest into can really mix up the gameplay. There's also a fate meter, which is essentially an execution bar where you go into a rage and deal extra damage whilst everything around you moves in slow motion, then you can execute enemies which kills all 'knocked down' enemies around you, whilst granting you bonus XP. You have your wizard, rogue and warrior skill tree. You have two weapon slots to quickly switch between as well as a 1-9 spell slot (casted by right clicking). The control might feel a bit console-like at first, but it's no where near as bad of a port as some other games have been (i.e. dark souls). Simply put, very playable. The graphics also look aesthetically pleasing, no real complaints.  There's a lack of 'open world' things to do beyond questing and hunting mobs, though there is more than enough dialogue to fill in each city / town / hub as well as letters and books to collect.  A revamped interface (as in, an actual in-game UI inventory screen, quest tracker and similar, would be significantly more palatable than its current clunky interface) and the addition of a few mounts could really improve this game.  Probably an 8/10. Definitely should pick this up during the sale (currently at 10$ for base game + all the DLC, which are worth the money).
3577	1	a	The most underrated and hidden game from the gaming community I have ever seen and played. Apart from the limitation in charcter texture and the enemy level scalability issue, the game is very vivid, combat is absolutely fluid and rewarding, scenes and graphics are stunning and soothing, and hundreds and hundreds of quests. You also can kill chicken with no remours.
3579	1	a	This is a really great game. Of my 16 hours playing this game, I have probably only done 2 of the main quests, because of the fact that there are so many fun side quests and side story lines to do. That includes the time I spent to beat the DLC, which I would say is worth the money spent on them.  The game allows you to chose your fate as you go. You earn skill points, which you can put into Might, Finesse, or Sorcery. After putting a certain amount of skill points into those skill trees, you unlock fate cards, which grant you bonus perks that will help you with the skills you unlocked in the Might, FInesse, or Sorcery skill tree. The best thing is that they have 6 fate cards for each skill tree, that you unlock as you put more skill points into your respective tree, but you don't have to only put your points into one tree. They also have 6 fate cards for each of the hybrid classes: Might/Finesse, Might/Sorcery, and Sorcery/Finesse.  For certain quests, you will also obtain Twists of Fate, which grant you permanent bonuses which could include extra XP, more health, more physical damage, etc. As you progress through the game, you get more of these, which all stack, so you become more and more powerful as you do quests.  The actual gameplay is great as well. It is a Hack 'n Slash sort of game where you can string together different combos that you unlock from the skill trees. It is also a Button Masher, but I like that about games, so no complaints from me.   The Story is interesting so far, but from what I said, I haven't played too much of the main story, just because of the sheer vastness of the side quests. I mentioned that I played the DLC, but there are so many other side quests and factions excluding the DLC. The game allows you to venture off as soon as you finish the tutorial area, and you are free to explore and do any side quests you want before playing the story.  The graphics are pretty good, but not amazing, and the voice syncing is kinda iffy, but the voice acting itself is really great.   The game is also somewhat easy to play, so I would suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty in order to have a decent challenge.  Overall, I would rate this game a 8.5/10, a must get for any RPG and Hack 'n Slash fan alike.
3581	1	a	yes awesome game but sometimes boring
3583	1	a	Enjoyed this game and the RPG aspects. Could ahve been better but still recommending it.
3585	1	a	Just like any RPG games out there. Character development, equipments, quests, dungeons, and other RPG stuffs. But there is one thing that this game excels at, the combat. The combos are great, flexible, and pretty easy to land compared to, well, skyrim and the witcher at least. The control is so responsive too. I mean, you can just break a combo and dodge to dodge enemies incoming attacks.  The ability tree and char type are not much different from other RPG. Might/Strength, Finesse/Agility, and Sorcery/Intellegence.  For the equipment, it's very similar to Skyrim. you can buy/sell, loot, craft, and add gems. and yes, there's a skill that affects one's crafting capability and result.  The storyline is actually good, but the side quests are a bit repetitive and might be boring when travel such big open world. well, there are tricks though to lessen the boredom by abusing dungeons dynamic enemy level.  overall, this game is very good. I highly recommend this. Skyrim RPG and open world style and Darksiders combat style, why not?
3587	1	a	A quick message to say I spend time on this game. I did not finish it, I take time to explore, try all the game mechanichs...  For now, I can say:  Pros: ====  * Good game mechanics  * Interesting story  * Great NPCs (some are a bit lame, thought)  * Looting...  * Crafting...  * ... -&gt; Great RPG  Cons: ====  * Walking...  * Some uninteresting quests  * Not so much cons...  If you like RPGs, open worlds, this game can make you happy :)
3589	1	a	Let me start off by saying that the game time associated with my steam account is no where near how long, and how many times I've played this game. Originally fell in love with the videos upon its release, and I'll openly admit it, that I torrented it at first 'to check it out', like many of my kind will say. I fell in love. I don't think a day passed that I went out and bought this on the Xbox 360 and finished it on that. I later sold my console and had an itch for the game and purchased it on origin (ugh, right?). Then I purchased it once again on Steam, and here we are now. With that long back story having been said, now for the review.  The games environment is many things: Beautiful, yet dark. Peaceful, yet dangerous. Seemingly vibrant world citizens, yet quite solitary.  Graphically, the game is done quite spot on. I have absolutely no complaints in that department as I enjoyed every single second of spending time in the world that the devs have created. The camera angle though was a little bit annoying but you get used to it after some time and you learn how to manipulate it to your advantage.  In terms of gameplay, the fighting is phenomenal. Think Darksiders meets Fable (right!?). The difficulty of the game seems to be an issue for some, but I downloaded the Heartcore mod, which basically amps up the difficulty to your preferred setting, completely for free. Once I did that, made the game more enjoyable, especially when killing big bad trolls.  The replay value of the game, from someone whos definitely gotten his money's worth time and again, is outstanding. There's just so much to do in terms of side quests and side stories that just extended the life of the game so much for me personally. On top of that, the 2 DLC's also add story aspects, which are accompanied by sweet lootz at completion, aside from the shiny lootz 'Weapons &amp; Armor Bundle' DLC you can also purchase.  I guarantee you that for the current sale price of the game ($5) you cannot go wrong with this game.  Overall, would give this a 9/10 and would gladly recommend it to my friends.
3591	1	a	I got decent play time out of it for the money I spent. Was not so invested that I finished it but may come back to it one day. Combat can get stale pretty quick but the unique enemies and weapons help.
3593	1	a	Absolutely loving the game, bought it with all the DLC and it is just so vast with so much to do, you can find yourself getting lost for hours just doing side questes or even wandering around aimlessly but having fun doing it.  Character creation and skilling is great you can craft your character how you like picking and choosing skills as you need them, or want them.  Despite coming from EA this is a great game.
3595	1	a	This game is EPIC! It is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL!!!! There are tons of ways characters can be customized and re-customized and specially crafted! I highly recommend this game, and it has a VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUE!!!  The only draw back of this game is the constant respawning of enemies (I tend to just run past the lower level ones when trying to get to a destination), and there is so much to do and so many abilities, the game may seem overwhelming at first.  Overall, I would give this game a very definite 9.5/10.
3597	1	a	This game world is HUGE! I can see why EA wanted to make this an MMORPG as it would have been a helluva mmo for sure. So this game was basically a cancelled MMO turned into a singleplayer release and you can really tell. The world just has that mmo feel. This is by no means a bad thing and many of the quests in the game represents that mmo feel.   Anywho the game itself is hella solid. Combat is great no matter what class you play, and the missions are basically infinite. Don't be suprised when you check your game time and see that you put hundreds of hours into this because I bet that will be the case. I've put maybe 30 hours into this game already but it feels like I've just started (and I think that's true, Feels like I just scratched the surface of the main plot in the game as all the sidequests have kept me busy). Lots of customization in terms of equipment and skill trees so you play the way you want to play. This is for sure a gem of a game that EA has put out. Even if it is a one-of for the series it manages to stand on its own as a great action rpg.  Definitely get it if it's on a sale, and if you miss one then you suck :[
3599	1	a	Love this game. It was cheap (75% off), and keeps me intrigued. It is like a mixture of fable/skyrim. I find myself wanting to play multiple characters, as there are so many fun-looking options. The fight style is great, and I really enjoy the cutscenes. I highly recommend it to any RPG lover.
3601	1	a	If you like RPGs then get this game, the story is fairly good with a lot of lore.   I have sank 66 hours into this game doing 172 quests with over 42 still to do. Plus about 17 endless tasks. I can't recall a point where I felt bored or like I was grinding (I HATE GRINDING IN RPGs) at any point which is amazing. The game play is nice (other than you can only jump at curtain points!) combat looks great. You can do flashy combos very early on and it's not just down to one button attack ether. Changing type warrior, mage, rogue is quick and easy you can multi class to without being punished too.  Difficulty wise it is not that hard even on hard if you like your RPGs. Sometimes it punishes if you try and advance too quickly but hey a level 6 shouldn't play with trolls right?  The main problem with the game is the world map not showing you all the quest locations only the one you are tracking which can lead to a bit of back tracking but it's not game breaking, just annoying. But given some games problems it's not that bad.  I would give this game a solid 8/10 (if they fixed the map a 9/10)  Like RPGs? Get this game. Want to clock some hours in a good game? Get this game. It's on sale get this game.  
3603	1	a	Hack and Slash! Slash and Hack! Slash, Slash, and Slash! Magic Spell, Hack and Slash, Magic Spell. Push Shift to run to next city. Powerlevel and get OP. Realize you just got OP and stay OP throughout the entire game. Only die twice, and that is because you challenged the enemy who is invincible. Get gem, battle that dude again, Hack and Slash!  Fun game! Most of it is stolen content from other games. Story is lame. Voice acting is terrible. Lip-sync is equal to my grammer skills. There is one spell that you get, think Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. 'Get Over Here!'. Slash enemy, pull them back to you, butcher them! Best skill in the game, so much fun. High tier spells are OP and break the game. In 40 hours, I finished Main quest, Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, and some random house guild.   Replay, no. Recommend? Yes, if you don't pay full price. Don't pay more then $7.50 CDN.
3605	1	a	Good game. Some glitches but I enjoyed it anways.
3607	1	a	I love the stories, the additional quests and the fight. The voice also good. But somehow, I feel bored during the midgame untill the endgame and I can't figure it why. Oh don't get me wrong, this is a good game.
3609	1	a	Great game intense battles!
3611	1	a	I'm only 4 and the gameplay is incredibly satisfying. This game took the best parts of the diablo, WoW, and other RPG single players and added entirely new fighting mechanics and combos that are incredibly satisfying and make you feel like a beast. I've played a caster in every RPG I've ever played - this is the first one that makes me want to melee (and you can melee as a caster, and yes, it's actually viable and powerful!). Lots of single player fun, highly recommended.
3613	1	a	KoA is like a game somewhere between Oblivion and Skyrim, but with training wheels attached to it.  There's a lot of good to the game: The crafting system is a lot of fun, combat is very involved and requires you to know your enemies, and the sounds and visuals are also very pleasing when you actually take the time to stop and adjust your camera to something beyond the back of your character's head.  Of course, there's a lot left to be desired: exploration feels very boring and stunted because of the closed maps and lack of jumping. The storyline is bland and fairly unimaginative, and while it has a very 'World of Warcraft' MMO-style feel to it, the game feels very empty. Multiplayer, even a 4-person experience, would have made for a great addition to this game.
3615	1	a	Pretty good game. Seems like I am playing an MMORPG without the MMO part though. The story is good and the combat is satisfying. If anyone needs a game with a unique story and loveable characters to occupy their time, they need look no further.
3617	1	a	Ive barely scratched the surface (12hrs in and barely scratched the surface) but this game is incredible!  You like Skyrim (Elder Scrolls games)? You like Fable? You like Trines visual style?  YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME  Tons of quests, a ♥♥♥♥-off-MASSIVE world, so much to see and the lore is deep.  Grab a helmet and prepare to crossclass
3619	1	a	If you're looking for a neverending RPG game then you guys should try this.  Choose who you wanna be, define your own destiny, and customize your own character with a tons of equipment, use every abilities you've earned to kill many thuatas on your journey. This game is totally one of many games that'll make you won't leave your PC!
3621	1	a	Lots of fun, lots to do, lots of freedom. 'Nuff said.
3623	1	a	A solid game. It's a fun action rpg, and i'd certainly recommend it, especially considering it's often on sale. Not a fantastic game however, so don't go in with too high expetations.  - Story is nothing spectacular, some interesting stuff to be sure, but nothing special. It does stroke the player's ego quite a bit, what with all the 'Chosen One' Themes, the NPCs are consistently impressed with your perfomance.  - There's quite a lot to do, thought the side quests can get repetitive. Once i reached the level Cap i couldn't be bothered to do most of it, specially considering i could craft much better gear than any quest reward at that point.  - It's definitely not a difficult game, in late game i was able to stomp everything in Hard quite handly, and i'm only a mostly competent player at best. seriously thought, by the end of the game all but a single type of attack (piercing, i believe) did any damage to my character, he literally could not be hurt from almost anything, on Hard.
3625	1	a	Not a great storyline, but the gameplay was quite satisfying!
3627	1	a	If you are a fan of RPG/Action/Adventure type games, this one is an absolute must-have!  I might be overly biased, but this is the first game in years that I haven't been able to put down. Every aspect of this game, from the lore to visuals to voice acting is so carefully crafted, that you cannot help but lose yourself in it.  It is quite an experience...
3629	1	a	Kingdoms of amalur is a very fun game and defintiely worth checking out. It has highly customizable skill trees and MANY weapons throughout the game. The story felt like it dragged at times but beating the final boss made it all worth it. Overall I'd give this game an 8.3/10.
3631	1	a	Some people told me: this game is too childish. I don't think so... Don't let the design fool you! Huge amount of content, a lot of blood, interesting story and a good upgrade system packed into it. The combat system also makes me smile. I love the fight even in close and ranged combat with weapons or use of magic. Just give it a try...
3633	1	a	Hey.....hey...... ya like Spawn? What about Legend Of Drizzt's?  Well you might like this then.   First bought this game for my PS3 waaaaay back when. loved it! and well lost it. not the love, but the game...yea.  Anyway! This is a great game. all an all.   Graphics = Awesome Story = Awesome Gameplay = Awsome Camera = i hate it! ( Mainly when encountering more then one enemy)  I think the only other thing then that is the sprint buttuon is a bit too far away. But its not like you couldent fix that.  Other then that its great. dont have many complaints.   
3635	1	a	Plenty of things to do, and a very polished game, I haven't experienced a single bug
3637	1	a	Great story, great game. I like the ease of the multiclass system. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. there are only a few things I think could be improved: 1. Jumping... The character should be able to jump over or climb the smaller obstacles. Coming from similar games, it is hard to get used to not being able to jump 2. More classes. Although most of the classic RPG class attributes are there, there could be more customization. Should get more than 1 skill point and 3 ability points per level, or raise the level cap. Other than that, the game is very well designed and a load of fun.
3639	1	a	excellent game game of year 
3641	1	a	The game has a very good story. The combat system is also quite good it is fun to play troughout the whole game. However, there is the constant risk to overpower your character. Even on the hardest diffivulty level it becomes quite easy to play. Nevertheless, with a mod this negative site can be minimized. Fruthermore, the graphic is nice and the atmosphere of the game is good. I would recommed to play this game.
3643	1	a	underrated rpg that is worth trying. give it atleast some hours
3645	1	a	I love this game. I beat it on my PS3 with over 100 hours in and when I saw it on sale this summer with all the DLC I grabbed it. Do not overlook this game, good solid gameplay with a great story (even though the bad guy is voiced by Jim Cummings the voice of Pooh/Tigger, you just can't take him seriously xD). Behind Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy series, this is my favorite game of all time. I can't recommend it enough.
3647	1	a	Overal nice graphics and locations desing.For me too colorfull.Good voice acting,good combat system and combination of character class also skills,lots of weapons, armors and side quests.DLCs are pretty cool. Here comes somethink about story ....... nothing special or maybe its beacause of so long long and repetitive gameplay, that you will lost point even its just the good against evil.NO chance of changing something in story(truly just little).Camera is also strange sometimes get stuck or its to close or far.This game is for fans of WOW or Lineage,if youre looking for something really good i will choose Witcher or Masseffect series thats my favorites rpgs. 7/10
3649	1	a	In a nutshell I loved this game.  Notes: ~Fun game to just jump into. ~I found the 'wowesque' graphics to be a tad tired and offputting initally but I have found I apprecaite the style. ~Storyline is not super rich or alluring but again more like a cartoon its fun and you get to beat the bad guy.  I wholly reccomend anyone play this game. 
3651	1	a	Good game. Fun combat, fairly interesting story. There's a lot of random quests that I would expect from an MMO more than a single player RPG, like 'go fetch this' and 'go kill that', which don't actually have anything to do with the story.  Also, the game is WAY too easy, by the end of the game I was running around with 4-5 curses and wearing armor I used near the beginning of the game and still slaughtering most things in two hits - and that's on hard mode. I'd suggest playing just the storyline quests and the faction quests, the rest are kind of pointless and level you up too fast.  It was still worth the money to me because it kept me entertained for a weekend when I didn't have internet connection, lol.
3653	1	a	This is a game that deserves its ranking.
3655	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time.
3657	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is in many ways an offline version of World of Warcraft which i have been searching after for some time. I never really knew about the game and stumbled upon it when it was on sale. It is a stunning open world rpg where you can level up with the level cap being 40 and the options for your gamestyle and which type of character you like playing are really diverse and interesting. The main draw for me is the actual world that which is stunningly beautiful. A lot of my time is spent taking screenshots of the vast open landscapes and beautiful colours :P. The loot system in the game works really well too with lots of different armor and weapon types to farm which i am used to from my WoW days. Overall I was shocked at how good the game is and still like to go back to it from time to time for side quests etc which are highly recomended. An instant classic for any rpg fan 10/10.
3659	1	a	Game is amazing you can be mage rouge warrior best thing about this in my opinion that you can still use magic :DDDDD this games 60$ but its worth it trust me!
3661	1	a	I love this game! Its so unlike every other fantasy RPG I have played. Its combat has a very MMO feel, and the character creation is so good! The universe is unique, and the specializations are absalutley awesome! I also own this game for the xbox 360 and i have probably logged over 20 hours in it, and i havent even put a dent into the main story. If you love fantasy, a unique story, or beautiful scenery, this game is for you!
3663	1	a	1-10 (ten being the highest)  Story: 8/10 Graphics: 9/10 Combat: 9/10 Customization: 5/10 Difficulty: 3/10 Content: 5/10 -- Overall: 6/10  Completed the game and I will admit it was a fun adventure; however, there were many thing in the game that could have used improvements. Nonetheless, the game itself was outstanding. It's a love hate relationship.   What I really found impressive with the game was the storyline, the graphic, the combat, and the world. No questions asked, there was a lot of work and creativity that was put into this game to make it what it is. Big kudos the the developers. The combat was a lot of fun, if you're into hackn'slash games, then this game is for you. The combat is over the top, you feel like you're kicking ♥♥♥, and it's just a lot of fun to enter 'fate'.   Things that I had experienced that I thought needed improvement was the amount of repetition that the game had. After playing about 40 minutes into the game, you've pretty much experienced the entire game. The quests are all really similar and you're going to find yourself fighting the same monsters over and over. There really isn't a need for gold, other than buying health potions, curing yourself, and fixing your armor. The skills were meh at best. The only skills that I felt were useful: Stealth, and pick-pocketing for the loot. Crafting was OK, but you end up finding better armor in a random box, so it kind of felt pointless.    Overall, great game if you're into RPGs, just don't expect to get everything you want from an RPG. 
3665	1	a	Amazing. Everyone that disses EA because the games are incompleate, play this, and apologize. The only technical issue i found was while playing this on Xbox, and the game would not start after downloading a DLC. I would rate this game 95/100.
3667	1	a	This one of the best RPG i have played in a long time. Personally i like the story line and it kept me hooked. You will spend a lot of time in your inventory deciding which piece of armor is a fraction of a present better then the one you already have but that's pretty much every RPG. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of RPG or fantasy games
3669	1	a	Anyone looking for an easy action RPG, this is my recommendation. It's very long and there are plenty of side missions to keep you entertained for months. Crafting mechanics is one of the best I have experienced, including plenty of games (Skyrim/Dragon Age/Mass Effect etc). Combat is also great. The reason it's not well known or underrated, due to it's unfortunate release time (just when Skyrim appeared) and the developers declared bankruptcy after this game.
3671	1	a	Really, really fun game in general, though it's a bit short for an open world rpg. I have logged about fifty hours into it now and finished the main questline, plus two side quest lines and all the DLC. That being said, aside from some slightly wonky camera work and a not always perfectly responsive combat system, I would highly reccomend this game for a casual enjoyer of RPGs. 
3673	1	a	This game is addicting if you like RPGs. Very fun, though a little bit slow at first. The story and the DLC's will suck you in fast, though, and is definitely worth a play.
552	0	a	Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.
3675	1	a	For all the drama on the studio and poor business decisions, this is a damn great game. It probably would have been a gigantic hit if it had not come out around the same time as Skyrim, which raised the bar exponentially for what an action-rpg should be. But that doesn't mean it's not a great game in it's own regard; it just had the misfortune of coming out and being instantly last-gen. I still like the combat system better in Reckoning, but to be honest, I wish Skyrim had Reckoning combat more than Reckoning had the Skyrim lore/world/graphics.
3677	1	a	A great fun RPG. There is a ton of content and area to explore.
3679	1	a	This is Skyrim, Arcade Edition.  (Note my playtime says 1.3 Hours, its actually closer to 40 - been playing Offline for a large part.)
3681	1	a	good, exoansive world with lots to explore and loot galore! Still gets old after a while.....I put it down before finishing the main quest.....
3683	1	a	Wonderful RPG, the quests are fun, the lore is built upon the classic RPG type and yet feels new,the controls are pleasant and the graphics are eye catching and eye oddly old school. The music score/environmental is phenomenal. I highly recommend this especially if it goes on sale with all the DLC. It has that memorable charm that will be with you like a good cozy book. My only grief is repetative voice actors, but even they are fun to hear. 9.5/10
3685	1	a	hi   done about 20 hrs now on this game and really loving it lots of stuff to find and monsters to slap   and moces to learn really good
3687	1	a	This is one of the best RPG/Open world Hybrids I ever played. This game makes me wish more games like this existed. It has very sastisfying controls/battle system. It really feels like you are your own character, by the choices you make. Yes, I know the company went under, and there are still bugs, but hell give this game a try if you like Skyrim and the like.
3689	1	a	This game is seriously lacking in climbing gear.
3691	1	a	If fable and skyrim had a baby, this would be it. I find myslef doing every sidequest not because of the xp, but because the dialouge is so engaging and tthe story is so well writen that i cant help myself. A must have game!
3693	1	a	This is easily one of my favourite games. I know I haven't played it much (36 hours at the time I write this) but this is no doubt an extremely fun and replayable game.  The variety of weapon types is excellent and they feel like they have their own unique roll but once you get to the mid-late game stages there are some very cool weapons to be bought and found. The unique/legendary weapons are very powerful but they also feel balanced at the same time and there is a beginner pack that gives new players to the game some good early game gear w/o being too powerful.  The DLC is definately worth buying, you can play them at any time in the game and they have a great storyline. Overall each DLC lasts around 4-6 hours of gametime but that didn't stop me from buying them. The DLC's also add new gear and weapons that aren't too overpowered and they are good for leveling your character if you can't find any side quests to do.  The main storyline is also very well made and probably one of the best in video games. However, there is 1 area where I could just skip a part (I don't think this was a main quest) where all I needed to do was hit a wall a couple times with chakrams and it would open.  The combat is also a very fun aspect of the game with the so called 'destiny' aka class. You can be strictly a warrior, archer/assassin or a mage or you can mix it up a bit for some more fun or you can put all 3 trees together to become a Jack of All Trades. The camera can be a bit annoying at times in combat but I can cope with it.
3695	1	a	This game helped to weaken the state of Rhode Island
3697	1	a	A fantastic RPG that has good gameplay, decent story, and great leveling and item implementations.
3699	1	a	It's quite like the legendary Skyrim, but unique in its own ways.
3701	1	a	Great game but ♥♥♥♥ EA Games, yes, but ♥♥♥♥
3703	1	a	If you want a singleplayer MMO-like expirience with some interesting combat mechanics thrown in, then this game is for you, there's really not much more to say really. Personally, I really like it.
3705	1	a	A massive game if like me you do all the side quests, and the skills trees give you lots of choice to make your perfect avatar. Recommended!!!!
3707	1	a	Awesome quick successive AI, gameplay &amp; creatively designed environment. Story is a bit lack on depth.
3709	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing you should get it if its on sale and like rpgs
3711	1	a	best game I ever played with better story, content and it was co-created by RA Salvatore, who did the story, what isn't to like. the continent you are on is at least 5 times the size of skyrim and has more interesting gameplay  30.7356t8391977646158746382832651236541934591436814 out of 1.12345678900987654321  but that is an estimate : )  defininetly worth every penny, and then some 
3713	1	a	While not without it's flaws, KoA is a massive game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. The gameplay is unlike anything I've ever seen in an RPG, the customization options are endless and the story is entertaining. The DLC (especially Teeth of Naros) is definately worth it too. It's a shame there will not be any patches for this game, while it could use some. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience too much.  8.5/10.
3715	1	a	This is really big game 'big' means too many quests to finish, of course you can skip too. Some quests are just too boring to do. I gave up on the game half-way (since I think it is boring) But if you're fan of this RPG type then you should play, pretty useful to kill time
3717	1	a	Great game, good storyline, shame there's no chance of a sequel 10/10
3719	1	a	I enjoyed this game quite a bit the game play is a hack and slash the only problem is that its a very short game but its still a good game and if you have the time and money give it a shot you wont be disapointed.
3721	1	a	This is probably the only(?) good game EA has their name on.  Yes, I said it. EA has a game that doesnt have stupid microtransaction baits, terrible graphics that are 10 years behind everybody else or pay-to-win DLC.  Primarily, it is because the game is very, very easy. Not you-will-always-win easy, you are perfectly able to lose, but it does follow the somewhat shallow trend of 'click this button and you´re doing good!' type of gameplay. Don´t be afraid to start off the first playthrough on hard, especially if you are used to RPGs or even brawlers. If you´ve played any of the recent Batman games, this combat will feel somewhat home-y to you. The Might tree is your 'Warrior' playstyle, Finesse covers 'Rogue' and 'Ranger' and the third and final tree, Sorcery, handles all your Wizardry needs. And because the game is this easy (due somewhat to the fact that healing potions are plentiful, even solely from drops/vendors and have NO cooldown despite being full heals unless you´re using the first ones at endgame) any player who can handle themselves will gravitate towards the Finesse tree to don the armors that boost damage the most. Magic especially has little merit since it really is just a Finesse Bow playstyle without the critical hits. Not to say that you can´t don a shield and robe and play through this game as a tanky wizard; There´s a specialization for that!  In fact, there are specializations for pretty much ANY playstyle. Whether you want to go for a 'pure' playstyle of absolute wizardry, Teleport around in plate armor while firing lightning bolts or be a complete Jack of All Trades, the games Destiny card system will have bonuses that suit this playstyle. You can truly go into combat however you want and not feel like you're doing something the designers didn´t think of. (Unless you´re like me and just want the damn teleportation aspect without spending the points in Sorcery to get it ;~;)  That is probably also one of the selling points of this game, to start off with; The combat flow is GORGEOUS. Without a doubt, the spectacle of combat (At least dual-wield combat, from my playthroughs) and the flow between enemies is pretty much the same as in the Batman: Arkham [Word] games, only without the QTE prompts to avoid hits or change targets. Instead, abilities, dodge rolls or even teleportation lets you avoid big hits and zoom between enemies to perform more beautifully animated combos. You can feel the weight behind the heavier weapons, and the devs know exactly when to slow the game down and where to hold on a pose to get the most out of each hit. Even though you´ll be seeing the same exact hit combo throughout 95% of the game (the Main Story which I completed in 34 hours, with casual but active side questing in between) you won´t grow tired of seeing it.  As for the visual style, the game is best described as if World of Warcrafts art team had to design for Skyrim. You have large, beautiful world areas with lush forest, canyons with huge rock structures and shapes and wide open plains but still kept in a comic book-y, colorful palette that is almost like a childs imaginary world. The game is played in third person, but try and remember to turn the camera and look around, because it is indeed a beautiful game to immerse yourself into.  So, SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? I would definately say yes. I got it for €20, and for that price it is well worth the fun you´ll get from the base game alone. If you´re the type of person who likes to replay the game, but in a different way, the Destiny cards definately allow for tons of fun here.  Now, there´s also 2 DLC areas, the Legend of Dead Kel and the Teeth of Naros. I´ll quickly cover these two;  THE LEGEND OF DEAD KEL DLC: This DLC is very well suited for those who just finished the main quest line and want some more Kingdoms of Amalur, and get the best items. A big thing at the end of this DLC is that you gain very, very easy access to lots of Blacksmithing materials, which makes it a billion times easier to craft the best armor possible (Not needed in the slightest, but hey, if you want to catapult a giant across the map with a sneak attack, here´s the way forward!) once you complete the quests to own your own keep. The story takes you to Gallows End, an island ravaged by Dead Kel. You meet a small town of survivors who seem to pray to an otherwise unknown god, and through ship stealing and offerings for human possesion, you´ll uncover who this god is, why Dead Kel is angry at everyone on the island and just how owning a pet rat is actually quite a neat thing.  The DLC is feels relatively short in terms of the main story, but considering the €10 price tag and all the side content that you have to enjoy, I´d say it earns the price tag. It´s not needed (nor is any other DLC) to enjoy Kingdoms of Amalur, but if you have the spare euros and want an evening or two of fun, then you can safely purchase this one. It´s just as good as the rest of the game, and even introduces an interresting AOE mechanic from a new mob (even if it is just a reskinned enemy skeleton). I reccomend to download and play this after reaching the level cap at 40 (or, if you are short a few levels and don´t want to spend an hour or two farming mobs, 35+) for the best rewards for your effort.  There is only one problem, and that is that the final quest has a somewhat buggy NPC AI that doesn´t always go where you need(read NEED) it to go to end the last main quest. Look on the unofficial wiki for a couple of easy ways to fix your NPC pathfinding at the end. As long as you don´t save once you´re standing on the beach with no NPC in sight to talk to, you should be able to reload the earlier (quick)save and fix it right up. Don´t let this scare you, just be aware of it :)  THE TEETH OF NAROS: I feel this is really the one where EA might have shoved the content out without some proper QA. If you look this up on the unofficial wiki (AND YOU SHOULD!) you´ll realise there is a downright scary amount of bugs that can hardlock your character in this region. I reccomend saving outside the DLC area before and after going in (checking no bugs occoured of course) and only saving inside using F5 to quicksave and F9 to quickload. Look up every quest to be aware of potential bugs. As with the bug I just mentioned, they are avoidable with reloads, but there are so many you really want to look up what you´re doing.  The DLC feels a tad bit shorter than the Dead Kel DLC, but perhaps this is just because I rushed the main story for the reason I just mentioned above.  This area looks and feels very different from the rest of the game, with an obvious roman/greek influence. I feel the main selling point (besides some more KoA fun!) is the it offers the best core components for weapons in the game, better than the Prismere available otherwise. Perhaps best is that if you, like me, feel Prismere looks more like rock candy than deadly crystal, these components resemble the earlygame iron counterparts, but with better damage than prismere. If you´re sad that your OP weaponry looks horrid, this DLC fixes it!  Overall, if you don´t mind being careful with (quick)saves, it´s also worth another €10.  Oh, and as for the weapon pack, it´s not endgame related and NOT needed. Don´t waste money on it. You´ll get more fun out of throwing the bills out the window and watching the wind catch them as they fly away.
3723	1	a	A pretty good rpg game with dynamic combats, a bit repetitive about the npc's but not even close to obscure the good points of this title.
3725	1	a	Game for people who like to search for chests and defeat monsters on their great adventure through the Amalur!  I have played this game as a non-steam game and as a steam game so I have more than 400 hours of gameplay in total, I think. The game is a good game for people who like adventure games (such as Skyrim or GW2) and for people who just simply like to smash people (God Mode?).  Good: +Good graphics +Interesting story +Character backgrounds +Customizability of the character +Many weapons and different paths you can choose +Is a bit different on each time you play it  Bad: -Has a tendency to crash sometimes -The combos do not work properly sometimes
3727	1	a	A decent attempt at creating an RPG similar to Skyrim but comes off with a feel of being a failed RPG. There is no feeling in any of the characters, everything feels a bit stale in general and overly large for little reason. The combat is ok but varies wildly between too hard if you don't cheese and very easy if you do. So essentially an RPG for if you're desperate but really just go replay Skyrim. Trust me.
3729	1	a	This is one of my favorite RPGs out there, very few managed to replicate its customization, story and progression feeling between each level. There are 3 paths butt  ♥♥♥♥ing   each other to provide players fresh combination, atributes, and perks. Some set items available make the game more explorable. With proffesions, lorebooks and general enviroment placement, I'm surprised to find such polish on a single player game.\ Would definitely play this game once more....I am lying of course....since storywise, its very linear in its choices, but thatss not a bad thing. my only annoyance is all the walking i have to do in unnecesarily long hallways. Would pay for a hopping ballerina run animation DLC
3731	1	a	Fun to play, such huge playtime and gets never boring.
3733	1	a	Extremely good game, with good story and quite colourful. I felt emotionally touched and is definitly worth checking out!
3735	1	a	Huge game with a world that's overflowing with content.  I should really finish this some day, 60 hours in and I think I only got 3/4 of they way and that's only because I started skipping most of the sidequests. It's been so long I'll probably have to start over to make sense of it all.  It's a shame the company tanked so hard because this is a great game.
3737	1	a	A good action rpg game.
554	0	a	Unimaginative and often constricting gameplay got in the way of my interest in the world and the story. After a little over 20 hours of completionist-style play I felt like progress was a chore and just stopped playing. Plus the still-present minor technical issues didn't help either.  Full review here:  http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/09/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning.html 
3739	1	a	Ohhhh man this satisfied my RPG itch. I just got into the whole PC Gaming thing, and this was the first game I ended up playing because I got it on a crazy sale like last year. Money well god damn spent.  Rich lore, great character-building, awesome loot, and a super fun fantasy world. I'm sad we will never see another Kingdoms of Amalur but hey, it took me about 100 hours to complete this thing.  Only con was running into the level cap earlier than most players so I just powered through the rest of the main story since there was no real challenge anymore.
3741	1	a	It is mot very often that you find an Action RPG set in 3rd person that properly conveys the sense of combat and variety of moves, attacks and defenses of their isometric cousins. The game plays like a Tochlight or Diablo. It is also rare to find a game that fully utilizes your graphics potential. I have a crossfire setup and MSI afterburner shows me 96% GPU usage across both cards with both clock and memory frequency maxed. This game usually goes on sale during the summer and autumn sales. If you are a gamer and like Action RPGs do yourself a favour and pull the trigger.
3743	1	a	This game is long as hell. If you pick it up, play in bursts so you don't burn out on it.
3745	1	a	This is one of my favorite action RPG games of the last 20 years. If you're a fan of real-time combat systems and storylines that take longer than a weekend, then this is definitely worth a try.
555	0	a	I'd advice people not to buy this game. It's just not up to par at all with other RPGs.  It feels like everything's just a shell... I've played F2P MMO's with much more oomf to hitting things and doing things.  Games like these would REALLY need the combat to make you feel awesome, but here it feels kinda bland and superficial. Your hits don't feel like they're doing much. 
3747	1	a	I originally played this on the xbox when it came out, was a fun game, have moved to PC, and its still just as fun. IMO its a mix of fable and skyrim, leaning towards fable. With bright colors and details worked into every facet of the game its a fun time waster.
3749	1	a	I offer a tepid recommendation for this game. Pros: fun combat, involved crafting systems, epic OP meteor spell, beautiful environments Cons: awkward menus, cruddy inventory, questbreaking bugs, relatively shallow Mixed: lots of forgettable sidequests, several underwhelming guild questlines, stilted boss battles  The main quest is long and will take you across the world, which is disturbingly MMOish in it's linear zone-y design. The world and it's lore is present and interesting - if not the pinnacle of originality. Most of the DLC is pretty good and adds some new little areas. The weapon and armor bundle is garbage though, it adds a chest in the first town with several sets of magic armor and weapons that you will replace almost instantly with better equipment - which is a shame as the items do look much cooler than other early game equipment.  I don't think it's a gem as many people claim, but it does have some good fun gameplay. Building up a character and exploring the world is actually quite fun. But the experience gets bogged down with some poor design decisions as well as a few limitations which make it feel like a stunted port that didn't take full advantage of pc capabilities and controls.
3751	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I decided to get it as an alternative to Skyrim when that game started getting buggy. The end result :  Pros (better than skyrim): 1. an actual dynamic and engaging storyline written by Forgotten Realms writer R.A. Salvatore, 2. all conversations are fully voiced by incredible voice actors who actually sound like they're creating a film rather than a video game, 3. the graphics were created by Todd McFarlane creator of spawn, 4. the combat system is incredible allowing chain attacks involving 2 weapons and it is fast and fluid. 5. I've never had it crash: EVER 6. more dynamic and creative crafting system 7. non-mod-capable  Cons (skyrim did it better): 1. massive free-roam environment. 2. more dungeons, 3. more quests, 4. more factions (dark brotherhood!!), 5. more magic, 6. mod-capable  Final Judgement: EVEN   All in all, I feel that the pros overshadow the cons and that skyrim and KOA: Reckoning are both great games and I would recommend both of them personally, depending upon what aspects of gaming are more important to you. If I had to make a choice though, I would choose KOA which was finished upon its release over skyrim which was (once again) rushed into production and it shows.
3753	1	a	Amazing game, if I do say so myself. I rather like a lot of features this game has, a few of them being the voice acting, as well as the 'add to junk' and 'sell all from junk' features, which really makes dealing w/ spare and unused items quicker and easier.   As far as the plot goes, I think it has a really great story line; love some of the plot twists, as well as the lore. When playing the game, I almost want to reccommend doing the whole story before doing any of the faction/other quests, but that's just me. I was glad I only did the story quests first because even after I finished the game, I had more game to play! So glad It didn't have to end there.   I highly reccommend Kingdoms of Amalur, it really is an underappreciated game. Once I picked the controller up, the hours just flew right by because I had such a hard time putting the controller back down, haha
3755	1	a	This game is simply a must-have for the RPG fan. I don't normally get addicted to video games (I even stopped playing Arkham City after 10 hours) but I sank 40 hours into this game and played it through to the end without getting bored. That's saying something.  The combat is fun and interesting with some neat timing mechanics that subtract from atypical dodging without subtracting from the challenge. There are tons of quests to do in a huge, lush world. You can say that Elder Scrolls games are bigger, but Amalur has much more detail. There's also tons of quests to do, whether side or faction, and with fast traveling you'll chew through them quickly. Fortunately, the sheer number of them will keep you occupied for some time.  The graphics in Amalur are gorgeous. Not because it uses the latest and greatest tech (although it might have for 2012, who knows), but because the art direction and detail are not lacking at all. There's no such thing as a dull environment and there are loot caches and reagents scattered everywhere.  If there's anything to complain about, it's that the XBox One controller isn't compatible (sure it works but it causes massive frame drops for some unknown reason) and the camera isn't perfect, but in this genre it's really hard to get the camera right and at least it functions well enough here.  The music and dialogue are just okay, nothing really stands out, but at least it doesn't detract from the experience. And I never gave two hoots about the story and lore.  Bottom line: Amalur is a fast-paced adventure RPG with gorgeous graphics and fun combat. You can't do much better than that and it appeals to a wide variety of gamers. It also goes on sale about once a quarter, so look out for that.  Check out my full review here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI7qw0EVQA0 
3757	1	a	truly fascinating rpg\slasher. over 100 hours of total gameplay. and also the Chicken Overlords
3759	1	a	Best PC FPS around
3761	1	a	Love this game and everything about it!
3763	1	a	This game rock. If anyone wants to be my friend just add me to your list. ^_^
3765	1	a	So many options for character creation. Love it.
3767	1	a	Was Good but Graphic was not URLGH
3769	1	a	WoW on singeplayer
3771	1	a	If you’re looking for a solid action-RPG to play, Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning would be a great choice, but it’s not without its faults. My 89 hours at the point of this review are straight after completing the main storyline and the vast majority of the sidequests, but while I’ve enjoyed my time I won’t be going back to 100% or play the DLC any time soon.  The Good:  + Combat is sharp, responsive and entertaining. I played a rogue/mage hybrid, using a combination of either daggers or faeblades, with a bow and magic to support throughout. Once you get used to the combat style, you quickly learn a series of useful combos. I only played briefly with some of the other weapons, but they seemed ok as well. I was using the Xbox 360 controller for Windows that worked really well.  + The creators have put together an interesting world, with a few ideas that put it above the generic tropes it could have fallen into. Lore isn’t normally my sort of thing, but I felt more interested in the world than I do with similar games.   + Loads of content. My playthrough was a fairly swift run, despite doing most of the sidequests, and I think I could have padded this out with an extra 10 – 15 hours if I was a bit more thorough. Sidequests are largely solid with a minimal number of fetch quests. The House of Sorrows faction questline towards the end of the game was a particular highlight for me.  However, it felt like the content became sparser as you got closer to the end – with fewer sidequests per area. I remember spending ages in the first area, but got through the final continent in no time at all. Might just be me though.  + Loads of concepts. Blacksmithing, alchemy, two types of lockpicking, stealth, enchanting, hidden items, player housing, interesting collectables – the game feels like it has it all. Admittedly, each of the areas are fairly shallow, but they do help spice the game up.   + The game is fully voice acted with the exception of the protagonist. I know this has annoyed a few, but to me it felt like a conscious choice by the devs to help the player project onto their character. Real choices in dialogue are fairly minimal and the consequences irrelevant, but the voice acting is consistently high quality and there is loads of backstory in the dialogue if you’re looking for it.  + The graphical style holds a nice point between realistic and cartoony. The art is sharp and colourful throughout and works well.  + The game performed well on my mid-range PC, with no slowdown at 1080p. I’ve read that many people had lots of technical issues with the demo, but these seem to have been resolved for the end product. A couple of issues do creep in more towards the end of the game (getting stuck on scenery, interaction with some objects), but nothing gamebreaking at all.  + Lots and lots and lots of loot. Most of it is fairly useless, but the illusion of variety holds strong in the items you pick up.  The Bad:  - I’m a fairly average gamer, and found the difficulty far too easy after the first 10 hours. Once you find your playstyle and learn how the limited number of beasties attack, you will be in cruise control for the rest of the game. The only times where the difficulty was higher was against mages, where their attacks can be harder to dodge and they also back away from melee types. This is quickly sorted by the ‘fateshift’ mode, which offers from stylish killing blows but removes any real challenge.  The difficulty completely fell apart in the last 10 hours for me, as I made my own equipment (without playing the system) that ended with me being so overpowered I was one-shotting most of the regular enemies with my bow.   The final boss also failed to land a single hit on me.  There is an attempt to up the difficulty by making the ‘harder’ enemies more frequent on the second continent, but it’s too little, too late in my mind.  It’s worth noting that I was aware of the issues around difficulty before starting, and played through the full game on hard. I’d recommend that everyone does the same if they are a vaguely competent gamer. A fan made difficulty patch is around if you are looking for more challenge, but I haven’t tested it.   I seriously doubt I would have finished the game on a lower difficulty, there would have been no challenge at all.  - Content repeats itself far too often, and disappointingly the developers failed to offer up even reskins to give the impression of there being more enemy types. This extends to the dungeons as well, which are limited to a few themes with only the minority feeling unique. Given the size of the world, this becomes a big issue around the midpoint of the game – I had to take a break from playing for a solid week to avoid getting bored.  - Like almost all games of its ilk, money becomes completely pointless after the opening 20 hours. I finished with about 12 million gold, and this was with salvaging all of the equipment in the last 15 hours. For perspective, the biggest gold sink for me were trainers, who only cost 45k each at the highest level.  I rolled my eyes after a quest to collect a set of books across the world, spanning about 60 hours of game time, rewarded me with 800 gold on my return.  - The main storyline is a disappointment. While I said above I enjoyed the lore of the world, the main storyline was about as bland as it comes – amnesiac protagonist travelling across the world to face the big bad. Amnesia can be played well, but you learn nothing of your past until the final 10 minutes, where one of your companions gives you a load of exposition. A really lazy effort in storytelling.  The main quest also suffers badly from being too sparse. You end up doing a larger quest in the story, but then get sent a few areas across the map before you can progress it further. After doing all the sidequests along the way, I’d completely forgotten what was going on by the time I reached the next point – this being the only game I was playing at the time.  - The camera, especially in combat, is slightly odd and far too low angle. While you do get used to it, it is a shame there is no flexibility.  Conclusion:  Reading the above, it seems like I don’t like the game. Quite the opposite – I really enjoyed my time playing and do recommend it. I think the negative points above stem from the fact that the game is close to greatness, and with a bit more time and direction Big Huge Games could have made something really special. It’s disappointing to see that they went under after finishing the game – although something this large is a huge task, especially for a first game. I would have loved to have seen a sequel to solve its issues – the finale also set up nicely for the proposed MMO if it was successful.  Overall, this game gets a recommendation from me. If you’re looking for a fairly light action RPG, you could do a lot worse.  
3773	1	a	If i could sell my soul for this game agin...
556	0	a	This game had so much potential but there's something a bit off about it. I still can't point it out yet but it's a good RPG to waste 10 or 20 hours with but still I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros - Skill system is just pure AWESOME!  - Great crafting system - Combat is quite enjoyable  Cons - Voice acting. Try it and you'll see. Not bad and not good either. Maybe and just maybe this is the one that is really off in this game. - Story isn't really that interesting - Not immersive at all (I can literally kill a whole town and the next town wouldn't mind at all and tell you that's just one reason) - The monsters you'll be encountering are the same one except for the names from the start until the end of the game - Graphics (More of a personal taste)  I really just bought the game to show support on how this game could have been a ton better than it is now. I know the studio is gone and everything but We'll never know.
3775	1	a	BUY BUY BUY The child of Skyrim and Fable. You wont waste your money
3777	1	a	Fun, decent game, can play for quite a bit of time for entertainment.
3779	1	a	PvE RPG when its absolutely best! Could be described as a WoW/Skyrim style of game but kept more simple. The storyline's are well made and all quest giver's/quest npc's are in cinematic with voice and options to 'change' your fate as in doing bad or good things. Crime's,bribes,pursaidings,pickpocketing, own own house's,join different factions and quest while gaining ranks etc are just some of the few thing's you can and will do in this amazing game.Big map/areas and well designed! Get ready to for a timestealer in disquise! Ill update/cleanwrite when im reaching the point where i need to buy the expansion(s).
3781	1	a	Yep. After hundreds of hours playing this game I finally went legit and bought the game and all DLC's. I'm not proud of playing without paying but I really did enjoy this game so much. It has good graphics (for 2012 anyway), the combat system is nothing short of amazing and works really well, the story is interesting enough but the characters are forgettable (except Alyn Shir because DAT ♥♥♥).   8/10 game not bad
558	0	a	The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy ♥♥♥♥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.
3783	1	a	i love this game , one of my best game &lt;3
3785	1	a	This game is, simply put, incredible. There are a few flaws, yes, but everything else is so brilliantly done that you can quickly forget those.  Pros: Good graphics. Great character balancing. One of the rare games that if you want to make a mix between the various skill trees it lets you do it, and gives you unique bonuses as well. Good battle system. Haven't played much of fighter or mage, but the rogue's combat abilities are very good, and the combo system is easy to use. Great story. Hard to give any example without spoiling anything. Factions. There are a lot of factions, each with its own main plot and side quests. Crime system. The crime system is very similar to what Fable had. Did a crime? No money to pay bounty, don't want to go to jail either? Get out of town and let things settle down. You can also turn off safety mode, to kill any civilian in cities (also similar to fable) Map size. In my current (and most advanced) game, I have less than 1/4 of the map explored, with over 10 hours of gameplay. And most of all... Quests. So many quests. Some very trivial, being as simple as going to see someone and talking to him, some much more elaborate and hard, such as clearing an area of all Ettins.   Cons: In the case of the rogue, the sneak attack is not as relevant as you'd expect, due to the combat abilities you have. If you have the occasion (or want to challenge yourself), do try to kill a few enemies in stealth, but otherwise it isn't worth it. Travel on long distances if you don't have a fast travel can be long, as there is no other mean of transportation than running. Inventory system is similar (if not identical) to Dragon Age: Origin. 70 invetory space, each item takes one space, stackables take one space per stack. As I am someone that just loots everything, this can be quite a bother (especially at lower levels), and the price for backpack expansions are steep when starting.
3787	1	a	Love the gameplay, graphics and storyline.
3789	1	a	If you like a world where you can run around doing quests but there is still a bit of structure to keep you on track then this is the game for you. A friend describes it as baby's first Skyrim and I think that is probably an apt description. A jolly good time and it looks quite pretty too
3791	1	a	Great game,i have played it on ps3 but the pc version seems to have sound issues
3793	1	a	Great game, Its alot like Skyrim just with more of the fantasy. I love this game, sometimes its hard to play in long periods but if you still play in short bursts it doesnt lose you in controls or anything. Sometimes i just have to stop and look around at the world they have created and stare in awe. If its possible to catch the game on sale since if you dont like it it's not much of a loss but if you like Skyrim Elder Scrolls then this is a game i throughly suggest.   ~Life is a war, days are a battle. Everyone once in a while loses a few battles, the thing that matters is to not lose the war.
3795	1	a	All in all this game was a highly entertaining RPG experience. The few flaws it has generally don't effect gameplay too much like the lockpicking being stupidly easy in every way.  Pros  - Game is fairly long. I spent many hours on this game losing track of time while running through quests   - Pretty textures. I was highly impressed with how everything looked  - The combat is nice and fluid with anything you want to pick as your main skills.  - Characters are fairly interesting for the most part  - All quests tie into the story  - Fight big monsters (I love fighting big monsters)  Cons  - Game is quite easy. I suggest playing it on hard  - Lockpicking is way too easy  - Enemies spawn back very fast  - No way to travel quickly without outright using fast travel but as enemies spawn back fast anyway you would really only need to run around for XP farming. Which, as the game is really, really easy, will probably just over level you anyway.  Overall, it is a good game to try out you will probably have a lot of fun with it if you like RPGs. I suggest grabbing it on sale it is definitely worth a play  
3797	1	a	It's enjoyable! I would recommand to buy it while it's on sale though, it will be more worth it as it's not a rpg that STANDS OUT. But you know it's still a well-made rpg that has things to offer and that is fun. But wait for a sale, more worth it. I have good memories of this game still and hope that you will too.
3799	1	a	The combat is amazing and fluid, The biggest problems I have with it though is... it's the Jogging Simulator RPG edition!
3801	1	a	Solid, lengthy third person RPG. Avoid blacksmithing like the plague, though, because it'll make the game way too easy.
3803	1	a	A third person RPG with a decent combat system, pretty good character development, okay'ish boss battles and a generic storyline and lore. When you level up you choose from warrior like, archer/thief like and mage like abilities which can be mixed up for a very unique playing style.  Camera can be irritating to control during combat, fate can be built up for over powered kills with an experience boost (Fate moves can be used on bosses which usually one shots them) Lots of loot and side quests and the DLC is'nt too shabby.  Lots of playtime to be had here but overall nothing special. 7/10
3805	1	a	This game had a lot of hype and usually that leads to a letdown. But with this game i didn't get that at all I enjoyed every minute playing this game.  It's sad the developer is dead and no new content will be available. The DLC came very cheap in a bundle sale. and added many more enjoyable hours to the game.  If you like singleplayer RPGs this is a must play in my book.  Camera control is sometimes strange with the zooming in and out. but thats one of the only cons i've really seen from it.  This game is worth every penny even without a sale.
3807	1	a	Amazing game, does not work on windows 10. Overall runs very well but has random crashes. Seems you can play for ten to fifteen minutes before the game force closes back to the desktop. Untill this is fixed I cannot reccomend on windows 10. Otherwise, Windows 7 or older, buy it, amazing game and art direction.  UPDATE-- Windows 10 users or like me, surface 3 users (non pro but pro would run it as well) open task manager, gp to details, and kill the tabtip.exe. Runs like a charm.
559	0	a	When someone says 'Jump!' the response should be 'How high?' not 'Wheres the part that lets me jump?'
3809	1	a	Reckoning is amazing game worth a play or two. The story is well put together and the voice acting is great imo. My only issue with the entire game is that the uniques are garbage and if you dont play on hard you will destroy the game. I have done 3 plays of this game on easy, normal, and hard with no deaths.
3811	1	a	One of the best, most overlooked RPG classics.  Like a Skyrim and WoW mix, and really fun to play- and chock with great lore.
3813	1	a	Good game although at some point the (many) side quests become uninteresting.
3815	1	a	If you like Skyrim, you will probably like this game too.
3817	1	a	The graphics, story and combat style is outstanding. Great game. I loved it so much that I had to buy all the DLC for this game.
3819	1	a	Enjoyed the heck out of this game ,best pick up on sale but well worth your time ,great story and combat
3821	1	a	The state of Rhode island presents: Why not to develop an MMO for your first game dev project
3823	1	a	very awesome game!  pros: you are freaking GOD in this game. effekts are amazing. grafik are good too. you have alot of choises on how to play your hero.  cones: there are invisible barriers, I mean com on, we are in 2015 (or later if you read it later). quests does not punish you if you do not follow the instructions. there are nothing left after last boss. game ends!
3825	1	a	In some ways it reminds me of Fable. Part of that has to do with the music score. Or maybe I'm totally bats. Dunno. But whatever the case, I love this game. It's too underrated! The content is wonderful, the graphics are lovely, and it hasn't glitched on me yet!  I wasn't sure I'd like the class system, but actually it's quite interesting. At first I favored the rogue class, but then I started branching into all three disciplines. The hybrid build is ridiculously strong.  The crafting system gives you a leg-up in the gear department; but like with many things, that seems to pay off more at higher tiers. Still, you can make some pretty awesome stuff.  Play it! Chances are good that you won't regret it. :3
3827	1	a	I have one regret... Why did I refund this game... 
3829	1	a	Immense game, far bigge and much more interestingr than I ever thought it was going to be, can't stop playing. I should qualify this a little, I gave up on PC gaming for a couple of years because I could not follow my passion anymore, Sim Racing, because of illness but wanted to keep my 'eye' in so bought a couple of 'doorstops' 360 and PS3, this was one of the first RPGs I got for the 360 but only played it for a few hours but never go invested in it, after a full refub of my PC I started buying the games I had aquired for the consoles for it, my god what a change, M&amp;K control and I was like a pig in mud and this allowed me to wallow forever, excellent fun, I cannot recommend this highly enough.  Sam
3831	1	a	In almost all RPG games that I play, I take a warrior trade. I prefer to just take hits and hit others back twice as hard. This game has completely changed that for me, I do not want to part with any abilities. It makes the rogue, the warrior and the magic aspects so much fun all at one go. Factions are also very interesting. Highly underrated. Don't think, buy, play, a few hours of your life that you won't regret.   I'm still going on with the game and I am still loving it.
3833	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is good rpg that excels in its combat but falters in its story and side quests. The story is layed out in way that doesn't flow like a good story should. Having said that, the combat is what made me finish the game and its dlc; the fluidity of the spells and weapons are unmatched in a third-person realtime rpg. 8/10
3835	1	a	Let me put it this way as far as RPGs go;  I've played it for 20 hours straight, no afking or what not and just started the main campaign. After getting this for 10 bucks on a steam sale.  It's a solid rpg.
3837	1	a	fun addicting and imaginative.
3839	1	a	Immersive story and innovative combat features.
3841	1	a	  Thoughts on game:
3843	1	a	A game with an awesome combat style, the it's story fails to interest me lackluster charcters, bit overall it's a awesoemllme game
3845	1	a	A fantastic game, extremely underrated.
3847	1	a	Amazing RPG. Fun without complication. It s not very hard and maybe remember too much of WOW.  But is a game very well crafted. Get it.
3849	1	a	The greatest game i've ever played!! And honestly very addicted game too      10/10 i would like to collect more purple or yellow items
3851	1	a	This is really Good game and i collected each and every part of this game and only concern is the boos fight was not much expected. it is so easy to complete the final step.
3853	1	a	
3855	1	a	This is an excellent game overall and I fully recommend it, despite how it looks like there's many cons. Just try not to take things too seriously and don't think it'll be the next Skyrim, but enjoy it for what it is. I did get pretty addicted to it though, because it IS fun to play :).  Pros:   - Beautiful graphics. Those spells man, they're gorgeous! - Really fun and flexible combat.  - Good story. - Nice characters, with voice-acting for every NPC. Quite well done too. Good facial expressions as well. - Plenty of character flexibility, in terms of choosing how to play.  - Good DLC. - Beautiful cutscenes.  - Very stable game. No crashes or glitches after 60h of play. Even after resuming the game after PC sleep. - Very quick saving. Odd, but true. Esc&gt;Save Game&gt;Esc again to re-enter game fast. Other games need time to save. - Player housing, which is both expandable and comes with beautiful rooms and useful features.  - NPCs are often quite beautiful facially and they also respond to event changes or differences. At one point, NPC A was talking to me and he then complained about a race in the game, the Dokkalfar, but my character was of that race, so he added something to the effect of 'Ahem, except you of course'. Very nice touch! - Safety mechanism in place to stop you from accidentally hitting friendlies. So you need to press H to enable this. However this is less realistic than in Skyrim. To make matters worse, you can't always enable it, such as in certain safe areas it seems and thus you can't attack annoying people, as the games loading screen suggests... - Makes you feel special as ♥♥♥♥ lol. - Fast loading times between going in and out of buildings.  - Nice 'junk items' system, where you go through your inventory, add the items you don't want to junk and then go find a merchant. Then you click 'sell all junk' and you're done. Quite nice and easy. - Many different items, both clothing and otherwise. - Lots of hidden items and locations to find, as well as collectible armor sets. - Many different kinds of enemies and areas. - Possible to stealthily kill NPCs, although you only get a stealth-kill animation if using a Dagger. - Really nice tarot-card-like destiny system, with good RP options, due to the descriptions.  Cons:   - No followers.  - Your character has no voice and so is silent during dialogue. - Not possible to yield, if accidentally or intentionally hitting a friendly character. - Sometimes clunky system of having to constantly re-do the same dialogue to make multiple selections, such as if you choose to buy all upgrades to a house at the same time. This also means you can't choose what gets added to your house, but instead have to follow a set order. So if you don't want an Alchemy room for instance, but the Alchemy dialogue option comes first, then you're forced to buy the Alchemy room to get to the next dialogue option, for other house segments. - Character creation is based on presets mostly and thus isn't very deep or flexible.  - After creation, only certain features can be changed; not major things such as eye color. - Mini-games such as lockpicking can be tedious and not as refined as say, Skyrim. - Game is generally less 'free' than Skyrim and is more cartooney, but still pretty. Less options. - Less freedom of movement. It's one of those games where you can't jump over edges, but need a prompt. - Character facial gear *always* gets removed during normal dialogue, annoyingly, so you can see their face. - Combat can be annoying sometimes, because you can't always just stop a combo or spell mid-cast, to dodge or block. Thus when you do long basic attack chains, but know that an enemy is charging an attack, it's not possible to stop and block. Thus you often get hit. - Shields aren't visible when you equip them. Instead, they just appear out of nowhere when you press the block button. - No mounts.  - Shallow interaction with environment, such that you can't interact with chests or bookshelvs by putting things back into them, like you can in Skyrim. So once you take everything out of them, they stop their characteristic shining. - Lacking a screen that shows which clans/factions you're allied with and their respective banners and your status within them. I would've liked this, even though it's not a big deal.  - Inventory system is annoying because if you have health potion A in your inventory already and you find a new health potion, you won't be able to add that potion to your existing stockpile of the same potion, if your inventory is full. Thus you need to clear at least 1 slot, in order to be able to pick this up. Quite tedious. On the other hand, ingredients from things like plants don't require space. As goes for crafting materials. - If you press F to talk with an NPC, but they're in the process of laying down to sleep or getting up or something, then your character is completely immobilized until the dialogue starts. This is a small thing, but quite stupid.  - Lack of mods and steam workshop support.  - Block is simplistic, which means you can just hold down B for block and then enemies can't even flank you, as your character will automatically turn to block them.  - When you have just finished a quest, the game will, perhaps unless you've unticked tutorials/help, auto-select the main quest line for you again and add a pop-up notifying you of the fact that you have no quest. This is annoying, as it means you've *always* got a quest and can't just ignore it.  - When buying items, the game doesn't calculate the cost for you. So if an item costs 446 and you want to buy 3 of it, you get to select how many and then click buy and you won't know how much the final price is, unless you calculate it yourself. No pop-up shows how much money you used either. - NPCs using weapons you can't get. I've seen a few NPCs use spears and I love spears. Yet I haven't found a single equippable spear in the game.  - Sleep is purely for role-play it seems, as there's no benefit to doing it, besides healing up to full health/mana for free. - Unless there's an enemy in sight, you can't aim neither spells nor arrows, but only shoot straight ahead. Thus you can't really look up at the sky and shoot that way, for instance.
3857	1	a	This is one of the most under aprriecated games of all time. The game company 'BIG HUGE GAMES' went bankrupt after the release of this game because they went over budget and didn't get enough sales afterwards. I think the only reason they didnt sell enough was because it was barley advertised.  It feels like a new fable game but with plenty more content but less of that typical fable humor. I've heard some deescribe it as a watered down skyrim but i'd say it's just a different styled RPG compared to skyrim.  Seriously good tho
3859	1	a	very happy i bought this game 9/10 allday !
3861	1	a	One of the best action RPGs of the last 4 years on PC. Very long game with an epic story line, excellent fight mechanics, great blacksmithing/crafting, fun DLC....pick it up now!!! You won't be disappointed.
3863	1	a	One of (if not the) best RPG i've played so far. Combat is challennging, story is amazing, and there is more than enough to do in terms of sidequests (and no grindy ones either). Add to that the crafting mechanics, and I'm convinced this belongs in a hall of fame somewhere.
3865	1	a	This is literally one of the best RPG's you can buy, it often goes on sale for 5 bucks.  Please note this game is LONG, don't expect to beat this in a weekend. I've beaten it through 3 times on the PS3, and working on PC now.  
3867	1	a	Aye so I was saving a pretty penny like, got this in a sale and everything. Mam woulda been well proud. Anyway so let's get serious, this game is a proper cheeky little number like.   So apparently I've been dead and come back alive right, but I proper know that ain't true. Ya can tell the characters just come out of a proper fat ket hole right but that's not the point.  I head into this town and there's this canny gnome like. I told her I'd smash her back doors in and break her hips like but unfortunately she's a gnome and im a human and from experience... it's like banging a kid. Proper tight as owt and a lot of crying.  Im gonna go kill something.
3869	1	a	This is a fun, immersive game. I enjoy it's combat and the depth of skills. The class system is also different from what I have played before. If you enjoy action, combat, fantasy, or RPG games I recommend this game.
3871	1	a	Great game with a bright crisp art style.  Combat is fun and smooth with blocking and countering easy and clear, though you may find yourself fighting the camera to try and see everything that is around you. Being able to change your experience points at any time to change your class and play style is a great feature for a game as big as this one so you can mix and match to suit you.  how ever the term 'walking god of destruction' comes to mind in the late game as you can (with the right specs) can become so over powered that nothing can stand before you. so play on the hardest difficultly setting for any real challenge
3873	1	a	great game! mix between fable and skyrim
3875	1	a	It's good. Deserves more recognition.
3877	1	a	Great game, fun as ♥♥♥♥.
3879	1	a	A good but not great RPG. I was looking for something to play and stumbled upon this. First impressions were great, but my opinion went down a bit after that. The world is enourmous, and there is tons to do, but unless your a completionist I would recommend not bothering with a lot of the sidequests, there are to many of them. I don't regret buying this game, I had a fun 20 hours, however the midgame is stretching on so long I have soured to it, and it's quite unlikely I finish it.
3881	1	a	I got this game as part of the Steam Summer Sale. I don't get to play my games all that often, but I do not regret picking up this title. It's a little wonky at first due to the lack of PC optimization with the controls, but once you get used to the weird quirks of having to use the keyboard to go through menus, it's a great game to play. The story is pretty well fleshed out as far as I can tell, the world looks fantastic, albeit a little cartoony, and the fact that you can re-spec your character for a different playstyle without having to start a new game is really nice. The crafting system is quite nice, it's simple to use, and stays relevant from early-mid game all the way to late game. Combat can be a bit clicky/spammy, but with different combos and skill moves, you can fight however you want.  tl;dr  A fun game that has some quirks, plays slightly like an MMO, and has a lot of depth and customizability. Totally worth buying.
3883	1	a	A very highly underrated game. Made by some of the greatest minds to the Fantasy Genre, including Ken Rolston of Bethesda, and R.A.Salvatore, writer of the Demon Wars saga, this game is full of color, lore and a ton of places to explore and weapons and armor to find. This is what World of Warcraft would look like if it wasn't a low poly MMO. The combat reminds me of the first Fable game, so it's really easy to learn; also there's a bunch of weapon types to choose from. I have played through this game twice on the Xbox, and now I am playing it for PC. I recommend it.
3885	1	a	KOA is honestly one of my favorite RPGs. It's not completely perfect, but the great combat system and incredible art style more than make up for its minor flaws.
3887	1	a	Lovely game- beutiful locations, varied enemies and fun story. Voice acting could be better, as could the abilities, but overall I have to reccomend, especially so if its on sale
3889	1	a	Ok, I have played this on Xbox, Playstation and PC, and they are all marvelously fun. Sadly the PC version doesn't like the new Xbox One controllers (something about the software that it works with) but it still works great with keyboard and mouse. This feat alone I give a nod of approval towards.  It is not the worlds greatest game, but if you're looking for a fun little fantasy game then give it a bash. If you're like me and just curious, you might even find you like it.
3891	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a third person RPG in a vast fantasy world. Brought to you by R.A.Salvatore (DnD novels' author), Todd McFarlane (Spawn creator), Ken Rolston (Oblivion designer). With such credits nothing could go wrong. Well, almost...  Amalur is a good game, it's almost like third person Skyrim. You wake up as a kinda resurrected John Doe, aka The Fateless, and apart from uniting factions, killing monsters and looting ruins you're gonna avert the end of everything. Because fantasy. The story is staple, but it's not bad, and you'll have lots of sidequests to deal with, and some of these can be quite interesting too. Main character can progress as Sorcerer, Fighter, Rogue, or a mix. There is not much difference really, but some weapons work better with a matching class. All in all game is quite fun and took me almost 70hrs, that's for main quest plus almost all of the sidequests and some achievement hunting.  I liked: * lots of stuff to do and lots of places to visit * your character can use any weapon regardless of the class * some interesting npc characters  I disliked: * normal is very easy * most of the armor pieces are random drops, so it's hard if you aim for a specific set * gfx look a bit dated  Get this: * if you like third person rpg games  Don't get this: * if you don't like arcade'y combat in your rpgs * if you want complex character progression
3893	1	a	It's honestly what Fable tried to be. While they don't deliver anything extraordinarily ground breaking here, every element they have pulled into the game are ones I have found fun in other games. And one point I feel I have to make early on: This is nothing like Skyrim. Many people have asked me if it's like Skyrim/Oblivion, and I'm assuming this has to do with the designer being involved in the game. Really, the only thing familiar was the lockpicking, the rest of the game plays vastly differently from Skyrim and it's a good thing. Really, though, if you're not sure if you want this game, play the demo. It runs you through the tutorial portion of the game and then gives you 45 minutes to explore--and while you'll only touch the tip of the iceberg in that time, it will either save you sixty bucks if you don't like the style of the game or it will make you crave more. Personally, I'm betting on the latter.
3895	1	a	This game is pretty cool. So far i've invested 58 hours and i'm no where close to finishing it, so if long games are your thing then this is the one for you.  A Pro is there are tons of quests and you can just keep going one right after the other. The Con is that some of the simple quests can get somewhat repetative, just with a change of scenery. Another thing is that the amount of items you get is staggering, getting set items and unique items is like getting presents on christmas. This brings me to one thing i didn't like.  If your a collector that has to have...and keep every item, this game will be hard for you. I'm an item collector in games and for this game i run out of space after every quest and have to choose on what to keep. My personal stash and shared house stash are almost full, and like i said before, i'm no where close to finishing. Another thing i didn't like is the combat system, it gets pretty repetative pretty fast and seems like your just pressing the same button over and over. But that's only if you choose to upgrade your weapon mastery first (it takes a while to upgrade all weapon masteries) instead of getting abilities first.  All in all a good game to spend your time and money, especially with Steam marking the price down to 75% at times with all the dlc.
3897	1	a	An overall Fun RPG took a bit before I got used to some of the weapons and to level up enough to fight some of the bosses but it was fun in the end. 7.5 / 10
3899	1	a	I love this game. Just re-downloaded it and started playing again. This is my third playthough. Only things I don't like are that it is to short, and I feel like the classes aren't balanced. The Worrior is definatly easier than the other two. This is only a slight drawback as it is single player so you don't have to play as the strongest class, just the one you like the most.
3901	1	a	This is a great game. R.A. Salvatore is an author I adore, and the richness and detail of the world live up to Demon Saga and Forgotten Realms -level storytelling. The art is fantastic, and the gameplay is addictive. I've played through it a few times now, and I never tire of it.  The main premise (you are 'fateless', with no pre-written destiny) was apparently not written by Salvatore, and that's nice to know since it makes no sense. Sure, you get to write your own fate, but so what? in any RPG you get to choose your own 'fate'. It seems like the storyline missed an opportunity to incorporate the struggle between a game's inherent linear story (if you want to complete the game, you DO have to follow the storyline, so you aren't really without destiny, are you?) and the idea that you are a character without a destiny. That aspect is never explored, and yet you're constantly being told throughout the game that everyone's really amazed by you because you have no pre-determined fate.  Aside from that, the game is perfect. The combat is FUN, the RPG elements are solid (in fact, you can change classes and skills quite easily), and the world is huge with lots of side quests. Highly recommended.
3903	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a great RPG that satisfies with hours upon hours of playtime. Replayability is good but not so much necessary. The game is perfectly suited to match any playstyle. Want to be an assassin? No problem. Want to be a battlepriest? Sure, can do. Mix&amp;match your skills to make the most use of this great game with uncommon weapons and skills. The fighting still is enjoyable and the game works really well with the Steam Controller.   8/10  
3905	1	a	One of my favorite RPGs of all time even with its lackluster execution on the story/character side of things. The game plays like Fable meets God of War, so its easy for me to forgive its faults. Played and beat every hour of this on 360 and had to buy it again.  9/10 Would buy again.
3907	1	a	This was a game I expected to be a 5/10 and ended up being 10/10. Great story, fun game play, and doesn't pigeon-hole you into one style of gameplay. You won't regret this purchase.
3909	1	a	the game play in not complex but the story and art is amazing. the design is very fantisy(colorful and detailed) not like Skyrim (i'm not saying that skyrim isn't amazing). when attacking you aren't so much building your character in the sense of stats as you are building his/her fighting combos.
3911	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur is a great game that I would recommend to any RPG player. Yes there are some flaws, and storywise it is no Witcher III, but for most part, it gets the job done. Also, I have a problem of trying to clear every single quest and area before I move on, so some of the downsides I mention of the game is probably due to that.   Although I've played for 40ish hrs, I think I have yet to reach the halfway point. The beginning parts, when you start to get to know the world and explore, figure out enemy patterns, is a blast. I just couldn't stop playing. However going towards the middle the pacing slows down, and although I am sure the game will pick up its pace, I am very slightly bored. This is largely due to my play style, but there is also the big difference in quality of story between side quests, faction quests, and main quests. Main quests and faction quests have intriguing characters and somewhat novel plots (especially the faction quests since I've barely finished a few main quests. I also didn't find myself invested in the protagonist). However, the side quests do not have much substance and the effort to build a compelling story around the usual kill things or fetch things falls flat in those cases.  There is also quite some running to do even with the help of fast travel and me trying to optimize for running distance as best as I can (main reason I try to finish all quests before moving on). Almost all the 'dungeons' have a related quest, which is good and bad because on one hand there are no filler stages (but there are filler quests), but on the other hand it potentially makes you run around more.  This game is not supposed to be Dark Souls, so the following is just something to note rather than criticism. The combat itself is pretty good for a normal action RPG. But enemy patterns are a bit repetitive once you get a hang of it. Enemies usually have two main patterns and even with more patterns or stronger variations of the patterns, the attacks are quite predictable even when facing new enemies.
3913	1	a	So good action RPG fun a lot of classes play differntly you would not expct them to play.buy this a shame we will nevr get a sequal. this was a great game
3915	1	a	Great graphics, good dialogues and story. Quests can be repetitive in their task but the diversity of the map compensate it.
3917	1	a	This game seriously is my all time favourite RPG :D it's highly addictive, great stories in game, easy to control in game and mega hours of fun :D it generally is easy to play and the in game tutorial whilst playing the game is easy, i mean if my mates 4 year old can play no problems im sure you'd all agree by that sentimet that this game is easy to play :D
3919	1	a	1) Essential purchase  2) Recommended purchase
3921	1	a	Pros -Fun combat with lots of moves -Long hours of gameplay -Lots of unique armour and weapons Cons -Story is plain and boring -A few annoying bugs that will never be removed  -NPC's voices sound mostly the same and are not interesting
3923	1	a	Fun rpg that has a lot of content. Worth a buy for sure.
3925	1	a	One of the few games that managed to keep me entertained for hours. A must play for anyone who loves RPG games
3927	1	a	I sold Technomancer because I was disappointed in almost every aspect (except graphics). I tried out this game and I love it! I love every single aspect (inclusive graphics)!
3929	1	a	i love this game but need a windows 10 update to stop the crashing
3931	1	a	Quite good thing to play. A ton of bugs, but still nice.  Advantages
3933	1	a	This game is awesome.I used to play it on PS3 but when I purchased my computer it was one of the first I bought to play all over again.It wasn't a success when it first came out and not many copies sold and the company was disatisfatied but this game worths both my money and my time.
3935	1	a	I rarely write reviews about games that I buy and play. This game is the exception. It's a gem! I'd had it in my wishlist for a while, unsure whether or not it was worth it. Bought it during summer sale and it was definitely worth it.   Pros: -Combat system is awesome! Smooth, fun, engaging. -The lore of the game is great, what else could one expect from R.A. Salvatore?  -If you enjoy Elder Scrolls, this game will a have a slightly similiar feel. Why? One of the lead developers for ES IV: Oblivion was the lead developer on this game.  -Great way to waste time. Would sit down and next thing I knew it was 4 hours later. -Controls lay out makes plenty of sense.   Cons: - Underdeveloped story and characters. Could've done more there.   Overall, 10/10 would definitely recomend! Worth every bit of what you may spend on it!  
3937	1	a	This is a criminally underrated game. The story is kinda ok but the combat is some of the best I've played in an rpg.
3939	1	a	single player MMO. It's hard to say whether this game is worth playing or not. It's literally like playing world of warcraft solo. So you have the same grind, the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fetch quests, and the same art style. Then again there are some nice touches like a better-than-average story, and a crime and punishment system akin to skryim which lets you be a jerk, if you so choose. A decent way to sink some time, but don't expect much.
3941	1	a	Highly recommended 10/10  More detailed review to come.
3943	1	a	Great game but underrated. Definitely worthy to play. :)
3945	1	a	Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game. It has a good amount of replayablitity, especially if you want to 100% the game. Just wish they would have made a second one.
3947	1	a	Overally, it is a game worth playing. However, the combat system is a bit boring and the world is too big to explore on foot. It wastes a lot of time travelling, it will be perfect if there is a mounting system
3949	1	a	Great game if you get into it :) if you spend some time into the game you will get used to the camera (whitch is pretty close for my comfort) but once you put time into the game it will get a great one! ;)
3951	1	a	An easy and casual RPG with a good plot, a plot thats easy to follow and allows you to not play the game for a long time and then come back to easily pick up where yo left off. Good controller support which allows for a laid back gaming experience.
3953	1	a	Good game, worth 20 bucks without hesitation. Reminds me of the Fable franchise for the design and gameplay. Very fairy game tho, if you like dark fantasy this might not be for you
3955	1	a	Amazing gameplay, it gave me a lot of fun. I only wish the storyline would have been better developed. Still, this game s must if you like action RPGs.
3957	1	a	10/10, would raise damage resistance to 100% again.
3959	1	a	Simple, cool, fun graphics - very similar to Elder Scrolls or WoW without the online play and monthly charge. A good casual RPG/sandbox for experienced gamers.
3961	1	a	ver good game better than the console version lol to me it is anyway i wish there was a number two coming but nope anyway its well worth the $ and the expansions are two
3963	1	a	This game is great for those who have enjoyed fable, there is a lot of content in the game and it will keep you entertained for a long time, but there is too much boring diolog.
3965	1	a	Pretty solid game i enjoyed it highly if you havent given it a shot try it out. weapons are a bit redudant after a while but over all a fun experience.
3967	1	a	I have played the game for quite some time now, and I guess it's time to review this game. The game is good, combat is fun, voice acting is adequate, and visuals aren't outdated in my opinion. However there are some other things that bother me about this game. For one, doing the DLC's midgame, along with the sidequests over-levels you. This game does not use dynamic scaling at all, and is however set per zone. Therefore you must be certain that you are sure about entering a new zone, because it to sets the level based on your character when you enter the zone. Other than that it's fun, story interesting and the gameplay is very good. DLC's are worth it too.
3969	1	a	If people were to ask me to pick between skyrim and amalur, I would recommend Amalur more. This is due to gamepad friendlier game and a clearer character progression. Downside of this game is the limited character builds and unmmodability
3971	1	a	It looks like most people have sung this game's praises, but I'll add my two cents to this game.  First and foremost, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fun game. You're a man/woman with no Fate, and as such can choose your Destiny out of 7 available styles. In addition, you have access to Reckoning Mode, where your attacks do more damage and you can finish your opponents by pressing 'A' or the corresponding key and mash a randomly selected button/key to gain extra experience.  The combat is in real time, and requires you to think on your feet. You've got 9 different weapon types, each with different moves and strategies required to rule the battlefield with. You can choose Primary and Secondary weapons to switch up your gameplay on the fly, which is really helpful. In addition, you can put 4 spells/skills into your slots and use at any time.  You also have access to a wide array of non-combat skills that help you create powerful weapons, craft helpful potions, and persuade the masses, to give a few examples. You'll want to stick with 3-4 main skills to level up, as you only have 40 levels to work with. Personally, Detect Hidden and Persuade are essential to see all the cool stuff available.  There are 5 main areas in Amalur, and each are unique in their appearance and ascetic. Each area has a lot of quests and places to explore. There are also 5-ish factions, each unique and fun to play through.  Due to your Fateless nature, you create Twists of Fate during big moments in the story and during faction quests. These Twists will benefit your stats, and will potentially change the faction you're working with for the rest of the game. These faction Twists have two paths you can take, meaning you have to play the game twice to see what both Twists offer.  Now this game, despite how good it is, does have some flaws. To begin with, there are some quests that have a chance to break, and will keep you from Fast Travelling if that happens, so save often. Persuasion has a percentage chance o work, but even at full Persuade, the highest chance to work is 95%, meaning you'll probably want to save if you are going to use that skill.  The targeting system is really bad, considering the nature of this game's combat. It's very difficult to change targets during combat, and sometimes you'll want to attack someone else during Reckoning Mode, but still keep wailing on an opponent who is already at the prompt. This game also has some quests that require you to escort/'ally' with NPC's that will fail your quest if they die. However, it is really easy for them to run off and get themselves killed while you're trying to fight off an opponent. It really doesn't help that enemies love to attack teammates, and I can't seem to find a way to draw aggro consistently.  In addition, the game's length, even if you skip the factions and most of the side quests, will still take a long while to finish. This can create fatigue, especially during the final haul, where it might feel like it'd be best to run past every enemy rather than deal with all the encounters you run into.  The DLC is also good, with Teeth of Naros being the best of the two expansions. The bosses in both are challenging but fun, and the areas added have plenty of content.  I bought this game and the DLC for $9.99 during a Sale, and I believe that the game is worth the initial $19.99, but I'd wait until the DLC's price goes down during another Sale to pick them up. This game can be frustrating at times, and I don't think I'll be playing again for a while, as this game can fatigue you with it's length. But Kingdoms of Amalur is a really fun game that you'll clock many hours into.
3973	1	a	A really good RPG with a lot of choices (moral,gameplay and so on) with a really robust combat system, a very rich lore.
3975	1	a	This game is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, it's right along side the dark souls series and skyrim in my opinion. Its a shame that this game didnt get recognized for the awesomeness that it is. I wish this game got more popular. I love stealth and assassinations, and this game handles both really well. For instance, the takedowns that you can preform with a dagger are unlike anything ive ever seen before and I was very impressed. There's a lot more I want to say about this game, but i'm lazy.
3977	1	a	Great game if you are lacking rpgs to play  Pros:  -Fun combat systems -Exploration -Unique artstyle -Awesome crafting system -Good Class progression   Cons:  -Story could be better -Needs more avatar customization  -Your character doesn't have a voice (might not be a problem for everyone) -Choices don't really affect the story
3979	1	a	An extremely fun game. There is the occasional camera issue and the absence of a jumping ability does give the game the feeling that it's lacking something, especially when you can't jump off cliffs unless you're standing on a specific location. Some of the locations can also feel generic and some of the enemies attacks just feel like they're hacking away at your health, which can ruin any sense of strategy.   All of those are minor flaws, though. The biggest flaw of the game is when you're fighting multiple enemies at once. You'll be hacking away at an enemy, then another enemy will injure you and you'll automatically lock onto that new enemy. This can get frustrating when you're facing off with a boss and they summon a swarm of monsters. You're character will keep getting hit, hack at that enemy, get hit again, turn around and hack at that enemy, then get hit again and hack at that enemy. This can cause the fight to last forever because you're not locked on to one enemy long enough to actually kill them.  This may seem like a lot of complaints, but I've gotta admit that I still really like the game. The story is interesting, with a deep lore, and you can usually either work around or suffer through the enemy locking problem. The bottom line is that, despite its flaws, this game is very entertaining.
3981	1	a	Running Windows 10. Summer sale bought it for PC and love the amount of content music and stories in the game. For 5 euros so much worth.  You can setup your character in anyway you like with whatever weapons and trees you want to follow or mix. SO gives a lot of choices.
3983	1	a	As of writing this, I'm 115 hours in and am only in the first half of the last part of the story [exhausting every quest along the way], and still have both of the DLC to go through. The combat is probably the best part of this game, the fate/destiny level system pretty much serves to let you customize your style of fighting. The artwork is quite good, if mmo-ish. The story is decent. There are plenty of quests to do, parts to combine to make items you want, and houses to furnish. It's not too challenging though if that's what you look for in an RPG [my playtime is just due to me grinding as I go to get to max level so I can do the DLC at max (DLC drops and rewards scale to level as you enter iirc) before ending the story].   My advice for maximum enjoyment, challenge, and actual decision making, in terms of gear, is to avoid getting gold through excessive gem combination farming and to not be tempted to save-scum when salvaging gear for crafting parts. Also, try to finish everything in an area before moving on because regions level lock to the first time you enter it and thus you can cripple your progression if you just run willy-nilly and locking the first regions to level 2 or something [despite it being open world].  For the power gamers: gem combo farm like hell for 30 mins after like the first four regions and you'll never need money again. And save scum like hell when salvaging to get those +damage parts for crafting when they're available, because crafted items are the most OP stuff in this game.  TL;DR - Excellent Combat, good skill set customization, good art style, ok story, plenty to do, not the most challenging, crafting is op, gem combo farming is op, region level lock shenanigans possibly spoiling the open world and ability to level up fast element for some people
3985	1	a	Pros Gorgeous, colorful art direction Almost an entirly original setting. Smooth God of War-esque combat Enough lore to do an Elder Scrolls title pround Tons of content. With DLC you can easily pull 100+ hours if you take your time and do everything Great crafting system that lets you tune your gear to your needs  Cons Too easy. Even on hard the enemies will easily fall to a well built character Crafting system makes unique and set items worthless 38 Studios financially mismanaged itself into oblivion  KoA:R is by no means a ground braking title. However it is a very polished and well put together title that any RPG fan should check out. Sadly this will probably be the only title we see in this setting. Hopefully someone like Obsidian or Bethesda will get their hands on the IP and turn out another title.
3987	1	a	If you're looking for a wonderful story set in a fantasy RPG world, then you're out of luck. On the other hand, If incredible combat is what you desire then this game is definately for you.  Either way, it's a nice game.
3989	1	a	Really enjoying this game. A lot to do and just good clean fun. Loving the graphics also. When did it become 'graphics have to look like real life?' This game remains gamish. For the lack of a better word. Good stuff indeed.
3991	1	a	KoA:R is a game that I can play for hours and just get lost in the world. I am an player of RPGs and I bought KoA:R on a whim when I wanted a new game to play. The artwork was not a big seller for me. Indeed, my initial reaction was that it was overly 'cartoony' for my liking. It grew on me and now I'm happy to see this world.  You're allowed a fair bit of character customization (beyond the normal aesthetic options). Skill point progression is, at first, odd since you can choose a destiny card to become a fighter, sorcerer, or finesse (thief) character - or a mixture of them. You can 'respec', for a price, via the Fateweaver NPCs throughout the world. Any character race and skill combination will, at higher levels, be totally overpowered. It's not really possible to completely hose your character, especially since you can tweak your character at the Fateweavers. A fighter is a melee machine, a sorcerer can use elemental spells and 'magicky' stuff to devastating effect, and finesse characters are backstabby/archers of doom.  All characters can, via metagame knowledge, gain max skill points in every skill. If you roleplay the character it might be more enjoyable than simply min/maxing, but either playstyle would work.  Although the world is open and allows you to go just about anywhere, there is a bit of 'go this direction' happening. The world is broken down in to smaller map sections and each of these sections is sort of a self-contained adventure. You quest in the zone and move to the next. Nothing prevents you from running three zones over and, assuming you aren't killed outright, you can 'do stuff'. There is a wierd level cap for each zone that sets the level to whatever your character's level is upon initial entry. That zone is forever capped at that level. This can break your adventure when you come back to the zone again. It's not something I really noticed on my first playthrough.  Like many games that offer choice, your choices are only a passing thought in the grand scheme of the world. Some characters will recognize you for certain accomplishments or choices but overall the world remains largely unaware of your existance (apart from the NPCs involved in the the main questline).  There is a great wiki and other online resources for the game if you like to game with the references open during the journey.  Pros:  * generally open world to explore, with a few quest locked areas (especially the second-half of the game) * nice character progression * easy to get into and play and not overly complicated * hard to 'gimp' yourself * nice array of side quests to guide you on your journey * has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you enjoy that)  Cons:  * some may be put off by the graphics * the controls took a bit of getting comfortable with * the ability to easily reclass/respec your character may limit you on replay value * has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you're into hardcore) * choices in-game have only minor effect on the world  Overall rating: 8/10  * Definately worth picking up on sale, or at any price if you're a fan of RPGs * I started playing and lost track of time
3993	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. I still refer to this game when I talk about how combat should be done in current titles. It was far ahead of the curve and is still superiour in many ways. The closest thing on the market currently to it's combat style is Black Desert Online, but that feels clunky compared to the flow this game has. I so wish things had turned out differently and we'd been able to get sequels to this magnificant piece of art.
3995	1	a	I actually enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game when it first came out. Sure it has it's flaws but theres really something special and magical about it if you can give it a chance.
3997	1	a	I bought this because the xbox 360 version completely stopped working. I wanted access to it. I preodered the original, and played it for hundreds of hours.  Not a bad buy at all.
3999	1	a	Where is co-op?
4001	1	a	I recently bought the game for PC and haven't really played it much on PC, but on console i possibly could have logged 100+ hours when I played. I found out abou the game a few days after release, saw the cool armored characters and huge beasts to slay and immediately got excited. I looked up the trailer on youtube and was in complete awe. I love this game, highly recommend it. The combat is fluid, the quests are amazing, and the possibilities are endless. THe quests aren't repetetive like in other titles. The graphics are great for a game this old. Thankfully the game is being sold for $19.99, so now it is more available to others. I still have no problems paying full price for this game back in the day.
4003	1	a	Diablo game with Assassin's Creed combat, AWESOME!
4005	1	a	Buying this game may not bring its devs back from the dead but it's 100% worth it, most of my hours elsewhere.
4007	1	a	R.A Salvatore the writer of the Drizzit series provided the lore for this game. This game felt like a huge MMO but your the only person running around. Kingdoms of Amular is all about loot and exploring. If you don't enjoy that you will not like this game. Sadly the company that made closed down due to financial issuues and a follow-up game was never made.
4009	1	a	Amazing RPG Experiance...  well worth the time, money and effort...  Nuff' Said...
4011	1	a	This is a very fun and entertaining game to play. Just whis they had better skill trees
4013	1	a	Best ♥♥♥♥ing game I have ever played. First time I played this game, I was at school in the librarytrying it out, got ambushed by spiders and freaked out. Everybody around me was looking at me wierd. This is my go to game for when I get bored with Skyrim. I do recomend this game to everybody, however, I must point out that I did not have any problems with running the game or with gameplay.
4015	1	a	This game could easily make tons of money becoming an mmo!!! This game is a lot like fable. The combat is a lot better and the story is less rediculous. Very beautiful graphics and the game play is fun too!
4017	1	a	I bought this well over a year ago, and no matter how long I go without playing it; every time I come back to it, I fall in love all over again. Though, I'd still wait to buy it during a discount event, tbqh.
4019	1	a	i love the colorful atmos of the game. The combat system is so enjoyable and loveable
4021	1	a	It's an action-oriented World of Warcraft with several classes/dual classing, fairly entertaining combat mechanics, an interesting crafting system, great sound, whimsical graphics, and good production values. It can be played quite well with keyboard or controller and ALL KEYS ARE REBINDABLE (♥♥♥♥off Fallout 4)!
4023	1	a	In this game, you play as someone who died, and when revived, had enough power to destroy the entire world twice, but people still treat you like an errand boy. The main word on this game would be 'Fate', as people who call themselves 'Fateweavers' (aka Gypsies/Seers) play a major role in the lore. Everyone has their own Fate predetermined by the gods, and the Fateweavers are the ones with power to see the fate of everyone, but not control it. The aforementioned power that your character has, is the power to change the Fate (aka Killing people with glowy weapons. If you kill them with normal weapons, it's fine, but killing them with glowy things changes their fate, because screw logic), and since you died and was reborn, you are a person without its own Fate.   Pros:
4025	1	a	1st Playthrough is Magical and is full of fun mechanics 2nd Playthrough is a bit slower as you kinda know what happens and fun of mechanics wearing off 3rd Playthrough your really starting to get bored after just leaving the Forest and you end up dropping it Great for first play, terrible for replay value in my op 7/10
4027	1	a	Fable meets Skyrim. If you like both, you'll love this game. Highly recommended 9/10. DLC is worth buying as well.   PS: Beware the Chicken Overlords.
4029	1	a	wait....this isn't Skyrim?!!
4031	1	a	The game is very good. Graphics and WIDE World access great. Some challenges might be beyond the intellectually stunted, but over-all many hours of inter-active play. Wide assortment of character types and styles. ONE caveat of concern is the loot tables and inventory program....IT IS BUGGED. Stackables items do not always stack. Example: Have a potion stack (limited to TEN), but only have ONE in the que,,,and can NOT loot a drop of the same potion. BANDIT arm bands, normally stack (upto TEN), but some do NOT stack, indicating to me that there is some CODEX diff in the items. The inventory limits for loots can be raised by TEN items per backpacks, which are VERY hard to find. Apparently, there is some rare need to limit ONE to a vendor. Some vendors are really egregious thieves, even in your own Faction. My toon is ArchSage, and has highest level of Warsworn, et al, at the vendors rip him off. Pitiful. Training can be had for a hugh cost, IF you can find the trainer at the appropriate time/level. Otherwise, you have to use your ONE POINT/level to advance skills. NO SKILL UPS for usage, or accomplishments. The LOOT system is badly flawed. due to the stackables NOT stacking in many cases. Also, this time around I made a BAD choice to accept the Niscaru Lord power and that put me as NEMISIS of the Warsworn. BEWARE. No remedy except to start OVER. Shame on EA, et al. And don't do Master level pots as you will use up your Fate Essence and probably NOT have enough to finish the Dragon Boss. Reccomend NOT using the Fate pots untill you get to the LAST boss fight. Hours fighting the Dragon. Failed. Waste of 12 hrs time. And that was level 40 MAXED skills.   ALL SAID, it is worth the sale price, and having logged WELL over 500 hrs, , what with dozens of side jobs, quests, and HUGH world to explore, I would buy it again, if needed. I recommend the game to any adult, with sound moral values, as there is quite a bit of off-color, 'mature' content, suggestive themes, and plainly VILE content. Sire, the world is going to hell in a race-car, but I do not want to advocate capitulation. Keep looking UP....Col JDM
4033	1	a	Fantastic Game, one of those games that kind of got lost in the fray, but well worth a play. It plays like an MMO with fantastic Combat and a huge Story!
4035	1	a	this game is like a fairy-tale. you come here and don't want to leave. interesting stories, beatiful landscapes and more. here you can find everything to relax and enjoy the game
4037	1	a	This game is great. there is a big well realised world with a lot of lore despite it being Tplkinesque. i spent a lot of time talking to all the characters to learn more about the world. There is a great sence of freedom and exploration. there are a lot of sidequests and you can spend many hours just playing those without doing the main quest. the combat is a great combination of meelee magic and bow and arrows. since there are a lot of differnt weapons that change up the combat whenever you switch them out. this can only work so well because the gameplay is fluid. combined with good sounds designe the combat feels impactfull despite not being overly graphic and bloody. this is also due to the artstyle of the game that is pritty easy on the eyes. the main story itself is a bit chliche despite the fact you ware raised from the dead and thus have no destiny unlike everyone els in the world. this concept is not used very interestingly and the story boils down to go beat the big bad guy. This is not a big problem since the great artstyle gameplay lootgrind and lore will keep you hoked buy this game.
4039	1	a	This game was amazing when it came, and it is still great today. I played many hours on the Xbox360. This game had much potential for a sequel, it is a pity the company went under. Every so often I get an itch top play which why I grabbed this for the PC as well. I recommend this to all RPG and adventure lovers! Enjoy!
4041	1	a	Fantastic story, great replayability, just wish there was a sequel.
4043	1	a	If Fable and God of War would ever get drunk and end up doing some QTE's of love, Kingdoms of Amalur would be the result.  If you like hacking and slashing away in a colourful fantasy world, this is probably going to be your best buy in a while. Even though the story's not as epic as in other RPGs, there are a lot of cool little storylines going on. And if the story doesn't do it for you, there's the awesome combat. Think God of War light with shakrams, swords, hammers and what not. Add a metric but ton of loot and lore and you've got yourself a great way to spend the coming winter.
4045	1	a	I started playing this on PS3 and really liked the game, so i figuered that I would get it for the PC. if you're a big fan of action RPG's this is a game to not pass by. there is a lot of content that will keep you playing for a good long while.
4047	1	a	Flawless in nearly every way its possible to be. Would have been much better with co-op play but the world design and gameplay are fantastic, if a little to godmode once you get the hang of it
4049	1	a	It's always a good time with KoAR.
4051	1	a	Beautiful game that can show you how free will can work (to a point) has a in-depth story that can surprise you at parts.
4053	1	a	Surprisingly good Action RPG. Combat requires you to time your dodging and blocking and learn the moves of your opponents. Story is pretty good and graphics are beautiful even though its from 2012.
4055	1	a	Great Game.
4057	1	a	Underrated af, but still a great and fairly gorgeous game! Seriously, the voice acting is top notch!
4059	1	a	A great underated game.
4061	1	a	This is one of the best hidden gems out there. Combat is amazing and the world is bright and beautiful. Character customization is on par with other games in its catagory, but gameplay surpasses most others.
4063	1	a	Awesome game - if you like open ended RPGs like Oblivion, and visceral combat like God of War, you'll love this game!
4065	1	a	This game was a lot more fun than I expected. Great action RPG. I really liked that you're not locked into a class.
4067	1	a	So, this is gonna be short. This is one of the mosty polished, expansive and fun action RPGs i've ever played. The level of character customization is moderately high when it comes to appearance but the customization of skills is where this hidden gem shines. The backstory for all the drama that went into creating isn't widely understood by many... but i'll say it was a storm of excrement. A damn shame really.  8/10 Deserves a sequel
4069	1	a	Underrated game! :D  
4071	1	a	Hidden gem of a game. Perhaps too cartoon like for lovers of realism. But if you liked fable you will probably like this.
4073	1	a	  Even though this game didnt reinvent itself, but it had the most enjoyable combat mechanics I have played in a very long time
4075	1	a	Buy it. It's awesome....More after respectable playtime hours.
4077	1	a	If you like action RPGs this is a must buy. Great story, good graphics &amp; animation, the dlc's are quite good as well (especially the Giant one). A bit on the easy side, so if you are a veteran aRPG player crank up the difficulty to hard at the start.  If you are a completist, it will easily take you 100+ hours to complete everything. Well worth the money. Nominated for the hipster game award, e.g I loved this game before it got an award.
4079	1	a	Its a good game, the grafics are good and as an interesting history. I like the part that you can create various combinations between Might, Finesse and Sorcery or you can choose to follow one role. You can create your own weapons and armour wich is nice and you can add enchantements to the weapons like fire, ice, thunder and poison. Its a pitty that this game didnt get a sequel because i like this one very much.
4081	1	a	Underrated.
4083	1	a	I never write reviews for games, in fact this is my first... This was also the first game where i beat ALL of the game.  Kingdoms of Amalur is without a doubt one of the best free world rpg's out there. With a fast paced combat system that varies drastically depending on weapon choice, a unique doging ability allowing for quick strategy, and an amazing storyline crafted by the great R. A. Salvatore himself, this game is one you should not miss out on. Personally, I am a huge fan of R. A. Salvatore's works and my view on the story may be a bit biased in saying it is top notch, but regardless of how biased my opinion is, any fan of fantasy will respect this story and recognize the genius behind it. The graphics are also fantastic in this game as well; i never had a single problem while running it.  All in all, this was a great game for the price. Plus, if you can grab it on sale, as it is now for 5.99, dont hesitate  updating for nomination badge, still an amazing game
4085	1	a	Must have game for any RPG fan. 9/10 overall.   A hugely underappreciated title, even moreso than Enslaved.  Damn shame what happened to this IP. This is by far one of the most entertaining RPGs I've played, with loads of content, fun and deep crafting system, engaging combat, etc. etc. BHG did a really good job.  Pros: -Incredibly bug-free -Fun, smooth, combat -Flexible character development with easy respec -Great storytelling all over -Truely unique world -Great crafting system -I could go on and on  Cons: The only complaints I have are: -No new-game plus, so replay value is limited -The complex zone level-locking mechanic, in order to get the best loot and have the most end-game loot options, you'll want to level as much as possible in each zone before moving on to the next, and plan out the order you visit zones carefully, but that will make you overpowered for some areas; if you don't care about end-game loot you can just play through as you like.
4087	1	a	It is a very solid game. The combat is basically as fun as you want to make it. To elaborate, you can play an archer and shoot enemies from a distance with the occasional dodge, or you coud go with daggers and be right in the thick of it. Both are viable and you can even have both at your disposal to switch either based on enemies or preference. The skill development system is very flexible and allows you to respec by paying an NPC. The voice acting in the game is pretty good. There was clearly a significant amount of effort put into fleshing out the lore of the world for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing. There is an absolutely silly amount of side quests for a single player game. I would definitely recommend it.
4089	1	a	One of the best games from a new studio I have ever played.
4091	1	a	A wonderful RPG experience. Large selection of weapons with unique combos for each. There are no traditional restrictive class system. Instead you can be Warrior-Mage or Assassin-Warrior or Mage-Assassin and any other combination of these class depends on your preference. A lot of armor sets. You can even craft your own armors and weapons and name them.   But there are some downsides, The graphic looks like really old for a game release in 2012. There are a lot of side quest across the world but they are repetitive and less meaningful. The main campaign has a solid story though.   7/10. Recommend to RPG lovers.
4093	1	a	wait....this isn't Skyrim?!!
4095	1	a	This is a great RPG to lose yourself in. Has just about everything you would expect from most MMOs without the hassle of ninja looters!
4097	1	a	Story: 7/10. Can be compelling at times, and bland at other times. It can be a mess with so much going on, and it lacks emotional depth that would normally get you invested in the story.  Visuals &amp; Sound: 7/10: It looks fairly good, but animations tend to feel repetitive after a while. Same goes for weapon and spell effects. It seems a bit uninspired considering how similar it looks to games like World of Warcraft, but if you're okay with that then no issues here. It definitely looks above average. The soundtrack is decent, nothing bad nor is it memorable.  Gameplay: Probably some of the most fun I've had in a combat RPG, ever! The skill progression system and character customisation (combat-based, that is) is spectacular. You can mix and match your character's abilities to range from a regular fighter, to a dirty rogue, to a mystical mage, and everything in between. This definitely has some of the most rewarding combat, level-up, and looting experiences in recent RPG games.  Conclusion: I would buy this game for the gameplay alone. Sure, it doesn't have the most amazing story or unique brand of visuals, but the gameplay value is stunning and will keep you coming back for more. If you enjoy combat-RPGs that give you the freedom to manuever around in combat and rely on your own reflexes and ingenuity to get by, then this is it.
4099	1	a	The title Kingdoms of amakur: Reckoning does not sound very promising. It sounds like the most generic pile of garbage, and in all honesty I expected it to be ♥♥♥♥. However, it turned out to be quite a bit better than I expected.  The highlight of the game is the combat. It's fluid, fast and fun. Nothing special about that really. It's a lot like a fighting system from a hack and slah game. The game does get REALLY combat heavy towards the end, which get's kinda annoying. The fighting can also get repeative, because it's not that complex, and there is just so much of it overall.Actually, my main problem with the game is that it's simply way too easy. I can count all of my deaths with 1 hand, and no, my hand does not have 36 fingers or anything like that. However, I do like the big world, and all the places that you can visit. I really wanted to explore the world and see new places, even though a lot of the tombs and caves are really bland.  On the other hand, the story and characters are really uninteresting. I never really cared about what was happening, and I barely remember any characters, Not exactly a good sign. I am also not a big fan of the visual style, just because it doesn't match the tone of the game at all.   This game is quite lengthy overall. I took me about +30 hours to finish, and in that time I almost got to the max level, and I beat quite a lot of the side missions, so that is pretty neat. I have heard that this game has enough content for over 100 hours, but I personally have my doubts about this. Many things in this game kinda give me the impression that this could have become a new fantasy RPG series, but that will most likely not be happening.  This game is not great, but it's not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. Even though the story and characters are weak, I still had a fun time playing through this game. Generally my feelings towards the game can be summarized with: It's fine
4101	1	a	Very unusual setting and lore but highly recommended!
4103	1	a	One of the best Hack n' Slash RPGs ever made.
4105	1	a	This game is what you could call the 'definitive' version of Disciples 3. It takes a lot from the first two iteration of D3 and revamps it to make something that is actually enjoyable to play.  The biggest problem with original D3 is that it tried to be as close as possible to Disciples 2 in some parts and something completely different (mostly a HoMM clone) in others. The result was an inconsistent, bipolar mess that was neither a proper successor to D2 nor a good rival to Heroes franchise. Not to mention buggy.  D3:Reincarnation tries to reconcile the two dysfunctional aspects of the earlier D3 games, and, in my opinion, succeeds in doing so.  For those who never played Disciples 3 before: this is turn-based strategy game in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic. You start with a capital city and a hero, and your job is to recruit an army, explore the map, gather resources, capture new cities, level up yourself and your army, and eventually defeat whatever is the boss of that map particular map.  What sets this game apart from HoMM, Eador and similar games is the fact that your 'army' consist of only a few characters (the actual number is determined by your hero's leadership skill, but caps at six), each of whom gains experience and levels up independently. For that reason it feels more like leading a party of characters in an RPG, than leading an army in a strategy game.  This impression is enforced even further by the inventory/equipment system for heroes.  Characters don't die permanently unless your entire army gets wiped and can be revived by potions, spells or by paying money in a controlled towns. After gaining three levels, a character 'upgrades' to a more powerful class, granted you built the appropriate building in your capital. Some characters have mutually exclusive upgrade paths, allowing you to customize your army composition to better suit your play style.  When playing single player campaign, your hero retains the levels and equipment from the previous map, but the army starts from square one.   This version of D3 includes 4 playable factions and a campaign for each of them. Campaign themselves were redesigned from the earlier versions and now include water traveling. Character stats were also changed substantially to better fit the new hex-based combat (earlier versions just took the stats system from D2 and tried to make it work in a completely new combat system, with not so stellar results).  Overall, this version of D3 takes all that was good in previous versions and reworks the rest. If you have an interest in this genre, and weren't irreversibly scarred by earlier D3 versions, you should find this to be a very enjoyable game. It may not be Disciples 2, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
4107	1	a	Finally! It comes to Steam Store...  Reincarnation is the real Disciples 3. It's Renaissance+Resurrection, with refined tactical system and magic. Its combat is more like an advanced version from Disciples 2. The Combat area is smaller now, and every unit has their own limited movement and attack range, which makes formation extremely important. Ships and thief abilities are back, too! How could a old Disciples Fans miss all these features!!?? Although there are still a few balance issues (poor Alliance QAQ...), and a little bugs as well (we have some non-official fix. don't know whether the steam version has fixed them or not), the game has the whole mechanic remastered and fixed all the buggy and annoying problems from the old 2.  Moreover, Reincarnation is very mod-friendly. It provides map editor and file-export function. Players could make mod themselves in a very convenient way. Don't miss it! (Really hope it could provide Workshop support  Although, not sure if I may see the Clan back agian in this series.... I really don't want to see them just stand in the wild to give you experience like the green skins do....... Anyway, let's hope the Reincarnation may be the reincarnation for the series... and 'reincarnation' enough to bring us the Clan back in the future...
4109	1	a	Imagine if Disciples 3 never existed and instead Disciples II was actually remade into a next gen game. While the base D3 was somewhat iffy, Reincarnation is an awesome game all around. This was achieved by retooling and improving almost every single aspect of the original game.  Pros: + four vastly different factions with their own strengths and weakness + multiple upgrade paths for units allowing for flexibility + very long (we're talking 40+ hours each) campaigns + the gorgeous art style, graphics and awesome music  Cons: - some rough edges like one or two mismatched voices
564	0	a	I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3. The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so. However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people. And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash 'END TURN' until I have the money to afford them.  The fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.  Of course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible. Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.  There were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way. Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats). Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle. Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.  But ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.
4111	1	a	The definitive version of Disciples 3, with many improvements, but also carries over some of the faults found in the original release. Difficulty still fluctuates all over the place during the campaigns and so missions can turn into grind fests.  Worth picking up on sale.
4113	1	a	This is how Disciples 3 should have been like from the start. Reincarnation is an awesome successor of series. Compared to Reinessance maps are reworked, everything(literally!) is rebalanced and difficulty is just set perfect. Contains 3 base campaigns as well as Resurrection one. Even old rock(melee), paper(mage), scissors(archers) system is nicely remade. I think it's combat is the best I have seen(archers or mages aren't OP) and I played a lot of heroes-like games. Also except some minor translation bugs everything is fine. Buy this instead trying Heroes 6 or 7 uplay disasters.
4115	1	a	I dont know why, but I prefer play Disciples II... but this is not bad at all.  Much bugs was imporved and fixed after the Renaissance and Resurrection!  Reincarnation &gt; Resurrection &gt; Renaissance
565	0	a	Do not buy this game if having access to the editor is important to you. It requires a cd key, which steam will not provide. Attempting to get a cd key from them results in them informing you that the game doesn't come with a cd key and then, if you keep going despite the clearly copy/pasted 'support', telling you that you have to deal with third party support.
566	0	a	Don't buy this,  They promised to fix the original and make the story and gameplay better. They didn't, the story is now very weak, and the gameplay is wonky. you now need to level up 3 times before a unite goes to the next stage, the avarage length of a campaign mission is roughly 900 turns now.  then there are the things that made the original so broken (the crashing, the freezing, the savegames dissapearing) Those are still there. all in all they Broke what didn't need to be fixed, and they didn't fix what was broken.  GG DIII, GG...
567	0	a	If you enjoyed Disciples 2 i would stay away from this one...
568	0	a	I was a fan of Disciples 1 and 2 but all the Disciples 3 games seems to me inferior and not fun at all. The comparison to  Heroes of Might &amp; Magic  is very misleading because, in  Disciples , the level up of your units is so long that you have to keep the same 4-6 units for a whole map and grind slowly with many small battles without an ounce of tactics. The art is not as good as in Disciples 2. And the highest graphics settings don't do any good because of a very mediocre engine. Conclusion : Highly disappointed. I can't see any redeeming quality for this game.
4117	1	a	Being a huge fan of Disciples 1 and 2, I tried the demo of Disciples 3: Ressurection and hated it... When I saw that they went back and made the Reincarnation version I thought that I would try it... I must say that I truly enjoy this version (despite the awkward map scrolling and camera rotation)... In Reincarnation are many of the things that I felt could have improved Disciples 2 and I am happy that the spirit of Reincarnation carries the franchise forward in such a beautifully crafted manner... The sheer beauty of this game coupled with challenging gameplay should please any true fan of turnbased strategy RPGs and I am hopeful that someone will work to make this version modable in the near future... I will admirably give this game an 8 out of 10 score...
569	0	a	I will start with the improvements.   1. More NPC bands and treasure on the map making it easier to level up and makes the terrain map a closer feel to D2.   2. Boats  Now the fails between Older versions of D3 and this pile of poo.  1. The character info screen. Tab #2 to see my XP? It's the stat I look at most often. Wait... WTF! Tabs!?!?!?! The right click character info from the older D3 editions were closer to D2 (and better).  2. The 3 tier levelling process of your support units. Again these guys made changes where older D3 editions got it right. I don't want to dump that much combat experience into a disposable unit before he upgrades. 'Look! I only need to play 643 more hours before my squire levels to paladin'... Go die. This also makes it harder to have multiple well supported leaders, so Lambert has the paladin while your other leaders rock squires and knights.  Side note: Your characters that die in combat also gain experience... This felt strangely like cheating.  3. The smaller battle map. Either copy Heros of Might and Magic, or stick with static formation turn based combat like D2 and old classics like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The smaller map makes it near pointless to move around and puts your ranged units and magic users in harms way like never before.  'Oh, Look! You got creative in an uninspired game'. Your creative efforts have gained you a hybrid, akin to the crap you take that comes out like you've been eating cheese for a month, but leaves your butt dirty like Taco Bell diarrhea.  4. The ranged/magic user unit's attack range has been limited (which was never a thing in any previous installment). Ranged units were weaker, but could hit anything on screen, so you never had to move them into melee combat, or off bonus tiles (in D3). This further weakens an already weak support unit. I assume this was meant to draw ranged units off the bonus tiles by having your melee units 'Run Away!'. Pro Tip: concentrate attack on bonus ranged/magic unit. They will not have that bonus after 1 =&gt; 2 rounds of combat. Limiting range of ranged units = EPIC FAIL!!!!
570	0	a	The game has gotten better then other D3 games, But there are TONS of typos, Bad or senceless sentences. they had over a year to fix this but they havent done that. That soooo says no support, so if you get into trouble with this title, your mostly out of luck.
571	0	a	This game is okay, other than the mindblown fact that they released this game for purchased on steam without giving any serial code/keys to unlock the toolkit. If you guys are planning to buy it for self modding, just don't waste time.
4119	1	a	Ok, I need to write a review about this game. Are you a Disciples fan? Have you found yourself lost in the previous versions for hours on end? Then buy this game. Its better than all the other new 'R' incarnations I can't spell (Renaisance, Resurecction, whatev) since it takes the best from all of them and leaves the rest out. I read some of the negative reviews on here and like a fool I let it delay me from having the best Disciples experience since Sacred Lands Gold. This is polished, flowing, and builds on the previous games while adding modern mechanics and TONS of new artwork. People giving negative reviews can be listened to but their complaints are mostly about Disciples in general. Is it hard? Not nearly as hard as the first Disciples was. Is it tedious? Not nearly as much as Disciples 2 was. The magic is very specific, as in certain spells may sound all-powerful (and be bloody expensive) but there are many times they will be useless in battle. You have to be careful and cherish everything you find. There's lots... LOTS to explore and discover. It will take you a long time to develop powerful characters that can face anything (as in, multiple levels and countless hours), but yeah that's Disciples for you. The game is all about power-matching and countering, like any good magic fantasy, but Disciples was always famous for ramping things up and this version is no different. You will be forever out-matched, that's the point! Courage and charge on! Also, get good at healing and using powerups. Again, if you liked the original Sacred Lands with all its glitchy headaches and miserable gameplay (ie. always being outgunned), then you will like this game. Also, you can now carry forward two heroes with 9 items each to new campaign levels (!!!) Oh and when you resurrect a unit, they retain their experience from the previous battles and will level up upon returning to life if they can! Yay improvements! The art is fantasic, worth it just for that imo, and also if you're obsessive compulsive like me and love a good, complex, interesting and ultimately satisfying game (your souls are MINE you damn dirty elves!)  Hints if you've never played before or its been a while; - When upgrading your leader skills, you should ALWAYS been gunning for the extra leadership point. Adding another member to your team is the best possible thing you can do. - Set difficulty to easy and leave it there. - Legion was always unfairly powerful, its the same this time, so play as them I guess if you're having trouble. Invest in Fiends and have them do the dirty work. - Pretty everything you do should be geared toward upgrading two good, balanced teams. When a member dies you gotta go back and resurrect/heal, yes every time. Pump all experience into the same 8-10 units. Spend all extra cash on leveling up dudes in training camps. - The easy enemies in the beginning are very valuable. Save them as easy pickings for your newest recruits. - Turn the music off or you're going to drive yourself insane! (My last level was 140 turns!!)
4121	1	a	 Interim review:   Holy ♥♥♥♥ I love this game. They fixed the vast majority of  things I disliked  in Renaissance.  If you are interested in the difference between the versions, see  here .  Also changed:  + Tremenduous improvements in the user-friendliness of the UI.  + They added some amazing background songs.  + More polished and sharper visuals, more foliage, better 'time of the day' implementation.  + Hotkeys! (And overall more settings.)  It feels like they really listened to player feedback, and remade the game to a quality it should have been made the first place. Finally a game I really enjoy playing, and feel is a worthy successor to Disciples 2!
4123	1	a	A much better and totally improved version of Disciples 3. This is what it should have been from the beginning. It's a shame that the company shut down before this actually became the primary version of the game.   They got a new voice actor to read the scenario information, which is a HUGE improvement. They shrank the battlefields which was a great improvement for combat. They revamped and rebalanced each unit and hero in the game and they rebalanced all of the scenarios in the game. This results in a much more enjoyable experience. Sadly, it may have come too late for the future survival of this series.
574	0	a	Recommend not playing this game on hard. The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.  Gameplay: Concept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the 'guardians' are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better.   Overall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.
4125	1	a	I don't often write reviews, but many of the amateur articles I've read about the Reincarnation edition of Disciples III have been deplorable and unfair. I am 35 and a lifelong PC gamer. I love strat games. Chess is my #1 game in general and there are few other strategy games I appreciate.  If you know and remember Master of Monsters (Sega Genesis), I say this edition of D3:R is worth your cashola. There are no bugs I've seen (Win 7, nice compy, blah blah). In fact, it's one of the more solid games I've played. I like that I can Alt-Tab out and do other things; the sound stops, the game stays static and contained, totally dependable. I have often kept my Disciples campaign running for days, just clicking into the window to make a few moves and then going about my business, not unlike how I play chess.  There are threads and threads of bad press about this game in its past forms. I tell you, this game is gold -- extremely reasonably priced -- and a great work of art the series of which has culminated in something I am absolutely enjoying. Feel comfortable sending me a question if you like. I'd be happy to defend this software in my private time.
4127	1	a	Love this game! I held of on buying Disciples 3 due to hearing terible things about Renaissance. But after reading how Reincarnation fixes many of the issues i bought it in a heart beat on gamersgate 6 months ago.   The music and atmosphere is great and really makes the franchise stand out compared to other turnbased strategy games. Though the combat is more HOMM like instead of Disicples 1 and 2, its still a very fun game.   I really recommend this game to people who love turn based games, especially to Disiciples fans.
4129	1	a	This is a very polished and balanced version of the original disciples 3 games.  It feels worked, solid and different in every little corner. Map has more stuff now, variety of enemies has been increased and i have the feeling that difficulty is raised a little (in a pleasant way), making map spells essential. If you enjoyed the originals like me, i think you'll find this one pleasantly refreshing. If you didn't like the originals, i think you're going to enjoy this one as it is very professionaly polished. The game remains the same and still gets repetitive. But battles and map movement now feels a little more dynamic.  Voice acting is now mediocre, from laugable-terrible that it was before:).
4131	1	a	It is NOT a worthy successor to Disciples 2, like Heroes 5 is not a worthy successor to Heroes 3, it's not even a TBS, but it's no longer a complete fail like the original Disciples 3 is (who said Heroes 4?).  Patrick Lambert's talent gave life to the world of Disciples 2, a sane grade of realism in a gothic fantasy world where humans look like humans, orcs are orcs and dragons feel like they're alive. Reincarnation is still gothic, but artist's anime abuse shines through all holes, most of the atmosphere is gone and calling one of the protagonists Lambert seems like a bad joke or outright trolling. Treat this game not like a sequel or a remake, but like a fan-made jRPG spin-off in the same universe and you'll enjoy your journey, just don't expect anything special, it doesn't bring up nostalgia.  It's now quite balanced, I've managed to beat the first 3 campaigns on maximum difficulty without much strain and quite enjoyed it. No more spell and resurrect-spamming, no more '4 trolls per enemy party' to keep game challenging and in-combat creature summoning now works 'right' (for those who remember how Zombie talisman was useful in Disciples 2).  Story has some twists and turns, 'darkness in not the evil, greed and indifference are' etc. You're already used to saving damsels in distress, right? What can go wrong?
4133	1	a	Game made with a soul.. good graphics, pictures, maps and creatures..   I've found one negative aspect: computer AI. Enemies is realy stupid in buttle..
4135	1	a	'Just one more turn' game. And for this game it is completely true. It was very difficult to end it and so I spent a several long nights with it. AI is not much but fortunattely no totally dumb and for pre-scripted single player it's clever enough.
4137	1	a	Disciples III Rebirth is the one you want to buy. Unique art and music as ever in this series. It could be love, love, love.
4139	1	a	very good game,i recommend to anyone :)
4141	1	a	dunno what to write. I love it, its as good as disciples 1 and 2 and the new combat system is also a refreshing new aspect. The difficult is hard as ♥♥♥♥ and unfair in the most parts, but it wasnt any different in the previous games, so this is ok for me :)  Finished the first Campaign and cant find any bad aspects for now. Buy it if you like the previous games
4143	1	a	I just want to play this with someone :kattyface:
4145	1	a	Fantastic game, especially for fans of classics like age of wonders and heroes of might and magic. The music and atmosphere is great and the artwork for the different characters is good (although the faces are a bit generic at times) I played through a portion of the Elven campaign and it was very interesting. Only thing I would like to mention is that the difficulty is steep at the start of a campaign and then it gets really easy and I end up just autobattling most fights.
4147	1	a	It's tough, it's got a learning curve as sharp as a knife, and there's almost zero guidance. But my god is the game ever beautiful and full of depth
4149	1	a	A bit difficult to start out but that makes it more fun!
581	0	a	At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.   For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me. On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are 'tough'. And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.  To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.
582	0	a	With beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, and the Disciples name in the title what could possibly go wrong? Well the most important part of the game, the combat, kills the game. It's clunky, difficult to control your troops, you cant pick which direction to attack the enemy from (flanking and such), and the camera acts weird. I've only played like 2 hours and already I'm losing interest. If only they would have designed the battle part of this game better...I'd be hooked.
4151	1	a	Finnaly Disciples 3 almoust without bugs and erors, nice story, pretty long and chalenging campagin. It is really good game. If you like Disciple universe, or turn-based strategy games, YOU MUST, really, MUST BUY IT!
4153	1	a	Finally, in Reincarnation they managed to save the series, because the earlier D3 games weren't even close to how awesome the D2 series was.   Progression is a bit slower than expected and the AI is sometimes unfair, other than that, great game!
585	0	a	This game is bad. But it is that cheesy kind of bad which everybody (OK, die-hard fans of Disciples) like. I suppose the guys tried to sort of remake the Disciples II but got short on money halfway through. In Reincarnation you get no playable Dwarves but you get see and play your good ol' undead and demons and humans from DII. Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable. But hey, bugs, interfacece and level scaling (yep, seriously the game expects you to topple 30level enemy during first campaigns mission when you max level is 5) aside, the storyline seems pretty enjoyable so far.
586	0	a	Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss   Unless you don't want to see a lot of this when you play, then stay far away from this game.   It tries to be Heroes of M&amp;M but the combat is just terrible.  Don't be taken in by the nice graphics and reviews, this is a bad development team based on what I have seen.
587	0	a	I tried to play this game on few occasions, and it always makes me regret it. It's a barely playable mess. Reincarnation is a transformation of original Disciples 3, that tries so hard to be like Disciples 2, that it makes you wonder: why play this, when you have an excellent Disciples 2? Akella made the same game THRICE, and while Disciples 2 is an improvement to 1, Reincarnation is not even close to being equally good as either of the previous entries. They changed this game into a bad version of Disciples 2, worse in almost every aspects (if not literally every).   I can stand the unintuitive UI and sluggish controls, but I can't - for the love of all that is holy - bear the combat and that is my main issue with this game.  First, we have a leader that is completely useless. I don't even know if he will become a force to be reckoned with later on, he is useless at the beginning and dies from one or two hits, while dealing 1/3 as much damage as normal units. Then we have the overall balance of combat; it's INCREDIBLY hard. I don't understand how am I supposed to defeat even one group of enemies that have some overpowered units with hundreads of health and AoE attacks that two-shots my mages and heroes. It's not like they are not standing right in front of my base, guarding basic resources... Is this a game about exploration and looking for that one, specific group of enemies that will allow me to level up? Or is this a game about taking that one-and-only useful hero and a very specific combination of units? Neither of these appeal to me, and neither of these was mandatory in Disciples 2.  Hotseats (that can be played with AI) feels just unplayable. Campaign is barely more bearable, but equally not fun with the clunky, slow and random combat. I felt like they lowered hit chance to around the same, idiotic values as in Disciples 1 or even lower and one, just ONE miss can completely ruin whole encounter.  Mind you, I don't take into account the artstyle and music. It's good, art is even great, but a hit or miss sometimes. It can be gorgeous at times and it can be ugly on another asset or picture, but the overall design is what you would expect from the series: unique and very atmospheric.
4155	1	a	This game is amazing i have been a fan of the series since the beginning when i git a free demo of the game when i was 6 and now play all the games everyday and i am proud to own this game. Dose it have its problems yah but what games dosent and in my opion its worth evry dollar you spend though i am confused on how you do the map editor
4157	1	a	I play this game because its Disciples but im like Disciples II more Disciples II simple and fun more !
592	0	a	The custom mouse cursor in the game is stuck and I have to guess where my mouse really is. Not even gonna bother playing.
4159	1	a	cool game love the series and the story line.
596	0	a	Nothing changed, still unplayable piece of ****.
597	0	a	tedious
598	0	a	I really tried to get into this game, but it just never was a disciples 2 game. The combat doesn't match, the art style is nice, but doesn't match. Not having the dwarves ruins the game too. I want to burn this game.
4161	1	a	Well, do you want to have your TBS collection complete!? This is a MUST buy, it compiles the previous versions within one (Disciples 3 Renaissance + Disciples 3 Resurrection). They also added new content and fixed lots of bugs. This game has a good story, a dark theme that's even reflected in the UI of it...like the previous versions of it. The game is a little difficult for beginners, but a good challenge for those that know how to play TBS games.  And by the way it has nothing related to Heroes of Might and Magic. IT'S NOT A CLONE OF IT!!! Damn, look at a dictionary before, they can be compared but they have their own style.  I could explain features or combat, or even give spoilers, but there are enough videos and screenshots around....but why looking at them!?   JUST BUY THIS GEM AND GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET!!!
600	0	a	still very disappointing, interface and gameplay are very cluncky. Nowhere near as good as Heroes, Age of Wonders, Warlock, etc.  The voice acting, music and art are very good though.
4163	1	a	Any map or this game full a lot of quests, thay are interesting and game is really balanced. Desciples 3 was not good but reincarnation much better.
601	0	a	First of, the game is horribly buggy and impossible to finish, which sucks, because up until now the franchise was brilliant. Dont get me wrong, the game is beautiful and the story is inmersing, but the bugs completelly break the game, many battles (specially boss battles) are simply unwinnable, therefore so is the game. I wouldnt recomend buying this game, not even in sales.
602	0	a	bland, unexciting battles, clumsy controls... really dissapointing game. You have to force yourself to progress, you are not drawn into the game.
4165	1	a	I already own 2 copies of Renaissance - one purchased at Amazon to get the non-updated, non-broken version so I could finish the thing - and 1 of Resurrection - which I've never finished because of all the bugginess and the way the Undead Hordes are so underpowered and handicapped it isn't even funny. Even so, I went ahead and purchased this based on the positive reviews that indicated a lot of the issues have been resolved.   I expected simply a better working, better balanced version of the original but I'm happy to say that this is an entirely different game all the way around. Not sure I'm happy with the new battle mechanics, though, but I suppose I'll get used to it. I can already tell that the balance for the Empire army has drastically changed - not nearly as overpowered as it was, which gives me hope that perhaps the balance of the Legions and the Undead Hordes has improved so that they aren't so weak. On the other hand, I will probably not use auto-combat in this one as much as I did in the others. My army tends to get decimated if I'm not in control.  Another hope is that I won't experience as many crashes as before, although the game did freeze up after one battle. Once I got the game to minimize, there was a low memory warning on the screen that doesn't make sense since my computer is built to be a gaming computer with as much gaming power as HP could give it.   Also have to mention the opening, which is phenomenal. Much better than the original. The storyline seems much improved as well. Kind of makes me wish I could read Russian so I could read the book that was written based on the game.  Despite the nerfed battle system (only my opnion, though), I believe this is going to be $30 well spent and I do recommend the game.
4167	1	a	Really brings back the original essence of the disciples games. Been playing them since the first one and this one feels like a fresh update. Alot more on the same lines as the first two. The first release of the third disciples was terrible and felt like a wanna be heroes of might and magic.  Glad they got it right. Just a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it went on sale for 50% off 12 hours after I bought the damn thing.
4169	1	a	If you enjoyed D2 and would like a more polished spangly version, this is it. Plays pretty much like D2 with knobs and bells on. Pretty good :)
4171	1	a	If you like Disciples 2 then you will love this. they add a lot of things you wish 2 had yet they still missed a lot and the AI is 2 easy to master and out due even on Hard.
605	0	a	I like the old disciples better. Game pace has became is too slow for my taste &amp; high level mobs in the first level, really?
4173	1	a	Much Better than Disciples 3 Gold
606	0	a	A quick disclaimer: I've only played through the tutorial. I think this is enough to review the game, but some may disagree. It's obvious that this is a failed attempt to move Disciples 2 almost verbatim into 3D space, so I'm comfortable laying this out here.  They tried so many times to make Disciple 3 the game it should've been, but it just never lived up to 2. I understand the desire to move the game into 3D, but all the wonderful visuals I loved from the first title were sacrificed in the transition. They changed the battle system to hex-based from static turn-based, like every other game in this genre that felt stale years ago (AoW, King's Bounty, HoMM, etc). While the audio wasn't perfect in the original, it has even less impact now that it did before.
607	0	a	Turn based combat and a overcrowded ui. Looks like warcraft 3, not a bad thing if it was 2002 all over again...
4175	1	a	To buy the rights to a great franchise To delay the release of the game To release with a huge delay zabagovannuyu garbage Not bugs release has FixYa addon When all polymers prostrani to produce sensible optimized version ??? Profit!!! Series characters are driving themselves into an even greater game losing fans Continue to optimize displau Fans to with heroes ??? 2xPROFIT!!!
4177	1	a	so when's Disciples 4?
608	0	a	This game really upset me. First of all I would, say that this game worse that Disciples II. Icons of units dont understandable. Secondy, where is mountain clans? Thirdly, too easy to conquer capitals. Finally, this battle web is so awful. 4/10
4179	1	a	Finally Discpiples game that as good as it should be.
611	0	a	The game is glitchy for me. The mouse pointer does not work. So I can't play the game.
612	0	a	You will most likely ignore me and waste your money but still.... Game is long abandoned. Still have tons of bugs, very poor storyline, gameplay try to look like heroes of might and magic and fails.  disciples 2 better than this in any way. Just buy it if you want real disceples experience.
613	0	a	Have to say, bugs aside (didn't encounter any so far) this game feels very poorly made. The graphics are awfull (at High). The voices are even worse than graphics. It sound's as if someone made the voices for the game while it the toilet. The previous two games were much better evan though they containd a lot of bugs. I am 'Discples' fan and i have played in all of their relises, have to say, this is the worst one so far. I am very disapointed!!!
614	0	a	Terrible game. There's absolutely no skill involved in playing this. Don't waste your time with this terrible rendition of the classical Disciples.
615	0	a	Mouse cursor issue - Game unplayable See Support Forums
616	0	a	New title needed: Disciples, The Miss Simulator
617	0	a	I wish I could recommend Disciples III, since I love the world they built, but the truth of the matter is that this game is an unholy grindfest. With 50 hours under my belt, I've managed to complete 1 of the four campaigns, allowing me to deliver a person from Point A to Point B. That's it. That's all that can be meaningfully said to have happened in the story.
618	0	a	Avoid this one! It plays like an old school HoMM, but it is just broken. The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control. There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited. All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy. You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it! Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more. Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight. I guess that makes it refreshing and new.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay. The graphics are nice too. But, this game is just broken.
4181	1	a	7/10 Not At all like Disciples 2. Way more in=depth. While it has some of the basic functions of other Disciples. it has major differences. Still fun to play and it will challage you. The ai will try to flank you use 'Feign' force to draw you away from it main goal. You will be on your toes the whole time.
4183	1	a	This game is simply Amazing.  The graphichs and the combat mechanics are excellent. The 3d models are extremely detailed and the maps are colourful and beautiful.  I fully recomend the game and especially in its current price is a burgain!
4185	1	a	The hexagonal battle system is a bit different from the rest of the series- graphically the game looks decent, and gameplay wise it's somewhat repetitive but still has potential, unfortunately this lacks some of the variety of it's predecessors- namely in recruitable units and expansions.
4187	1	a	Definetly a must-buy for any disciples fan!
4189	1	a	After reading the reviews I picked this sucker up. A much improved version from the last as it seemed sooooo buggy and unplayable. No problems playing and haven't enjoy the game so much since the original and 2nd games.
619	0	a	Mouse pointer doesn't move in game makes it unable to play. Disappointed.
620	0	a	This 'remastered' edition makes many changes however they seem to mess just as many things up as they fix making it hard to recomend this over the origional, even though both have their problems. I could go into exactly what was good and bad about it but at this point I'd need to replay the game to gather my thoughts again. Comment if you want me to do this... 
4191	1	a	Love these devs.  Not to often you see a dev making fun of themselves. 'In 2012... We released the worst game ever'    The game is pretty fun overall, glad i got it to support them :)
4193	1	a	The game is $1. You pay $1 dollar to play Halo, Killing Floor, and Quake at the same time. You also get a lightsaber. What's not to love?
4195	1	a	Still better than CoD Ghosts
4197	1	a	i mean... i dunno it's alright, it's kind of god awful in a hilarious broken buggy kind of way. But it's a dollar for a few hours of super cheap fun. You have to pay more for a can of coke than this game, and though coke is tasty and refreshing, this game costs less money and therefore is better than coke.
4199	1	a	This game started as disaster with a good idea. With the newest Update a lot has changed and it needs a review from all the bad voters.... it tooks a while but the devs made the effort to finish their product (not like many other bigger studios out there) Worth gaming. Worth buying.  8/10
4201	1	a	Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?  As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.  Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.  In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.  ORION: Prelude [7/10]
4203	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun.
4205	1	a	360 noscoped a T-Rex for 0.49€ 10/10
4207	1	a	You can fight a T-Rex in a mech. That's all you should need to know, unless you live a small, sad existence.  (like the sort of person who makes daily comments on the same Steam review)
4209	1	a	Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.  So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).  This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.  So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!
622	0	a	Both the publisher: TREK Industries and the devs: Spiral Game Studios should be permanently removed from steam. Not only do they steal assets from other devs, they have a long track record of not following through on there development promises. They try and undermind the steam review system by removing valid reviews, they changed the name of a game they never finished so they could re-release it and make everyone pay for the same game twice while abandoning their first game. I for one will never buy a game from this publisher again, not for $10 and not for $0.10. Devs that only have one release game should not be allowed to rename that game so they can release it again to make more money and cheat their customers. If you like Dinosaurs consider buying Ark, survival of the fittest is free, seriously Ark made a second game and charged nothing at all. What is your excuse TREK Industries/Spiral Game Studios?
4211	1	a	Perfectly Simulates Jurassic Park If It Was In Russia.
4213	1	a	For the sweet price of $1 there is little to comlain about.  I've bought $5 sandwiches and spent only 3 minutes on them. This I've spent over 5 hours. That's like 60 sandwiches.   10/10 Would have more sandwiches.
4215	1	a	  TLDR version; 
4217	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and knocked me off the triceratops I was attempting to ride for an achievement 10/10.  But ♥♥♥♥, it was ninety-nine cents!
4219	1	a	OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY ♥♥♥  First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game 'Dino Beatdown'.   Now, let's go with the review: The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs... Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good. Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!  The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...  Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi. Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.  There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.  I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.

4223	1	a	Many people asked me about the game „Orion: Dino Horde“. So I have written a review now. ^^  First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game 'Dino Beatdown', not for 'Orion: Dino Horde' and the game hasn’t only changed the name, its totally different now.  For many people it’s still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright – I would give for it 7/10 points. – You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitches…) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DON’T KNOW WHY!  Really…  I LOVE THIS GAME!    For me it’s like a mix out of “Primal Carnage (Jurassic Park Style) and “Killing Floor plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general it’s about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).   Possible Game Modes:    Slaughter  (lots of enemies)  Survival  (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)  Rampage  (like in “Primal Carnage there are 2 teams “Dinosaurs and “Humans who play against each other and switch after that)  1v1 Duel • Team Duel • Team Elimination • Free for all Duel • King of the Hill • Instagib • Conquest • Gun Game   You can play it  solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).  You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!  During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech &amp; Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles. But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level – there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.   Classes:   Assault  He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (That’s freaking awesome! It’s so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is “Frag Grenade.   Recon  The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.   Support  The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they can’t just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you can’t - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, it’s possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^   Back to the level system:  You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50.    Achievements:   Oh it’s just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.  So all in all.. what should I say… this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure it’s not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isn’t realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~
4225	1	a	Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space? Do you want to shoot Dinosaurs in space with rocket launchers, lazers, and a sword? Do you want to do all that for only a dollar?  Of course you do! Buy this game!
4227	1	a	i quickscoped a T-Rex with an explosive arrow while my teammate crashed a V-Tol into its head  10/10 would crash again 
4229	1	a	Its Halo 2, but with more dinosaurs
624	0	a	After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.  First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.  I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as 'The Worst Video Game EVER!' and 'Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?'. I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was 'the best turn-around in video game history!'. Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. 'It's Halo with Dinosaurs' they said, 'Nonsense!' I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed 'I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!'  So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?  What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.  The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.  Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.   EDIT:  In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game, but my recommendation stays the same.  To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself 'he can't be that bad'. Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?  This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. 'Can you still have fun with it?' Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.  There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.  You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.
4231	1	a	This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, 'I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,' remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.

4239	1	a	Why the hell do games nowadays NEVER have any dinosaurs?  This game has dinosaurs. 10/10, Game of the Year, best 50ct I've ever spent. Seriously, this game was hella fun for a few hours. I'd say it's well worth the money.
4241	1	a	the third person animations on the player models look like deep fried aass other than that it's fun to make these magestic creatures go extinct all over again by brutally blowing their heads off 577/12 - would kill baby raptors again

4243	1	a	Budget wise this is the best and most fun coop shooter I can think of! I bought this game for many of my friends since its so cheap and we always had alot of fun playing it. I dont regret a single second spend playing this game.   10/10 would buy it again.
627	0	a	  Weapons seem pretty weak . I guess its not my cup of tea . The concept is good but it laggs for me most of the time.   Fast paced gameplay , and much spray and pray . however the lagg-spikes make it really hard for me to play :/
4245	1	a	I got ripped off, I spent 1 dollar to buy it, now it's free.
4247	1	a	 ORION: Prelude  is worth a look. It sells for 0,79€. I’d say the price is right. I’d also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. It’s a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks. Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.
4249	1	a	Step 1: find VTOL Step 2: That's it, you win.
4251	1	a	I knifed a pterodactyl while jetpacking over my friend who was fighting a T Rex with a bow and shotgun
4253	1	a	36/100 in Metacritic  #1 in my heart
4255	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar... and I did!
4257	1	a	10/10 best game ever  buy 4-pack and play with your m8
4259	1	a	I got lens flare from looking up at the sky.      At night. 10/10
4261	1	a	It's fun with friends for a few hours every so often. you're crazy if you don't pick it up for this price.
4263	1	a	Where can you go wrong with this game? It's very cheap and super fun. Honestly, I'd buy this game for $10 or even $20. I highly suggest trying it out or even getting the 4-pack so you can play with your friends. How disappointed can you get when it was only a dollar?  10/10 would watch friend be eaten again.
4265	1	a	Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel).   With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:  Original Prelude / Modern Prelude 3 Modes / 15 Modes 5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable) 30 Weapons&amp;Gear / 50 Weapons&amp;Gear 5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps &amp; SDK  It is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.

4267	1	a	I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. 'Games don't fail, only developers do' (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS. This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.

4279	1	a	Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.  Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.  Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.  My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.  You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.  Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.  Pros:
4281	1	a	So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.  Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.  The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!  One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.  Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with 'updates' like most games. 'You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items.' A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.  Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.
4283	1	a	For the price it can't be beat. To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game. It's simple but challenging and fun. it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it. Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great. Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play. I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.
4285	1	a	is it a perfect game? Nope not at all BUT it is very fun i bought it back when it was $0.99 and even though its now f2p i still dont regret it, its a fun fps game to just shoot some dinosaurs trying to stop your generators and you have a large assortment of vehicles aswell as weapons also if you play most of your games offline and solo like i do it completely supports that so grab some guns and blast some space dinos!  (if there is one bad thing to be said its the micro-transaction store for cosmetics im not a fan of stuff like that in any game at all but aside from that its still a solid fun game to play)
4287	1	a	Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting. The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept. A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.   ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old. (Not a bad thing) I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list. There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched. But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer. With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game. With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on. It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish. And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you. Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?  Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.
4289	1	a	Surprisingly fun for its price! Feels good to play this.
4291	1	a	This game is absolutely marvelous, a gem hidden in between triple A games. Not only are you able to express your burning desire to warn someone for a sniper, man. They added a whole other game mode for free! In this gamemode you're able to shoot pre-historic creatures back to extinction while driving vehicles that don't obey the laws of physics.  I would totaly recommend this game if you need a hour to kill.   
4293	1	a	The name will have probably changed by the time I post this, but Super Mega Dinosaur Slaughter Adventure: Space Explorers is not that bad of a game. It's 99 cents, and, while certainly bad, its fun to play. If you have a dollar thats burning in your pocket I'd suggest picking this up
4295	1	a	I was honestly unsure of this game, a friend of mine had bought it for me so I gave it a go. Now there is an issue with lag at some times but it is rare. The up of this game, well it's just fun as hell. I love getting in the cars and just plowing over the raptor. Even my son plays this game with me on another computer. the game is multiplyer or you can go solo if you so wish.
4297	1	a	Plays game for 5 minutes.  Gets trapped in rock for ten minutes. Finally finds the teleport button. Hurrah! Run around dinosaurs with cryo knife taking advantage of their slow turning. Cryo blade a T-Rex and a Triceratops to death. Gets killed by a small and insignificant dinosaur. 10/10 would play again.  
633	0	a	What can I say ? After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money.
4299	1	a	It's fun and it costs less than a dollar. Sell some cards and buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it. Just make sure you have some friends to play with too!
634	0	a	I'm torn. For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there. That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...  No.  The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun. Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc). Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!  That's not to say the game is /bad/. Are there performance issues? Yes. Is the attention to detail lacking? Absolutely. Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while? You betcha. But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends. That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of 'skating' over terrain), and a linear level experience.  For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app. Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing. I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.
4301	1	a	game made me hate pterodactyls  go hear for moor revew:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ceubiesreviews 
4303	1	a	Really fun and fast-paced co-op game!  +focus on teamwork +decent graphics +plenty of game modes -sometimes lags when a lot of dinosaurs are in the area
4305	1	a	Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.)  Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word 'FUN'.  This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much 'fun' for bad feelings to arise.  There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game 'Rampage' you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more.  There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades.  I am completely addicted to this game. :)
4307	1	a	This game is no where near related to it's metascore. First of all, this game has gone through some intense updates that have made it insanely fun. You have the Unreal engine (Which is very good), The Halo-like multiplayer, and YOU CAN KILL DINOSAURS.  TLDR: I ate my friend as a T-rex and I don't think I've ever heard anyone ♥♥♥♥ themself over the mic. 11/10 It's OK - IGN
4309	1	a	It woths more than $9 but on sale with $0.49 tag. 100% WORTH. You don't need to spend much extra money , just head into a survival mode server and take out guns in the weaponary shop , bambambam , fun. It has potential to grow bigger.
4311	1	a	This is the cheapest coffee, And it cant be finished, Didn't sleep for 2 days,yes 2 days straight. Dinosaurs + Jetpacks + Mechs+ FPS + TPS game. 12/10
637	0	a	Stealing content from other game developers and lying to their fans about it, deleting negative comments on their Facebook page, setting up an Indiegogo campaign to steal even more money from their fans (They donated $500 to themselves in the campaign to make it look like it is successful) @  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orion--5#/  , abusing employees (Firing them just before the release of the game and not paying them a single cent), abusing the current publicity they are getting (  http://imgur.com/s4WSxmf  ), threatening to sue people for having negative comments on their company (  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/d4rc74m?context=3  )    https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/   Also, this game is horrible in the first place. I bought this game last year and I have only played 0.1 hours for many good reasons.
4313	1	a	Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.  PROS: - A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles. - A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring. - Very well-made maps. - Different classes. (assault, support and recon) - Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff. - It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first? CONS: - There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved. - When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.  Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now! P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was ♥♥♥♥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for ♥♥♥♥s sake.
638	0	a	The devs jumped ship to release another copy of this game under the name 'Orion' to avoid the press on this game because they stole assets and fired their artists right before release so they didn't have to pay them and are now playing the victim and claiming it's a witch hunt because 'they're a small studio and wahhh AAA publishers are mean'.
4315	1	a	OH my gosh! Instead of buying that Mountain dew for $1.89 buy this instead, trust me its worth it! (Plus you shouldnt even be drinking Mountain dew...Its bad for you!) Ok to start off this review i'm gonna list some pros and cons for it below.  +PROS+ + Very affordable price + Beatiful visuals (Graphics) + Well made interfaces (Ex: Main menu, shop, in game HUD, all of its great really!) +Voice acting seems pretty good in my opinion + Different classes (their is 3 classes) +Has vehicles (Suck on that cod fans!) + Variety of guns (and are upgradable)  + Awesome devs (They admit the game was bad when it was first released and made it so much better) + Great multiplayer + Lots of maps and game modes + Even better deal when on sale (Dont even know how much lower the price could possibly go but it's great for you penny pinchers xD) +Has a uique art style mixed with dinos (Think Halo style mixed with Jurassic Park!) +Easy to make servers! and work well!  -CONS- - Has glitches (like most every other game also has. Very few are game breaking) - Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well) -Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!) -Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)  =Summary= Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of 'TEAMMATE DOWN!' xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, try it out!
4317	1	a	For $0.99 you can go buy a chicken sandwich or shoot T-Rexs with a grenade launcher while flying through the air with a jet pack strapped to your back. Its not even a tough call.
4319	1	a	I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!  I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not?   Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience. Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress. You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves. One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it. I thought that was pretty cool.  The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues. The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.  My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up. I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.
4321	1	a	Cheap game but very enjoyable. though graphics is outdated for me its gameplay is nice. But kinda boring playing alone.And If you go online Few players are there and sometimes no one.  But this game really worth its price .. so i recommend this for every gamers out there.  NOTE: if you dont know the name of some dinosaurs you'll know it emmidiatly when you play this game, and not just their name but also their cute faces.
4323	1	a	The best get stuck in a rock simulator.

4327	1	a	Don't let the low MetaScore scare you away, this game is a blast to play! Ridiculous action, a fun mix of vehicles, weapons and enhancements, and cooperative team-based play. Also, freakin' dinosaurs!  It's well worth 99 cents, for sure, so grab it while it's still on sale if you don't already have it.
4329	1	a	I don't even own the game but yeah.
4331	1	a	10/10 Achievement unlocked for no reason.
4333	1	a	Very good game for only 99 cents
4335	1	a	shot a midget pterodactyl with a helicopter shooting rockets, then i randomly blew up: 11/10 would die again 
645	0	a	This Is way more horrible than the metascore suggests. I dont see how anyone in their right mind would play this for fun, aside from laughing at how horrible this game is for a few minutes. There is a reason this game is only up for 99 cents. The paid reviews should be investigated as well.   Buyer beware.
4337	1	a	A poorly-made, unashamedly dumb game that nevertheless offers equally dumb entertainment.   Pros:  -Drop-in co-operative multiplayer  -Multiple classes  -Customized loadouts (when unlocked)  -Many upgrade paths once in game  -Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you're lucky enough to survive long enough to find them  -Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them!   Cons:  -Occasional crashes  -Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks  -Lack of servers  -Somewhat monotonous level design
4339	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10  Gameplay 6/10 I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you. One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.  Graphics: 5/10 Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -&gt; horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.  Music/Sound: 4/10 I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast. Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.  Performance: 4/10 The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.

647	0	a	Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the 'Play Solo' option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.  It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.
648	0	a	What a huge piece of ♥♥♥♥.  Very poorly optimized.  Framerate is poor and drops constantly. Specially when the dinos come.  Unplayable, unenjoyeable.
4341	1	a	The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our ♥♥♥♥.  Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII. May the t-rexes of the world rot where they stand.
649	0	a	I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.  They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the ♥♥♥♥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the ♥♥♥♥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're: -A hipster -A game collector -A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.
4343	1	a	Lol why did I buy this
4345	1	a	amazing game 8.5/10, me and my friend had invested in this development in order to find an amazing first person shooter. it was on sale for 99c, so we thought, why not. it was the worst game we ever played, so after 1 hour, we immediately uninstalled. Coming back almost a year later, we both downloaded it, as we had heard of the word that it ha totally and utterly transformed into a monster of a game, and we thought, 'How on earth could this be?' We came on to have a bunch of giggles, fun, suspense, action and glory,.....   Biggest transformation i have personally seen in a game.  Great Job game devs, hats off to you lads.  - Good ol' dusky
4347	1	a	Do not listen to the metascore!!! This game is awesome and I've had so much fun playing this game so far, if you are thinking about getting this game for the $.99 get it! You won't regret it.
4349	1	a	Funny game, not as bad as people say it is.. when you get into a game, because there are some connection issues. But it's a fun co op game and if you can get it at a discount, I got it at 93% off, 0,99 € you should get it. 
4351	1	a	A very underated game !
4353	1	a	It isn't great but you'll get 10-20 hours out of it for next to no money (less than £1 is a fair price for what you get).  Make sure to bring a few friends and try and save for the flying tank thing.
4355	1	a	Payed only 25 cent on a sell, 7 hours later, OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER, I mean who the heck does not like dinos and halo like combat? The fact the developers stuck with this over the years shows dedication. Drives a jeep around in circles as dinos ragdoll under my wheels as I squeel about the lighting effects in the game. 10/10
4357	1	a	10/10. Would shoot baby dinosaur in the face in front of dinosaur family again.
4359	1	a	The Devs are extremely devoted to this game, and after seeing what they have in store for this game, i have nothing but gratitude towards these guys. I used to have a bad opinion of them after seeing some bad news on them, but it seems to have been nothing more than some raging internet idiot posting lies. I say get the game, and since it goes on sale so much for $1, you shouldn't have much financial problems from picking this up. What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for. If anything, it would be the dev's devotion and effort to build this game into something beautiful and amazing that caught my attention and encouraged me to recommend this game.  tl;dr - Great game, great devs
4361	1	a	Game is a lot of fun. Many of the modes require exercising precise teamwork. Updates have eliminated a lot of the bugs. The metacritic score does not do the game justice at all.
4363	1	a	Quite a bizarre experience, actually. On the one hand, this game is very buggy and unbalanced, its sound design is just weird... BUT on the other hand, you are killing (and roadkilling) a handful of FAHKIN' dinosaurs and flying around using jetpack. It's kind of like a mix of EDF, Halo and maybe a little bit of Tribes. It could be better but it is good for what it is. ...why do I even enjoy this
4365	1	a	Fun game, lots of problems, get it on sale or whenever they give it to you for free which is almost god damn every month. So, that's a thing.
4367	1	a	I got teleported into a Triceratops and my vehicle randomly exploded. 10/10 would play again
650	0	a	 https://encyclopedia   dramatica.se/The_Orion_Project 
651	0	a	The compeny behind this game is a real flock of scum bags so don't bother supporting them.
652	0	a	very much not a fun game, not worth the dollar it cost
4369	1	a	In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.  And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie. But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).  I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.  Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. &lt;- this was the major selling point for me  Buy it.
654	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/ 
4371	1	a	This game reminds me of of the time I got that dinosaur skull from an auction.
4373	1	a	Is this seriously only £0.79?!  It's fun, it's lively, it's simple. Kill the dinosaurs, secure the objectives, buy cooler guns. This is a bargain, get on it.
4375	1	a	it's not bad.. but it's not great. They tried to mix Halo with a Dino hunt. Good graphics except when they aren't. Good controls that suddenly seem to stop working. (shaking head) I hold final opinon cause it's consistantly getting updates and changes. But get it cheep dudes.
4377	1	a	What the hell Bren, this is actually fun.
656	0	a	When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.  Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.  The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.  Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped. I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.  On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.
657	0	a	this game was a dollar and I still feel like it wasn't worth it  that's like an entire twix bar man
4379	1	a	Great game, very fun to play!   Only problem is losing your arm to dino, which really sucks.
4381	1	a	ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.  This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.  To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.  Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.  Pros and Cons.  Pros:  *The game is fairly cheap. *The community is not dead for now. *The developers may fix all the issues at some point. *The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts. *The graphics are quite nice for the price *You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents  Cons: *Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever. *The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows. *The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen *The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars. *The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater. *Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard. *combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.   I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.   My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming
4383	1	a	wow. such dinosaur. very achievement.  putting a mech on a helicopter  10.000001/10 would glitch again
4385	1	a	Objectively this game is pretty bad, mainly because of the bad AI and stiff animations, but due to it being co-op, and it's crazy concept &amp; gameplay, it still manages to be loads of fun. The developers still update it, too, and so far every update has added something good.
4387	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
4389	1	a	BEST GAYM EVER JHHRURHURADKAD :melon:
4391	1	a	This game is honestly great, you'll buy it for the Horde mode with the dino's and stuff and when i got bored one day i didnt even realise that they're other game modes i could play! This game is worth it!
4393	1	a	Its good fun with a team of freinds and its only 1 euro.  Lots of different modes, maps and weapons and lets not forget the dinos, they are great.
4395	1	a	Yes, this is the game you should buy. Very good for the price.
4397	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is solid. Orion Dino Horde has a Halo/Jurassic Park/Avatar feel to it and I like it! You've got guns, tanks, and planes to kill the dino's. It is mostly PvE but it does have PvP as well. Great pick ESPECIALLY for $1. Get it!!!
4399	1	a	i love this game you must buy and play with me ^.^
4401	1	a	If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said 'I want'. It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.  It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde! (Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)
4403	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
4405	1	a	I've never posted a serious review below a minimum playtime of 40 hours, but consider the following:  the average wage in western europe is above €6/h this game costs about 20% less than an espresso  If I ever want to get my money back, I'll have to work 8 minutes overtime, or walk past the coffee place next morning. I could never down-rate a game that cheap.  Besides, just the mere existence of vehicles and sandbox maps give Orion a very good replay value. Sometimes it feels like back in 2007 on Halo 2.  
4407	1	a	 I'd buy that for a Dollar!
4409	1	a	Shooting raptors while flying through the air in a jetpack. Sniping pterodactyls on top of mountians. Driving tanks head-on into battle against a giant alligator. And best of all, flying a VTOL through the air, laying down covering fire for a teammate trying to make it to the base. 10/10 best buck I ever and ever will spend.
4411	1	a	If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.   Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.
4413	1	a	It's pretty much Halo: Reach but you're killing dinosaurs instead of screaming children.
4415	1	a	Do NOT trust metascore ! This game is pure awesomeness ! Spread the word and join !
4417	1	a	The game I feel that it is underrated and it's developers have been keeping to their promises and are still developing it with community ideas with support from people.
4419	1	a	I was shocked when I saw this game being sold for 0.99 €, so I decided to write a review. This game truly made a great leap in development and is an acceptable, fun and fast shooter with many game modes, maps, enemies and vehicles. Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.  I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c
4421	1	a	Great Game! Best game i have played in a long time, And it is better then some $60+ games! 10/10 would recommand it, Hours of fun!!
4423	1	a	Old review was completely inaccurate and overly subjective, stating in a nutshell, 'this game has jetpacks and dinos what more could you want?' Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun. Even more stupid and even more fun with friends, and really its best described as Just a Good Time. Quote that too. It's fun.
4425	1	a	Best game I've ever played in my life 11/10
4427	1	a	My mum bought this for me and told me this is COD:GO the dinomen mod but there was not enough black men without eyes. - Halnoter Jafin
4429	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HOt0ZOcYk 
4431	1	a	its kind of good
661	0	a	its not worth 1$
4433	1	a	Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks.   Doesn't sound relaxing enough?   Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?  And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were 'Transformers' quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.   Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26/10 would recommend to public ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Best game on Steam. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4435	1	a	THIS GAME IS ONLY .99 AND ITS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS I PURCHASED 5 COPIES OF THIS AND SENT TO FRIENDS THIS IS A COMBINATION OF HALO + BORDERLANDS 2 + Planetside 2 I ENJOYED IT A LOT 10.5/10
4437	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
4439	1	a	If you're going to buy a game in which you wield lightsabers, shoot your friends and blow the tar out of some massive dinosaurs while flying hundreds of feet up in the air, I would probably recommend this game above other games that fall into those categories. Most likely.
4441	1	a	I like this game. Glitchy as at times and it does seem a bit chucked together, but fun all the same. Really, for 79p it's not like you are wasting your money. You'd get more hours out of this than you would goes on an arcade machine :D
4443	1	a	Definitely far from a bad game. If Borderlands had a Horde Mode sponsored by the National History Museum's Dinosaur wing, this is it.
662	0	a	I got this game for free.... and I want my money back.
4445	1	a	Nice game but it has some things that could be done better but the benefit that it's a cheap game makes it good. :)
663	0	a	horribru
4447	1	a	The metascore may be low, but this game is real fun with friends
4449	1	a	I think I shot a dinosaur and it moonjumped into space, came back down to Earth at break-neck speeds, and survived impact only to land in water and drown.  Why aren't more people playing this, again?
4451	1	a	I was riding on the back of a T-Rex.  10/10
4453	1	a	BUY IT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!  Edit: Oh wait its free...
4455	1	a	METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE
4457	1	a	After reading the reviews, I bought this game thinking I would get a few lolz with 3 friends for 3 euros. After playing for a while, I have to say that this game is ridiculous and looks funny, but it is also absolutely fun and awesome.  Animations look weird, graphics are dated and some illustration are hilarious in a kitsch way. It can be confusing too and doesn't make much sense. But as long as you don't take the game seriously it's surprisingly fun. Just try it if you can without expecting too much. It does a very good job at making you forget its flaw.
4459	1	a	I played this game for 25 hours striaght for Extra Life 2013, and despite the obvious exhastion of playing a video game for that long, it was a surprisingly fun experience! There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with. Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up. As of this review, it is on sale for $0.99 and Free-to-Play, so at least give it an hour of your time, and be patient with it.
4461	1	a	Really cool game tbh. Looks cheap bad etc... BUt truly its a great game with a bit of call of duty in it and some nice graphics really cool ideas and creative!
4463	1	a	36 Metascore, everytime for 1 Euro... Dont care about that... The game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!
4465	1	a	no one told me it had dinosaurs, completely misleading.
4467	1	a	Definitely better than what the metacritic suggests. And for $1 right now... totally worth it. Get it while it lasts! Has the structure for replayability, especially with friends.  Edit: The previous was my inital reaction. A more detailed review to come.
673	0	a	This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usally found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game  just  went below average.
4469	1	a	My friend said to me 'hey Protahto! this will be the best decision you ever made', I believed him. I have since killed myself from the hatred I bear for this game. Has some neat holiday themed updates. Fun times ahead. 8/10
4471	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
4473	1	a	A First Person Shooter. Check! Multiplayer? Check! Upgradable Weaponry? Check! Stealth Camouflage? Check! Jetpacks? Check! Tanks, Mech-warriors and other Military Grade Equipment? Check! Oh, yes... Dinosaurs, hungry for your blood? Check!  I have not had such a lot of fun in ages. Mutiplay with friends in Co-op is awesome. You should get it just for that. 
675	0	a	too many glitches and stuff they need to fix them
676	0	a	Pay real cash for in-game items for a game which you already paid for?...Really?...Might as well make it free to play then.
4475	1	a	drive around run around fly around and kill those dinos. loads of fun and laughter and best played with friends!
677	0	a	So I see a ton of reviews stating that 'This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!', but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.  Pros: The game is 0.99c. It has co-op in so many ways. It has pvpve. it has hordes of dinos. It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank. There are lots of weapons. Conquest mode has a very interesting concept. It has the old announcer styled 'Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect'.  Cons: There is a bug that allows your 'Private' server to become a public server without warning. There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears. For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use. If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much. Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.) Getting stuck on spots is very likely. The tank's machine gun is ear ♥♥♥♥ much like the large dino roars. The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will. There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds. They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now. The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos. There are still other bugs that have not been adressed. Controllers still do not function properly with the game. The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems. This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.  So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that. So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.
4477	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score. It's freakin' awesome. I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.  In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades. There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade. That's how they work though, accomplish an 'acheivement' and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the 'acheivement' granted you.  I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun. Not to mention, look in their 'recent updates' area of thier Steam page: 'Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!' Read it. Enough said.  Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it. If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's 'Sales' section got me again.  It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.  Buy it. Play it. You won't regret it. At least try the free 2 days!
4479	1	a	Even though many people says that it's bad, I had alot oof fun with it. I recomend playing with friends for maximum fun.
4481	1	a	Orion Dino Horde Is A great Game! it literaly grabs you into the world where you must fight dinos for survival BUY IT NOW BEFORE THE DINOS EAT YOU!
4483	1	a	♥♥♥♥ING BEST GAME YEAAA 10/10 A MASTERPIECE
4485	1	a	Halo ft. Dinosaurs. Still buggy but constantly updated, get some friends, crack open a box of Scooby Snacks and don't go into the long grass
4487	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play Halo 3, or Borderlands but you were too ♥♥♥♥ing stingy? Well Orion Dino Horde is the game for you! Bungie, and 2k obviously stole many aspects from this game. Including the borderlands vehicle controls, the second wind, actions, and many other aspects from borderlands. Now on to the halo guns, textures, hornets, and character models. Great Game! This quote perfectly shows this game 'I paid $3.99 for this game, and its better than most of my other $60.00 games.
4489	1	a	If you have £0.99 its a must buy! Better yet buy 4 copies for £2.99 then you can give them too your friends when they ask why you don't come outside anymore... I see dead dino's... and I love it.
4491	1	a	The metascore is definitely something you should just ignore. The developers have really done a fantastic job and I hope that they will continue to do so. The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.
4493	1	a	Don't let the metacritic review stop you from getting this game. Great buy with good multiplayer and forces you to work together or you won't survive.
4495	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 would play again
4497	1	a	It's hard being a support class. Everytime there's a support class, you are expected to heal/support team mates while saving your own skin. If your team mate dies 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT' , if you die 'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT', if your whole team dies 'WHERE THE HELL IS THE SUPPORT?'. RIP support class for being too supportive :(
4499	1	a	EPIC dino killing!!! Ps. the METACRITIC Score is WRONG!! its for the old version, this is Mk2, all new and improved!!
4501	1	a	an unpolished gem, get more servers and you guys good to go. im having fun playing with my friends, but with a helluva ping. 8/10
4503	1	a	I love this game ! :D
4505	1	a	You get Halo, CoD, and one heck of a FPS for .99 cents
679	0	a	Despite having a relatively good computer, I found it really hard to play this game. Many of the reviews had good things to say, though, and I wish I was able to experience all that it is capable of.  Maybe I'll try again at another date!
4507	1	a	Didn't think I'd like this CS:GO-inspired kind of game, but oddly, the first time I loaded it up and played a little bit, it was like the first time I played Zombies. It's so simple yet addicting and for $0.49, no one can argue that price.
4509	1	a	YOU SHOOT DINO'S  AND DRIVE MECHS AND DRAGON FLYS (TO GET MAD AIR)  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ MORE DO YOU WANT?
4511	1	a	This game made me realize that judging a game based on Critic reviews is a big mistake. I just don't know why people complain about this game. This game is very enjoyable and has hours of fun!
4513	1	a	Rightful winner of Game of The Year every-year 
4515	1	a	Really laggy but the eleven minutes i could play were awesome!!! I love how the dinos teleport!!!
4517	1	a	cool.
4519	1	a	When I first bought this game for 1 dollars.. I was like holy &amp;%^$ this is such rubbish game, not even worth for 1 dollar.. Never going play it again, I even wish it remove from my account.. Last night saw one big update and I thought it might my pc delete by mistake and download it again.. until i saw big news about developer change this game completely! My eyes pop out when I saw the big changes on graphic.. today i give a try.. WHAT A AMAZING GAME!!!!! Spiral Game Studios.. please read this review.. THANK U FOR LISTEN TO ALL FANS.. I going recommend this to all my friends and trying ask them to get this! 1 Dollar? I believe it shall be price more than 1 dollar because it brilliant! I just need you to fix chat log, make it more more clean and simple like others game in co-op please :)
4521	1	a	love the game, wish i could delete all my progress so i could experience the thrill again from leveling up and getting stronger doing so.
4523	1	a	This game is T-Rexcellent.
4525	1	a	I really love how immersive this game is, it's like a mix of jurassic park and halo came together and had a brain baby, this game is very fun and I personally recommend it.
4527	1	a	This game started out as 'meh whatever' and is now skyrocketing somewhere between 'neat' and 'awesome'. While it's not a AAA title game it is also not available for $50- anything below $15-20 for this game is something you cannot say no to. Whether you just wanna mow down a ton or Dinos with your friends or wanna mow down a ton of friends as a dino- this is the game for you.
4529	1	a	After about four hours of firing non-stop rockets into an unending wave of invisible raptors with bright orange heads, I'd say this game was worth the 50c I paid for it.  The horror never ends.
680	0	a	How to play : Play for like 2 mins max and delete
4531	1	a	10/10 would get chomped again.
4533	1	a	worse than cancer 10/10
4535	1	a	I've put in a lot of hours into this game and it's better than last two COD games released! I'm looking at you COD Ghosts!!! Anyways, the game is highly adictive and fun and may have some issues if you're playing solo or online! Unless you got a really good gaming computer like Alien or similar, than disable blooming and dynamic lighting! (even though it takes away from the overall awesomeness it brings to the game) And set the game to windowed mode to help out with makeing sure you have a better speed! (May not work for everybody) Overall this game will bring back nostalgia of Turok while adding other styles of games to make a familiar, yet unique, style of gameplay! Hope you guys (and gals) have as much fun as I have with this game!
4537	1	a	It may be a really cheesy game, but metascore is way too low. It has no outstanding features, but playing co-op (especially with friends) is a real blast!!!
4539	1	a	This game is Awesome. You can drive cars and fly Helicoptors.
4541	1	a	Definatly worth 99cents
4543	1	a	I have to say, this game has turned out to be pretty awesome. Keep up the good work devs, and thanks for making a fun game.
4545	1	a	This game is ridiculous. But it's worth a shot, if you play with your friends. For only a buck it's a decent experience. There's something about this game that gets people playing it, I guess, it's the mindless run-shoot-upgrade model. This game has its fun, but you have to give it a time. I enjoyed this shooter much more than L4D2 for instance. Also, it has one of the most easiest-to-acquire achievement system, I have encountered on Steam. My overall rating – 6/10, because, after all, this game is shallow and with lots of bugs.
4547	1	a	This is the most 99 cent game I've ever played
4549	1	a	has potential. if the creators did not throw the game, and will make a few improvements, will be a great game
4551	1	a	there be dinosaurs; u shoot them more importantly, u could almost buy a candy bar, or get this game instead
4553	1	a	this is one of those games that makes you want to take a bath with a toaster 10/10
4555	1	a	Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.
4557	1	a	These developers man. Selling this game for $0.99? This game is better developed than any early access and most recent full release titles. Well worth the amount you spend on it if you have a friend to play with.
4559	1	a	best game NA jimmy buy this right now u cok guzler
4561	1	a	It's like cs go, but with dinosaurs  11/10 - Would play this game again (with friends this game is a must own)
4563	1	a	this game is sp00ky, 10/10 would bang
4565	1	a	Like this game came out of nowhere. It was truly outrageous. Phill Fish really knocked it out of the park. Cancelling Fez 2 was worth after he made this magnificent masterpiece. Truly the best game i've ever played in my entire life.  ༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽༼ ◕_◕༽
4567	1	a	ORION: Prelude  Would totally recommend this game! It's a fun dino FPS that's great for playing with friends. You capture bases, buy weapons, get upgrades, and fight off dino hordes!  PLUS if you like getting achievements there are tons that come really easily, mostly from just casually playing the game.  Picked this up for $1.50 in the steam summer sale and would give it an 8 - 10
4569	1	a	This is a really good game, not 'good because it's cheap', but this game stands on it's own merits. Lots of fun, good feeling weaponry, the graphics are simple but clear and attractive. Strongly recommend.
4571	1	a	Great Game For MultiPlayer And Killing Different Dragons !!! &lt;3 &lt;3 but shuld inprove a bit cause it's a bit of a mix of Halo i hate Halo but when i m playing it i kida foget about it :)
4573	1	a	'Very Great Game indeed' -Quote from ME! :D  I would play this game MORE often if I get a better Pc,Who wouldnt buy a game thats 1$ and great graphics! :D
4575	1	a	PHEW *Wipes Sweat From face* Just got done playing a conquest on wave 30, man what a ride it was.  It was litteraly the most enjoyable 2 hours spent on a match i've ever had!  There was never a dull moment each part had action killing murdering beating down dino noobs across the tundra. Got in my VTOL/Helicopter started wrecking all types of dinos across the map I felt like the damn ice age myself the way i was killing those dinos.  DOUBLE KILL TRIPLE KILL MEGA KILL ULTRA KILL ARMAGEDDON LAST BUT NOT LEAST BRING ME SOME PIZZA!  Those are the coolest kill streak quotes in the game i feel like a damn boss when they guy is telling me all that mojo! This game has AWESOME REPLAYABILITY I RECOMMEND GETTING IT NOW WHILE IT'S ONE DOLLAR! You're paying one dollar for a game that produces $60 of fun honestly, which in my book is pretty darn good.  Highly Highly Highly recommend this game to all you guys looking for something new or something to play with friends with this is you're game I for sure know it!
4577	1	a	Jetpacks, guns and dinosaurs. What more could you want? Tanks? yup, got that. Multiplayer? What else IS there? Fancy devouring the corpses of your vanquished foe? Got that.  Best game ever, 10/10
4579	1	a	Insane level  Active the generator, kill raptors, restore the generator, , kill compys, restore the gen again, almost die ; revive, buy weapons upgrades,kill dilos ,secure the outpost killing a trike and 236 dinos, back to base without press 5 and no vehicles, a rex is coming; poor rex, be a sniper; dead by rhams,help mates; dying in front of you,buy all augments , even the antifreeze in slopes, bots stuck in a wall; annoying sound, trike smash; die in high grass, buy smoke ,last dinosaur in wave; rahm stuck in a high rock sooooo far away....  Kill everything using the gatling gun with the assault class... 11/10
4581	1	a	♥♥♥♥ it was ninety nine cents.
4583	1	a	It plays like Halo! It's got Dinosaurs but it's a breakfast cereal! 
4585	1	a	Totally Worth 99 cents
4587	1	a	gameplay 1/3 story 9/1 graphics 2.14/6 moms 8/4  Overall 10/10 Game of the last year
4589	1	a	I was hesitant to get this, because of its metascore, but it's actually worth it. This game is a great FPS that reminds me of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (anyone else?), but I can guarantee you that this game is original and only reminds me of it. In this game, you kill dinosaurs with guns, something I've always wanted to do as a child.  In spite of a few bugs here and there, this game is pretty good (very good if you got it for its sale price). With just a bit more development, this game has the potential to get its metascore where it schould be.  I rate ORION: Dino Horde a 7.75 out of 10.
4591	1	a	This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing fun its unreal. There is a survival horde mode and PvP. A solid 10 hours of fun AT LEAST
4593	1	a	shot an Dino in his ♥♥♥ and he blew up 10/10
4595	1	a	Best game I ever bought
4597	1	a	Okay, Metacritic failed the score for this game! I got this when it was on sale for $1, but I still recommend it at its $15 price tag. Basically, its killing dinosaurs with mechs, and on a lot of servers, you can BE a dinosaur.  Hours of fun, so buy it now. Overall rating: 88/100
4599	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥.... 
4601	1	a	It's kind of a glitchy game, worth a dollar. Graphics are 'ok' but still good enough to have fun.
4603	1	a	this is a fun game and at one point you can be a dino yourself 
4605	1	a	Dinosaur shapes , chef boyardee ~ DINOSAURS! ~
4607	1	a	Counter strike with Dinosaurs, do you really need anything more? You even get classes to buff yourself up so you can HACK INTO DINO ANKLES WITH A KNIFE
4609	1	a	DO YOU HATE PREHISTORIC LIFE? DO YOU HATE THEM ENOUGH TO MURDER THEM WITH VARIOUS FUTURISTIC WEAPONS?? IF YOU'VE ANSWERED NO TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, DO A 360 AND RE-EVALUATE YOUR LIFE CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS (AND THE OCCASIONAL QUADRAPED) TO TRULY FEEL SWEET JUSTICE AGAINST THAT VEGETARIAN STEGASAURUS THAT KILLED YOUR FAMILY BACK IN 'NAM. YOU OWE IT TO THEM (AND THE PRESIDENT) TO SEEK JUSTICE AND REVENGE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. TAKE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A DANGER TO YOURSELF IF YOU GO ALONE, SO BRING FRIENDS. NOT ME THOUGH, I'M BUSY.
4611	1	a	Definaltly one of the best, most funnest multiplayer games and fps games. Don't listen to metascore. I have no idea how they gave it a 36. It deserves like 106! Just get it. GET IT NOW. You need this in your life. You won't regret it.
4613	1	a	I heard bad reviews coming into this game, but me and my friends ended up having an absolute blast playing it.
4615	1	a	hands down the best game you can get for $0.99. tons of game modes and cool guns! perfect for the jurassic world hype!
4617	1	a	I played this game a little while ago and it wasn't terrible but it had things in the game that just were not done well. But now it seems the Developers actually saw this and unlike other game devs they actually fixed ♥♥♥♥. NIce job
4619	1	a	Pretty good game, I like getting the handheld minigun as support, and having the self healing as that class to is a teensy bit OP, and the start pistol is pretty OP for that too, but really good game overall
4621	1	a	If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?  Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion)   ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored? You scroll down your games list looking for games you guys both have and wanna play. Well lemme tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is always a game that we agree to.  Check it our, join in, be a part of the community, and shoot some dinos!
4623	1	a	Super fun game the score is very deciving its super fun!!!
4625	1	a	Fun game for the price! I feel like I got my monies worth.
4627	1	a	its like battlefield and borderlands 2 had a dino baby
4629	1	a	At first this game didn't seem that apealing, but when I started eating it I kind of liked the taste.
4631	1	a	A lot better than it looks. It's like Shadow of the Colossus, mixed with iCarly.
4633	1	a	Noscoping dinosours has never been so fun.
4635	1	a	I had a difficult time choosing if I wanted to buy this game or not. Sure, it's only a dollar, but I guess the guy behind it pulled some shady dealings, so I couldn't decide if I was okay with that.  After much though, I came to the conclusion that a buck was worth giving the game a try, and I'm glad I did. While there are still a few bugs in the game, it's fun and refreshing. I didn't realize just how much we really needed a dinosaur game!]  If you can overcome the moral arguement of the game dev, and overlook the outdated metascore, this game has a lot of potential.
4637	1	a	If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.
4639	1	a	It's Halo. BUT WITH FRICKING DINOS. nuff said
4641	1	a	It's 0.79p?  what you waiting for i got more enjoyment out of this than COD AW   no surprises though :(  but this game for 79p   go.
4643	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME 
4645	1	a	This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.
4647	1	a	Probably the worst game I have ever played. 69/11
4649	1	a	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   ITS LIKE HALO. SURVIVE AND THRIVE. And watch to Dactlys.They seem to be annoying trying to swoop down on u but get a couple of buds and u can survive them.Totally worth to buy it.
4651	1	a	this game is so fantastic i cream my pants EVERY TIME I PLAY IT ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE DINOSAURS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH
4653	1	a	Stole the lightsaber sound from star wars 8/8
4655	1	a	When I bought this game i got to blaze it everyday with a T-rex. T-REX IS LOVE! T-REX IS LIFE! 10/10
4657	1	a	This game needs better optimization but its good. I wish this game had a better explanation of the gamemodes, and it had more unlocks. The game dinos just seem to be repeating and have very bad sprites.
4659	1	a	I thought dinosaurs were the scariest thing about this game. Turns out it's the bugs.
4661	1	a	The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score. Good gameplay - almost the same if you combine Halo and Jurassic Park together. Makes you nervous everytime you queue solo for the game. Best to play it in multiplayer. Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.
4663	1	a	For a dollar, this was one of the craziest and most enjoyable games I've purchased. The fast-paced hordes of velociraptors, pterodactyls, and eventual T-rex is absolutely amazing with 4 of your friends, if not complete strangers. Not to mention the insane abailities and vehicles, like jetpacks and health stealing, or tanks and mech suits.   Buy this game for a buck, and kill dinos without giving a ****.
4665	1	a	team duel - the most fun i've ever had gaming - 5v5 using only lightsabers, bows, temperary stealth and super jumps... need i say more... no, no i don't.
4667	1	a	Super fun with friends. Rough around the edges but still really fun. For less than $3 100% recommend. Just buy the 4 pack and give it to your friends.
4669	1	a	I probably paid somewhere around $10 for this game when it was actively being worked on. It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you. Well worth the $0.99.
4671	1	a	Was not expecting this to be much of a game halo vs jurassic park was my first impression oh how wrong i was its a challenge its funny and iwould suggest everyone gives it a try. survival mode multi player awesome times grab a can grab your mates and get to killing everything that moves :)
4673	1	a	One of the best games I have out of my almost 100 game steam library! The Metacritic is wrong. Other than connection problems, the game has no problems. It gets better with time. The Devs really deserve for this game to be played. GET THIS GAME ALREADY!
4675	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
4677	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
4679	1	a	Very fun game! Great Co-op style and is like fighting a militia.
4681	1	a	nice game and it is cheap. Good for playing with friends for few hours.
4683	1	a	Got rekt by a stegasaurus while running from velocirapors. 10/10 would die again.
4685	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
4687	1	a	THIS GAME was pretty so so, yeah, my friends didn't want to play it anymore
4689	1	a	I'm bad at writing reviews, but this game deserves another thumbs up, so here you go. Easily worth 10 to 15 bucks. Pure madness they are selling it this cheap.  Also, these devs deserve way more attention and praise. They kept working on their game, kept releasing free patches and updates for years. In a world where abandoned Early Access games and bug-ridden triple A titles are daily routine, these devs are showing exceptional dedication both towards their game and their customers.
4691	1	a	It's Halo with Dinosaurs
4693	1	a	This is a great game, it's has alot of playibility due to workshop. Multiplayer is great and graphics are good
4695	1	a	It cost me less than two dollars. And I can shoot dinosaurs.
4697	1	a	The first time I was killed I was dropped 200 feet to my death by a pterodactyl.  Fun game to play for an a short time period. I can't sit and play it at length like I can a lot of games, but if you're looking to waste an hour or so it's a great game for it.
4699	1	a	better than ARK
4701	1	a	Soooooooooo This game finished downloading; so I decided to sit down and play it at (around) 12:15 AM Eastern time. When I look around or just stand still the screen tears and graphical errors seem to occur. Combine this sleeping and tired eyes and you can either   A. Get yourself a headache B. Go Blind C. Get an EXTREME seziure  Or the common effect D. All of the above!  4.5/5
4703	1	a	one dollar is well fukken cheap for good game... but then THEY DISCOUNT IT INTO HALF.  I mean, even it's cheaper than I buy coffee without the cup and sugar!  10/10 good game, best price.  np: even now I feel guilty when buying this at halved price.
4705	1	a	Killing Dino's have never been so much fun!!! Teamwork is great and all... but killing dino's with tanks and what not just takes the cake!
682	0	a	I dont know if im doing something wrong but i have big fps lags with this game, when the rest of tha games i have works well
4707	1	a	Like killing Dinousaurs? Want a first person shooter? Do you want to drive tanks, fly helicopters and control mechas? Or what if you want to be the Dinousaur and kill the other players? Now imagine you can do all this in one game. Welcome to ORION: Prelude :P
4709	1	a	I just picked a 4pack up for 3$.   Pros vs Cons:  Pros: Dinosaurs Jetpacks Mechs Tanks Dinosaurs  Cons: I can't find a laser..but there is a F'CKING LASERSWORD..  Really, for 1$, there are no cons. It works, I had fun. And I KILLED DINOSAURS USING A JETPACK.  Buy it.
4711	1	a	Just buy it
683	0	a	So it got updated. And nothing from what I've noiced has changed. It's still the same boring buggy mess when it was orion: dino horde. Just go buy primal carnage instead. That's an actual good game where you shoot dinosaurs.
4713	1	a	this game is so good. i have a great time using the battlefield 4 guns. the graphics are better then real life view. there is a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ places like riding the T-Rex.  i enjoyed the most to replace the guns! once in a life time experience
4715	1	a	Mid or Mac because Mid is not Mac but when Mac is Mid it is
4717	1	a	This game is the ♥♥♥♥!!!  9/2 Would not ♥♥♥♥.  play it
4719	1	a	fun and amazing I love it. one of the best Dino games I've played
691	0	a	This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde
4721	1	a	ok, i can't beat around the bush here, this game is fun AND ONLY FUN with friends if you're a neckbeard loner lurker on ♥♥♥♥♥ then this game is the equivalent of having a dinosaur mug you for 15 dolans or 1 dolan if you got it during the sale, with friends you can make fun of how stupid and awful and dumb and fat and ugly and mean the game is together, unite people with the hatred that is this game. its fun with idiot pals 4/10
697	0	a	Grafica e naspa.... Graphic is to low and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥....
698	0	a	if u want good graphics this is not a choice for u
4723	1	a	What Jurassic Park could have been if it had a good director like Michael Bay.
699	0	a	Eh. Can't launch a game with a friend, that's kinda why i bought this :/ if this gets fixed i might change my mind. why release a game that has that many bugs?
4725	1	a	this is the game of the year, if you dont have this you might as well just give up. buy the 4 pack just for yourself and have pride in having 4 copies of this game. dont trade any of them away. truly a masterpiece of our time 7 flamingos/5 flamingos.
700	0	a	its like a worse version of primal carnage. the sound and movement aren't really sinced at least when u shoot.
4727	1	a	Better than Angry Birds
4729	1	a	This is probably the best game that you can get for $1 (on sale)! Only thing I don't like are the microtransactions (purely asthetic). I would have preferred to unlock all the asthetic's through playing the game but really it's quite minor. This game holds it own and seriously is more fun and addictive then the shooter you are playing right now. It's a must get.
4731	1	a	Don't trust the Metacritic score. This game is absolutly amazeballs.
4733	1	a	After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after. Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core. The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game. It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay. Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.
4735	1	a	Cheap and Good ^^
4737	1	a	There's dinosaurs?! That was scary as all hell!
4739	1	a	This game is so awesome now, shooting dinosaurs for only 99 cents! I bought 4 copies of this game for 1.50 euros to give to my friends and play together. This game is very fun and challenging for a couple of hours. ORION: Prelude is totally worth your money: 8/10
4741	1	a	You like halo?!?! You like dinorsaurs?? Than this is the game for you!!!
4743	1	a	Stupid amount of fun, especially with friends. Worth it for the price no doubt
4745	1	a	I had this game for a while. It is pretty damn fun. Think Killing Floor with Dinos in the far future with vehicles and you get the idea.   Also while its on sale for 99 cents, why the hell not!?
4747	1	a	Was ♥♥♥♥ at the start, developers were like '♥♥♥♥ me with a mango flavored popsticle, looks like we gotta improve this ♥♥♥♥.' and then they gave us an update more vicious than a hobo hurling out of his trolley in believe of hearing a 5c coin dropping to the ground and seeing you about to pick it up. This game could kill a 78 year old man just by... know what, it probably can't do that, BUT NOT ♥♥♥♥ING YET ANYWAY, this game is still being worked upon to become such a popular steam game that it will have its own store where you can buy in-game items and trade them over the steam community with your beloved friends and other members of this ever growing community, now where the ♥♥♥♥ have we heard of this before???? Till then it will be a 10/10 and HOPEFULLY remain that way after all those traveling salesmen come along and turn this game into a bartering simulator.
4749	1	a	This is a great FPS with many play options and configurations. In a phrase: Halo vs Dinos. Oh and it sells for less than a dollar. I have put more hours into this game than other games I have spent $50 on.  I highly recomend it.
706	0	a	I got it for 99 cents. It's bad. Just.... bad. 
4751	1	a	ONION: Dino Hoes has no onions  10/10 broke it
4753	1	a	Quite possibly the best wave-based dinosaur FPS's ever.
4755	1	a	It's like Halo, but with dinosaurs
4757	1	a	Its a buggy, awful mess with little polish, but a lot of heart put in to it. But its amazing. At first you laugh at the badness of it, but it becomes irrelivant as you find yourself having fun at killing large amounts of dino's in this crazy chaotic FPS.  Its an awful fun game, I recommend you get the 4pack and play it with friends for some stupid fun.
4759	1	a	This Is Freaking Awsome 
4761	1	a	I'm not too sure why this game has such a low meta score. I only played this for 17 minutes and that was during the free weekend, to make a let's play, and during that time, I had a lot of fun. Sure, the shooting isn't the best but the concept and the graphics are awesome!  I only played this on easy so I don't know if the dinosaurs would be harder on the harder levels or if you just have less ammo etc... but shooting dinosaurs is quite good fun!  This is one of them times where you shouldn't actually listen to metacritic and just go ahead and buy the game.  I have to admit though, this game is not worth £11.99, maybe just £5 but I would recomend it to anyone for just 99p!   This is a really good game overall and I liked it a lot!   You can see a full let's play of it here:  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming  (the let's play will be going up later today)
708	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
4763	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick ♥♥♥♥♥ !
4765	1	a	God damn autistic as ♥♥♥♥ 11/10
4767	1	a	Incredibly fun game to play with friends!  A survival game that pits the future against the past.  I highly recommend all players pick up a copy of this game, especially for it's unbeatable price!
4769	1	a	Best game I ever played.
4771	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
4773	1	a	This game was a ton of fun despite the metascore. XD
4775	1	a	Killed a T-rex with a pistol before I revived my fallen caped crusader who shot me with a med-gun as I jet-packed over the next stegosaurus. I now wear the T-rex's head on my head. No ♥♥♥♥.
711	0	a	This game has brought me enjoyment it is true; from its derpy triceratops to its 'laser swords' that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be.   The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game.   I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever 'run' properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.
4777	1	a	Started off as really biggy and unplayable but has been pbeen getting better and better and is now qite fun to playh, Highly recommended.
4779	1	a	 ORION: Prelude   ORION: Dino Beatdown   ORION: Dino Horde  ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only  $8.99  $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too! Support indie devs!
4781	1	a	This game is awesome fun with friends, would recommend this game to anyone.
712	0	a	They say the Meta score is wrong I think their right I agree with them the metascore is wrong.  It should be lower
713	0	a	Honestly the concept of being able to play in various game modes along side your friends in this Jurassic slaughter house is a great idea. Personaly tho I found the controlls for the Dino's hard to manage and clunky. If you can get around some of the frusterating controll draw backs you could probably get a couple hours of fun out of it if you play with a buddy. ORION: Dino Horde shall remain a game full of quaint notions and maverick game modes.
714	0	a	Better than the meta-score, but still not worth playing.
715	0	a	its 99p for a reason. Don't expect a good result.
716	0	a	This game is not worth it. Honestly, it will not capture your attention for long. ORION: Dino Horde is just another FPS that was quickly slapped together.
717	0	a	Don't spend a penny on this game, the servers are terrible, the graphics leave much to be desired, the attack animations are non-existent. Did they even try? It's good for a short while, but never leads up to your hopes. Please spend your money elsewhere.
718	0	a	Thieves plain and simple.
719	0	a	PATCH THE SERVER GLITCHES
4783	1	a	great game hope for new updates
4785	1	a	10/10 it's ok
4787	1	a	Dinosaurs are awesome, so the laws of physics literally state that this game is awesome too.  Play it.
4789	1	a	THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN AIDS! I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS AMAZING AND I LIKE DINOSAURS. ONCE A BIG BIRD THING GRABBED ME AND IT CHUCKED ME OFF A ROCK AND I GOT SCARED. BUT IT WAS FUN AND I LIKED IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITED GAMES OF 2015. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
4791	1	a	36/100. The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score. I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale. Thank god I did.  I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one.  Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game).   Now, by no means is this a '10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS' game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.  Good Points:  Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;  Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)  CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.  Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.  Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to see what they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.  Bad Points:  Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a 'Single-player' game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.  Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be ready for a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)   Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;  1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos. 2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)   Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the £11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)  Thanks for reading! (Or, going into the comments just to rage about me talking about the rating of this game)
4793	1	a	in this game, I used a jetpack to fly up to a t-rex's head, and hit it in the face with a lightsaber. and its usually 99 cents! Does anything else need to be said?
4795	1	a	its got dino hordes i guess 10/10 delivers what it promises  just make sure to hold C to roll out of trex chomps  ( This game used to be called Dino Horde )
722	0	a	I dont know one person who auctually likes this game, most my friends play it and they say its only ok
4797	1	a	Drove car into an alligator and blew up. 10/10
4799	1	a	I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.

4803	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.  ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.  The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.  The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things.   In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.
4805	1	a	What isn't there to say about this gem of a game?  The developers took a common staple multiplayer game, L4D2, and challenged the concepts that make that game great. 'Why are their zombies? The story just doesn't make sense!' They exclaimed, and went to work fixing all they could.  The end result? An amazing amalgamation of Amazing graphics backed by an abnormally high framerate, incredible gamemodes and features that make it a complete blast to play, and amazingly polished combat. Don't even get me started on the incredible menu design and feedback.  If you're going to buy lunch, do yourself a favour and buy ORION: Dino Horde instead, and even better, buy some for your friends also.  A solid 11/5 from me, if only I could go higher.
4807	1	a	Quick review: This is 'Getting Attacked by Endless Impossible to Hit Flying Enemies: The Game'  Seriously. I can still hear the constant, endless, horrible screeching of the most annoying flying enemy I have ever encountered in a game. It's Cliff Racers from Morrowind all over again. I actually have fun playing this game despite the bugs, poor balancing, and lack luster presentation. It has charm, like B grade sci-fi. But those flying what-evers kill this game for me. The guns are so hilariously innaccurate that there is no way you can reliably hit them, forcing you to listen to their screeching while they peck away at your armor, bit by bit, harassing you to the point of insanity. Yes, my entire problem with the game is not the enumerable other issues that so many point out, but simply the fact that I spend the entire match beset on all sides by what amount to Cliff Racers. No one liked Cliff Racers. Not even the devs that made them.  If you like Cliff Racers, this game is for you. If you don't, then get the game when it's a dollar. Still worth playing with friends.
4809	1	a	This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is ♥♥♥♥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something. You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it. It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents. If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself. This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes. You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans. Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents. This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support. Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason. Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos? This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that. Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.
4811	1	a	This game is more of a 'so bad it's good' kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons.   Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.  In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.  All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.
4813	1	a	Alot of fun for an odler game. Fun with friends and the ever so not safe for work chat and in game voip. Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3   My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.
4815	1	a	This game is good for its price but i would like to see offline modes survival etc. 
726	0	a	It isn't amazing but it isn't awful either. The game is a decent amount of fun, but Trek Industries is a trashy and shady company. I'm usually all for supporting indie devs, but Trek takes things to a whole new level. They're manipulative and money hungry. They lie, fire employees without paying them for their work, and they steal assets from other games as well. I cannot recommend buying this or any other games they may be involved with.
727	0	a	Feeling like i was scammed i bought the game when it costed money but now it is free devs can you return my money because this is now f2p  To anyone who bought this i feel your pain
728	0	a	I was not aware this game had stolen assets before purchasing. For 50 cents, it's a great game to mindlessly kill some time on, but after hearing about the theft, I regret supporting this developer with my purchase.  
4817	1	a	It's less than £1/copy, with 4 copies for £2.... why wouldn't you buy it, even if it just sits in your libary as part of your collection.  The game doesn't run all too great, and feels very cheap/poor quality -hence the price- but if you want a game to play for just a few hours with some friends and have a laugh, this isn't a bad option.  It's a shame this game is the way it is and feels so cheap, I think it offers some really great ideas - jetpacking around fighting dinosours with a lightsabre style weapon, like what?!  People are complaining a lot about the company and their dodgey endeavors, I don't know too much about it, and frankly I don't really care to look it up. The game is so cheap, and has been for a while, why care about any of that lol.
731	0	a	It was a free weekend, and I wanted to see if it was as bad as people were saying. Words cannot describe how abysmal this game is. Supposedly the devs went through the game and fixed all the bugs.   Supposedly.  Honestly don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money.
732	0	a	I played this ♥♥♥♥ing game.Bad graphic
733	0	a	Whats orion mean?!
4819	1	a	I didn't expect it to be so much fun...but it is! It's like Jurassic Park 5: Shooty-shooty fun-times with Dr. Alan Grant
735	0	a	This has got to be one of the most boring and most disjointed games I have never had the pleasure to play.  This game has recently had a name change, for the second time, because for some reason these developers change the ♥♥♥♥ing name of their game whenever they release a 'big update'. This game was and still is a buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥ since launch and despite these 'big updates' the bugs remain. First time they changed the name, they didn't fix anything... They just added a microtransaction store. Because they changed the name it caused a lot of bugs with Steam and it brought the game back on the front page of the Steam store and it did NOT deserve it. And now they did the same ♥♥♥♥ but it didn't seem to break the Steam Store like last time; No, all this update added was some hats, controller support (which by the way made it so that it only shows the Xbox controller buttons in the main menu, well done guys), and some game modes. I didn't even bother to play any of the other game modes after seeing how godawful their MAIN gamemode is.  So what actually is Orion Dino Beatdown/Horde/Prelude you ask? Well, it's a horde mode game involving dinosaurs. A fairly simple concept: there are waves, there are enemies, you kill enemies, progress through the waves and so it goes on. But the presentation and gameplay are so horrible that it doesn't work right (which is probably why they added the other game modes to make up for the garbage that they have created).  Presentation: This game looks hideous, even for an Unreal Engine 3 game, and it runs terribly dispite how bad it looks. I had to lower all the settings down to get a decent framerate and the game definitely does not look good enough to justify it. And it appears that they added a disgusting cell shaded look that just seems completely out of place recently, weird black outlines on some places. Besides graphics, the animations are atrocious and the modeling on the guns look pathetic, the sound design is just bad, many of the guns feel weak as a result of having poor animations and sound quality. ♥♥♥♥ing magnums should not sound like BB guns. The dinosaurs look alright, decent enough modeling and sound design... Until they attack you with their adorable little nibbling animations, making them look completely unthreatening. Yeah, this game doesn't look good at all.  But ok, graphics aren't important, gameplay is what matters in a game, right? Of course, only one problem, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! The gameplay is so bland and generic, it has nothing original about it, it only takes game mechanics from other games, and the mechanics that it takes it doesn't do as well as where they were originally taken from. I mentioned before how the guns feel weak, and they really do. Nothing has any of the OOMPH you would otherwise see in a competent FPS. This game's gunplay is almost as bad as Borderlands', and the guns themselves are completely uninteresting. There's very little variety in the enemies and it gets boring to fight the same dinosaurs REALLY FAST. So the gameplay is also a failure here.  So it looks bad, sounds bad and plays bad. Is there any point in getting this game? Absolutely not. It's not even so bad that it's funny, it's just awful, it isn't even worth the $1. If you want to play a good horde mode game, I highly suggest Killing Floor, it does everything right where Orion does wrong. I decided to write this review now because it seems like the developers are trying to squeeze out every little bit that they can from this game and it's just depressing to see. It feels like they really tried their best here but this just doesn't work. Guys, this game is not good, you have to move on, from here you have two choices: You either realise that game development isn't your thing, or you improve upon what you did here and take note of your mistakes. Either way, let go of this game and focus on stuff you really want to do, rather than just change the game's name multiple times and milk the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.
4821	1	a	OREOS: Dino Horse is the spiritual successor to the universally acclaimed smash hit Cabela's Outdoor Adventures, building upon everything that made the fan favorite so spectacular (YOU JUST USE CARS TO WIN, AS LONG AS YOU ARE SEATED IN A VEHICLE THE ONLY HORIZON FOR YOU IS ONE OF GOLDEN RADIANCE) and revving it up to the next level! Squeezed from fresh virgins harvested at Spiral Games Studios very own Hell Engine, ARYANS: Dino Harp finally delivers what all satanists have been craving for the past 2 decades: For someone to take good ol' fashioned class based FPS gameplay, dumb it straight the ♥♥♥♥ down, shoehorn in pointless costumes and hats, and throw in all the assets from Natural Selection but instead of aliens have ZANY ♥♥♥ SPACE DINOSAURS so that it can all be blended up, mixed into a fine non-alcoholic beverage, and poured all over the ♥♥♥♥ing ground because holy hell this game is complete dogshit why in God's name would anyone wanna drink it. But don't soften up yet, cause this game's still got enough hilariously stupid shenenigans to keep your ♥♥♥♥ rock solid; It's got all the core essentials to being cool, including but not limited to 1) Dramatic Slo-Mo Kill Cams so you can soak in you/your friends every death, 2) Mother♥♥♥♥in jetbikes, 3) Mother♥♥♥♥in JETPACKS, 4) Poorly Optimized Motion Blur (a strong sign of being truly next-gen), and 5) Rag Doll Physics out the ♥♥♥. If you aren't soaked through to the seat by now than you gotta have a crotch colder than the Artic Circle, in which case this is the kind of game that might just actually kill you. TL;DR it's ugly and stupid and cheap but if you're looking for a silly co-op shootbanger than you came to the right place
736	0	a	Oh boy, this game.  The game isn't horrible, at least not as horrible as metacritic says it is. But it still isn't good. Everyone else has explained what the game is like so I'll just do a pros and cons list.  Pros -  -It's 99 cents. -Can be fun with friends. -Graphics are mostly nice. They aren't bad, but the player models are kind of weird looking.  Cons - -Animations are horrible -Dinosaurs have skin made of steel. -Boring when played alone -Definitely not worth 15 dollars.  Overall, 6/10 would not recommend. May want to get it now since it's a dollar, but for 15 dollars, you'd expect more.
4823	1	a	Got this ♥♥♥♥ when it was free and went hard as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Forgot to buy it when it was 99 cents and got ♥♥♥♥ for it but I have it now and I gotta say, it's complete ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong, it's fun as ♥♥♥♥ but the spinosaurus is a mean ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He'll eat you for breakfast and ♥♥♥♥ you out right after. He eats those little ♥♥♥♥ing raptors like a fat kid eats cheetos he found under his man-boob flabs. His health shoots up faster than a meth addict in a truck stop bathroom. The stego is an OG and is a pretty cool guy. The ♥♥♥♥ing trike likes to hang out with the stego and act like he knows what's up but he's really just a ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ nigguh. The damn crocidile thing is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't do ♥♥♥♥ other than be in the way if you're playing as a dino. Now you may think I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥ing, but your opinion doesn't really matter you loser. All-in-all I'd give it a solid 8.5/10. Really good price for a really good game.
737	0	a	Regret: The game  what seems like an awesome concept becomes boring after 10 minutes. Avoid like the plague.
4825	1	a	its not necessarily a good game by any means, but oh my god is it a good time. Its not one of those games thats so bad it's fun it just has a bit of charm to it. I do recommend this especially for only $0.99 
738	0	a	Turn away. Now.
4827	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
741	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
4829	1	a	♥♥♥♥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as ♥♥♥♥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy mother♥♥♥♥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).  Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.  Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.
744	0	a	Crashed starting a solo game. Turned all the details and everything down to minimum, still crashed.
4831	1	a	Yeah, I have been playing games for years and years, and back in the day, games were fun, games were simple, and most of all games were FUN, specially with friends,this game while simple in its premise, has a lot of heart is fast paced, and is loads of fun, sure the meta critic is low, but that was its previous incarnation, not this one, this is a great article on the game check it out:   http://www.dsogaming.com/editorial/orion-dino-horde-controversy-let-the-battle-begin/   Besides what have you got to loose for a few dollars? this game gives you more bang for your buck than some AAA titles that I own, and even tho It might not be the most polished or graphically amazing game out there, it delivers, and brings home the pizza!  so dont hesitate, you will have fun, you will be surprised at the sheer madness of running around from killer dinos, and then jumping in a jetbike making a last second save, the gameplay has lots of emergent moments of pure madness, and in that you can see that the folks that made it has a vision, and above all know how to make a fun game.  Play it, you will be surprised! oh and it has a 5 star community you cant go wrong!

752	0	a	Don't trust the minimum system specs listed. My system meets all of them and even with all settings dropped to lowest, I only get around 3 FPS, making the game completely unplayable. This comes despite marginal polygon counts and no exceptionally heavy eye candy that I could see. There is little to no optimization of code, making what should be an easy to run game utterly unusable for anything but fast computers, and the threading priorities within the client are so poorly done that I even encountered audio stuttering in the menus before the game. Audio stuttering on SFX is one thing, but this was BGM stuttering, completely ruining immersion. Needs heavy work before I'd call it a success of any sort.
753	0	a	I only have 17 minutes played, but the 17 minutes were dull enough to make my eyes glaze over. The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the voice acting is awful, the combat is easy enough that a person with no eyes could beat the enemies, and the maps are overly large for no reason at all. I don't think there is even an end goal in this game.
4835	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥ was .99 cents.
756	0	a	its bad
757	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, that’s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just can’t see myself recommending it in its current state.   Rawwr!!  4/10  Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the 'improvements', however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.
4837	1	a	The Best Way to play this game, Is to play with freinds.
4839	1	a	Its just fun, I don't know how else to explain it. Little sweet $5 game.
4841	1	a	This game is amazing, better than CoD and battlefield combined and the perfect blend of action and ridiculousness! I don't see why this doesn't get more publicity 
4843	1	a	Sometimes I want to ♥♥♥♥ a dinosaur but be careful that you dont get dinosaur STD e.g dino genital herpes, Dino aids and dino gonorrhea and GTD but i love seeing that dinosaur riding my ♥♥♥♥ and me cumming in its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is fun.
764	0	a	This has got to be just about the worst, overhyped games i've ever played. It's not hard, it's just stupid and boring. I would NEVER recommend this to anybody looking for a great game to play.... Go grab yourself a valve game, or a steam sale game instead of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
765	0	a	Dinosaurs AI is very bad, they only walk in straight lines. Clipping issues with dinosaurs. Graphics could be so much better since this game was release in 2012. The maps are boring, plain open fields of nothingness. The gameplay is clunky and unrealistic. Weapons seem like they don't have any weight and I think bullets travel foward until they hit something. The dinosaur theme itself, not that interesting but I decided to give it a try anyways and wasn't really disapointed cuz i was expecting anything good from the start. Wouldn't even pay 0,01 for it.  (anyone who wants to ♥♥♥♥♥ about this will be talking to the hand cuz i have better thing to do than listen to lil fan boy kids.)
766	0	a	Dinosaurs. What's not to love, right? Right?... In the case of ORION: Dino Horde, there is a lot not to love. I was excited at the concept of the game, as I love horde-type games (MVM in TF2, Escalation in Transformers, etc.) where you are forced to work as a team to defeat unbeatable odds.   In my first time booting up Orion, I had a bit of trouble finding a server as there were not many to choose from. There are a few dedicated servers, however most are player-run on their own machines. Because of this, the lag was almost unbearable to play a decent match. There was no teamwork to be had, and usually I would blame this on the team I played with, but there wasn't any incentive to work together. I trudged on, hoping it would get better after a couple of waves. I was wrong. Server after server the dinosaurs would warp around the map, and give Michael J Fox a complex because they were so jittery.   The game feels like a Halo copy, with dinosaurs thrown in. After jumping in a jeep and manning the turret, it felt oddly familiar. This only confirmed my suspicion when I saw the tank go by. Yep, same tank, different color.   It isn't absolutely terrible, but when it was on sale for $0.99 I still didn't buy it. You may have better luck.
4845	1	a	STEP ASIDE DINO D DAY FOR A NEW DINO GAME HAS COME FOURTH! FOR ALL OF YOU THAT LIKE A 99CENT GAME WITH UNPOPULATED SERVERS AND ♥♥♥♥ING DINOS THEN BUY IT FULL PRICE, EAT ME, #DINO4LIFE#ALMOSTASGOODASPEGGLE  #YALLBETRIPPIN
768	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
769	0	a	This game just sucks, its the kind of game that a 10 yo would play, if he didnt have any other thing to play with.
4847	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
4849	1	a	It would appear to be a work in progress. For one dollar this game is amazing. Full price though..... I do like that the developers seem intent on adding content without charging the user for it. I like to support the little guy and this is a good game.
4851	1	a	This game much better than the metacritic rating it has recieved, I have only played this on multiplayer co-op but there is some fun to be had running around with your mates killing dinosaurs.
4853	1	a	This game has hot dogs you should buy it
4855	1	a	Oh man, this game.  Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.  It was ♥♥♥♥, just utter ♥♥♥♥, a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats ♥♥♥ about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!  I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.  Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter ♥♥♥♥, give it a try, show your support to these awesome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!  Extended Cut; So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!  I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; 'Screw this, it was fun.' And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.  Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!  All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.
773	0	a	suck.
4857	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
4859	1	a	I bought this when it was Orion: Dino Horde. I LOVE this game!! For 0.99$ its is worth it, actually its a rip off to the developers! This game hasa hours of replay ability and it is still being worked on,  so the people claiming the ai sucks, shut your trap, msot people who claim it sucks have little time on it anyway. Its a great game to play with m8s or random people online. It requires stratagy on higher levels and good teamwork. 11/10 In my opinion, anyway its only a dollar and you spend 20$ to buy cod 4 still.
4861	1	a	justawesome i just love blowing trexsbrains out in a airship and alson some multiplayer ffa action
4863	1	a	I recommend it a lot ! :D Buy it ! NOW ! Cheap and awesome :3  The game gives you the sensation of a simple game, but it's the best 'shooting things' game i've ever played :3  Amazing graphics, but i can't play it on max settings due to my GPU :'c (GT520 2gb)    Keep up with the awesome work :3
4865	1	a	I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.
4867	1	a	This game has changed A LOT since release. What was once a shoddy, broken game is now one of the most jam-packed, jaw-dropping experiences I've ever encountered in a game. Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.  Do you like Dinosaurs? GET IT. Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs? It has 4 (soon to be 10). Do you like tons of guns? Game has 50+. Do you like cooperative gaming with friends? 4 coop modes. Do you like competitive multiplayer? It has like 10 modes!  200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked. Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.
4869	1	a	A good game. Entertaining, Beutiful And- DINOSAURS! The maps are well made. The game is extremelly fun, though lacks a large player base. Deserves more than its current meta score for sure.
776	0	a	I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.  I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.  Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.  Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser. I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.  I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.  There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.  In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round. The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles. I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.  I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time. But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.  Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game. Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it. Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.     
4871	1	a	A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends
4873	1	a	Epic 11* out of 10 i played free week and now i am going to buy it recomend for sure 'It implants Halo, Primal Carnage, Zombies and other games in to one whole dino action packed epic game for only £11.99!'
779	0	a	This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?  The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is 'downed'. The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little 'increments' when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.  Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?  It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was 'Dino Beatdown' or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.  Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.
4875	1	a	Best transformation of a game I've ever seen. It was, honestly, very buggy and broken when it was first released. Since then there was a massive overhaul and more (content) updates than any AAA game ever had. The devs didn't charge any money for any new content they released while the in-game content increased by extreme amounts. It is a really enjoyable and good game now and will get another big update (for free of course).  http://spiralgamestudios.com/post/77018495383/a-prelude-within-coming-2014  It's definitely worth the money and because of the current sale you can even get it for only 1€
781	0	a	This is not done well. The animations suck, the dinosaur movements are bad, and the guns don't kick enough. There is no tutorial, so you're thrown in with no idea how to play. I like the concept of a survival game based on dinosaurs, but this is not what I want. Besides, fighting dinosaurs as a Halo reject isn't cool. Couldn't we get something like Jurassic Park stlye characters?
4877	1	a	10x better then 'Call of Duty' :P
782	0	a	Wow this is bad. I didn't plan on even testing this out until I read some reviews and decided to try it for the weekend trial. Wow what a mistake. I played a whole 30 minutes of this and knew this was garbage. This game has numerous basic gameplay issues. Just to start off, you can't properly remap your keys and the keys displayed in the control settings don't correctly state what key something is currently bound to... Shooting a gun has some sort of a lag from when you actually click and the gun shoots to when you see your weapons recoil/flash... Everything is scaled horribly, it's like they had no regard for what things should look like. You'll have dinosaurs ranging from mouse size to giant size, vehicles, buildings and consoles all look like they took a whole 5 minutes slapping something together... I honestly knew what I was getting into when I looked at this game and other reviewers made me think otherwise. I am honestly more dissapointed at the Steam community for all the 'recommendeds' for this pile of dinosaur crap. Don't waste your time on this, even for a $1 there are much more polished games out there.   Metacritic got this one right. Heed my warning, stay away.
4879	1	a	Awesome Game, for the price you pay it is absolutely amazing
783	0	a	this game is a waste of time dont even bother to be honest there are better free to plays
4881	1	a	Very Fun game for that price. MUST BUY++++!!!!
4883	1	a	its one of the best games, some may gripe about the price drop, but its so fun to run around lopping off raptors heads in a single sword swing  really lazy, didnt read: its better than most games that take many many years and many MANY millions of dollars to make
785	0	a	This game is great......for a good laugh. Though the laugh is not really worth $1.
4885	1	a	I haven't had this much fun eating someone as a giant monster, since the original Natural Selection's Onos.
4887	1	a	YES, What a friggin awesome game! The most fun multiplayer game i've played in a while! 10/10
787	0	a	The excitement of this game is about on par with Minesweeper.
788	0	a	Played this game in a FREE weekend EVENT (THAT'S WHY my GAMEPLAY TIME IS SET to 0 Hours) The sale price is a trap !! Don't buy it unless it is less than 0.49$  The game is one of those that u play for like 2 hours then never coming back to the game again Primal carnage is way better than this game  What king of openworld gameplay that can take only up to 5 players ???????
4889	1	a	Fun to spend time, interesting game liking so far. There should be more players almost no servers
4891	1	a	Ignore the metascore. I believe it has something to do with a previous iteration of the game. This game is great fun with friends. There are plenty of different game modes and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out. The development team are also constantly adding new features and game modes.  If you're looking for some entertaining co-op or versus action with friends then I highly recommend it.
792	0	a	It is rare I'm able to say this, but this is even overpriced at $1..
4893	1	a	So bad it's actually f'ing hilarious, totally worth 99 cent, would rent. 11/10
793	0	a	bring the pizza
794	0	a	I can play horde-based gamemodes for hours upon hours without even getting slightly bored. I've played tons of Black Ops Zombies and Gears of War's Horde Modes back on Xbox 360, and the concept generally kept me entertained and immersed in the game longer than I would have without those Horde Modes.  However, when a Horde Mode isn't all that good in a tripple-A title, there's usually plenty of other content that will keep you busy, like the multiplayer and the co-op campaign and what not; the Horde Mode is simply an addition. Lately developers tend to create more stand-alone Horde games with little to no other content meaning that the value determines how good or how bad the game is. Take Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army for example. It's a great horde experience with lots of fun to be had in the co-op. This is stand-alone horde gone good.  ORION: Dino Horde  is stand-alone horde gone haywire-bad.  The Good: · Reasonably large maps with objectives and hordes of dinosaurs. · Dinosaurs. Ross approves.  The Bad: (Oh God, where do I start...) · Terrible hit reactions from the dinosaurs. You just have to spray and pray that you see some blood squirting from their fugly bodies. Oh, and there are no bullet holes where you hit them, so good luck figuring out IF you've even hit them and which ones you hit and which you didn't. · Unorganised and messy, from map layout and design to gameplay. Dinosaurs look like they're moonwalking on an escalator, the maps are unnecessarily large, 'upgrade stations' to buy vehicles, upgrades and weapons are scattered unlogically far from each other and so on. · The menu looks okay, but everything else is just so damn aweful: the HUD and chat-window are just large bulky windows that take in unnecessarily huge chunks of your screen. · A few 'game modes' that make little to no sense what so ever.  The Ugly: · The visuals look just acceptable on screenshot, but ingame it's simply terrible. It feels like a rushed and forgotten product the entire time and it's broken at its very core.  Final Verdict: Save your money (even the 99c for which its being sold lately) and do not waste your time on this mess of a horde-game. Boring, ugly, broken and generally dumb,  ORION: Dino Horde  underdelivers in every sense of the word. You may get a laugh at the terrible overall design of the game when it's on a free weekend and you're drunk as sh*t and high as f*ck munching away a pizza on a overly hot summer evening with some equally bored friends.  1.5/10, and that point and a half is simply for the dinosaurs. Rawr.
795	0	a	Probably the worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, seriously not even worth 0.99 cents.
4895	1	a	Orion: dino horde is great for those cold winter days when you need to light a wood stove with your computer. 10/10
802	0	a	When I first contemplated buying this game, I though: It's so cheap. It's like buying a can of coke, surely this will be more enjoyable. I was wrong, this buggy, spasmy game full of rubberbanding is not only more repetetive than a pendulum, but is actually less fun than watching one. The graphics suck, the game lacks animations, the sound is lofi. Even the announcer is laughably terrible.   There you have it. I should have gone with that can of coke.  3/10  Also, can you get refunds on steam?
4897	1	a	Many dinosaurs, weapons and game modes ! To take urgent !
4899	1	a	this game is awesome i cant wait to play it every day 
4901	1	a	You know, this game kind of sucks. BUT. I have had a ton of fun on it- I cannot lie. Haven't played anything but survival, so that's what I'm technically reviewing. Check it out. It's only $0.74 right now.
4903	1	a	For however ♥♥♥♥ing cheap it is, it's ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious to play with friends. It also looks REALLY good.
4905	1	a	First game, I just jumped in. Found a rifle, 'Ooh, that's cool. I'mma shoot me a raptor!'. I ran around until I saw a raptor. As I was patiently scoping on him, a t-rex came up behind me and chomped my ♥♥♥. My girlish scream of terror woke up the whole house and I was sold in an instant.  Get this game, shoot dinosaurs, squeal like a little girl and hopefully don't get eaten.  Pure and simple extinct-animal-murdering fun!
4907	1	a	Will not start up... Dont get it yet, wait till they fix this!
4909	1	a	One time, my girlfriend had this dream that me, her, and all of my friends were riding this huge pterodactyl. We were armed with assault rifles and flame throwers, soaring through the sky. There were many raptors and lions beneath us, which we were mowing down by the ton with our guns.
4911	1	a	If you play games with a group this is a hands down awesome game for the price.  on another note I was able to trade this game for ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS   Dinos for Rockets   10/10 would trade again  It's like syrim with dinos and guns 10/10 ~ IGN
4913	1	a	i brought this game because it was on offer and it may be cheap but its fun to play with you and your mates you can set up a server or join one so ill give it 9.5/10
4915	1	a	Running through the cannons shooting up a Raptor when all of a sudden a massive T-rex rears its ugly head from around the corner. I can see it staring deep into my eyes, I watch on as this massive beasts picks up a boulder with its jaws and throws it at me, I had no choice but to take it to the Knee like a real man, I was down. I watch on as the beast walks over to me, fear in my eyes, hate in his. He leans down, smells me then stands on my head. R.I.P  10/10 Will play again, &lt;3
4917	1	a	Worth every penny!
4919	1	a	We were mowing down a bunch of little annoying dinosaurs with machine guns then a giant T-rex came out of nowhere with an ear-shattering ROAAAR and ate my friend in one bite.  9/10 would watch my friend die horribly right in front of me again
4921	1	a	By far the best game for 1 EUR I ever played till now. DINOSAURS! You ARE SHOOTING DINOSAURS :D:D:D Add a Level and Loot-System = Perfect.
4923	1	a	I was watching the steam page and I waited for this amazing game to come on sale. It was a dollar so i had a choice watch a porn video on Barzzzars for one dollar or get this amazing game, i made the best choice of my sad and uneventful life, i got this game! I was thinking to my self i may have down's but i got a smashing deal! Opening this game to the menu was amaizing the meu was so well made it was almost as good as the ET game from the 1900's hell this menu was so good i unzipped my pants and started to beat my dino to it. after 2 hours of trying to get in a game with my gay lovers we were in, the graphics were amazing they looked like someone ♥♥♥♥ed on a wall and added in color, then i noticed the best part of this game, the dino's looked and moved like they were mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it made me feel accepted in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ covered world. This game also ran amazing it ran better than bf4 and had much graphics i was getting 2 fps on low! As playing as a dino i realized wtf am i doing, as i write this i pounder killing myself because i spent 1 dollar on this game when i could have been watching cp, this game should get an 11/5 game of the ♥♥♥♥ing century. Thanks Sprial Games for putting oon alt-jay and ♥♥♥♥ing me till my ♥♥♥ is no exitxtant.
4925	1	a	ive played 7 minutes of this game, most broken thing on steam. 11/10
4927	1	a	Bad. Play it and see how bad it is. Bad.
4929	1	a	This game is tons of fun. 99 cents right now!!!
4931	1	a	Dino Horde. I really think this game is great. Fast paced, balanced achivement/ credit earning (changes based on difficulty setting) Really helps to play as a team, and feel free to guide new players in to helping the team's overall progress.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. Very replayable in the current release.  I would value this game around 15 - 20 USD all day long.   I am having trouble browsing/finding game matches/ servers. Usually about 10-15 come up, but I have trouble connecting to most of them. Often time I find myself in a Lobby, and It appears the host is AFK. Would also love to see projectile/paths added. Other than that is very fun. Give it a try!!
4933	1	a	Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game, you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you pass it up. I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding get it.
4935	1	a	I 1v1'd a T-Rex with a laser-cannon rifle
4937	1	a	As a jurrasic park survivor, it's really touching to get the oppurtunity to get back at those pesky dinos for almost klling me and my family. For any one like me who had to go through that tragic events of jurrasic park it is a must have.
4939	1	a	This game is fun!It has ok graphics not the best but who care's.  Ok let me get to the point,I i was not to sure if i should buy the game but with all the helpful comments I bought it! It won't lag,trust me unless you are on a server with high ping.So I say buy the game you won't be sad if you do and please as soon as you go in-game don't say it sucks and you have wasted your money because you havent!Enjoy the game i know i have and just because i have only played 1.6 hours of it is because i just bought it so trust me for a game this cheap there is nothing to lose!You can make your own servers to play with your friends so have fun.
4941	1	a	Cool game :)
4943	1	a	NIce game for 0,27 $ ! Love to killl Dino with Friend !
4945	1	a	I'd recommend Orion: Dino Horde because the game's a good run for the money especially because it's only like a dollar right now. I've played this game for a few hours and while it gets a bit repetitive and isn't as challenging as I'd expected it to be, the game's fine. In my opinion, this game merges the FPS and dino elements together in a rather fine manner. The netcode isn't as smooth though and the game works best when you're playing with friends that are close-by, not with people across the world because the ping has a huge impact on the gameplay. In conclusion, the game's soild especially since it's available for only a dollar right now.
4947	1	a	 I dont know why people complain about this game, i think it is very enjoyable, fun to play with friends,and the bugs that people seem to complain about(example:cant connect servers/lobbys, vehicles like Vtols crash around, dinosaurs pop to outposts,walk trough walls and other that kind of lies. I havent met any of these so said 'real bugs' in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different. 
4949	1	a	A game that has everything you've ever needed: Guns, dinosaurs and pizza.
4951	1	a	This is the best 75 cents you will ever spend on a game. Just buy it dammit. Its got terrible graphics terrible physics terrible sounds and the announcer sounds like he was ripped right off the Halo 1 disk and rammed into this game but ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ get enough kills and the announcer hollers bring me a pizza like ♥♥♥♥ SON thats way better then any game already. Trust me if you want to have a great night with a group of friends playing an actually pretty smooth running comedy of a game buy it. DOnt ask questions. It doesnt get much better then this!
4953	1	a	This game ended slavery and cured aids..... 99/10 IGN
4955	1	a	bretty damn cool  I've always loved dinosaurs and really all the games about dinosaurs are pretty terrible, but this one isn't all too bad it certainly isn't a terrible game, infact it's has the potential to be fantastic, and it's almost there, but I feel like it's a little rushed  great to play with friends, and the dino vs humans mode is a blast with a lot of people  if you've played call of duty zombies, or ghost's extinction, it's very similar to that, and all the same fun
4957	1	a	For 1 dollar, it's damn worth it. Make sure you play on prehistorik settings (kinda like an advanced setting, where you can change more stuff) to get more experience faster.
808	0	a	Okay, simply put...I hate this game. Horrible framerate. Bad controls. Annoying music.  Good thing I only bought this game from someone for 20 trading cards. I wouldn't have paid $15 for it.   I would rather play TF2 or Section 8 instead of this game.
4959	1	a	TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.  I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made. After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2€, I finally decided to get this game.  First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.  Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief. The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.  The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.  This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99€ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.
4961	1	a	this might just be the funnest game i have EVER played. im talking better than cod advanced warfare
4963	1	a	Best dollar I have spent in a long time. The CoOp is a ton of fun.
4965	1	a	For $1 this game is awesome. Gunplay is alright, the auto-shotgun is satisfying, the vehicle combat is fun as hell. My only problem with the game is the vehicle spawning but overall for the price the game is amazing.
4967	1	a	Pew Pewing at Dinosaurs, what more could I ask for!
4969	1	a	got this on sale for a dollar and it's like going to burger king and finding out you're the 1 billionth customer and they shower you in triple whoppers made of REAL MEAT  8/10 wish i had friends for hamburgers and dinos ;_;
4971	1	a	After being disappointed by a few other games claiming to offer a fun time kicking dinosaur butt, I was reluctant to buy this, even at the ridiculous sale price of 1.49. After a friend recommended it, I found to be a great shooter with a nice arcadey feel that not only features great human vs. dino combat, but also fulfilling human deathmatch modes. That being said, I strongly recommend this game to be played with friends. Help get this underrated FPS to where it deserves to be.
4973	1	a	I can't get enough of this game. I don't know what it was before but the Meta score is WAAAAAAAYYYYY off now. This is a great game. I got this game on sale and I love it so much I am buying in game Items just to support the developers!
4975	1	a	I would like to take your time to say...that this game...is only fun with friends and if you do it by yourself...  Well how do you feel when you touch your pee pee while looking at random images?
4977	1	a	Dude... You get to murder dinosaurs with futuristic weapons and jetpacks and tanks... The vehicles all resemble Halo, so do the guns and maps for the most part. BUT WHO CARES YOU GET TO MURDER DINOSAURS!!!!!!!!!!!
4979	1	a	This game is a simulator taken on space where you get attacked by dinos,WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!People say this game is laggy but thats there computers problem it works perfect for me and I tried it for free and found very enjoyable so i bought premisson for teradacyles to put me on the top of the world and it was worth it,somehow.
4981	1	a	Pretty fun game, kind of a mix between halo and left 4 dead. Can act slightly glitchy at times but no major things.  BUT THE DAMN BIRD DINOS, like jesus, give them a nerf please. Almost impossible to hit and can take you out so quickly.  8/10 so far.
4983	1	a	Decent FPS to hop into with friends for quick 30minute sessions
4985	1	a	This game is highly innovative, interesting, and highly original.  I enjoyed it, and is definately worth cheching out.
4987	1	a	Really fun and enjoyable game with a great price!Of course it was down to 1$ for like a week but still 11$ is worth it!I had some fun playing this game and I will propably play a lot during the summer.Now I have to focus on my exams and I don't play videogames a lot :p
4989	1	a	T-Rex ate me.. EPIC!
4991	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Not too difficult, enjoyable multiplayer and a fun concept. The announcer is one of the best features of the game, would recommend.
4993	1	a	420/10 would buy
809	0	a	it sucs
4995	1	a	crazy fast paced gameplay combined with violent over the top dinos make this a very fun game it just may take a bit to get the setting rights on an older comp like I own
4997	1	a	Awesome game for the price!.
4999	1	a	This game is awesome. the .99 cents you pay is worth it, because you get a fast paced gun game with Dinosaurs. If you want to fork out more cash you can buy special custom looks for your character. Great maps and the graphic style is like that of borderlands. This game is a 8 out of 10 for me.
5001	1	a	This is a great game!, but it still could use some more update's, becuase its pretty much the same gamemode, only slightly diffrent, but still a great game! (:
5003	1	a	Many reviews say this is a bad game, I disagree. The gunplay feels good, the graphics are very good, the maps are nice and the gameplay is fun.  I haven't seen many bugs at all, it seemed a fairly seamless gameplay experience.
5005	1	a	just had a LAN party. This game was one of the funnest games we played!
5007	1	a	This game is amazing, the guns are great and it's so many choices, they have tanks and flying stuff D: AND Its the best multiplayer game i've ever played
5009	1	a	great game
5011	1	a	Nice game, having lots of lag issues though, that needs to be fixed. (its the game because i have no problem playing other games)  this game is awesome to play with a few friends or just by yourself. this game isnt challenging at the start but later on you will die a couple of times wich is good, it keeps the challenge in the game. the graphics are great (although i have to play on lowest graphics because of the lag issues)   everything summed up a bit: buy this game, its awesome. but you do need a pretty decent pc to play without lag
5013	1	a	Burned three hours in one sitting since buying this game. For the dollar I payed for it I've already gotten a 33 cent per hour return on it. Keep in mind this is only fun with friends.
5015	1	a	verry good to play but it's lag
5017	1	a	very good for this price you can pick it!
5019	1	a	I don't know what you guys are talking about because it's even worth 15$ But one dollar I don't how they make money. But it's a good game. 
5021	1	a	This game is amazingly fun for how cheap it is.  If you want some quick laughs, buy the 4-pack and gift the games your friends so you can play together and share the insanity!
5023	1	a	It's cheap and fun. You don't lose anything if you buy it.
5025	1	a	playing alone by yourself this game will be boring and you will regret buying it playing with friends however provides a really fun experience. this game is actually quite fun the leveling perk system is unique and gives you a nice rpg feel to it and wide variety and weapon types is also good ive been playing this for awhile and i find it fun reminds me of borderlands and halo almost with a good horde slapped on i play this with my buddies alot and we have a blast this is really fun if you have friends that are interested go for it you guys will have fun so far im enjoying it.
5027	1	a	this game is good for 0.99 i dont see why you wouldnt get it i would probably pay 5.00 for this game 9/10 bugs
5029	1	a	It has dinosaurs, and you shoot them..... 10/10
5031	1	a	This game is some of the best fun I've had playing a multiplayer on the PC in a VERY long time. Thumbs up from me!
5033	1	a	When this was released may 2014 it was junk!,now i love this game! with 60+ updates this game is not like the old one!,I recommend buying it its only 0,79$,Better than COD i can say, a mashup with hallo and jurassic park :)
5035	1	a	Good game, people naturally knew what needed to be done. Not a single word said and you got a driver with a gunner.
5037	1	a	I admit i HAD to give this game a try as soon as i noticed how the devs. mocked their own game, and hey it only costed me like 7 bucks to find a very enjoyable game, yes a poorly designed but fun game and i can only cheer the devs for the improvement they've made so far. With some more work this game could be a coop-dino-classic.  At first glance this game will simply remind you of Halo. The armors, vehicles and even the weapons must be inspired by Halo i must say.  This is a focused co-op wave-survival game which offers several difficulties and competitive modes such as Conquest, Deathmatch and a 5v5 where both teams need to protect a power generator while destroying the enemy's. Very fun.  Graphically the game does not offer anything new, i can be honest and tell you that this aint no eye-candy, at all. They seem old and poorly designed.  Right away you will notice clunky animations aswell. Robotic movements and weapons being held by thin air, dinosaurs that may disappear for a second while they chase your sorry-♥♥♥ making it difficult to kill, specially the small ones.  Dont take me wrong, i really enjoyed this game for a couple of days nowadays i play it when i dont know what else to do and i still find it fun. Remember, like 7 bucks for a fun ride !!   If you are considering if this game is a go or a no-go, please do.
5039	1	a	Really worth 99 cents :D 
5041	1	a	a cheap good game....now thats is unique.
5043	1	a	If you are looking for some good clean fun with your friends ORION will give it to you. Nothing fancy, just A LOT of Dinos to be killed. Although a bit lacking in the graphics department and such. Still worth the $0.99 price tag.
5045	1	a	Fun game that costs less than $1, what more could you ask for?
5047	1	a	nice fps games ... worth to buy
5049	1	a	10/10 
5051	1	a	Brief: An extremely underrated dinosaur survival game well worth the small cost.  Pros: +GRATUITIOUS DINOSAURS! +Play as a dino or a human +Bots for offline play +Various game modes +'Avatar' style vehicles +Various weapons/cosmetics +Decent graphics with nice effects +Skill tree per match +Endless survival mode (or maybe I'm just too rubbish to reach the end)  Cons: -Gameplay gets a little stale after a while
5053	1	a	Step 1: Happily play with friend for 20 minutes Step 2: 420.69 mph in a speedy gonzalez car.  Step 3: Get stuck in rock Step 4: 5 mins later figure out suicide command Step 5: Continue to play happily  10/10 ign would buy again.
5055	1	a	This game is really awsome its totally worth it!
5057	1	a	After only playing the game for a matter of a half hour I managed to get stuck in a dino, watch as my team mate flew into the sunset carried off by a pterodactyl. I got bumrushed by Compsognathus (tiny rat looking things from Jurrasic park, you know the miniture t-rex's)  Wan2play.net  9/10 gives this game a 9 out of 10 the only thing they need to work on is minor glitches and support for AMD users other then that I think this game is well worth a dollar
5059	1	a	Great game! Bought it for myself, and after a few hours of playing, bought the 4-pack for my friends, Good job!
5061	1	a	Glitchy for now... But it's AWESOME!  EDIT: 2015 This game... it has changed... from a Glitchy F@*% Fest.... into a formidable game... This is where my 2012 purchase went to..... it worth at least 10 USD....
5063	1	a	Briliante Game'a :P recommend it :)
5065	1	a	Don't even have the game but i can review it.  11/10
5067	1	a	Despite some negative feedback, this game realley deserves to be praised for its ingenuity and fun gameplay. Over all I really do recommend this game and I give it a solid 8/10.
5069	1	a	An amazing game, especially for the low cost. A good game of dino survival with a few friends and you can't go wrong.
5071	1	a	Fun, bought it on sale, easy to pick up and get right into it after a bit. Worth full price IMO
5073	1	a	This game is great fun, I dont think it gets as much appreciation or attention as it probably should.
5075	1	a	at first i didn't know what to expect from this game. i just had a little money left so i thought sure why not buy it. it was tricky at first because i didnt know how to play and i don't really play these kinds of games anyway so i wasn't to sure to think wether it was good or bad. a group of players helped me with learning how to play and from that moment on i started really liking this game. the dinosaur gameplay i wasn't to crazy about but i loved the weapons. jet packs, mech suits, tanks and things that unleash hell XD. to top it off there are also dinosaurs ofcourse! :D  so yes i do recommend this game it's pretty good for the price...
5077	1	a	Very well put game love it so much!! and P.S. help me i can't stop!!
5079	1	a	The real questions is...  Would you pay $1 to pilot a helicoptor firing missile swarms at a Tyrannasaurus Rex?  Why, Yes. Yes I Would.
5081	1	a	its pretty fun for the price, nothing special but very enjoyable with friends, just buggy enough to give you a laugh without being frustrating, easy to pick up and very scalable in difficulty, from being a cakewalk at lower difficulties to being nigh impossible at higher ones  same price as a cheeseburger, you cant go wrong
5083	1	a	It's a game featuring cyber-soldiers with jet-packs, shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, cloaking devices, and a bunch of other weapons and gear against waves upon waves of dinosaurs. And it costs one dollar. There's no reason not to buy it and spend at least an hour or two messing around in this game. Also, rocket launchers and jet-packs are OP.
5085	1	a	I paid less than 75 American cents ($0.74) for this game today. And me and my friends just got over 3 hours of some of the most fun gameplay we've had in years.  At first, I thought, 'Hey, this movement is clunky', and then I remembered that this wasn't a $60.00 Battlefield X title. But it wasn't any worse than any FPS I grew up with like Wolfenstein, Half-Life, and... um... other stuff.  5 minutes in, all bets are off, and you're loving killing dinosaurs. 10 rounds of 'pull the trigger and shoot' and then you start to figure out an upgrade path for your weapons and skills. It's about 30 minutes of confusion, and then it clicks, and this game is fun as all get out.   The visuals are amazing. The levels are huge. The weapon selection is vast. The vehicles are ridiculous. Yes, vehicles. Not on-rails. Free vehicles like Battlefield.  Case in point: by the last two sessions tonight, the final map is an all-out dino rampage. Two of our three players figured out how to fly the gunships, keep them in the air, while providing air cover for a tank driving back to base. The slow moving tank was getting swarmed, and the gunships were raining missles down on the dinos attacking the tank. Meanwhile, the gunships were getting swarmed my pterydactyls. They had ground-cover from the bots though.   Seriously. It's not earth-shattering physics or revolutionary gameplay. But it's some of the most fun you can have goofing around with friends. It's an AMAZING game.  The maps are beautiful and huge. The layouts are really smartly done, And the progression for each level is smart too.  I wish there was a way to make the progress from levels 1-&gt;10 carry over to session 11-&gt;20, but you quickly realize that it's a 10-match world, and you scale appropriately. When the next round comes up, you start with nothing, but you're a little smarter. And you WILL play the next round, because its fun as hell.  Buy this. Buy the 4-pack and hand it out to people on your friends list.   I love this game at under a buck, but I'd have no probalem dropping $20 for this one.
812	0	a	Warning , there is NO invert options on this, i have waisted cash and space on this . if you do find options for this pls let me know as i cant find invert anywhere. good looking game but built in the stone age it seems:( 
5087	1	a	Awesome game especially for not even a buck Orion &gt; McDouble
5089	1	a	Best Coop Game that i have played in a while
5091	1	a	Game is fun for a few minutes and on a sale cost much as a phone app so get it
5093	1	a	Hey, forget Evolve, buy this instead. It has assymetrical multiplayer, excellent co-op, different classes with leveling and perks, multiple different weapons, turrets, vehicles, and ridiculous fights.  It's really a lot of fun, and it's cheap! It's something you can play with anyone. Oh yeah and Workshop support? Yep.
5095	1	a	After 78h I'm glad that I bought this game. That is really great time-killer with a lot of fun.  If you don't have this game - buy it now. :)
5097	1	a	Non scoped a T-Rex with a Sniper for 0.49€... 11/10 Best game...
813	0	a	From a 100% honest reviewer:  Hi guys, this game wasn't too bad! The graphics were definately a bit underwhelming, especially the way the dinosaurs moved. However the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. I picked up pretty quickly and was able to play some fun rounds. However, it was slightly repetitve, and for me, it didn't really have any replay value. I wouldn't really play this game a lot.
5099	1	a	What you must know is that it's all about the vehicles. Get a ground vehicle, run dinos over or shoot them from and attached gun with someone else driving. Or get an aerial vehicle and shoot the hell out of annoying dumb flying dinos.
5101	1	a	played when it was free weekend i remeber it was fun im actuly planing on buying it this summer
5103	1	a	I honestly didn't have much thought about this game when I first started, I thought I'd play it once, think 'Yeah, alright, good laugh' and never touch it again.   I absolutely love it. Fun, frantic, fast paced, and getting ontop of a rock with an LMG spraying down dinos is immensly satisfying.   Easy to pick up, easy to play, little brain processing required - good, simple fun.
5105	1	a	OK playing solo, awesome playing with friends. Great game, especially considering it's only $0.99. Heck, spend the extra $2 to get the 4-pack and send them to friends, it's worth it.
5107	1	a	Mmm...nice game!
5109	1	a	Getting grabbed by Pterodactyls never gets any easier.
814	0	a	First match I get the flag and a T-Rex tries to eat me. I glitch through the bottom of the map and am stuck down there for the rest of the match along with the egg. Very buggy.
5111	1	a	Devs actually fixed it. Game don't suck anymore, guys.
5113	1	a	This is basically the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with fewer bugs and dinosaurs instead of aliens. Definitely worth the purchase, I spent less than five bucks so I can shoot dinosaurs in the face with three friends. Worth every penny.
5115	1	a	Using the Unreal Engine, this game is a combination of Halo and Killing Floor, only more entertaining. With three classes to choose from and a extensive leveling up system, this game is one awesome indie title for the ages. Orion has difficult but pleasant battles with all kinds of dinosaurs, including T-Rexs. It is very satisfying to fight and kill these very large and prehistoric beasts. The fast-paced shooting works greatly and I most definitely recommend this title for everyone.
5117	1	a	Great little game, fun too mess around on and fun to play with friends. I would recommand getting it. :D
5119	1	a	Best dino shooter I have played. Pick it up if its cheap.
5121	1	a	so fun and addicting you upgrade and kill dinos! i judged it at first cause i thought it sucked but played and i loved it
5123	1	a	My friends told me 'you could buy a bag of chips, or this game' and you know what? I would rather have that bag of chips. Honestly, this game is crudely-made and minimally optimized with gameplay inferior to Killing Floor.   However, if this were 2008, I'd rank this game a solid 9/10.
5125	1	a	Unknown game blew my mind. Plays like HALO!!!! Kill dinosaurs like TUROK!!!! Vehicles work great, leveling up gets addicting. Within the small hour of gameplay I blew a pack of Compy's with a grenade, a triceratops rammed me and knocked me back across the map, stepped on by a trex, ran over a pack of raptors and got picked up by a damn Pterodactyl.....while I was driving a freaking warthog! Instant buy 4 pack for me and my buds.
5127	1	a	Good game, TERRIBLY OPTIMIZED  the game is FUN don't get me wrong but... running around at 2 fps with the lowest settings on MY computer means something is VERY wrong.
5129	1	a	somebody clean up my ♥♥♥
5131	1	a	To be honest, this game is bad aesthetically. Its animations are rudimentary at best and the gun animations are out of sync but what do you expect from a game that costs 0.99 freakin' cents?! The gameplay is repetitive but somehow it keeps me playing for a few hours (I just go straight for the mech during the later waves) but again 0.99 freakin' cents! I recommend this game solely because of the price. The game is fun with some friends and you owe it to yourself to try it out. It isn't the best looking game but it is a hell of alot of fun once you get the hang of it.  PS: There is microtransactions in the game but only for cosmetic items so if you are one of those people who love buying virtual items using real life money... go ahead nobody is stopping you (or you could buy the items to support the developers ;-) ).
5133	1	a	IS GUT GUT GAIM YIS
5135	1	a	Its a fun game but man could the frames be better
5137	1	a	its like cod bo3 with dinosaurs.
5139	1	a	Well it's not the best game out there but it really fun to play + it's very cheap bth 0,79 euros is not that much. I think its worth buying it ! :)
5141	1	a	Onion:Shreklude &lt;--- thats how i feel about this game. &lt;3
5143	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs. Interesting environments. Unique weapons.  All this can be yours for just one easy payment of $0.99.
5145	1	a	Very recommend.It is a very interesting game,it's price is very cheap but the game experience is good.The optimization is fine so the game can runing smoothly on a low-configuration computer,so you may not worry about your configuration.In the game,you can play three different career and cooperate with your friends or a Bot.And there are also so many interesting game modes,you can enjoy them one by one.
5147	1	a	I really like this game. Totally worth the money, especially if you have friends to play with. The game is still sometimes rough around the edges. For example, the animations aren't as smooth as you expect them to be. Still one of the most fun I've had playing a game. Occasionally, you'll die from something dumb like being glitched into 2 dinosaurs, but I'm looking forward to the game being polished by their updates.
5149	1	a	Very enjoyable game, if you are playing it with a budie on co-op mode :D
5151	1	a	Great game. 100% worth the $.99 it costs. 500% worth it when its on sale for $.50, or 1000% worth it to get the four pack for $.75. I bought 5 of the four packs to share the game with my friends. 10/10 would buy 5 more.
5153	1	a	You get to kill dinosaurs with big guns... and it costs less than a beer. So you get the idea.
5155	1	a	Fun game especially when you play with your friends . Lots of fun and laughs. Many interesting weapons and vehicles , although the mechanisms are pretty difficult. Nice graphics too. Definately worth my 0.39 euro.
5157	1	a	If you use the weird hoverthingies you can climb over the heightlimit and go driving around the skybox. Also it had dinosours at some point. But they won't really bother you if you keep driving in circle and just not care about them.  You are a autist who likes dinosours so you will buy it even if I say that this game is worse than Hitler.  9/10 it has dinosaurs.
5159	1	a	I recomend it becaus its trully fun to blow stuff up especially when its alive though i would like to see more oprimizations for laptops and 'not so good' PCs.
5161	1	a	This game is well worth the money spent ($1), and even if it was 5 bucks i'd STILL buy it! Half descent graphics, and good game-play make this game a 7.5/10 in my opinion. I've paid alot more ($10-20) for games that weren't even HALF as good as this one! Enjoy it, and pass on the good word :)   Respectfully, Cronic
5163	1	a	This game is actually really cool, like I spent $1 on it like 'pfft whatever, can't really lose at that price' and it turned out to be remarkably fun. I'm not sure what this game did or what state it was in on release but it's certainly much better now, has a huge Planetside 2 feel to it on a smaller scale but with freaking dinosaurs!  Planetpart, Jurrasicside, take your pick.
5165	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games i have played in a while and with still more content coming out this year!
5167	1	a	Awesome game for such a low price! Definitely worth it!
5169	1	a	10/10
5171	1	a	It's fun!
5173	1	a	its cheap , cool and fun
5175	1	a	This Game is bad but it makes fun with friends because you can trickshot dinosaurs! 10/10 :D
5177	1	a	I have no idea how it costs so little. It shouldn't be this good.
5179	1	a	I hit a dead T-rex with a vehicle, t-rex flew into the air. 10/10
5181	1	a	.50 cents on a sale to play hours of tons of gamemodes with friends. Sign me Up
5183	1	a	Teached me so much about history, 5 stars.
5185	1	a	Is the best game
5187	1	a	i need a tutorial on how to stop playing this game because damn gurl, this game is gud
5189	1	a	Well worth the money, quite a bit of ridiculous fun. wave based dinosaur survival game with limited shopping between waves. can also buy power-ups and turrets not just guns.
5191	1	a	An AMAZING fps game! Just watch the trailer and you'll know why. This game has guns, jetpacks, tanks, helicopters, and dinasaurs in it! It's 99 CENTS just for the plain version, and the WHOLE game, PLUS FOUR PACKS are only 3.99! It's worth so much more! I would reccommend to anyone who is a fan of an fps, and surviving waves of enemies. I even got a four month free trial!
5193	1	a	The ratings on this game through youtube and a couple other places are pretty bad but I think this game is amazing. Sure it has a few quirks, as all betas do. But I can't seem to get enough of it. Well done!
5195	1	a	Awful, yet also awesome.  The game is not well made, even on a good machine with solid internet connection it will lag.  It's not smooth, and the AI is kinda dumb. The modes simplistic and the enemy cheap.  With a few friends (and it helps to have a drink or two in you) it's an absolute barrel of laughs and fun. Play for the dino mayhem and slaughter. Don't play to have a good intelligent shooter.  Grab a gun and go shoot a raptor in the head. Rinse and repeat.
5197	1	a	Orion dino horde is extremely fun and you will never get bored, servers are also very easy to make!
5199	1	a	I was told this game was really bad by friends. With a free weekend we started to play the revamped version and I must say it is a blast to play coop on CONQUEST. I will be supporting there new kickstarter on feb 27 for an open world game. Give this game a try and you will not regret it, this team has pulled a complete 180 with their game and you can see with their updates that the truly care.
5201	1	a	I'ts worth .99 cent but that's all I'm going to say about it.
5203	1	a	OH yes it is the most fantastic game on the planet. Even the Stig has something to say abou ♥♥♥ and i quote, 'It's real good.'
5205	1	a	I played this game when it was free for a day and I was very negative and only looked at the bad parts of the game.  But when my friend and I wanted to play some co-op we decided to give this a second try. And It's actually really fun! Maybe the idea and sounds are kind of cheesy but the game is packed with hours of fun.  I recomend this game for the people who want's a good cheap co-op game. 10/10 would dinosaur again.
5207	1	a	After the update and switch to UDK this game got AMAZING. My whole class in college is full of people who play it and LOVE it. I cant remember a time in my life I have had this much fun outside the tub. I give it 5.4 stars out of 6.
5209	1	a	THIS IS THE GREATEST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME EVER
5211	1	a	0.99 is a steal for this game. Fun and more fun. Lovin it.
5213	1	a	This game is insane... and fun!
5215	1	a	This was 39p
5217	1	a	Do you like Science Fiction? Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you have a Dollar? If you answered yes to these questions, get the game!
5219	1	a	The first game I play where the butt of a gun hurts more than the gun itself.
5221	1	a	Half life 3 GOTY
5223	1	a	Me and my friends had a blast its halo vs dino amazing
5225	1	a	So much fun, so much god damn fun and violence and dinos all together.  When to buy this: If you like fun If you like more fun If you like killing stuf If you like running like a little girl If you like fun (yeah, again) If you like being chased by big ♥♥♥ dinos If you like shooting stuf If you like FPS (should be first, but all the other stuff is moar important)  When not to buy this: If you don't like fun If you don't like killing stuff If you don't like being chased by dinos If you don't like having a god damn lot of fun while killing ♥♥♥♥ while being chased by dinos while having a lot of fun trying not to die. (there is no syntax error on this sentence, read it right and you will understand what it says)  Ahcro.
5227	1	a	This game is certainly worth 10 cents.
5229	1	a	Its a nice little game that you can enjoy for a some time. especially with friends and stuff. it is a bit bad here and there but overall its a pretty good experience.
5231	1	a	If you love Dinos and hunting this game is for you
5233	1	a	Get past the general generic feel of every aspect of the game and it is actually quite fun, plus theres always killing a T-Rex with a lightsaber.
5235	1	a	You pay 1€ to play Halo and Killing floor at the same time!
5237	1	a	Got the game as a gift, started playing seriously a couple weeks ago.  Played as assault class, purchased perk to get other class adrenaline weapons.  Roll in the final round with 2 pistols, 2 LMG, double grenades, and a Gattling gun. Mow down three large dinosaurs with the pistols and the grenades. Pull out both LMG's, take down the Crocodile looking motherf*****. *Morph into Hank Hill* 'That T-Rex is always throwing rocks at me. I think I'll go over there and gvie it a piece of my mind.' *Pull out gattling gun* *Put five hundred rounds into the T-Rex's head* 'There we go, Bobby. He ain't gonna be throwing no more rocks. I taught him a lesson.' The whole place explodes as I Matrix walk out of the canyon.   -Directed by Michael Bay
5239	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is a wonderful 'MURDER EVERYTHING' game, with great graphics, gameplay, and content. It has a variety of weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes. You could be shooting dinosaurs with energy lasers, or alternatively shooting players with energy lasers. Now, for most of the review there'll be content on Dinosurvival. This is because it's the main point of Prelude, but there are other games too. CTF is almost never played. If you want to play CTF, you might want to go somewhere else. Not saying CTF is bad on Prelude, just that nobody ever opens a server for it. You'll usually find the official servers are all Dinosurvival, with a few unofficial ones sportying different gamemodes, such as Gun Game or Team Deathmatch. I, myself, have never played TDM or Gun Game on Prelude, prefering the Dinosaur Shooting Madness known as Dinosurvival, in which you murder dinosaurs with Gatling Guns, Flamethrowing Turrets, and Helicopters.  Most of the time, the players are nice, friendly, and concentrated on the game. But once in about every 50 games, you'll get someone who hoards all the good vehicles without doing anything to help murder all dinosaurs you see. It's also very good for a cheap game, coming in at a CS:GO case key for 4 copies. (£1.69) Think of how much more content you and your friends are getting for your money when you bought a 4-Pack of this game instead of a case key for CS:GO. TLDR: A MURDER EVERYTHING game with a good playerbase and populated servers but some servers overlook gamemodes that probably would be good. 9.8/10
5241	1	a	*Friend Shooting T-Rex with Minigun* *Rams T-Rex and gets the kill*  10/10 would steal dino kill again
5243	1	a	10/10 not expected games that cost 0.74$ (summersale) are bad, but not this one
5245	1	a	Honestly, if my PC wasn't ♥♥♥♥, i'd play this more
5247	1	a	Dinosaurs. Do I need to go on?
5249	1	a	This game is optimized worse than a giraffe for raising a baby. It runs terribly, looks MUCH worse than in the screenshots, dinosaurs are dumber than Donald Trump running for president, all of the sfx are ones I hear in flash games on kongregate, and the price is a couple dollars over what I would pay. Also, i'm reccomending so people actually see it.
5251	1	a	Fix the damn multiplayer bugs and this game would be lots of fun
5253	1	a	This game, when it came out it 2012, was, without a doubt, a total wreck. Glitchy graphics, animations screw ups, pathfinding issues, etc.  Now?  One of the best survival shooters I have played. It's tieing with Gears of War's horde mode and Halo's Firefight mode for best survival shooter I have played.  Seriously, Play. The. Game. It. Is. Awesome. YEEHAW!!!!!
5255	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of hours now and I've got to say, this is probably one of the best dinosaur survival games that I have ever seen! The gameplay is so smooth and the graphics are amazing! The action in this game is unreal and you're always up to the task of finishing the objective. The only thing that bugs me are the pterodactyl's, they're always flying at you picking off your health, but the only way to stop them is with a shotgun! I recommend this game for everyone to play if you like a dinosaur survival, open-world, action, and multiplayer/solo experience!
5257	1	a	Good buy, a little expensive though
5259	1	a	You are in a SUV killing off dinos when a trex spawns and hits ur car....the car flyes off into the sunset (off teh map) and u win the round by unknown reasons. 10/10
5261	1	a	This game is awesome co-op is done well,it reminds a lot on Halo and Borderlands  Everyone should try it  -There aren't much servers
5263	1	a	Pretty dank, fun time waster
5265	1	a	Mech machine can get on top of a helicopter. 10/10
5267	1	a	t-rex sited on me 10/10-woud be afk agien
5269	1	a	You kill dinosours with guns 8 out of 10
5271	1	a	This game is worth more then just a dollar! If you own a steam account you should own this game. It has multiplayer rpg levels and rewards with over two hundrend fifty achievements. Many different game modes and even play as dinosaurs. Multiplayer games are fun and easy to host or play solo with bots.
5273	1	a	Was expecting to eat many people (cough cough Chris Pratt). Got bored and started killing friendly dinos (for sport... of course) and maybe ate some velociraptors and stomped on some compys in the process.   roar/10 would kill everything that moves again.    p.s. : I did better in the movie, except for the whole dying part.
5275	1	a	This game costs 80p A 500g tin of chopped tomatoes also costs 80p  This game has dinosaurs  Chopped tomatoes do not  Logic = Buy this game 10/10 - if this game were a tomato, it would be the best tomato  In all honesty it's hilarious and a load of fun with friends Absolutely priceless, best 80p ever spent
5277	1	a	Get in the car Ram the T-Rex The car flies in the air 10DINOS/10  
5279	1	a	25p each for 4 friends to shoot a T Rex in the face. What's not to like?
5281	1	a	Jet pack on top of a mountain to throw nades at dinos, see someone next to me slide off the mountain towards a T-rex, watched him get slaughtered. 10/10 Long live the king.
5283	1	a	Every so often you get a game that feels so genuine. By that i mean that this game is low budget as hell, Glitchy and bad quality animations, generic graphics. But through playing the game, i felt that the people who made it really enjoyed making it and they made it mostly for themselves with no expectations of getting popular or even wanting to be popular. I just get that vibe from it and for me it just makes the game so much better.   I have only played the survival mode. and it's kinda like the serious sam games but with different classes and unlockables and dinosaurs. And i love it.
5285	1	a	Cool and great.
5287	1	a	The Best Cheap Game Ever! i wonder why its cheap because the graphic looks fantastic!  10/10
5289	1	a	This game is awesome first off. Its a little broken in some places but theres tons of cool weapons, good graphics, awesome action and punching dinos in the face. If you have a couple of dollars you should really consider getting this game.
5291	1	a	Why spend $10+ on a game you will play for a few hours and quit. This game is only ~$0.99 and you can easly put 100+ hours into this game. Best bang for you buck end of story. Love this game. Highly recomended!
5293	1	a	This game is bad and terrible for a lot of reasons but it's somehow really fun to play.Am I going crazy?
819	0	a	Cool concept, Poorly executed.
5295	1	a	The game is actually pretty good! the graphics are OK, and the sound design isn't crap. unlike what others say, this game is pretty fun compared to the bug-fest others make it out to be. Dino Horde borrows elements from other games, which makes it very familiar and relatable. Ignore the Metacritic review, this game is worth the purchase, especially if on sale
820	0	a	it dose't woke on my windows 7   WTF I wrote this review when i was seven. My friend got me this game to play it but it is not working. I am gonna try to fix it bye reinstaling it but I cant stop laughing about the ♥♥♥♥ review I left/
5297	1	a	I love the open - world aspect, and the Metascore is totally off, it's a great game, and I reccomend it highly! 
5299	1	a	perfect blend of crazyness halo openish worlds and players
5301	1	a	Maybe this is a buggy game... but for 0,99$ ist really good and can give you 100 hours of fun :D
5303	1	a	This is a fun wave survival game. Its diffrent how it mixes future technology and dinosaurs together. It all works out to make a fun game. You start out at the begining of the round buying some guns or armor. Then you fight a wave of small Dinos and 2-3 bigger dinosaurs. For the 99 cents i paid, it was totally worth it. As cheap as it is i would say give it a shot.
5305	1	a	s'alright.
5307	1	a	i think that this is a high quality game, the anti aliasing is really smooth and you don't see any jagged edges(even on low). Also there is a very good campaign that everybody plays, everyone on my friendslist is playing this because it's the new trend. i feel sorry for this kid whos name is listerine that got bullied because he didn't play it a lot. The movement on this game is really realistic which gives a jurassic park feel if you're on acid. Overall: campaign=:) multiplayer=:) graphics=:) movement=:)
5309	1	a	1 dollar, come on, thats chump change. Just get the game. Even if you're not going to play it just get it.
5311	1	a	like halo with more dinosaurs
5313	1	a	I found Barney the dinosaur, I gave him 10 hugs. and by Barney I mean T-rex and by hugs I mean rockets to the head
5315	1	a	Just 5 hours in and I've already got the game by the throat, and then it goes and throws me for a loop all over again, something that doesn't happen to often. It's a great game to play with friends and laugh as they get eaten by dinos, and then get laughed at when you get eaten by the same dino. Easy to get a grip on, tough to actually master, the A.I might not be the smartest, but it still makes you work, no matter what weapon you have in your hand(s).  Give it a go, you can't go too wrong with this, plus who hasn't wanted to grab big guns and slaughter thousands of dinosaurs?
5317	1	a	I stabbed a dinosaur to death with a combat knife.... 10/10
5319	1	a	You can punch dinosaurs in the face
5321	1	a	Like Skyrim with dinosaurs. 10/10
5323	1	a	The best co-op survival fps game ever! You like Killing floor? Halo? Evolve? You should try this one then! You pay only a dollar for a great unique gameplay that will combined with beautiful graphics and some personal system that include level, stats, achievements, etc. It's a profit to buy this w/ your friends ;) 9/10
5325	1	a	This game.....I feel like im watching an albanian mock-up of Jurassic Park. It's absolutley wonderful 11/10
5327	1	a	'Games can't fail. Only developers can.' - orion dev team  this statment is true to every sinlge aspect of a game.  this game use to be unplayable, glitchy and down right imposible sometimes, but not the game has evolved into something beautiful and worth every penny you spend on it.  litteraly wtf guys, you forced a dream to come true, you are the real heros of videogames.
5329	1	a	The studio made an AMAZING job on this game and the remake of it, I would recommend this to all my friends, and I don't understand how they make money by selling it for so cheap?!   In all seriousness, I spent less than a dollar for this game, and its more fun than most of my games in my library! It has a great feeling when played, I only have very minor complaints!  -extremely large gun models -Cliffs like being buggy -no direct Steam connectivity  Other than that the game is amazing!  8.4/10.0
5331	1	a	After countless failed attempts, finally joined game. Lagged horrifically. Did nothing. Got achievement for being useless.  10/10 would be useless again.
5333	1	a	i love this game so much!
5335	1	a	Just 2 much lagg, sad but true.

5337	1	a	Really good game, recomend i highyl! You can point **** you and have a sandwich/hamburger hat, what beats that? Nothing is better than this game considering you also can dance like a boss with matrix patterns on your armor. If you want a fun, dinasaour killing game, I highly recomend ORION: Prelude
821	0	a	This game is still crap.
5339	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Do you like peacefull, non FPS games? Do you like usefull teamates? Do you like paying for good games? Did you answered NO to most of the questions? Then you will love this game
822	0	a	I dont even know where to start, the game in short is a terrible mess. Ugly and confusing GUI and the game's graphics even on best resolution leave much to be desired. It amazed me because the screen shots look good, even fun, but like every movie trailer these pics were probably the best parts of what this uneventful game has to offer. Trust me whan I say this.... STAY AWAY you'll thank me later.  Update: The game has gotten better since writing my review, but it still is graphically inferior. If you see my review just skip this game and try the devs new game The orion project. This game has much more promise, its currently in early alpha stage but well worth the dollar.
823	0	a	Taking a bloody ♥♥♥♥ would be funner than thhis game
5341	1	a	So...the enemy AI is crap, the music is repetitive, and the guns/shooting is uninspired. Why am I recommending this? Well, it often goes on sale for under a dollar and the sheer enjoyment of co-op dinosaur shooting makes up for it. Expect about 4 hours of entertainment from this before your ears start to bleed from the sounds, but hey, 4 hours with friends shooting T-Rex are ones well spent.
5343	1	a	This game is somewhat like mixing CoD: BO with dinosaurs. You work together with teammates who help you in return with getting the giant T-Rex down for new weapons/attributes that you unlock with EXP and 'CRDT', gained after killing any reptilian creature that attacks you first. It needs lots of development, more weapons than JUST pistols but it has potential. Good luck devs!
5345	1	a	i.... i dont know what i just played... where is my bleach stash.....
5347	1	a	It's nice to get your head bitten off by a T-Rex!
5349	1	a	Spawn into halo-ish world. Have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ to do. Have a gun. It fires laser balls. Get into a car with tractor wheels. Run over 27 dinosaurs. Stegasaurus tail-whips car across map.  Jump out. Buy flamethrower. Go insane. Get picket up by flying dino ♥♥♥♥ and dropped from the sky.  27/10 Recommended.
5351	1	a	I got stuck in a rock. 10/10 I will get stuck again.
5353	1	a	A friend gifted me this game, i played it once. game crashed twice and lagged the hell out of my game. I swear I had like 4 FPS. I don't have a bad computer, and i rarely have a problem with this type of thing. Dinosour haelo is fun. 
5355	1	a	360 no scopped T-Rekt while i eat Doritos n MtnDew  9/11  MinamiNyan
5357	1	a	How to play this game: Pull out a gun, load it and shoot your head off. I played this game and i got molested by a T-Rex 11/10
5359	1	a	This is one of my personal favorites.... you get to kill DINOS!!! Not to mention you can run over other dinos with jeeps.
5361	1	a	Game sorts problems out for you: 10 year old kid was ♥♥♥♥ing around not doing anything and spamming down the mic so a Pterodactyl swooped down, grabbed him and flew off with him into the sunset whilst he was screaming down the mic for us to get him down. 10/10 would watch 10 year old be abducted by prehistoric bird/dinosaur again.
5363	1	a	You made it 0,99€ instead of a greedy 20€? Holy ♥♥♥♥. The first non-greedy game company in existance.
5365	1	a	THE DINOSWER CAME UP TO ME THEN I PEW PEW IT WITH BO THAT COST A MILLION COINS THE I DIE   GOOD GAME OVERAL
5367	1	a	I got $.99 and I spent it on this game!
5369	1	a	The whole time I was playing this game: 'WTF IS GOING ON?!?!?!?!?!'
5371	1	a	Absolutly love this game.  10/10  would jurassic world again.
5373	1	a	Is it perfect? No. Is it a Triple A game? Nah son. Are the dinosaurs smart and tactile, like most dinosaurs were? You bet your ♥♥♥ they aren't.  The game is a dollar. You can kill freakin' dinosaurs with lasers and light sabers and grenades and ♥♥♥♥. No, it's not the amazing FPS dinosaur game every kid that grew up watching Jurassic Park wants, but it's still cheap and fun for a while. The one thing I absolutely hate about this game is the audio. The guns sound like they have ZERO power. When I shoot a velociraptor in the face with a shotgun, I want my ears to vibrate from the loud blast coming out of my headphones. Aside from the ♥♥♥♥ poor sound fx, the game is worth your dollar. Besides, what else are you going to buy for a dollar? A candy bar? That'll be gone in 2 minutes unless you lose it in your couch cushions. Buy ORION: Prelude instead.
5375	1	a	It's okay, considering that I can buy a Coke for more than I bought this game for.
5377	1	a	Its a good game, but no Malaysia server, so if you about to play this game, make sure you live in the right region, to of course,avoid lag.  Pros: Epic graphic Massive multiplayer Overpowered weapons and upgrades  Bads: High RAM Usage Some badass dinasour will camp outside your spawn  Infinite/10 will play again if theres Asia Server  -Modified Review 11.13.16
5379	1	a	Truly one of the best ever games i have ever ever played, the graphics are amazing and the gameplay highly enjoyable, minecraft has nothing on this shooter.
5381	1	a	HELP!!! I can't move because my head spinns
5383	1	a	fantastic value, good gameplay and all for£0.99??? AMAZING!!1
5385	1	a	Even though the meta score is 36 its still a great game.
5387	1	a	Fun little game for very cheap at £1, worth buying while on sale!
5389	1	a	I played this solo. A Dinosaur bit my gentleman's specialty off and as I was bleeding out it ran away.  Of course, I died. These dinosaurs don't hang around like the mooks do on Borderlands, waiting to kill you. That suggests Dinosaurs are cleverer than the populace of Pandora.  8/10, would have my particulars bitten off again.
5391	1	a	I'm not sure why this game received such low reviews. I hear it used to be not the caliber it is, but I just played it for a solid hour and it was a blast. Seriously the most fun I've had in a long time. 8/10, would recommend.
5393	1	a	This is the worst game in my library. I love it.
5395	1	a	It's not bad, but it's also not good. If you enjoy a buggy dino slaughter, buy this game 
5397	1	a	It is very funny but it is not worth 13,99€   But 0,99€ IT IS SO WORTH !  
5399	1	a	It ain't ♥♥♥♥. I dont get the exceptionally low metacritic score as it's pretty much what is. I would give it a 6.5 at best at full price and an 8 for a dollar. Good silly survival co-op if you play with friends kinda reminds me of killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicles. It ain't no Killing Floor though.
5401	1	a	This game is really fun
5403	1	a	Definately ignore the MetaScore, this game is way better than however it got that rating! Great Co-Op or PVP fun, even play as the Dinos!
5405	1	a	It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hours… but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre, and it's very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
5407	1	a	For $1 you would be insane not to enjoy this. After playing it, I would say it even deserves its $15 price tag. But they cant get my money back NO SIR E  But seriously, just try it with a friend. Multiplayer is a must.
5409	1	a	Ok it is sooo broke but thats what the fun of it is, also there are jetpacks!  I will say get it, BUT ONLY IF ON SALE FOR LIKE $1  Because even if it is funny it is still a rather unfinished and badly programed game. But with good mate it can be very fun good time waster  4/10 for me
5411	1	a	Great game!
5413	1	a	This is the gameplay Call of Duty: Zombies wished it had. Very fluent, groomed and polished little game. Fun playing solo, and an even better time playing online with friends. Rewarding class/tier and weapon upgrades to demolish dozens of Dinos in a satisfying manner. Definately worth the price. 85/100
5415	1	a	First off the meta score is a little low for this game it is way more fun than you might think it does need lots more work.
5417	1	a	Would deffinately recomend this game! It plays a lot like borderlands and horde mode from gears of war. Really fun and challenging, especially with a couple of friends!
5419	1	a	Possibly the most fun you'll have with a bad game.  10/10 would bang.
5421	1	a	Fun with friends, but not that great of a game overall. graphics are old and bad, game is poorly optimized, but the gunplay is fun. Unless you havve a fairly large group of friends with Orion, I do not reccomend.
5423	1	a	Although more work on the game needs to be done, the game itself is really quite fun. that of course if you play with or in a group of people or friends. playing alone is a more hard and really just pointless, you wont survive long and it way less fun.  for my opinion there is no point of buying the game without friends to play with. its just don't worth it, but if if you do have someone to play with and you love the idea then give it a shot
5425	1	a	Reason why the meta score is bad because the game is bad
5427	1	a	I was rather worried about all the bad reviews, and the awful metascore this game had recieved, but given my interest in games like Killing Floor and Halo, I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, how bad can dinosaur killing be, right?  I downloaded the free trial, and WOW was I in for a surprise. It was just good, clean fun. It didn't feel as tight as Killing Floor, or as 'Next-Gen' as Halo usually does, but the combination of those two, and lack of real seriousness about the game make a fantastically fun time sink, and an extremely enjoyable game.  Within 15 minutes, I decided it was worth the $0.99 to pick this game up, as I had already had more fun playing it than I have had in a game like this since Killing Floor, and I do not regret it one bit, especially at this price.  While there are a few bugs here and there, such as dinos occasionally flying up to unbelievable heights, and arrows hovering after they have fired and hit a target. But there doesn't seem to be much of anything that gets in the way of the actual gameplay.  While to this point, I have not strayed much from the Players vs. Dinosaurs Survival mode (which is truly fantastic when you get a good group of people playing with you), there are many other different gameplay modes that provide good variety. Also, there is a pretty good selection of weapons in this game, catering to many different tastes, and nothing seems to be TOO over powered, with weapons seeming to be rather well balanced. The different 'Augmentations' are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to play to your own strengths instead of always having a vanilla character.  TL;DR:  Overall, this is a really good game, and has changed a lot for the better from the game that recieved a 35 metascore. Definitely worth the $1 it is right now, and probably even the $10 or $15 it is at full price.
5429	1	a	Lots of changes from the previous version... Keep up the good work. Looking forward to see another great updates
5431	1	a	Super fun, fast action dino killer.
5433	1	a	I recommend this game to the people who like first person shooters and 3rd person. There are tons of very uniqe weapons and equipment. PLAY THIS GAME!
5435	1	a	It's essentially killing floor, but cheaper and with dinosaurs and a car...and jetpacks...and no patriarch. It's actually nothing like killing floor. 8/10 Would recommend to people who like Killing Floor.
5437	1	a	Dino horde, the game you just love to hate, bad? maybe? its a game that you can play again and again and again, and yet still rage at it no matter how good/bad it is!   Is it worth it? not so much.
5439	1	a	I absoloutly love this game. 10/10    
5441	1	a	This game can't be compared to Dino Beatdown. Yes! It's created by the same developer, but once you play ORION: Dino Horde you'll get to see that Spiral Game Studios really took the negative reviews directly to the chin and practiced what the community demanded from Dino Beatdown - Put that into consideration. Also people that purchased Dino Beatdown received this game for free.  More and more free content has been added to this game, so it's pretty clear that Spiral Game Studios is working on it.  So how's this game? Well first off you need some people you can rely on playing with, I mean proper teammates. They should be able to revive you when you're incapacitated. Since there are big dinosaurs you'll trying to avoid them with your jetpack and you'll freak out for a moment since you don't know whether the Spinosaurus or Tyrannosaurus Rex can reach you or not when you're in the air!  If Spiral Game Studio is reading this - Please consider supporting Steam Workshop!  Peace.
5443	1	a	The metascore may leads to misunderstandings. It's not a very good game but at least not bad. i play in a lobby and it's really fun. it's exciting and some kind of interesting but still lots of problems  such as this game has the worst music ive ever heard and this game need more test. Anyway highly recommend if it is on 1 usd again.
5445	1	a	This buggy game is actually pretty fun when playing with friends!  This has a 5 player co-op.  i find the original price to be too high, I think this game should be around $5.00.  However, me and a lot of my friends only paid $1.00.Worth every penny. :D
5447	1	a	Great fun with friends :D
5449	1	a	If you didn't get this game when it was a dollar you really missed out. Honestly, i would have been more than happy to pay the full $15 for it. i put off actually loading this game and trying because of the low, low meta score, but you need to ignore the **** outta that number until they re-evaluate this gem. I reminds me of halo 1 charcter, vehicle and world design but on a much bigger bigger scale and more polish. it has a solid perk and weapon purchase sytem in game and a meta loadout your unlocking those same perks for you to use in matchmaking. and too top it all of ive hardly experienced any framerate drops, but ive been playing on med graphics when alone and low when online. All in all, on of the best multiplayer games if your lookin to have fun with a group of friends.
5451	1	a	A game so bad, it's good.  I bought a four pack of this for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles when it was on sale (90 cents a pop). Sent it to a couple of buds and started playing. There are so many mediocre elements in this game it's mind boggling.   LOOKS: At a glance the game looks kind of good. Until it starts to move. Animations are laughably bad, with characters running in comic fashion, kicking their heals against their butts as they run. Torso's not moving and turning as if on a swivel. Jumping looks equally terrible, with characters bouncing up into the air without bending their legs to push off. Dinosaurs movement is OK-ish if you do not count the bad AI creating what my friends and I ended up calling, 'Dino-trains'. A conga line of dinosaurs in all shapes and size, being kited across the battlefield as if connected to the player by invisible strings.  GUNPLAY: Weapons in this game are completely bland and unrealistic. From sounds to looks to feel. None of them stand out. Cross-hairs are obtrusive making aiming down site an awful experience. All gun sounds scream stock wav file.  BUGS: So many bugs, weird AI mess-ups, bad design choices (like having to run back and forth between a generator and the weapons caches in horde mode), clipping issues, getting stuck, spawning under the terrain. The list goes on and on.   GAMEMODES: PVP is a joke, with dinosaurs controlling like drunk trucks being driven by blind drivers. Horrible hit detection on their attacks and impossible camera angles making it even worse. There are so many invisible walls and clipping bugs in this game I started to wonder if the devs ever played their own product. Until I killed a dev and got an achievement (which was kind of cool).  This game has one redeemable game-mode, which is Survival (horde mode). This mode is the game's single saving grace. I wasn't expecting anything when I went in, but playing this with a couple of friends is a total blast. The constant upgrades in weaponry and vehicles between waves of enemies and their ever increasing size is just fun. Plain and simple fun.  Would I recommend this? The crazy thing is, yes, yes I would. But only if you can get it for a buck like I did. Spending more on this is just not worth it. Unless you're really into bad B-games and dinosaurs. It is good for a lot of laughs because of the over-the-top badness (is this even a word?), bugs and crazy physics. Survival mode is genuinely fun though. So at least there's that.
5453	1	a	Ok, so the graphics aren't jaw-dropping and there are so many bugs with the animations, gameplay and pretty much everything else...but this game is awesome. Because it is just plain fun - there is no mind-boggling depth to it, it's not all srs bznz and you can genuinely have a laugh and just enjoy the ride. Even if you're a filthy casual, like me, you can jump right in with those who are a much higher level and not feel out of your depth or unable to get stuck into killing compys, taunting T-Rexes (or should that be rexi?) and punching pterodactyls in the face.  Because if this were real life, you would TOTALLY punch a pterodactyl in the face. Admit it.
5455	1	a	There're dinosaurs in this game.
5457	1	a	Although I can barely handle this game on Low graphics, this game still looks good. The gameplay itself on the other hand, is AMAZING! I can see why they recommend a 6-core processor though xD
5459	1	a	Can kill T-Rex with mech.  10/10 Game of the Year  On a more serious note:  This game is incredibly underrated. I've played several hours of the survival mode alone, and it has been some of the most fun I've ever had in video games. The gun's models are well done, but are few in number. The game runs like butter and has crashed only once after a couple hours of gameplay. The dinosaurs models and animations aren't cringe-worthy. The combat is fluid, but some of the mechanics are questionable (Specifically the fight-to-survive mechanic). The graphics aren't anything revolutionary, but don't take away from the experience. The rounds in survival do, however, need a ready-up function to bypass the minute wait time in between waves.  I payed $0.99 for this game and had a better experience with it than I have with most AAA shooters selling for 60 dollars.  8/10, highly recommend.
5461	1	a	Good, fun, addictive game, great to mp with mates
5463	1	a	Pretty good game if you happened to get in on the huge sale, other than that i couldn't rec @ 15$. Controls are below average, weapons are about average, gameplay is maybe a little below average, graphics are poor, concept is pretty badass!
5465	1	a	Very fun, it has some server problems but it is evolving.
5467	1	a	Its a fun game and totally worth $1 i say get it and just enjoy the fruits
5469	1	a	You can kill a T-rex with a lightsabre.  10/10
5471	1	a	This game is just awesome!! The game is very fun to play with your friends! :D
5473	1	a	Woooooow...  A dollar well spent on the most ridiculous adaption of (Halo's) Firefight mode I've ever played. It's like a cross of Firefight, Planetside 2, and Dinosaurs. If you have a dollar that you don't know how exactly you want to spend, use it to buy this.   Best played while you're high on something. Seriously.
5475	1	a	this game is like an arcade game from the mid 90's that you played once and forgot because you played MK2 for so long afterwords and wished you had that quarter back.
5477	1	a	 Guys, buy it now . You won't regret it. Dino Horde , a.k.a. Futurist Killing floor with dinosaurs and vehicules, is a nice fun source. Step 1: Buy the 4-pack Step 2 : Give copies Step 3: Have fun !
5479	1	a	The game is incredible, it have a lot of dinos to kill :)  Pros: Have multiple classes ( assault, support and recon ) Have multiple game types ( survival, conquest, duel and so on .... ) Have multiple vehicles ( car, jet, tank, APC and so on ..... ) And ofc the game is constantly evolving ( char-class lvl and the game it self )  Cons: few minor glitches needs menu interface polish :)  overall - 7,5/10 ( at least )
5481	1	a	Orion Dino Horde, is basically HALOXKILLERDINOSAURSXGOODGAME. The game is fast paced with a couple ways to play. Three classes: Assault (Can Fly), Support (MEDIC!), and that one sexy female class that can go invisible. With rounds of dinos and lots of guns to play with, what could go wrong?
5483	1	a	Amazing textures ... gotta get ur self indulge in it if u try this game
5485	1	a	This is my first review, and I'm only writing it because of the low metascore that is highly inaccruate. If you like to shoot at dinosaurs and fly around with jetpacks, this is the game for you. Enough said.
824	0	a	This game is the love child of nazi-zombies and borderlands, except this child has an extra chromosome.
5487	1	a	For $1 I could have done a lot worse. This game is a lot of fun for the price. Yes there are annoying glitches and sometimes crazy lag, I have very muc enjoyed my time playing this game and will log in a lot more hours. Way to make a fun game guys :D
5489	1	a	Theres like dinos and guns and mechs and planes and ♥♥♥♥
5491	1	a	Best game I ever bought for $0.75
5493	1	a	Imagine playing a version of HALO 2 where you can obliterate raptors with the gun from RoboCop.  That's what it's like playing ORION: Dino Horde.  And I'm okay with this.
5495	1	a	Real fun often you can get this with a discount so be sure to check it out
5497	1	a	I got this for $0.99. 100% worth it. Great game to kill some time with your mates and a lot better than the usual Zombie Horde kind of games.  It's cheap and fun. Why not. Just like a street hooker.
5499	1	a	Game of the year! 10/10 It bearly works. amazing to record!! It's awesome butt ses so it doesn't work so good.
5501	1	a	Great game ^^
5503	1	a	so my reviews are along the lines of 'fu*k this game, 10/10' and this is no different. Wave defense, jetpacks, tanks and dinosaurs, what more could a guy ask for? you get to kill them? YES.    Fu*k this game. 20/10. Seriously.
5505	1	a	It's almost so bad it's good. I wouldn't recommend for solo play, fun with a friend. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
5507	1	a	GET a group of friends All get this game HAVE A BRILLIANT TIME
5509	1	a	this game literally isnt worth any amount of anyones time not even for the price I got it...
5511	1	a	I know Jeff Goldblum and he says that this is the best game where you kill dinos and he is the best person to judge dino games because he is Jeff Goldblum knower of all things dino.    ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY JEFF GOLDBLUM!   Real review: This is the best game ever, I mean having the upgrade stations on one part of a map and atleast 20 seconds apart with a minute to get to them is the best idea for the best game ever.
5513	1	a	Not A Bad Game
5515	1	a	This game is a must buy if you like the early halo series IE 1-3 , if you like jet packs gears of war or dinosaurs. This game started out broken as ♥♥♥♥ when it first came out and a lot of people got really butt hurt that this game was broken. But guess what they fixed literally every ♥♥♥♥ing thing people complained about. I bought the game when it was broken and shelved it for a bit and came back after fixes. But this games early community seems to be a bunch of limped dicked ♥♥♥♥♥es because they still troll this game ..... They have no right to talk ♥♥♥♥ about this game any more, the dev's truly made a cult classic out of this one and if your still upset about this game then it is time to move on it is great now stop living in the past.   This game is and will forever be one of my favorites not only because Dinos + jet packs + mechs with a Halo 2 meets gears look about it. But because the devs kicked ♥♥♥ and took a broken game they could have abandoned, and really polished the hell out of it. I have bought not just one copy but at least 10 so far because it is an amazing game to play with friends . Takes me back to when I use to do LAN parties as a kid :D  Do yourself a favor hop on and enjoy.
5517	1	a	This is a game that cost me $1. Simply the best dollar I've ever spent in my life.
5519	1	a	It's like call of duty meets dinosaurs.. but not exactly. It's really fun and addicting!
825	0	a	Play this if you hate yourself... and dinosaurs!
5521	1	a	why do you keep changing the name?
5523	1	a	This is the most fun you can have for $1.
5525	1	a	great game 
5527	1	a	this is a pretty good game, i give it 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family and would play 24/7 to save the little black people from Kony 2012
5529	1	a	Those who critisize this game do not really get deep into the gameplay. I personally like this game very much. You can experience a different type of FPS game by killing dinos with friends (and the multiplayer game is quite smooth). And you know what, this game costs only 1 dollar (and is even cheaper when you buy a 4-pack). Please don't compare this game with other which costs you more than 20 dollar!
5531	1	a	Metacritic rating is very misleading. This game is quite fun: lots of guns, perks, and powerups to buy in each individual map, as well as a leveling system that applies permanent passive bonuses.
5533	1	a	This game is great, i picked it up for the $0.99 sale. It is a fun game, it does need server work and i think there should be a TDM type mode as to where 2 teams battle it out, but also have to watch for dino's.  the graphic system does need an upgrade, it is a great looking game but it can be better, the menu needs an overhaul as well, the store items and character loadout is really pixeled and not clear.  The game has potential, and i see that there is another update coming this year, for a change of it to be orion: prelude with new maps, characters, menu, game modes ect. i hope graphics and dedicated servers are in it as well. Maybe more players in each game as well. But while this game is on sale id reccomend it, you cannot go wrong for $0.99
5535	1	a	I have given this game 2 reviews already but i kept coming back after the updates, the last update did this game justice, Spiral Games finally stepped up and listened to their fans and players. At first i did like the game, nice concept but then after they redid it, the optimization and performance was awful, and when i mean awful. The animations were just sad, i mean the way the raptors *chomped* on you was too odd and sad. It looked like someone eating cereal while having a stroke. But after the recent update this is what i must say.  1. The performance has been hugely improved, i can now play at 60 FPS without my pc tanking it.  2. The visuals have improved greatly, Dynamic Lights have been given a meaning however being annoying sometimes.  3. The animations have improved slightly, they still look clunky, specially the spino's, when theirs too many raptors it starts to breakdance lol, it looks funny but it could be improved.  Overall the game is actually enjoyable now, just becareful on joining a server where the host is from another country, you WILL lagg. This has to be fixed ASAP. Fun gameplay, great weapons (specially the bow, my god that bow is fun) and thank you for listening Spiral Games.   7/10 Fun, Great concept, Killing dinos with a bow while using a jetpack trying to avoid being eating while not dropping to a pool of raptors is enjoyable now.
5537	1	a	Great graphics and yet terrible graphics, but it is one of the most fun games to play with friends, up to 10 people at the same time.
5539	1	a	Amazing game! Love the graphics!
5541	1	a	Light and fun gameplay.
5543	1	a	Firtst off all Outstanding... Met score WTF this game is amazing why would anyone not want this game.. if you think about getting it.... wait why the F*** are you THINKING about getting this game. If your PC can run it get it! :) Here is a list of postitive things. 1) So Addicting  2) Great Game to play with family and friends 3) Great Open World DINO MURDER HELL YEAA!  Here are some negitives 1)Sometimes when you kill a big dino such as a spinosaurus it may crash, this has only happend to my twice and has only happened because my pc is a load of A hole. 2)Animations could be improved (But who cares right?) 3) In game Purchases, such as spiral points that I wish you could earn by leveling up. WHYYY.  Thats it! I rate it... 8/10 (Still some flaws; such as animations and in game purchases.) Addictive rating: REALLY GOD DAMN HIGH!  I love this game hope you do too :) Bye!
5545	1	a	Game is actually better than Call of Duty, less hackers , even not really possible to find one. Great Graphics, better animations than CoD, good Rainy Weather, even COD doesnt have that one. Good gameplay, enjoyable game with Friends over COOP.  Able to make lobby, not paytowin game , easy to play.
5547	1	a	llol i shoot a terex an it kill but i die cuz herbivore???
5549	1	a	The Bestest First and Only Dianasour Game! keep the great work Spiral!  9.8/10  EDIT (8/26/2014): Since Orion: Prelude is out Thank god i already bought the Orion Dino: Horde Because i diden't have to Repurchase  Rate again : 10/10
5551	1	a	Really fun, especially when played with friends
5553	1	a	well well, let me see... after a long break i have returned to Orion: Dino Horde .. it's fun.. with the right people, the job get's done easily..   do note, if you're planning on hosting a game, have a powerfull CPU.. a 4-core core2 series cpu won't do the job in later rounds..
5555	1	a	Just like battlefield with dinosaurs. 'It's okay 11/10' - IGN
5557	1	a	Ignore the metascore review, its wrong. This game is stupidly fun and you find yourself playing it over and over again with friends. This game is simply fun, if you're looking deeper into this gane welp, then you're not even trying to have fun. It's simple, it's fun and enjoyable and a good game overall. It's like 10 bucks too, just buy it.
5559	1	a	drove my friend into a t-rex 10/10
5561	1	a	Very good game. Metacritic scores are misleading.
5563	1	a	It's a decent game i guess. A little bit of bugs and other stuff but it's ok. :3
5565	1	a	I wish my T-Rex would evolve and get himself an automatic weapon but I guess throwing rocks will have to do. Fun game for a buck and young kiddies like it too. No complaints but hopefully with the next update the raptors will finally get jetpacks...eating guys in space suits sure beats licking tacks.
5567	1	a	at $0.99 I have already enjoyed this game tremendously for what I spent. Only have 2hrs in at the moment, but those were a couple of really fun hours for me and my buddies. This game has some terrible reviews, but I think it has come a long way since those reviews. Bottom line, this is a good game for its price, and a GREAT game for its current sale price.
5569	1	a	I haven't play'd this game since some of the most, most recent updates as an fyi. When my friends ask me about this game i tell them that this game is buggy and if you come into the game as a try hard wanting to beat it on the hardest difficulty this isn't the game for you. however if you come in with friends and just F around you will have one of the funest experiences of your life.  10/10 Best Simulator for Driving off cliffs in a Truck full of teammates
5571	1	a	Ran over 10 velociraptors with jetbike and, got stuck on a tree branch and killed 10 more with nuclear revolver. 10/10
5573	1	a	I'm surprised. This is actually a fun game. Is it a KF replacement? No, but it will give you hours of fun. And you can't beat the price.
5575	1	a	ok so i bought this game for 99 cents when it was on sale and i will admit it was probably the best 99 cents i have spent recently. the game is pretty fun i mean there are a few small things that i think could be a little better but overal the game is a great time killer and it has the potencial to be really fun if you have a good group of friends to play with. i personally wouldnt spend full price on it though even though it is fun there isnt much content its just another multi-player shooter. but next time it is on a steam sale i say get it for sure
5577	1	a	Given the massive sale that is going on right now it warrants a look at only $1. The score given by Metacritic is wrong. The game is a polished FPS that is continually getting updated. Fast paced survival action is what gets it for me. Nothing seems to over powered or useless, and there are many different styles to choose from, and routs to take. I am looking forward to see where they take this game in the future and I am gad I can be along for the ride.
5579	1	a	Wow, simply fantastic. I've persoanlly been searching for a good Dinosaur game for a while now, and all have been sub-par. All until now, that is. This game is the most exhilirating, most intense, hardcore dinosaur game I have ever played. I would a hundred dollars for this game, but this game is a fraction of the price, making it a must buy, 11/10 would reccomend
5581	1	a	Besides it being terribly hilarious, Dino Horde is really all I thought it was going to be. For only being able to play durring the free weekend, I was able to get a taste of something fun. Something that makes me laugh at it's simplicity, yet how amazingly fun it is. Best played with friends, this game is able to showcase just about everything it shows in the videos. It's a defense, survival, pvp/pve that does hearken to Halo, Killing Floor, and Jurassic Park as well. Though it goes beyond that into amazing maps, survival games, and even gives the players chances to get back at their friends in a multiplayer deathmatch.  It is a ton of fun, though I would say wait for a sale to get this. It's not exactly worth fifteen dollars in my mind, since there were bugs, but what game is without flaws? If you got it when it was a dollar, then hopefully you got your money's worth. This is most definitely worth the time for friends who want to have some co-op madness with dinosaurs and guns and mechs and always wanting to punch dinos in the face. That's always fun. :3
5583	1	a	Fun and great to play with friends
5585	1	a	My first experience of the game went something like this:  Waste loads of money on deciding which pistol I want (whilst not realising I can get a primary or secondary) Clicking more times that I ever have before in a panic to kill the dinos Hardly knowing what to do Dying within minutes 10/10 Would do again  If you didn't gather, my first experience was freaking amazing and I really found it enjoyable. I absolutely love it.
5587	1	a	You know what they say... 'it has swig'  #ND2013
5589	1	a	I'll be honest here I thought this game was gonna be a cheese buy like the game Bad Rats.  But honestly this game is a load of fun even by yourself.  I mean who doesn't love killing dinosaurs with guns?!  Also this game is super fun with friend's so bring them along as well!
5591	1	a	Love this game!
5593	1	a	It's an okey FPS game. But it gets boring after a while.
5595	1	a	Fun and addicting shooter. Worth a try.
5597	1	a	Purchased the game watching the videos. It looked like alot of fun. But then a saw that it had such a low metascore... i then thought dumb for buying a game that has a low metascore.. i shook it off and started the game. I loved it!! its alot of fun with friends. by yourself it can get hard. I recommend this game only if you have friends to play it with! 8/10
5599	1	a	I stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a sword. 10/10
826	0	a	99c? Not worth it. Atleast I saved 14$ with the sale. After it I bought 14 packs of sour skittles with the other 14$ I burnt my mouth. That experience was better than this game. The game -1/10 the skittles 11/10.
5601	1	a	Although the animations are eh, and the movement is kinda laggy/jittery-ish, it's still a pretty fun game to play with friends. I had fun playing it :D
5603	1	a	You can shoot a Tyrannosaurus with a lazer shotgun while flying with a jetpack... WHAT ELSE DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?!?! In all seriousness, I got this game on sale for 0.99$, (which it goes down to rather often) and I thought it was completely worth the price. At full price, I'd try to check out the game somewhere else first to see if you like it, but it's definitely worth a look. It has quite a few fun modes, and the gameplay is fast paced and fun. One of my few critiques though is while there is class variety (A soldier who can fly, a medic who heals, and a spy who can cloak) The distiction doesn't show up that much, and they're basically interchangable classes (So it's best to pick the one who can fly). Overall, a reccomendation to look at it, because you'll probably like it. It involves shooting hordes of dinosaurs while flying in a jetpack. Sometimes you can stab them with a lazer katana.
5605	1	a	Guys this is a great laugh........ give it a try!
5607	1	a	Very fun time killer with friends.
5609	1	a	Don't trust the metacritic score, this game went through several mayor changes, and the score is based on a much older version. This game is amazingly fun to play with a bunch of friends, and extremely diverse too. You can cloak yourself to escape from a T-rex, get enough distance in a suped-up helicopter and unleash hell on this dino by means of overpowered laser rifle! Leveling up earns you cool rewards, and so does unlocking achievements. For this current price, buy the 4-pack and blast some dinos to bits.  There are enough game-modes to keep you entertained for days and enough maps and difficulty settings to challenge your strengths. You can even open up a vast world and conquer it completely, provided you don't die in the process. Seriously, this game is top, recommended out the wazoo!
5611	1	a	This is a very silly game, for very silly people. All of this is in my opinion, keep in mind.  Graphics: Lovely Fun to be had: Lots Punching of the dino faces: Rediculously fun  I've had one game crash when I joined the server so far, so keep in mind this could be a problem,  but you can easily host your own public (Or friends-only) server in-game without third party software or paying,  which is a plus in my book.  It's £1, buy it, do it now (This only applies to the sale this review was written on, and possibly any future sales), although, for the full price of £12, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, but something to keep your eye on.
5613	1	a	What BF3-4 Dinosaurs should be!
5615	1	a	I got this game out of the blue thanks to the steam sale. And if it wasn't for that I wouldn't of found it. This game is awesome period, its player movements are nice and smooth and the dinosaurs give the game a different feel. The weapons are great and nicely balanced so far. If this game goes on sale again I recommend buying it. Its a rather fun game to play.
5617	1	a	When dinosuars existed they shot guns at them just like this.
827	0	a	This game is awful. Now I know what you're gonna say, 'How is it bad if you played it for less than an hour?' That's true, but it is extremely laggy, god-awful with a controller, and graphics are terrible.
5619	1	a	This game is far the best dinosaur game i've been played, a good game to play with your friends.
5621	1	a	not historically accurate, stegosauruses (stegosauri) were pacifists and did not partake in violence.
5623	1	a	controls are confusing, and it lags SOOOOOOOOO much for meh, but i dont dislike it. its really laggy, but i enjoy it...
828	0	a	Bad Game, worst Server Browser. Canr recommand this Game to anyone.
5625	1	a	Three words. Guns. Dinosaurs. Kill. 10/10 - IlumminatiGN
5627	1	a	Best $0.99 I've spent on Steam 10/10 would quickscope a T-Rex again
5629	1	a	Extremly repetitive, but strangely addicting. Small range of weps, OP upgrades, 3 classes with different skills to use... It kind of reminds me MVM on TF2. Jump right into the game and hope to meet the nice side of the game's community that will actually teach you things, because there isn't a tutorial. (Or study at the control part of options.) Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (And for 0.99, well, it's alright.)
5631	1	a	This game suprised me, I hate FPS games but being able to play as dinosaurs really drew me in.   Dislikes, The tutorial or starting play to me is garbage. Besides that its more fun with friends. way better then the lets play videos when it first came out.
5633	1	a	donno if its just me but its super laggy, can't see the dinos or anything else. I also played it on a friends PC and was great   9/10 great game
5635	1	a	It's mindless fun. The game takes itself more seriously than it actually is and tries to be over-the-top awesome which is quite hilarious. :D  The developer's good 'track record' makes me very optimistic about the game's future because they turned a complete wreck (Dino Beatdown) into a decent game and promise to refine it in the future, not very typical of todays small - and big - developers.  It is worth the original 10,99E in my opinion while for others it may not, but if it's on sale be sure to give it a whirl.
5637	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. With guns. Also, Jetpacks. Win.
5639	1	a	Wow i can write a rewiev for a game i doesnt have(Yet)  10/10 Not IGN
5641	1	a	BEST 0.99 CENT GAME EVER!  8 minutes ingame and already lovin it! A must get for all shooter fans!
5643	1	a	♥♥♥♥ it, don't need many words, one of the best games i've ever played, i've been going back to origins since games do bore me alot nowadays and when i tried this game (without any prior knowledge of it's existence) it was such a wonderful experience i can't wait to play it again every time i come home, just try it, don't bother with the reviews, TRY IT!
5645	1	a	10/10
5647	1	a	its good 
5649	1	a	A fun FPS that has basic FPS things (mainly stealing mechanics from Halo) but has it's own superior uniqueness.
5651	1	a	It made me ♥♥♥♥ upon myself
5653	1	a	like halo and wave defense had a baby, that had a pet dinosaur, that tried to eat the baby, too far?
5655	1	a	I've had this game for a while and I don't see how it got better... At all... I read reviews that hype it up and saying it got better since it changed its name to Prelude, and I see no change... I only recommend this game because I do still like it, I liked it before and like it now, but I was expecting that it did get better lol.
5657	1	a	Seriously this game is pretty badass. Think Killing Floor but with Dinosaurs. I always wondered what life would be like if I could beat down some velocoraptors with a laser sword and now I now.
5659	1	a	I bought this game when it cost £1.99 during a steam sale. Since that moment I can honestly i have never regreted my choice. This now under £1 game should not cost that much and i await the moment they put the price up and award themselves for the hard work they have obviously put into this. Would happily play £10 for this game as it is worth it. To any others that are looking at the game BUY IT NOW before they do what they should and make it cost more. Easily better than games such as Call of Duty and battlefield, It just needs more players and a wider community which it deserves
5661	1	a	I have to say that for 1$ is a really good game... And I REALLY mean it when I say that is a good game, considering you just spend the grosseries change on 1.5 GBs of pure FUN...  And I'm serious when I say that you have to give it a try! And let's be honest, at the beggining, everything looks blurry and you don't understand pretty much anything about the game, but after 2 hours this FPS becomes very promising! The game modes, the dinos, the weapons, skills and stores are fabulous!  You won't get dissapointed.
5663	1	a	This game is awesome... best FPS I've seen in a while.
5665	1	a	Slaying dino never felt so good.  The graphics is not so good but not so bad (1$ game, what you expect ?!). It is fun, it co-op, ROTFL mode on with this game. And 4-pack ? this game should consider 15-Pack. This game was way more fun if you played it with your close friend in the same room.
829	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxtPRF6NG7I 
5667	1	a	If your looking for a game to chill with this is one of my favourites. Well worth buying when its oin sale :D 
5669	1	a	The reviews are very misleading as they were reviewing a dfferent game... This game is pretty fun and right now its only a dollar so grab it and have fun with some friends
5671	1	a	I just threw a grenade down the throat of a T-rex that was trying to eat me. Need I say more?   Well I'm going to anyway. The graphics are very clean and play is very smooth. I can't even describe the feeling of taking down multiple large dinos with teammates and the satisfaction of learning how to use the classes well (I still love Assault the best, if only for the jetpack).  If you like co-op FPS survival games like Killing floor (and to some extent the L4D line), you will love this game. By my 2nd day playing the devs had even had an event, so I know they are involved with community. As usual a good group will go a long way toward you enjoying your playtime, so I definitely recomend getting a few friends to play with you.   I can't speak to the PvP element yet because I prefer Co-Op but I've enjoyed the Co-op play so much that I'm definitely going to check the PvP out and that is something I'm not normally drawn to very often.
5673	1	a	you get to fly around with jetpacks and shoot dinosaurs. what more could you want in a game? 11/10 would bang
5675	1	a	This game is total ♥♥♥♥.
5677	1	a	Killing floor with dinos and other game modes 10/10
5679	1	a	If you have buddies its alot of fun and a good time. but i wouldent recomend it to solo players. 
5681	1	a	subpar in just about every way, and poorly optimized. BUT has some interesting ideas and innovative mechanics which you rarely see in an fps. id love to see this one picked up by a major studio but only if it would stay faithful to the original concept and gameplay quirks. like everyone else has said, its way more fun than it ought to be, and its only 99c!
5683	1	a	Good for a 99c price
5685	1	a	With the gun style of Borderlands and the HUD style of Halo that makes this perfect. And you kill dinosaurs. DINOSAURS! How can you not find 99 cents for this game! Within 10 minutes of starting my first game, my friend and I were in tears because of how much fun this game is. 10/10
5687	1	a	This is definitely a fun game. Easy to learn after about 15 minutes of messing with everything that you have access to. The best weapons are late in the game so you'll have to be patient with pea-shooters. Each weapon does have its own unique set of characteristics but overall, I have quenched my thirst for killing dinosaurs - like no other game can! Thanks N!N and the Orion dev team(s)!
5689	1	a	Really good game. This game has been driven into failure because of it's previous title ORION: Dino Beatdown, but Dino Horde is different, and it is a whole new, exiting and amazing overall game. Completely worth my 15 bucks.
5691	1	a	I bought this game for 39 pence simply to extend my library and to have something to entertain me for about 20 minutes. What acctually happened was I spent 80 minutes having one of the most fun experiences in multiplayer gaming. The people I played with were extremley fun and helpful, no trolls or spams or anything like that. I only played the game with strangers but I imagine there is also more fun to be had with freinds. I'm about to find out actually, I just bought this game for three of my friends and we are going to paly it to death.  If I was to give this game a score out of 10 so far it would be an 8. I was happily surprised by this game.
5693	1	a	A fun little game which doesn't really feel like it's that much special but it's a great game to play for a few hours with a bunch of pals.
5695	1	a	this game is great
5697	1	a	I have no idea why did it take me so long to adore this game. Maybe it's the weird Metacritic score or some bad reviews from random people. I tried the game during free promo weekends and was all like: 'Meh, I'd better play some Killing Floor'. Now, I make a statement that this game is really fun. TONS of play modes, plenty lots of weapons and enemies. I won't say that this is a co-op game where you shoot dinos and stuff. It's all about how YOU play it. Deathmatch, Survival, Rampage, CTF. Weather changes, heavy rain and night time make you almost blind, your FOV can be frozen if you play in Arctic maps. Too much to say. You should really give this game a try? The most I like about it is that you level up. You gain additional damage, guns, ammo capacities and stuff. Buy it! P.S. You can 'arrow to the knee' a T-REX and build turrets! :D P.P.S. You know what would make this game hell? A FLYING BOSS DINO!
5699	1	a	ORION: Prelude is super glitchy and half-♥♥♥♥♥... but for some reason, it's really fun. It was $0.99 when I bought it... perfectly priced.   Buy a copy for each of your friends, have a stupid amount of fun playing with them and laughing at the game... don't ever play it again and still feel like it was money well spent.
5701	1	a	Deserves a lot more love!
5703	1	a	great game for a low price, although animations and graphics are a bit low quaility
5705	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game for every dinosaur lover, star wars fan, jurassic park fan or a Halo fan. I recommend it to everyone of those people from the list above! My rating for this game is 10/10. Keep up the good work!
5707	1	a	Great game
5709	1	a	54 cents Hour Download Instant Regret. 11/10 Not Halo
5711	1	a	wow nc game price soo low many vehicles weapons to test and a tough game evry one should buy it i will give 9.5/10
5713	1	a	Where is the Donate button?
5715	1	a	It's cheap, decent and almost always on sale. If you've got a dollor to spare have fun.
831	0	a	10/10 would not play even if it had a naked super model at the end
5717	1	a	Shootin dinos is fun. Nuff said.
5719	1	a	T-Rex throws machineguncar on hill, machineguncar not reachable for enemies and can kill all 20/10
5721	1	a	Its a very good game but at my PC lags. Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3240T CPU 2.90 GHz RAM: 4 GB and on board GPU. Is this normal to happen? I play games with higher system requirtments and they dont lag at low settings.
5723	1	a	This is a great game if i´m bored with tf2 and cs:go...And for just a buck
5725	1	a	Not a bad Dinosaur Horde Survival game, but for $1, its a steal of a game! Definitely get it, since its one buck.
5727	1	a	This games just ♥♥♥♥ed.
5729	1	a	Theres...Dinosaurs
5731	1	a	This game somehow makes many old concepts work together and feel new and innovative. It's a whimsical kind of awesome; you can fly around with a mother♥♥♥♥ing lightsaber fighting a T-Rex.
5733	1	a	Great Game for only $1
5735	1	a	Cheap and pretty fun. It's a win-win.
5737	1	a	ORION: Prelude is great horde game. It is really unique style. I absolutly recomend it!
833	0	a	Here is what we have learned from this game: Dinosaurs and Killing Floor do not mix. At all. They just don't. The people who think this game is good are lying to themselves. If you check the public multiplayer servers, there are many. Many barren, unused servers. It took one try for my friends to find the game that I had joined through the server list. That is not what I want in the game. Neither is a dinosaur Killing Floor knockoff. I guess that's what I asked for when I bought this game for a dollar. Yeah, don't buy it. Save your dollar.
5739	1	a	This is the type of game you mess around in with your friends.
5741	1	a	It's fun. Pure, simple fun and the developers are really cool guys whose devotion really payed off.
5743	1	a	Still not sure what this is a prelude to. 9/10
5745	1	a	When I first got it, I thought this game was crap. Then I realised that my computer was crap. The game was too pretty for me and my computer wasn't happy about it. So really, that's good. But survival wasn't doing it for me. AI weren't all that great, and I didn't know what to do. Then I played rampage mode. DANG. I'm a human. And some guy playing just ate me. LOL. I mix things up and play as a Spinosaurus. And I ate people. And it was AWESOME. Then I finally got somewhere in survival and I found a tank. And shot a Stegosaurus. And a T-Rex. And I wrecked dino-face. So glorious. Bought a 4-pack, and I'm looking forward to eating my friends while they try to kill me with puny guns. Not a great game, but it's great fun. I'd recommend this for $15 dollars. All the way. IT GOT BETTER.
5747	1	a	Your character spouts nonsense about pizza while your friend shoots dinos while in a giant mech. Out of room in the truck? Just run into your friend and take him along with you.  10/10 Bring me some pizza
5749	1	a	i punched a T-rex in the balls  10/10  would punch again
5751	1	a	First person shooter game sets in Dinosaur survival cooperative, big maps setting, survival mode waves with few objectives task to finish it. Killing dinosaurs to earn credits, you can buy upgrades, weapons or items. There a three class in this game, Assault, Support and Recon. The Assault has the ability to use his jetpack to easily escape from the dinosaurs as well going through unpassable obstacles. The Support has the ability to heal his teammates and also can heal himself and perhaps can act as a tank in the group, the last and finally. The Recon is my favorite class since the ability itself can cloak invinsibility to save herself in the trouble or revive her teammates, i also forgot to mention. There are alot of maps, game modes, etc.   I bought this game and i really enjoyed alot, even though there are minor bugs. They will always fixed the bugs and go for the updates, i highly appreciated of what the developers did because they listen to the community players. Take note that this is an Indie Game and its actually a small company who made this game. Some old low reviews came from Orion: Dino beatdown predecessor so there are lots of changes in the gameplay.  Rated: 8.7/10
5753	1	a	I've never been much of a fan of Shooters, but this game keeps bringing me back for more. Have you ever played a game where you can shoot dinos with a powerful array of weapons, or been able to kill a T-Rex by punching it in the face? Well, despite Sally more likely to end up eating you whole, this game has that, and so much more. It may lack the story that Guardians of Orion has, but nothing's as good at relieving tension than running through Prehistoric mode solo, as you can set enemy damage, health, large and small dinosaur ratios, starting credits, and credit drop rate to become a dinosaur killing machine, easily going on a 6 hour spree without even realizing how much time has passed. For just a dollar you can get so much fun out of this gem of a game, so I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a chance.
5755	1	a	Like halo... with dinosaurs very good and fun
5757	1	a	ok its food for the first 4 hours then you start to realize that it is way too damn easy. that makes it bad. the controls for the vehicles are annoying, i mean who does the borderlands controls like they suck... i want to press 'a' or 'd' to turn not move my mouse... the game really does suck ♥♥♥ though. though it is fun if you like that kind of game.  now i will say it is fun, i will say it is intresting, i will say it is worth the buck you pay for it, and i will say that if you have enough cards to sell, sell them and get this game. its bad but not for the price and the enjoyment you can get out of it.   will i play it again? yeah at some point is it worth my money? yeah it is... it's only a buck. is it worth playing? depends how bad are you at Modern Warfare...   this game is fun it is easy but hard at the same time, while i can survive multiple rounds (like 15) in Modern Warfare's servival mode, i only survive at most 5 in this game. but the shear size of the waves is rediculous. they get hard fast... but well sitting ontop of a rock and snipting the heck out of a few hundred dino's with a 75% acuracy rate... is rediculous. heck i think i am about 80 or 90 witht the top tier sniper... that isn't that hard to get. i can bearly hit the broad side of a barn in modern warfare when i snipe, yet along headshots are rare. in this game... you can pick up the sniper and head shot alot of dinos verry easilly. there are times you will run out of ammo before you miss a shot. large targets i guess...  lets now talk vehicles... they suck. getting them sucks even worse and well when you have to use an emp to access them... that is bad. intresting but bad.  i'm getting a little ranty so let me say the bottom line.  SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?  Yeah. you should. play if for 4 hours then realize it isn't much of a challenge. yes it is fun, and i would recomend this if you have a buck to spare.
5759	1	a	Fun for while. Jokes for a while. Id reccomend of youre bored. 10/bored
5761	1	a	Like jurassic world but with a 10$ budget 10/10 would play again
5763	1	a	I got an achievement for being eaten. 10/10
5765	1	a	This game is aweosome for a 1 dollar game, great game for if you feel like playing something new but dont feel like spending alot of money
5767	1	a	dinosaurs, lasers, guns, futureristic,lightsabers,jeeps,hover vehicles,and drones what more of a cluster ♥♥♥♥ can u ask for  1000/1000-MGN would play again
5769	1	a	I felt like Boba Fett, but except for rebel scum, I was killing dino scum 10/10
5771	1	a	pretty amazing game. i got it for .99 so that makes it even sweeter. good game play great graphics would recomend it to others
5773	1	a	I bought 4 pack of this game with 39 cents. I'd pay more for the fun me and my friends have. Excelent
5775	1	a	Don't listen to the haters. Its 79p for god's sake. You get what your paying for and for the money, with some mates, it's really not that bad.
5777	1	a	Got it on sale for .49 cents. Played for 2 hours and it was a blast. So far that about 25 cents to the hour. 10/10 would give two quarters again to get this game. Don't even think about it, just get it.
5779	1	a	This game is really fun for a cheap game and I enjoy it! stop for looking negative comment you should try it!
5781	1	a	Call of Duty: Dinosaurs  11/10
834	0	a	The worst game I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Not even worth the $1 its on sale for.
5783	1	a	Seriously just go buy this..Loads of fun and it's practically free..even in SA..
5785	1	a	You can either get that 2$ chicken pizza burger taco or buy 2 copies of this for you and your friend to shoot dinosaurs (and other prehistoric things not to be racist) for hours on end.     If your hungry you can always become the dinosaur and eat the human, probably tastes better then that chicken pizza burger taco.  I rate 1/1
5787	1	a	This game isn't too bad, and I know I say this with a very low gameplay count, but it isn't THAT bad. I definitely think that this game has improved, although I hadn't played the older versions, hearing it from other players, it seemed to evolve a ton. The developers seem fun, seeing as they called their old game 'the worst game ever', which is always nice to have good developers. I bought the fourpack for my friends, still haven't given all of them away though.  Let's start with the graphics. When I first launched the game, the title screen was okay, and then I joined a game and the graphics seemed a little... strange, not too well done. Then again, I'm used to ARK graphics, which is most likely why. As I went deeper into the game, I ignored the faulty graphics and I think it's still enjoyable.  Onto the gameplay. When I started up the game, I went into a server to see what everything was about. Wow, I never thought I'd be so confused - I went into a random gamemode, chose to play as a Dilo, and had no clue what I was doing. I started spitting everywhere and a human crawled up next to me and blew me up. That was that for that server, so I went into the Survival gamemode with a few other players. Man, that was certainly a plus. The survival gamemode is fun, waves of dinosaurs of all types, and it's decently challenging when you have everyone come after you. It took me about 5 minutes to get the hang of it (which I am a fast learner, sometimes), and all was good. I followed my teammates to see what was going on, shot dinosaurs, killed a pteradon. Overall, the gameplay I've had so far has been decent.  Honestly, this game is good and all, but don't have high hopes. But then again, for $1, the price of a can of coke, this is worth it, definitely. Sure, there may be glitches, the gameplay may be wonky, the dinosaurs kill you every two minutes, but if you manage to look past its faults, Orion: Prelude is a wonderful game. I'd rate it 7/10.
835	0	a	Well, it sucks.
5789	1	a	Well it had more than i wanted and the graphics are epic
5791	1	a	It's not a great game, It's not the game with the best animations, or the best gameplay, It's one of those games which is cheap and sells alot because of the great times you have with your friends blasting dinos.
5793	1	a	I got the game because of the sale and would have payed full price for it, I have a great time playing with my friend and gives off a sense of adrenaline rush that makes it extremely fun.
5795	1	a	10/10 I cried for three whole weeks after I bought the game. This game is litterally my life, shrek is no longer my life this game has become my love as well, sorry shrek. This game has to be the best game ever with the dino blast and the dino chopper all going like 'pew pew pew pew' gotcha! take that you dinosaur scumbags! MURICA NEEDS ITS OIL SOME HOW ♥♥♥♥♥ES. Must say I played for 30hours straight using a bucket to ♥♥♥♥ in and drinking my own ♥♥♥♥ to survive, was worth it just to finally kill some god damn dinosaur looking ♥♥♥ mother ♥♥♥♥ers. I lied 20/10 would reccomended beat the hell out of that there call of ♥♥♥♥o 3
5797	1	a	please make it for free because it is a very awesome game plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
5799	1	a	its neat.
5801	1	a	Don't listen to the metascore. This game has vastly improved.
5803	1	a	This game is by far one of the best games on steam and can be played for hours on end. nothing says a great game like guns dinosaurs. The fact that you can play it with friends makes it so fun and replayable also with different maps and different gamemodes there is a new adventure ever time. there is so much to be said about this game but to some it up in two words they would be 'Pure Badass'.
5805	1	a	Hello its me, Ive been recomending games like this since black ops 3 to go over everything, For only 1 dollar this game is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steal, BUY IT NOW OR YOU WILL SEE, HOW BLACK OPS 2 IS MW3333333333333333, AND I recomed this game
5807	1	a	Beatdown, beat em up, killem good!. Just watch the skies for the god darn TERRIES! May you jetpack in peace.
5809	1	a	This game is solid. The price is right, even better when I picked it up for 49 cents. If you like shooting things and fighting dinosaurse you will enjoy this game. If you dont, get off my internet.
837	0	a	This game sucks
5811	1	a	I recommend this game for countless reasons   Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 respect for David Prassel 900000/10
838	0	a	this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥
5813	1	a	Wow This game is Really good, it only needs a tune up on the visuals and maybe a couple more classes. and boom HALO for 1 doller+ jurasic park.
5815	1	a	To be honest, the game is far from being perfect. The animations are bad, the bots are dumb and for the first hour in game, you don't really know what's happening. BUT the overall concept is really, really cool. It's just like some guys were sitting together over some beer and then someone said: 'I'd really like to play a game right now, where I can punch some T-Rex on his nose!' And then the second guy said: 'Yeah, and where I can fly a jetpack while shooting rockets!' And the third guy just shouted 'LIGHTSABRES!'. Then they finished their beer and started working. For all of us. Because we all secretly wanted this game.  Even though the result doesn't look as great as they probably hoped, the game works. And goddammit it's so much fun. Buy it. And buy it for your friends too, so you can punch T-Rexes and run over raptors in beach buggies together. It costs less than a beer.
5817	1	a	Billions of great experiences and action in a 1 dollar game! 
5819	1	a	Great game so worth 1 dollar
5821	1	a	Simply the best survival game I've played combat is great and the visual effects are great ! Could add some more weapons and some smother maps to maneuver on that would be more grassy or have more trees in them giving that prehistoric feel ! Playing with friends is easy and great fun... This game deserves a 10/10 from me !
5823	1	a	HIghly recommended for people looking to play team-based games, or just waiting to have fun with friends online.
5825	1	a	I played it once before it was free for a few days i loved it.  What i like :  - You can be a dinosaur and ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up. - You can ♥♥♥♥ the dinosaurs and steal theire babies. - Has COOP and Online. - Can pick a few dinosaurs that are funny like the one that suicide bombs. - I like the graphic personally.  What i don't like :  - The fact that it dosn't have alot of players cause IGN rated it bad and same as the other.   I like this game but it has no one.. You could get it at a discount for 50 cents i got it for 73 cents i think. I reccomend it but don't buy it at the moment it dosn't have alot of players i want this game to be Popular again.
5827	1	a	its just awesome plain and simple
5829	1	a	AMAZING GAME! Sometimes you just need some mindless, time-wasting, jet-packing, missile-launching, dino-stabbing carnage. Even better? Get a few friends on a match with you and watch the hours melt away. This game delivers... NOW BRING ME SOME PIZZA!
5831	1	a	'This game feels like the hand of the lord has stroked my genitalia.'
5833	1	a	Orion: Prelude. Where do I start with this game?  Orion: Prelude is an extremely fun experience, especially with friends. Having bought it in the early-ish stages of Orion: Dino Horde (what it was formerly called). I can say this along with everyone else: This game has improved loads since its initial release.  Let's start with the gameplay. Orion: Prelude feels alot like other wave-based survival games, but with dinosaurs. Pretty self explanatory. (There are also PvP gamemodes, but I haven't played them, I just bought this game for the co-op). However, the variety of maps and settings keep this game fresh, especially the fully customizable 'prehistoric' difficulty setting. The open world game mode (conquest) is great, and I still haven't fully explored the open world maps.  The visuals, simply put, are good. It's no Crysis 3, but everything looks really nice. The tasteful lighting and particle effects add to the atmosphere and overall feel of Orion: Prelude. However, the environments and such sometimes clash with the player models (the player models being the ones doing most of the clashing), making the game's graphics look imbalanced at times. Some of the animations are slightly mistimed. None of these are major issues though, and don't really affect the feel of Orion: Prelude. For the price, you just can't get visuals this good.  The soundtrack is excellent. My only complaint in this department is sometimes a song won't play all the way through before switching to another song, and the song-changing seems unrelated to what you are doing in the game.  Orion: Prelude is a great game. It's not without flaws, but I can definitely recommend it. For the price, this is probably the best game you can buy on Steam.
5835	1	a	If you enjoy FPS games and horde action games   Orion: prelude is for you. All you need to know  Kill dinosaurs. Survive. Kill more dinosaurs.
5837	1	a	Great game the Meta score does not do it justice at all!!!
5839	1	a	It's a nice game, but if you dont got a friend to play with, you almost go SOLO. Not too much people playing.  8/10 play again.
5841	1	a	Forget about what all the critics say. This game is suprisingly good fun! It may be buggy and a tad rough around the edges but its very playable and you will have alot of fun with it for sure! So I reconmend you give this game ago!
5843	1	a	This game is created by illuminati My review is 9/11 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ▉▉▉▉▉▉◤┳◥▉▉▉▉▉▉ ▉▉▉▉▉◤┳┻┳◥▉▉▉▉▉ ▉▉▉▉◤┳┻┳┻┳◥▉▉▉▉  ▉▉▉◤┳┳┳┳◥▉▉▉  ▉▉◤┳┃┈╰╯┈┃┳◥▉▉ ▉◤┳┻╰╯┻┳◥▉  ◤┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳┻┳◥
5845	1	a	 Fun! Lots of fun and innovation right ahead!   + Awesome concept + Various types of dinosaurs + Alive community as hell + Usually has some good prizes + Lots of game types + Well made vehicles + Awesome potential  - Few and unbalanced classes - Relatively a few weapons - Not very known game - Sometimes you get p!ssed - Suggestions to make a perfect game   PROS   1. Awesome concept  When I first bought the game I thought like  dafuq am I buying? A game with a goal that is to kill dinosaurs? But wait, it's only R$1.50? I'll give it a try . And I liked it! A lot! The concept is fun, the teams have to be organized to survive the hordes of dinosaurs, that come from air or land. Although the graphics are not thaaaat good (they're only ' good ', not ' very god ', but that's not bad). Even though the dino-shooter game category is incresing, Orion is awesome and even if it's cheap it deserves a nice place in that place in that category.   2. Tons of different dinosaurs  The game itself has a lot of different dinosaurs, from different species and with different statuses: some are tank-ish, others are fast, others fly, others are so small that shooting them is way too difficult and etc. That's awesome! Bringing lots of types of dinos is truly a heavy thumbs up to the game, while other games lack in this topic, Orion is an absolutely  win  here.   3 Alive community  The community is alive, differently from other games and the devs are constantly open to discussion or sometimes they start contests or invite people to play with them, isn't that cool? I've seen lots and lots of games  (some good games, acutally)  that are with more than one year without free patches and are only 1,5 or two years in the market. This game's about 2.5 years until today being sold and is being constantly changed.   4. Usually has some good prizes  This topic is strongly related to topic 11, unfortunatedly. But everything has its good and bad sides! The good thing is that I've seen Orion with awesome prizes (85%, 90% off) a lot of times before actually buying it. I bought it with a heavy discount, 90% off if I'm right, and profited very well. It was actually better than a lot of games that I actually paid more and had less fun.   5. Game types  This topic is not as important as it should be since most of the shooter games -related to dinos or not- have this in common but since it's present in Orion it should be pointed, shouldn't it? Like many other games there are lots of game modes PvP, PvE, EvP, etc. It is a positive point so it has to be put here but nothing special.   6. Vehicles!  The vehicle types are cool! There are tanks, jet-motos, mechs, futuristic helicopters, jeeps, mechs and other types! The good things are not the vehicles themselves but the way you can use it. Even if the graphic's not that excellent there's always an animation of getting in and getting out, signal that  at least  the developers tried to make the game the most complete as they could. Other thing is that depending the place you are and enter the car, you can't drive or you can't shoot, that's a complete and wide thinking of placing the player in the most realistic ambient to the game. You can also get up on some vehicles while they're moving and they 'carry' you as long as you're on them. Of course that there are some necessary vehicles missing, like a two people mech and a 2-4 people helicopter but the game they way it is is not that bad :)   7. Awesome potential  Well, what can I say, this topic means it all. Yea, Orion has a huge potential, believe me or not, and it only depends on the developers. The ambient is nice, the dinos are annoying  (well, they're only doing their job, hah) , the vehicles are challenging, there are bosses  (with, let me say, are hard AS HELL to kill)  and a lot of other things that are differential to other games. This game's technically prepared to have any colossal upgrade that can greatly increase it's gaming experience, remember this.   CONS   8. Unbalanced classes  The game can have up to three classes only (assault, spy and medic -you probably know what they all do). But it lacks a LOT of classes, for example at least engineers, tanks, snipers, hunters, scouts, and ninjas/melee-handed  (anyway, call them the way you want)  are missing. Another bad thing is that every weapon is absolutely the same if used by  any  class, with means that, for example, if an assault player uses a machine gun they'll get the same damage output as a medic (which is NOT right, since the assault-dude is focused on hitting while the medic is focused on supporting). That's not right. The game could have at least an upgrade-tree, too, particular to each class. You can see some suggestions at topic 12.   9. Few weapons  The game has too few weapons in my opinion and they're all pretty much the same. They're all ballistic and the game's context is futuristical. Not that the game would need to have futuristical antimatter-weapons or black hole generators or portals, no. But at least some energy short range weapons, maybe some lasers, gauss rifles or 'dino-ECMs'? Maybe...?   10. What is Orion?  The game's not very known, maybe because the gaming industry is way too competitive, maybe because it was re-released twice I think, or even maybe because  the game has poor grades  [www.metacritic.com]  in a lot of sites and was poorly reviewed by a lot of critics (just see their grades). That's odd, I might say. If you see the Steam Store valuations  the game score is 74/100 . Anyway, despite the reason is, the game does not has a very good fame and that keeps pushing it down the gamer community, not only Steam.   11. You usually get ♥♥♥♥♥♥  Most of the times when you're playing PvE games at medium difficulty or harder you have huge chances of getting killed, despite of the reason. But the point is that when you die you lose ALL (I repeat, ALL) of your character/weapon upgrades and weapons! FFS! I know the game's not meant to be easy but this kills the game sometimes, it's very common to see players leaving rooms after getting killed, making the survival task way harder than it normally is, unbalancing the game and making sometimes other players leave! If you buy this game be sure this will be a common thing to you!   12. It lacks a lot of good things that could absolutely make it a perfectly success game  The game's awesome but it lacks a lot of things that some other games have that make them more successful as Orion. Let's list them up here  who knows maybe a Spiral developer read them     Classes overhaul : The class system needs to be completely remade. Not that the ones who are in the game are bad, but because they're insufficient to fill all of the gaps the game lacks:[/tr][/tr]    Class  Duty    Assault  Shoot things at a fair range Can fly.    Spy  Master of disguise. Can turn invisible.    Medic  Can heal people up Has a +0.5 HP/sec regeneration aura (10 meters).    Engineers  Like techy stuff Can repair vehicles with his money but earn more money.    Tank-ishes  Have more armor. Better at close-ranged fighting.    Snipers  Snipe!    Hunters  Incredible damage with bows/crossbows. Can smell enemies    Scouts  Poke and run Can run faster with their futuristic armors.    Melee  Awesome damage with swords and knives. Can make enemies bleed!       Campaign    Bigger vehicles   More game modes   Profile passive skills   More dinosaurs! :D  
5847	1	a	Those that bought is game when it was 15 bucks must have felt cheated......I bought is at the price of dirt. Anyway Orion Dino Horde or what its now know as Orion Prelude is a game where you survive hordes of dinos attacking you,its similiar to many zombie games and wave of enemies games so you will enjoy tis if you enjoy those.
5849	1	a	Ruined my life. 'Just one more wave.' 10/10 would bang.
5851	1	a	Its like skyrim with guns 9/10
5853	1	a	Halo Clone [check]   Halo Clone with Dinosaurs [check]  that's all folks, not the best game out there, but for 99cents, its well worth it. Highly Recommend to play it with your friends since the servers, well sucks  6/10
5855	1	a	Reasons why you should get this game 1-dinosaurs 2-multiplayer 3-10/10 fun 
5857	1	a	Just spent two hours on Survival, got a consistent feel going. That.Was.The.Most.Amazing.Game.I.Have.Ever.Played. This game is INSANE. The dev team is out of their minds to make it $1. Buy it now, buy 4 packs like I have, sell it when it gets popular for like $5 lower, make a profit, have fun with friends, heck, the experience is yours to make. Enjoy.
5859	1	a	I Got killed by a T-Rex 11/10
5861	1	a	It all started back in 2014, I got this game because my friends told me to. After playing it for the first time i was addictted and i started seeing the world was boring unless i was playing ORION Dino Horde, my life was centered around it. Ruined my life 10/10
5863	1	a	It's a terrifically fun game that's one dollar and people still feel entitled enough to complain about it on metacritic.  10/10
5865	1	a	What do you when we gain access to a time machine that allows us to go back in time and visit dinosaurs  Why we shoot them of course we want to make them go extinct before the astroid does  6 dinosaurs out of 10 dinosaurs
5867	1	a	I gave this game a yes only because Valve does not give us the option of a 'meh' or 'Decent' option. Let me go through this with you shall i? The game is loads of fun, if you are a fan of Killing Floor you will ADORE this game. If you love the art style of Halo and the feel of Halo you will ADORE this game. If you lik fast paced FPS games like Quake or Doom you will ADORE this game. It is all of these elements rolled into one with an added bonus of awesome DINOSAURS! However, perfection i not with out its hidden flaws.   These flaws have been reported as crashing upon starting the game or even just browsing for servers (wich thankfully i have yet to experiance though apparently it can be fixed by verifying game cache), the gun and other sound effects not loading up or working and finally (the one i am suffering through) Lag. Now there ae two types of lag to this game, regular internet lag (as i have seen most the people on here or the less populated servers you can access for play are foregin in nature IE im American and joining a primarily German server) but then theres graphical lag. This being the lag where you must lower the settings to the lowest or have major slow down. This issue is usually fixed by reducing the screen size but unfortunatly the resolution only gors to 1270x720 and no lower. The only way to truly fix this is if the resolution could go lower making it less of an issue to render and work the PC more. I have resorted to playing in windowed mode on 1270x720 but even then with alll the graphic settings set to low i lag HORRIBLY.   Outside of that tiny lag issue and bugs that can be patched the game is fun and offers hours of enjoyment and is a fun party game for survival mode. Highly recommended of a pick up but i would more or less wait till the bugs are ironed out (i believe the game isn't a full release yet not totally sure)   PICK IT UP AS I AM SURE THE .99c PRICE WILL CHANGE VERY SOON!
5869	1	a	The reviews are right, this game is extremely entertaining! It's a new look to the feels I got from playing L4D2 with friends before.
5871	1	a	whether you're flying a wangus or shooting a t-rex in the ♥♥♥♥, this game is hella fun with friends
5873	1	a	Okay, so you're probably thinking that this looks like some game for 5 year olds that the devs incorporated guns into. Well, I thought the same exact thing. WELL I WAS WRONG. This game is so much more than that and with the size of the actual game, with the sale going on, I would buy this game for a dollar in a heartbeat. Don't pass up this steal before it's to late. I have not bought it yet but I will make sure I do before the sale ends.
5875	1	a	I really liked this game so much but only two thing in this game need to fix, the sounds always out of sync and weapons need some improvments when shooting the big birds, but i recommended for sure when you play it with your friends its more fun!
5877	1	a	Orion Prelude is fun very fun game overall and the price is even better this game has by my opinnion the best developpers a game can ever want.  I have some slight requests for the devs. :  1. A graphical improvement wouldn't hurt considering the fact that we gamers, in 2015, have powerfull PC's. 2. Character customization system (a bit like the TF2 system but less complicated maybe). 3. Customizable weapons (Scopes, muzzles, etc.)  I know its a big demand but im sure our caring developpers wouldnt mind making huge (maybe) 3 year celebration update with these cool new addons.  Thank you
5879	1	a	Really good for the price. Actually really fun.
5881	1	a	fun coop with friends
5883	1	a	This game was suprisingly really fun. I'm not really scared of dinosaurs,  but I do scream when I see the stegosaurus running towards me. This is a game where it will sneak behind you and grab you and by  the time you look at the time, while you're trying to survive the next wave,  you will already be 3 hours late for work.  Plus- Jetpacks. This game made me see how well jetpacks and dinosaurs go together.
5885	1	a	Pretty good game Pros Weapons Difficulties Gamemodes Dinos Cons Bad graphics  8.3/10
5887	1	a	this game is the best ♥♥♥♥ I`ve never played for 0.79€ and will give u tons of hours of entertaiment
5889	1	a	So addictive, and for the price you can't beat it!
5891	1	a	Recently purchased the 4-pack bundle for my friends and myself - I tried it out this weekend with a friend, it was tons of fun. Absolutely recommend it for play for fun casual gaming and spontaneous LAN-parties.  The full price seems a bit high, but if you can pick it up on sale it's really worth it - especially if you have a few friends to play with! Also, you fight dinos with big guns from a jetpack - what else do you need?!
5893	1	a	8/10. A few bugs, but still really fun.
5895	1	a	this game just has the best 'cost/benefit ratio' a game ever had
5897	1	a	I didnt have much to lose, .74$ for a four pack for me and my friends(sale). I came out with a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game. it's a little clunky at first but god damn you'll enojoy this game.
5899	1	a	Very adictive Game
5901	1	a	I purchased a 4 pack of this game while it was on sale, not expecting much, but man, was that the best three dollars I ever spent. If I would have purchased this game at the full price, I would still not regret it. This game is loads of fun by yourself, but grab a couple of buds, and it gets just 10x better.If you are debating wether or not to get this game, I would advise you greatly to take $15 out of your wallet and throw it down on this game. Seriously. You won't regret it.
5903	1	a	Love this game. Bought it when it was on sale for .99 cents better than a lot of the 20 dollar games
5905	1	a	Great Game, Countless Hours of fun, only game i could fight a giant crocodile with a mech :)
5907	1	a	9/10 would be 10/10 if it was called orion dino beatdown again
5909	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
5911	1	a	one of the best dino fps ive ever played :D
5913	1	a	Amazingly well done game. Tons of game modes competitive and co-op with lots and lots of maps for hours of multiplayer fun. Still slightly buggy but I'm confident the developers will be working hard to fix everything. Buy this game!
5915	1	a	Dont believe the meta score for a second. While this game lacks modern texutre graphics, it hugely makes up for it with gameplay. With regular updates, new features, and devs who actually care what the players think, this game is awesome. even at that its a TON of fun.
5917	1	a	One of the games that comes with a ''Buy ME'' tag on. Easy to play and fun FPS.
5919	1	a	i wish i had this game 
5921	1	a	For $0.50 this is the best investment of 50 cents you could ever have. I would gladly pay 10.00 for this beauty of a game. Lots of replayabilitiy, good for wasting time with friends.  I love it.
5923	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs   175/10
5925	1	a	Worth the money! You can kill dinosaurs while flying with a jetpack and looking at the great rain effects!  10/10
5927	1	a	i like to shoot the dino and think that the gun is my wiener and i am peeing
5929	1	a	Game is bull shavick. I stood completely still and the T-Rex still saw me.
5931	1	a	I wasn't too interested in this game, but a friend bought a 4-pack for like $3. After playing the game, however, I can say this game is awesome. Its so much fun driving around yelling 'GTA MOTHA ♥♥♥♥AS' while mowing down dinos. Some of the guns feel good to shoot, there are plenty of perks and guns to buy, and some of the maps are HUGE!  Unfortunately, I do have a couple problems with this game. Although there are 3 classes in the game, but I feel it is really neccessary to play the assault, due to the fact that dinos will quicky overwhelm you unless you can jetpack out. Walking around is not really a thing you can do, especially while being attacked from LITERALLY all direction. Also, vehicles can be overpowered (you can disable them though), and some of the gamemodes (that I have played), while fun, seem a bit lacking (too short usually). Some of these probelms may disappear with a larger group though (I've only played with 4), so keep that in mind  Overall, this is a really fun game though. If you think killing dinosaurs or flying around with jetpacks while killing dinosaurs is something you would like to do, then I would reccomend this game, especially if its on sale.  7.5/10
5933	1	a	To be honest it's a crap game. But it was 99c!
5935	1	a	It's buggy - but for $0.99? Why not? The survival gamemode is definitely worth at least that. I have fun with it.
5937	1	a	1 dollars is nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!this game worth more
5939	1	a	as good as my last joint
5941	1	a	I want My money back
5943	1	a	This game is hilariously bad. The raptors will spawn right next to you and you can kill hordes of them with one clip. It's awkward to shoot because your gun doesn't recoil most of the time and for what ever reason the boss dinosaurs always attacked me. I can say the best part about this game was being grabed by the pteradons.
5945	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. Its only .49 cents, just buy it and have fun for a couple of hours.
5947	1	a	Good game easy to play with friends
5949	1	a	What the actual ♥♥♥♥
5951	1	a	Surprisingly fun game for next to nothing
5953	1	a	For the price, you get a lot more than you pay for, ignoring the awkward animations and weird looking players, a bug here and there, it's a quite fun game specially with friends.
5955	1	a	9/11 would bang
5957	1	a	So I watched like one episode of Sword Art Online 2 and if anyone knows me they know I like sniper rifles as much as I like swords, so I was reading this synopsis of one episode and I got really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that they imply the top sniper in an entire extremely competitive gun-based game was less skilled than some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that shows up with a sword, and then my friend tells me about how Kirito is using a sword in a gun game and how that was the class that was apparently treated as ♥♥♥♥ and awful and he's automatically the best at it.  So it made me think of this game because one time I jumped out of an aircraft with a lightsaber and took out a ♥♥♥♥ing t-rex in one hit with it.  *****. Best $1.00 I ever spent on a game.
5959	1	a	This is a game that if a bigger budget was available, it would be amazing! As it stands, it is good. Fun Co-op or Single Player. Great weapons, good dinosaur combat and plenty of ways to customise your map variables (dinosaur health/damage, timers, vehicles, oddly funny extra dinosaur waves). I've been playing since Orion: Dino Horde and I enjoyed that game too. Sure it has bugs and some issues and not amazing visuals compared with $40 Million dollar games, yet it is surprising replayable and trying to get even more XP the next game by using Melee is great! Punch a T-Rex in the head! There are not that many 'Survival' levels which is what I mainly play but still good solid fun. And won't cost much at all! Recommended!
5961	1	a	its not a complete or balanced game, but for a $1 it's fun as ♥♥♥♥ to play with friends. Also it has fire-breathing robot reindeer &amp; a robot santa claus in the santaslair map, how can you not give this a try.
5963	1	a	Got gangbanged by chickens, 10/10
5965	1	a	It's good.       ....For .99 cents.
5967	1	a	Great multiplayer, even though the game's engine isn't very good, its still pretty sweet for the $500+ pc.
5969	1	a	I love it. Sadly we have to have a kickstarter for the Open World versioin and Im broke &gt;.&gt;
5971	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, and you also enjoy slaughtering them, this is your game! 10/10 - IGN
5973	1	a	The game still needs work... like, a lot of work, but it's surprisingly fun, especially to play with friends!  Don't believe the Metacritic score. Buy a couple copies for you and your friends, and you're guaranteed some good times.  Just watch out for those baby dinosaurs. They'll bite your kneecaps off.
5975	1	a	I'm not sure why there is so much hate surrounding this game. It is not bad, and is deffinatly worth the 99 cents i payed. Flawed, but fun.
5977	1	a	Absolute bute game.Ever since the major update buying a 4 pack for $2.99 was a complete steal
5979	1	a	Kill a dinosaur  Kill a dinosaur with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends  Kill many dinosaurs with friends while fighting other teams Kill many dinosaurs without friends while fighting everyone in free for all Kill humans as dinosaurs Kill many humans as dinosaurs Kill humans while being a dinosaur who realizes his enemy is in the wrong time frame and who actually should be working together to find a way back to a safe dinosaurless environment rather than killing each other to have a bigger base  Careful for FaZe Rex BTW, he'll rek you with a rock like it's an illcam trickshot 8/10 for $1 7/10 if it was $10
5981	1	a	Fast, fun, and infinitely better with bros
5983	1	a	This game is not the best, not the worst, it may look like an unfinished game, but actually good enough for the price, the metascore is being unfair.  I did not played hardcore enough to make a perfect review, so go check other reviews.  This review is actually neutral, but steam doesn't have that option
5985	1	a	Thosands of Dino's, lot's of guns, good multiplayer, lots of gamemodes (One is almost an open-world kinda thing), 420/10 Fun Game, reccomend to all.    In a Doni-Shell: It's Worth Playing!! (If you have a good PC 'cause this game eats your CPU and Memory more then John Belluci and Cheese)
5987	1	a	This game is one of the most captivating and enjoyable co-op games I have ever played , and what's even better is that it only costs $0.99. I would say that if you have $0.99 to spare, this is the best way to spend it. 
5989	1	a	They should rename the game to 'Orion: Dino Hoe'  Because that's how i felt when i was playing the game.
5991	1	a	When I bought the game like 1 year ago it was really just a piece of buggy junk. I got it for 50 cents in discount so I was't really angry. Yesterday I was looking at my steam library and I found ORION: Prelude. I was kinda confused (the game was originaly named ORION: Dino Horde) so I downloaded it again and Holy ♥♥♥♥... They tweaked the game A LOT. It's still the same, same old weapons and vehicles, but it's polished. It really looks like the devs made a lot of improvement to the game. Some previously useless perks are now vital and guns are more responsive. Also, they added flying damage indicators, so you don't have to guess if you hit that one annoying pterodactyle or not. And the best thing is, IT'S FREAKING 79 CENTS!!! It will give you at least few hours of enjoyment and even if not, it's just 79 cents. 8/10
846	0	a	SERIOUSLY? YOU SAY THE BEST GAME EVER? THIS IS A ♥♥♥♥ING BULL ♥♥♥♥    if you want a REAL GAME of dino buy primal carnage but i don't name that a 'video game' this is a ♥♥♥♥ing bull ♥♥♥♥.
5993	1	a	If you seek a game full of fun and none stop dino hordes then this is your game, ORION: Dino Horde is a great dino survival, it has many gamemodes which are multiplayer and contains fun weapons and viechels. It is an easy game to get into and can be good for tornaments and other activities.
5995	1	a	This game is sweet
5997	1	a	its a great strategy game that you can battle dinosaurs! and beware in the map hell where you randomly fight the pumpkin king. hell map is best for assault as you can use jetpack to get on a cliff and take some potshots at the pumpkin king! good luck dino hunters!!!!
5999	1	a	A well spent £0.79 i must say, very good, recommend to everyone who like dino's or shooting so yeah
6001	1	a	Meh..Nothing special.A few servers,and not much people are playing it.The game is fun doe.
6003	1	a	I had to delete my old review, the game is very different now.  My review: it looks like a lot of fun, some good features, good all-round co-op survival game. Except that it has these floating damage numbers that appear every time you hit something and while you can toggle ALL of the HUD, you can't turn that ♥♥♥♥ off. So i won't be getting into it because that 1 flaw ruins the entire immersive value.   tl;dr if youre not an immersion gamer, but arcade or casual, you'll like it I think so I still recommend the game.
6005	1	a	This is so bad it's good trust me buy it it's amazing
6007	1	a	Funny game :) got alot of fun playing all those game mods, shooter based on the unreal engine. With 3 classes, each got his unique skills, different dinosaurs, variating from small Comps -&gt; Raptors -&gt; Triceratops -&gt; T-Rex's etc etc. even Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus Croc. U can play all these dinosaurs and even flying Pteranodons etc.   Nice survival mods, egg caputure etc etc. alot of different weapons add even more fun and tons of achievements. Get this game its worth it :) sometimes its even supercheap like i got 4x for just 3€ or so :)
6009	1	a	Easily one of the most fun co-op games you can play online with your friends. Ignore the meta rating score that must have been many patches ago the game seems to have improved massively. I would recommend this game to anyone. 8 out of 10 from me.
6011	1	a	This game has gone from one of the worst games to the most fun time waster on steam. This is proof that there is no such thing as a bad game, just developers who don't care.  10/10 best fun:cost game on steam
6013	1	a	This is a fun little team based shooter which involves you, the player, gunning down... well, dinosaurs. Hundreds of 'em, in droves. If you ever get tired of shooting at dinosaurs, then there's a whole host of different modes to choose from, including several styles of PvP. You can even turn the tables and play as a dinosaur yourself. The developers are very prompt about keeping this game up to date and adding new content, and have already released a huge update in the short time I've been playing it. Good work guys!  Pros: - Caters to a range of different playstyles. You can play in first and third person, solo or in a group. - Customisable characters provide a huge range of options. - A range of vehicles to choose from. Ever felt like blasting hordes of raptors with a tank? - Constantly updated with new maps, game modes and big fixes.  Cons: - Currently a little buggy, though mostly minor stuff like sounds not playing properly and dinosaurs getting stuck. - The music can be repetitive - While the game  can  be played alone, it's noticeably built with multiplayer in mind. Most game modes are considerably more fun with friends.  TL;DR: This game is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Why not give it a try?
6015	1	a	Well for a dollar its worth it
6017	1	a	Orion is a superhero in dc comics.
6019	1	a	It gets boring after playing for a while. Gameplay is too monotone. However it worths its price. If you have friends to play with, you can have a few hours of fun.
6021	1	a	For a 1.09, You need to own this game. The gameplay is addictive and fast paced, and Big ups to the Dev's for not giving up!
6023	1	a	Pretty sure this is the most fun I have had with a $1 game. Buy it.
6025	1	a	This game used to not be good at all. However the developers are amazing, listened to their fans, and turned this into one of the most fun games you can buy on steam right now. I've played this game for hours on end (on a different account if you're confused about my play time) and will continue to do so for a long time. Buy this game if for nothing else than to support developers who care about their player base
6027	1	a	Summary: This game is WELL worth the $0.99 it is selling for now. Gameplay is enjoyable, and the the overall graphics top it off.  8/10 Would knife a t-rex mid air again.  I bought this game for $0.99 when it went on sale as a game sold regularly at $12.99. This game by far was not worth $12.99. I didn't even consider it worth $4.99. The gameplay is nice, but very repetitive. Playing with friends is by far the most enjoyable way to play, but to fully play a match through, you have to play for a few hours non-stop. Point shoot point shoot point shoot.   The graphics make up for how little thinking is involved at times, and I'm not saying that you don't have to think strategy sometimes, just not most times. Out numbered yes, using your cloak to get past groups or larger dinosaurs is very enjoyable, but sitting at base sitting and spawn killing dinosaurs with a minigun, it gets boring.  Another problem with the game is how the pvp matches seem out of place. Not only do some of the maps have cartoon-like graphics, but the pvp system is so screwed up that it isn't enjoyable to play on those servers. All you see in those servers is people spam clicking with their sword until the other person dies or they die.  Overall the game I could have seen going for $2.99 and being well worth the money. Now that it is set at $1.00, I see it maybe getting more of a playerbase.
6029	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs, with futuristic weapons 8/10
6031	1	a	This game is amazing, tons of fun. fighting dino's with friends, and stabbing friends in the back with an t-rex egg in gungame. i really recomend you to buy it. a litle bit buggy but that doesn't really matter.
6033	1	a	Now Right Off The Bat This Game Is Realy Laggy And Bad Quality Do Not Waste Your Money...UNLESS You Want An Amazing Game That Is Amazingly Entertaining If You Can Look Around The Lag Bugs And Bad game Quality (Now I Know That Sounds Pretty Bad But Im Going To Finish What I was Saying Just Trust Me) Then You Get An Amazing Time With Your Friends So If You Can Do All That Get This Game...Its Worth 1 Dollar And Just Remember 'Games Cannot Fail Only Developers Can'
6035	1	a	For the price yes. Even though I didn't buy it... I did try it out and it was pretty fun. Bunch of kids, screaming: 'I'm going to eat your dinosaur ♥♥♥!' made me laugh...  Any way... Did you know, customize charaters requires you to pay real money? It makes me think of Destiny... DLC after DLC after DLC = $ It not a bad game. For a old computer. My gaming computer seeks for something else though. Thanks for the trial though.
6037	1	a	I paid $.99 for this game and look how many hours I have on record. Need I say more?
6039	1	a	better than what you pay for it
6041	1	a	Dion is a mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.
6043	1	a	worth your money 
6045	1	a	This offers a wide variety of dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus, Raptors, T-rex, Triceratops and many more for you to play as or against. Which is neato  Obviously you'll pick and play as the dino master race though, rather than dumb humans.  Overall dino scores: Includation in the game: 10/10 Looks: 7.5/10 Sounds: 3.8/10 Animations: 9/10
6047	1	a	I love the gameplay, but it's full of bugs, too bad there is only players servers, if there was a matchmaking this will be great
6049	1	a	Good game for such a cheap price.
6051	1	a	Flew some weird airplane into a T-Rex. Best $0.74 I've ever spent.
6053	1	a	This game was on a 93% off discount recently, going at 0.99 USD a piece. It's possible for me to fork out a single buck from my steam wallet after liquidating some of my items, so, why not?  The first thing you should know about this game is that, there is a reason why it's score is 36/100. Yes, this game is crudely made and, in most manner, buggy, but that does not mean that this gmae isn't fun. You will get to witness some seriously ridiculous conditions, such as rains or blizzards that which can pretty much blind you. There are also times where you can get your hands on some vehicles. Cherish them, as me and my friend managed to ram more than 100 enemies while driving an average looking hummer jeep (and it 'capsized' after my friend tried to ram a boss and failed).   I didn't play much to give a full account on how to stretch this game to its full potential, though I am certain this will be a great party game and its worth a laugh or two. Just one thing, don't get this game at full price.
6055	1	a	Your game is the single worst ♥♥♥♥en peice of trash i have ever seen in my entire life. ♥♥♥♥ looks at ypur game and says gee that looks ♥♥♥♥. I love it  8/8
6057	1	a	This game has the right plan, cheap games with good amount of stuff to do = good profit
6059	1	a	You can quickscope trexs and ride Choppers while running around with a lightsaber.  You get a game that's better than battlefront. All for 99 cents.
6061	1	a	This game seems to have a pretty bad reputation but after playing it for a few hours it is genuinely entertaining. It is not, however, a polished product by any means. It has plenty of flaws and at times feels like a conversion mod for another game. Overall it's definitely fun and worth $1 though.
6063	1	a	awesome game get it while the special last, you will be hooked trust me.
6065	1	a	Run into dinosaurs Kill dinosaurs Get credits Spend credits Kill more dinosaurs ... Get a fancy hat  Superb game, loving every round and match.  Only downside is that from all the different game modes they offer, I only ever see Survival and Conquest servers. Which is basically the same thing...
6067	1	a	gameplay - pretty solid, and a lot of fun with friends, and multiplayer. graphics - this game is not meant directly to graphic enthusiasts, but still looks pretty solid  lots of different modes to enjoy with many players.  cons. - many glitches and weird buggy gameplay which get frustrating. overall this game is pretty fun and i would give it a legit rating of 7.5/10
6069	1	a	A somewhat rickety dinosaur first person shooter, it makes for some very short periods of intense fun. It's definitely a game that you will want to play with friends, but have fun dealing with weird connection bugs. Overall, definitely worth $0.99.
6071	1	a	This game is awesome! That is the truth. There is a bit of jank to it though, but the developers appear to be actively updating it and ironing it out. What is already here is awesome. Like how Fall Out New Vegas was awesome, jank and all. The game is a blast to play. All games types have a real sense of progression to them and a rewarding upgrade/weapon/vehicle system to keep it changing as you go. The augmentations system alone gives you the ability to customize your game on every life or level if you want. This game is great. Get eaten buy a T Rex or the other one at least once. You gotta do it. 10 outta 10.
6073	1	a	Reminds me of Firefall ... but a little bit cheaper
849	0	a	I mean its kinda fun, but its just terribly made. Really badly done, choppy animations. The textures are muddy and bland, but some of the bigger dinos look good. You fight wave after wave the same way in the same area so it gets repetetive very fast. The weapons all handle like old school doom guns, along with the iffy hitboxes it just makes for a boring experience. After playing Primal Carnage(buy it), this game just doesnt have any appeal to me. I really couldnt recommend it, even for $1.
6075	1	a	Thsi gaem is fun if your a meme HA PRANKED!!! 4 heil hitlers outta 5 heil hitlers it was one helluva schnitzel
6077	1	a	You should to beat T-Rax its A freaking Hard and that's makes game Realistic   Don't forget you can use Joystick or Dualshock Controller its wroth it bro   And its best game you can play when you get boredddddddddd Enjoy!!!  
6079	1	a	It may not be a triple a title with insane graphics and intense story(it doesnt even have a story) but for pp cens, it is hands down the best game ever
6081	1	a	Where to begin with this game. Dinosaurs, guns, mechs and explosions. What is better than that absoluetly nothing.
6083	1	a	For a dollar its a must buy. I would suggest getting a copy for a friend as this game should is quite fun when you are playing with friends.   Pros ----------- -Lots of weapons -Vehicles -Dinos (what more can I say) ----------- Cons ----------- -Animations are derpy -Graphics are meh -Some maps are retextured and passed off for new one -Glitchy dinos (sometimes) ---------- This is your typical wave surival game. Kill enemies get credits spend them for weapons/upgrades. Die. For a dollar its worth the laughs  7/10
850	0	a	I was able to buy 1 game and my ma said she pay for the game... so I decided to buy a cheap ugly game... ITS THIS GAME!  The Framerate issues make it impossible to play,every one who plays it is a jerk,the weapons are terrible and take all day to kill a raptor, A RAPTOR!!!  All the 'LEVEL UP QUICK!' Levels too, DONT HELP! When I saw this game I was at first like,'Ohmagawd Dinosaur game' *sees price* 'oh its a bad game :( '  This My fellow gamers on steam is what we call... 'A waste of money' I-I-I just want my money back... Or My soul.
6085	1	a	metascore means nothing for this game. 36 my ♥♥♥. 8/10
6087	1	a	Bought it for $0.50, more fun than games I've paid $30+ for, this thing is simply amazing.
6089	1	a	This game + the Jurassic park movies prove that all dinosaurs are evil, even the good ones. Cheaper then a chocolate bar. Random crashes just add to the fun.  10/10 would throw grenades at dinosaurs again 
6091	1	a	Learned how to fly with a jetpack.. 11/10.
6093	1	a	it was a real fun game! i enjoyed playing it!!
6095	1	a	I wish I could pay more. It's that good.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It's great for solo play, but the coop aspect is really what makes it shine. The AI isn't top notch but watching a triceratops throw vehicles into the air around your campfire base in a lighting storm in the middle of the night while raptors go crazy down on the ground is just a feeling you can't duplicate. AND THIS GAME ISN'T EVEN ALL ABOUT DINOS! There's a ton of PvP maps and modes as well!  Just buy it and contribute to the dedicated developers who made the 'worst game ever made' into one of the greatest and probably least appreciated games of all time.
6097	1	a	Just buy it.You won't regret it!
6099	1	a	A game with derpy dinosaurs? HELL YEAH!
6101	1	a	Got a giant Mech to ride on top of a helicopter, 10/10.
6103	1	a	first it was bad but now my its 1 euro and its free for now its killing floor halo and tribes combinde do i recomend YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
851	0	a	its very expensive i dont think you should waste your money on this.
6105	1	a	It is a serious amont of fun, join a game fly around blow up a T rex with a rocket turrent run over little dinosaurs in a car. USE A TANK !!!
6107	1	a	Pretty decent game, fun to play with friends, defenetly worth the 1 dollar
6109	1	a	Defiently a way to say ♥♥♥♥ the ecosystem. Had fun making the dinosaurs go extinct.
6111	1	a	Way more fun than I thought it was going to be. Playing this with some friends is a total blast. I see myself playing this for a very long time and I won't regret a damn thing.
6113	1	a	I don't know why, but i can write a review for this game. I have 74 minutes of playtime, and have unlocked 14 acheivements. I have never played this game.  ?  
6115	1	a	Awesome game on replay value!
6117	1	a	Love this game i think the metascore is bulls***
6119	1	a	This sheit is tight yo. Play the role of extinction and laugh at god for doing so
6121	1	a	10/10 -IGN  'Like Skyrim with dinosaurs.'
6123	1	a	Great game for the price but don't expect more
6125	1	a	While the metascore may seem off-putting, it is COMPLETELY misleading. Great for a night with your buddies; fast gameplay interspersed with 60-second breathers, craploads of weapons, and multiple game modes to keep it fresh. The only problem is a slight lack of polish, but the game's wonderful mechanics shine through every time. In short: Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is fun!
6127	1	a	Stabbed a pterodactyl  10/10
6129	1	a	This game packs alot of punch for a game the costs almost nothing, this game is 79p thats less then a £1 and you get so much content and fun for this amount of money  with 15 or more game modes.  theres co op modes, player vs player and player vs player vs dinosaurs.  There are also lots of vehicals from jeeps to tanks to hover bike things to walking robots.  Whats not to love for that price for somthing that awsome right still not sold?   If you could also play as 10 diffrent dinos would that make you want it? well you can.   theres also a dynamic day night weather systme one minute you can be stolling to work at the kill all dino corp office and then it can rain and storm or blizzard if your in the artic any time day or night  the worlds your play in are wide and wonderfull with lots of places to go explore there are also loot chests to find.  so you have guns weapons and cars to drive what about a lightsaber? yes it has one to.  if you feel like flying ther ptreadactol will pick you up and drop you to your doom.  ok now lets talk about the other bits of the game graphicly its not gona win any awards but they are smooth and remind me of halo  where the graphics do shine is during its dynamic weather the freezing on your visor and the rain during the night look stunning :)  The controlls smooth easy bog standard fps controlls.  the xbox controllers work well :) just wish there was a sensativity option for it.  ok youv heard alot so far but for a small price its worth it.  so theres always servers going theres a nice comunity and its fun to play.  Another Pro is the game has devs that care its very rare :) here are some of my favriot moments so far  i Got picked up by petrdctol and droped to my doom wilst falling i managed to finish off a t-rex  i was driving around ran 100 little dinos over hit a tri cerotops and i flew across the map with all my buddys in the car and we drove off in perfect condition   so if you like what iv said so far then go get it if not look at the discription and see if theres anything iv missed about this game as it might sway your vote but hope you enjoy :) this game for the small price you pay you do get a lot of fun
6131	1	a	Fun game if lacking a little polish in some areas, the Metacritic score is years out of date from many patches, updates, and free DLC added onto the game. It's greatly improved since the initial reviews and is pretty fun. A very big update is coming later in 2014 that will improve the game even more. If you picked this up during the $1.00 sale, congrats on a great deal!  Graphics: 8.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 User Interface: 6/10 Replayability: 8/10 Innovation: 7/10  Overall: 7.7/10 Summary: Good game, great idea for a game. With some tweaks to the engine and a few more bug fixes Dino Horde will easily be an 8/10 game. 
6133	1	a	Okay - One of those blind buys, because it was cheap. DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! I have so much fun rolling around and blasting dinosaurs with my friends, I'd say that everyone should have this game - go buy a four pack and gift your friends and let the carnage begin! 10/10 would buy again.
852	0	a	Too expansive for 0,49 cents. Horrible, and isn't shiny. :&lt;
6135	1	a	I managed to survive one wave with my weak ♥♥♥ PC, and it was awesome. Bought the 3 dollar expansion whatever thing.
6137	1	a	this game.. oh man.. this game is AWESOME. it's a nice little pearl.  At first view it may look quite bad, but give it a try in the PROPER manner and this game is super-addictive. The infos you will need to get the fun out of this game are a bit 'hidden', because no tutorial is going to show you, so you have to guess yourself or learn from other players.  For example, exping is SLOW if you just play on servers. solution? make a 'surival\conquest' &gt; 'pre-historic' lobby (or solo room) and set the parameters to get up until 1400% (or maybe more) exp multiplier! you can literally lvl up from lvl 0 to 40 in 40 mins if you keep a ~1000% multiplier.  There are many, many other tricks and strategies to be succesful on this game, but they will require you to play for more than 2-3 matches and experiment a little. (for istance: EMP granades can activate vehicles shop even if you disabled vehicles in a conquest match!)  Furthermore there are many game modes aside from coop. Unfortunately the servers are a bit empty! But if you start some good lobby players will eventually join.  Again, this game is fast, relentless, furious.... and it also comes bug-free (at least no big bugs), has a solid co-operative mode, cool weapons, cool maps, it's not P2W (the store is only cosmetic).  Futhermore the devs seem to be in love with their child and they take care of it. I suggest this title especially to players who liked Unreal Tournament (1997) cause it's that kind of GOOD.
6139	1	a	Gets more updates then Day Z Standalone.
6141	1	a	This game might be one of the best value games on the Steam store. I would call it a mix of Halo and Counter-Strike with Dinosaurs. For the most part the vehicles are very cool. I like the aircraft and the mech in particular, though the jeep feels kind of clunky. There is a nice variety of maps to play and they are rendered very nicely. The guns are where it's really fun. I just can't get enough of the fully automatic shotgun. The big dinosaurs are tough to take down and it's rewarding when you do. I definitely enjoy this game a lot more than what I thought I would. And for a regular price of $1 you just can't go wrong with this, assuming you like shooters.
6143	1	a	This game is the funnest game i have ever played!
6145	1	a	bought a 4-pack for $0.99 and i've played alot more than i expected. it does need work but overall a fun game.
6147	1	a	I drove into a trex and killed it                                10/10
6149	1	a	brilliant game some graphical faults but one of the best games available in my opinion
6151	1	a	I don't really know how bad this was at launch, but right now? It's quite fun. It's essentially Killing Floor with a touch of Halo. Worth giving it a shot considering how deeply discounted it tends to be. Ignore the Metacritic score if you can, and ignore all the people who tease you for playing 'such a bad game' because ♥♥♥♥ them, you're a grown up who can make judgment calls for yourself and are capable of enjoying life without worrying what other people think.
6153	1	a	nice nut a bit Laggy :/ 
6155	1	a	It's kinda like Halo2 and the oiginal Turok decided to go out for drinks, ended up getting smashed and got hoard mode confused with ♥♥♥♥♥...ooops we got a baby!  It's not a hardcore fps, take it serious kinda game. For just messing about, having some fun shooting dinosaurs and flying away to safe ground with the jet pack (and who dosen't like shooting dinosaurs or jetpacks) its perfect. The gameplay is great (once you figure out what the hell you are ment to be doing....there is no tutorial), maps are pretty big, dinos are plentiful, graphics are ok too, guns are fun. For 59p you can't really go wrong! Although i now know what the guy in the toilet felt like with a T-Rex about to eat him in Jurassic Park!  8/10 Would get ♥♥♥♥ out by a T-rex Again!  
6157	1	a	Very fun game at a cheap price and is worth a dollar. It's pretty much Halo with dinosaurs instead of aliens. 7.5/10
6159	1	a	Despite being pretty unpolished and seems like it was made by a band of chimps; it's still very fun.
6161	1	a	Good FPS game in low price.
6163	1	a	why is this game so cheap??? It's game about surviving hordes of dinossaurs. Not that good, but not that bad either, let's say is so so.
6165	1	a	$0.49 USD thats all :D
6167	1	a	This game is tons of fun! Got it on sale , but having so much fun playing co-op / survival with my wife that it would be worth full price. Pretty easy game to learn with enought variety to make it fun , but not so much to make it overly complicated. Love the fact that I can set up a friends only game with bots. Makes it fun with just 2 of us playing. ( Or single player ). Bots actually work pretty good !! Will heal you as well as get in vehicles with you. Graphics are very good and gameplay runs prettty smooth. Really nice game to just jump in and blow the crap out of some dinosaurs! Good variety of vehilces , weapons , maps , and augmentations. I was'nt expecting much for a game that was so inexpesive , but was extremly surprised &amp; happy on how good this game turned out to be! One of the best values for the money I've gotten. Would definately reccomend this game !!
6169	1	a	This game proves why critic scores are pretty much useless for judging the value of a game. Play as dino or man, hunter or hunter. Eat or shoot your prey. Drive your friends off a cliff. Eat raptors for health.   Buy this and play it with your mates. Solo is fun but co-op is insanely fun.
6171	1	a	Uhhh, this is a bad game - and I love it. It's trashy, cheesy and a hell of fun.  Play it with friends, though.
6173	1	a	sick game you choose one of three classes and get different weapons and abilaties based on your class help your team or be a noob and steal all the kills do whatever you want just by it for you and your friends.
6175	1	a	I bought this game for pennies, way back when it was a pile of junk. I was amazed when I logged in a few months ago and it looked completely redone. Are there strange physics glitches? Occasionally? Are the dinosaurs a little stupid? Absolutely. However, the game is one where you can play the game because its core is good, and you are happy to see the game actually be good, perform well, and have a decent level of graphic fidelity. 7/10 in my book, a real recovery. Just look at the cost and ask yourself, why not? 
6177	1	a	OMG THIS GAME IS INSANE! I recommed this game to everyone! I like to kill dino's ;D But those small creatures are hard to spot -_-
6179	1	a	really love this game, my friend bought it for me and we always play it together, so much fun its really awesome. kudos to the developers
6181	1	a	New to the game? You'll love it. It never truly shines, but there is something delightful in equipping a flamethrower and baking crispy dino-treats. Or zooming around in Halo-esque vehicles causing general mayhem while you're being chased. This could be a very, very, very good game and at how cheap it is and it IS a good game. . . for a time.  Then there are the game modes that don't completely work. Game settings that never stick (I'm always having to change the visual settings even though I've saved them EVERY TIME.) A healing gun that sometimes won't heal (because the game doesn't properly show health bars.) Less than stellar UI. Boring and repetitive dinosaur mobs.   Maybe the reason why I recommend this game is because I can see what this game COULD be. At the core, it's a incredibly fun multiplayer game that is easy to pick up. Sadly, though, the game doesn't feel complete. Most people will put this down after a few hours and never pick it back up. . . which is a shame! Add some more customization, make more maps, fix the other game modes! There is really not a game quite like this out there - similar, yes, but not quite.   TL;DR: Buy this game. It's cheap and good for a few hours with friends. But don't keep it out of mind and let's see what the future can bring.
6183	1	a	So this is how the dinosaurs became extinct... 10/10, would force species into extinction again.
6185	1	a	wow..lots and lots of dinos especially on prehistoric difficulty...lots of fun and only 79p..AWESOME
6187	1	a	i dont even know where to begin 10/5 would not play again
6189	1	a	you know that moment when you pee after a long day of work and it feels so good and you're overwhelmed, that's just like this game except you're peeing out dinosaurs
6191	1	a	Thank god they changed it from a expensive grabage to a cheap masterpiece.
6193	1	a	Couldn't resist for less than a dollar. Downloaded. Logged on to server. Shot a tiny dinosaur in the face with my pistol. Picked up and carried into the atmosphere by a pterodactyl. Plummeted to my death. 10/10 would forget parachute again
6195	1	a	Its relly good and fun game but little laggy and buggy also pay2win i think   Ill givethis game 8/10 :P  Comon buy it its cost onley 1$
6197	1	a	A bit buggy game, but enjoyable none-the-less. Shooting down a Pteranadon? Heck yes!
6199	1	a	'Optimus Prime in the teens fights buggy dinosaurs.GOTY!' - Gamestop 'Like Halo with guns!' - IGN 'IT'S 1$!!! I LOVE STEAM!!!' - 12 yo boy
6201	1	a	Total of 30 min. 20 min searching/getting to a game.10 min of gameplay. Searching for a game was more fun. I somehow got this game for free.So im winning.
6203	1	a	Who doesn't love blowing up dino brains with their friends? 10/10 hands down one the best co-op games ever!
6205	1	a	Buy this game, it will make ur life better because you can think and say 'i'm not the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person in the world' becuase the creators are :P &lt;3
6207	1	a	10/10, bought the 4 pack last time it was on sale, gifted it to my friends, I now have no friends. Thanks Trek Industries!
6209	1	a	You get to play as a spartan, using lightsabers, to fight dinosaurs.  Need I say more?
6211	1	a	You may get what you pay for in terms of functionality but the game does seem to run ok with only minor issues, but I mean come on..dinosaurs..guns..JET PACKS what more do you want? lots of fun
6213	1	a	RAWWWRR pew pew pew RAWWWRR pew pew BANG! game summed up
6215	1	a	Fight for Egg-Based Dominance in a world of marines fighting for Egg-Based Dominance and Dinosaurs who conveniently are also fighting for Egg-Based Dominance.
6217	1	a	This game is good when playing in such as Lan party or something. A thumbs up game that every FPS player should have.
6219	1	a	&gt;Bought it during the steam christmas sale for %51 off. &gt;Lauched it up but never played a round &gt;Never even launched the game for about 5 months &gt;Finaly got back on the game and played 1 solo game &gt;Only got past wave 2 &gt;Didn't play the game for about another 3-4 months &gt;Got back on a couple days ago and played a hour or two &gt;Found out the game was pretty good, like halo but you kill dinosaurs instead.  10/10 would spend 49 cents and not play it for 5 months again
6221	1	a	Pretty much an epic game! =D
6223	1	a	This game is highly addicting. And packs a whole punch for such a cheap price.
6225	1	a	Best game ever! 10/10 Worth the money, got a dragon fly and flew it to mars.
6227	1	a	This game really isn't that bad anyway, so the fact that it is £0.79 ($0.99) is phenominal, there's litterally no reason for you and friends not to get this game, being as cheap as it is. Shooting dinosaurs is nice, the easter egg events are great and it really tests you and your friends when you first play.  After not long the game becomes rather easy and you gain more knowledge; make sure to turn the difficulty up.  And not to mention you can 720 blaze a T-Rex with a sniper rifle :D
6229	1	a	A truly fascinating commentary on Muslim life, told through the eyes of a young Japanese man stranded in Antarctica following the death of his family by mass seppuku. What it lacks in visuals it makes up for in its terrific fighting mechanics, which require the player to mash not only X, but left trigger as well.  11/10. A masterpiece
6231	1	a	IT THE ♥♥♥♥ING BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6233	1	a	BEST CO-OP SHOOTING GAME This game is Halo 4 and Star Wars combined.  Nice graphics, very fun to play with friends. However a bit buggy.
6235	1	a	Dinosaurs + Guns...what can go wrong?
6237	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with the starter pistol.  devs pls nerf starting pistol
6239	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a sword. The dinosaurs didn't have feathers. NOT SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL!
6241	1	a	£1 for a game thats like cod zombies in the halo universe (obiously with dinosaurs instead of zombies), brillent, shame about the wave limit.  10/10 ragdoll physics - rammed a triceratops witha tank, did a double backflip then exploded
6243	1	a	As i exspected turok+halo+killing floor equal a game that does need to be redone but is still fun to play anway so im not surprised i tried it its fun.
6245	1	a	This game is excellent, ignore that low meta score because it is so much fun to play, single-player or mulitplayer but is best with others, the graphics are good and the mechanics great. I have found no bugs so it is very smooth to play and easy to learn. It can get very heart-thumping at times and is very good fun for groups of friends
6247	1	a	Really cool type of game I have never seen before. A survival wave game... with dinosaurs.
6249	1	a	A good game and it plays very well for the size of the game
855	0	a	I 'played' this game for twenty minutes before I had enough.  Five minutes were spent in a solo game to test out graphics settings. Noticed the AI was pretty terrible, but I figured it was just easy because It was only the second wave. Anyways I didn't want to make any judgements about it until I tried out the multiplayer.   So I navigated through the buggy menu for fifteen minutes. I tried to join multiple different servers. I restarted the game several times trying to get it to work, and I could not join a single game. It's really frustrating to have to give a game a negative review because I legitimately could not access the multiplayer (Which is the only draw to the game in this case) Rather than on the merits of the gameplay itself.   I could have probably had a better time smoking cat hair out of the dollar I spent on the game.  Still better than Infestation Survivor stories.
6251	1	a	Air lifted a Deinosuchus with a spaceship. 5/5
6253	1	a	It might have been complete ♥♥♥♥ once, but after trying it, it isn't too bad for such a cheap game. Think Killing Floor, except really, really stupid and with giant enemies and vehicles. The hate for this game is a little bit ridiculous at this point, so I suggest getting it once it's on sale and just have some fun. With a more polished sequel with more content and variety it might actually be a great game... Hell, give me a sequel with climbing mechanics from Dragon's Dogma and we have a classic.
6255	1	a	To start off, let me say for only one dollar this is a must have game. I don't understand the hate in some of the reviews and in the metacritic score, as the game is very fun for just the survival and conquest gamemodes. In these modes you'll face waves unending dinosaurs, buying upgrades and guns along the way. And when you think you've got everything under control, prepare to face a T-rex, or maybe a tricerotops, either way it adds a great challenge you have to carefully approach. Lastly, mechs plus dinosaurs, what're you waiting for?
6257	1	a	The game is ♥♥♥♥
6259	1	a	sick game love the environments, game could change, when everyone dies on a specific wave, they just restart that wave and not a hol new game.
856	0	a	Multiplayer is absolutely broken and unusable
6261	1	a	its a piece of ♥♥♥♥ but i love it
6263	1	a	Saw this game for $1 so i bought it... 
6265	1	a	Orion: Prelude (Or Dino Horde, when I had this game) is a game where, you guessed it, kill dinosaurs. But it doesn't just stick to slaying gigantic creatures. You also get to pick from a hefty variety of gamemodes that change the pace of the game, sometimes entirely!  Would I recommend someone to play this game? It's $0.99. How can you NOT buy it?
6267	1	a	This game is quite good. I know that it got downvotet into oblivion by IGN and CO but this game is not quite good. Give it a try, you won't be dissaponted
857	0	a	HOLY CRAP! This game is amazing. There are no words to describe the fact 1$ and so amazing. And, it's on Unreal engine... so that results in stability.  I unfortunately at this moment, cannot recommend this due to the fact it currently doesn't have linux support. I'll be able to change this when it does.
6269	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing rad. you get to BE dinosaurs!!1 and then you get to KILL dinosaurs!!!1 how sick is that?! direct ripoff of halo by the way.
6271	1	a	Alright. A lot of things to say about this lovely game! It is so fun and awesome with co-op and friends! Playing this also works on really crappy laptops and desktops and you won't have overheating problems! Its kind of like a halo weapons with destiny costumes and the vehicles are too fun! Even playing with bots is crazy fun! $0.99 this dollar can be found on the floor. Hell people find 10 dollars on the floor! Get this now! Like seriously, bro! What you waiting for?
6273	1	a	bought the game for the cards....   Then I joined a game and had a ♥♥♥♥ing blast... This is what happens when unreal has wild S . E. X with jurassic park lol. the combat seems pretty smooth some bugs here and there but what do you expect from a 1 dollar game. Was shocked that the player base is pretty decent with full lobbys in game.   I rate this game a 7/10 best damn dollar i ever spent in my life
6275	1	a	Got this game as a gift, very fun game. 8/10
6277	1	a	Punched a T-Rex to death.  11/10 would punch again.
6279	1	a	for a 99 cent game i'm suprised at what i got a chance to shoot dinosaurs in the face with my best buddy's  but other then that really don't go expecting the meaning of life  so for just an awsome mulitiplayer-dino-killing game, its worth the 99 cent tag as an evening game to be played with friends
6281	1	a	It's like PlanetSide 2, with dinosaurs!
858	0	a	With so many back of the box mechanics, how on earth could I possibly not recommend this game? Dinosaurs! Jetpacks! Mechs! Character progression! What more could you want?  Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.  From my mere hour impression of the game (and it might come alive later, I wouldn't know) the game feels like an absolute mess. Sure, they've crammed a ton of stuff into here. But I couldn't make out a *game* anywhere. It's hard to explain, but I just couldn't get a sense of what I was supposed to do, let alone why. I couldn't get any traction in this game, I coulnd't make any sense of it. Shooting, movement, everything feels loose and just *meh*. so there weren't any moments that felt satisfying.  I can't even try to comment on visuals, ripped off mechanics, or anything like that. I was just too frickin bored to even bother with anything beyond these meager first impressions.   If you can get it on sale, you're sure to get your money's worth. But if you buying games to actually play them and not just for the sake of buying them, at least wait for another free weekend so you can try before you buy.
6283	1	a	First review so bear with me guys. ;_; So, I was gifted this from a friend and we decided to play together for a little while during one evening. Needless to say, I had a blast from the short amount of time that I played it. Once I have some more free time at a later date, I will definitely play this game again! I loved playing with other people in an attempt to wreck some dinosaurs and stuff... Aaaand to get wrecked by the dinosaurs themselves at times. Worth the buy for sure.
6285	1	a	 Worth much more than 1 Euro/Dollar
6287	1	a	Probably one of the best games i have ever played.
6289	1	a	I could say a lot about this game being pretty standard shooter - but I have had some much fun playing this game. Shooting dinosaurs - levelling up and jumping around the map - this game is silly, surreal but fun.
6291	1	a	Ay it's a good one.
6293	1	a	Never Ever Play Versus on this - no autobalance means that if you choose to be Dino there will be 10 marines aganst you - Just totally unfair  Cooperative Play works somehow will be hard to coordinate while in the dinos are attacking - ofcourse after the wave ends it will be slightly easier.  I would buy this while this is now on sale when this was written - until major fixes are made this is only Co-op Survival Game and not worth to pay full price  But always better than Space Empires V. Never buy that game... or even look at it.
6295	1	a	how much sorry?!!! 99p?!! Thats a great deal but the recent updates have made it worse than better. Sad times :( Still it's fun to play coop
6297	1	a	A good survival game featuring defending a base against a wave of dinosaurs, capturing outposts, using vehicles to explore, buy different guns and much more. There are many different game modes to play and many different maps, my favorites are the conquest ones.  The graphics are good and the game runs smooth. The Level system looks pretty cool where you edit your loadouts but I'm not sure on how it works yet so I can't really review that.  All you need to know is you can shoot dinosaurs in the face...  7/10
6299	1	a	14 hours and still not bord so..... ya i have also put 270+ hour in terraria another game i highly recamend
6301	1	a	this game awesome! after update for conquest mode and world map this game jump from garbage (3/10) to nearly perfect game (8-9/10) share the games with your friends and survive this primal world!
6303	1	a	Suprisingly hilarious with friends, good for the $1 I spent on it. Don't expect variation and uniqueness.
6305	1	a	Played it for 10 minutes and got AIDS. Thanks Orion: Prelude! :)
6307	1	a	Awesome game, 9/10 only thing i could suggest is more work towards controller work.
6309	1	a	Good indie Sci-Fi shooter! Kill all these Dinosaur hordes!
6311	1	a	Pretty sick
6313	1	a	do you want to see how it is in jurassic park with a Scifi twist then you would enjoy this game where you feel immersed with the first person view where your helmet visor freezes over from the snow or get's rain drops that blur your vision when its raining. I Recommend this game for the Co-Op modes it does have PvP modes but in my opinion they aren't as fun as working with your friends fending off dinos to protect your base.
6315	1	a	if u have a computer that cant run games very well do not buy lololoolololl laggy af
6317	1	a	Hilariously fun! Only played a couple times but It's definitely worth more than a dollar
6319	1	a	Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!  This is a First person shooter game.    Interface/Menu/Settings
6321	1	a	I avoided this game for months. When it became free to play, I got hooked. I don't think I can go back to CounterStrike after playing this. Too much fun with friends here. Not much to the game at all, and once you figure out how to counter, it gets extremely easy even on higher settings, but for some reason I'm hooked.
6323	1	a	On it's price, I expected it to be another bad game on cheap sale price.  But it was actually Killing Floor with dinos and futuristic guns.   Very decent game, especially on it's price. You can customize your character, your guns and even your enemy dinos! Also graphics are pretty good and in this game there is even nice looking rain. Game has fun multiplayer too.  Game is based on planet where future humans fight against dinos. I don't know plot as this game doesn't have single player campaign but it's doesn't need one. Gameplay is pretty simple. Shoot some dinos, upgrade your skills (these reset in every game but you can unlock weapons so you don't need to buy ones) and defend your base. Notice that in every dino wave there will be stronger dinos like T-Rex. Also you can have mechs and cars by unlocking objectives. Also if you're playing solo, you can just free roam and kill dinos that gets on your way. There are also classes but you're gonna find them out ingame, but myself I like Assault as I can have jetpack.  This game has also workshop and map editor which is awesome. Steam cards and VAC to protect players against cheaters are also good. Only negative is that game runs poorly on high settings and I can run Skyrim on max settings 60fps.  Every player who likes Killing Floor, Black Ops Zombies or even Left 4 Dead should get this game. Also people that like any sort of FPS games should also buy this! It's cheap and worth on it's original price. 8/10
6325	1	a	This does have a feel similar to halo. Haven't gotten very deep into it yet but it also reminds me of playing Turok back in the day! Seems like a great game to play with friends!
6327	1	a	This game is actually really good...
6329	1	a	For 1$-0.50 cent there's no reason not to get this game at all, I'd say this game is well worth 5-10$ at least, the pvp a very well done, the dino-survival is fantastic, and the community, despite small, is very fun to play with. Anyone that enjoys a good fps, whether it be pve or pvp should give this game a shot.
6331	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
6333	1	a	love it all the wasy but sometimes a little lame when you bye your self fun with other
6335	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.
6337	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
6339	1	a	I nominate this game for: I only had 50 cents left award, cause you know ......MOAR GAMES
6341	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing and the fact that they are letting you buy it for 99 cents right now is an unheard of deal in itself for a game that is this much fun. Definite must have and it's the only one type of game that you can kill waves of dinosaurs for hours on end.
6343	1	a	Do you want fun? This is funny. You can laugh with or at it. The game lack a story? Narrate a creative one while you play at a random server or with your friends. At first glance the game may look stupid, but even though a second look reveals the same opinion, this is still worth playing. I wish there to be more friendly and helpful players, so the community can grow lively and strong.  Edit: Do I like this game? Yes, I do. I do really enjoy playing it. Is this game bad? Yes, it ♥♥♥♥ing is. I laugh at the poorly opmized game with clunky gameplay. But I do wish it was good and well made, with more time dedicated to it. But the developer left it to rot and went on another project that is an even worst cluster♥♥♥♥. I wanted this game to be something I could give to my friends and enjoy with them. But it is buggy and most of the fun comes from laughing at the game and not with it.  I still recomend it though. Even more now that it is free to play. Hope one day it will be open source and the players will be able to directly contribute to good development of this great concept and visionary idea for a game.
6345	1	a	Very fun to play, never gets old.  The amount of effort the Devs have put into this game makes it worth way more than $1.
6347	1	a	It's a gud game, only $1 pretty cheap m8.  360 no scopin' dinos like no tomorrow.  9/10
6349	1	a	I got this for .99 and it is awesome. I've already put way too many hours into it.

6353	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
6355	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
6357	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
6359	1	a	This game is ridiculously fun!
6361	1	a	Addicting - Not sure if it is because of the different achievements - the fact that you get to shoot Dinos , the fact that you get to drive vehicles over dinosaurs.. or what ... but it is definately addicting.
6363	1	a	very fun and addictive game with quite a few game modes. fans of dinosaurs and a halo mixture will likely enjoy this
6365	1	a	You can be a futuristic guy or black guy or girl from the future and kill other guys/black guys/girls from the future or you can kill dinosaurs with your friends or alone. And you can wear hats. I got it for free and not gunna lie its pretty fun and entertaining if I've got time to pass (unlockables would be nice). I guess its worth it though. Buy it unless you're scared
6367	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
6369	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
6371	1	a	This game has come SUCH a long way. In fact, I don't remember the last time a bad game was patched into a good one.  First off, this game is not perfect. There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.
6373	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
6375	1	a	I reccomend this game simply on the basis that it has guns and dinosaurs without even getting into the fact that it has jetpacks, tanks and lightsabers
6377	1	a	This game is much ♥♥♥♥♥♥
6379	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
861	0	a	boring
6381	1	a	Ran over a pack of raptors in a Humvee. Later, while running away, got my head chewed off by a T-Rex.  10 of 10. Would play again.
6383	1	a	Fun, tough, and addicting. Going into the survival mode solo is plain suicide, but it's very fun just to see how far you can make it. The plethora of Steam Achievements is wonderful, and if you are big on trying to 100% games, then you will have your hands full with this, in a good way. At the end of the day, gaming should be a fun, enjoyable time, and that is exactly what this promises and delivers. Walrus Approved.
6385	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
6387	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
6389	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
6391	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥, this was 1 dollar? And Ride to Hell can be sold for 60?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

6395	1	a	Good Game But With One Major Problem.......The Lag Can Be Overwhelmingly Bad With A PC/Laptop Of Around i3, If The Curators Of The Game Could Fix It Then I Might Give It A 9/10
6397	1	a	Great game for the price, lots of fun!
6399	1	a	This game has more content than some milky milkers,but hei its fraking Hilarious and lovely,much better then some big blockbusters!
6401	1	a	Best played with friends for a stupid good time. I got mauled by a knee high ankle biter.
6403	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
6405	1	a	Fists are more effective than guns on dinosaurs, who knew? 11/10
6407	1	a	Okay, now you are sitting here looking at the trailer for the game and see its like a dollar USD... I got it on sale for .50 cents just because I like to collect random steam games. After seeing some of the cool mech and helicopters I decided to try this, mainly out of bordom... then it happend.... im flying around, blasting t-rexs in the face with machineguns and rockets and had to keeping, The only thing I really dont like is how the dinos look. Theother things such as the terran, buildings and mechs like unique awesome and theh multi player is not horrible!  Do it... spend a dollar and have fun!
6409	1	a	I seriously can't recomend this game enough. I don't know why I havn't written this review Earlier, I've had teh Game since day one and have watched it grow from it's pretty rough and shaky start into one of the most fun Lan party games I've ever played. Sure it's not the highest quality games but It's certainly one of the most fun esspecially with Friends.  I can't thank the Developers enough for all there hard work and sticking with their product until it became the game they always wanted it to be. Also Seriously the Game is only $1 now so if you havn't got it yet shame on you. It's the best value you'll ever get from one dollar. Can't Recomend enough. 
6411	1	a	The Godfather of video games
6413	1	a	Still learning the game but had a ton of fun with friends playing it and seeing all the features like the mechas and tanks. It's a pretty simple shoot and follow objectives kind of game that's fun in group. It's silly and has a good base but definitely room for improvement. No worries though since the developers have been working on constant fixes to bring it up standard.
6415	1	a	Shoot dinos in the face!
6417	1	a	Honestly, This game is actually kinda ok. People put down you pitchforks! Almost reminds me of killing floor in terms of gameplay (of course jetpacks now included) and a lot of fun can be had from this game, just not shinny sparkly graphics fun and can be repettitive at times. But seriously, this game is basicaly F2P now with its new price and the updates have seroiusly boosted my score of the game, For the price of a Yourkie at a corner shop, at least try this beacuse you kinda-maybe-hopefully wont regret it...maybe.
6419	1	a	This game is a awsome first person shooter with a great survival tatics. teamwork is one of the most importent thing in this game. Love it
6421	1	a	The game has a excellent premis, but is about as polished as decaying squirel poop. It is becomming a much better game with every update, and its eventually comming out of it's shell as 'One of the worst games polluting The Steam Library'.  Its pretty original, unlike exploitation games like Revelation 2012, and it has allot of 'good seeds' in it, waiting to 'bare fruits'.   All in all, with the price in mind, its definitly worth it. And for a few hours of cheap, guilty fun with the potential of becomming a good game with time, I'd recommend it.
6423	1	a	For how inexpensive this game is, and for how many free give-a-ways they've done with this game, you'd think it's absolutely terrible, but this game is actually one of the most fun multi-player games out there. Everything is cooperative, the gameplay is fun, the leveling system is okay, the people who play this aren't absolutely toxic, and the game in general isn't that difficult. Also I'm one of the highest level people in this game so I have major streed cred amongst the players on this game which automatically gives this game a 10/10.  8/8 m8 gr8 I r8.
6425	1	a	To be honest, i only played the free trial, (3-5 days) but i have to say, i am quite surprised how AWESOME this game was ;)
6427	1	a	One of THE BEST games I've ever played. You can fight each other, team up and survive or just plain muck around. Orion is DEFINETLY in my top favourites.
6429	1	a	Before the update of March 1st, this was a fairly average game with a few flaws. I found it fun to shoot dino hores with friends, and would find the whole experiene to be banterous. However with the update it has just revolutionsied the game and made it so much better. I would honestly recommend everyone with friends to buy it, (but if you dont then dont bother). 10/10, would recommend to a friend.
862	0	a	it is nothing like Jurassic Park
6431	1	a	I fap to this well spent 0,99$
6433	1	a	I personally really enjoy this game, especially with friends. The graphics are surprisingly good (though I had to turn them almost all the way down to get it to work on my laptop) and there's plenty of variety in weapons. Sometimes a bit repetitive, but over all I'd say it's a really good game. Definitely worth the $0.99.
6435	1	a	Shootin dinos with broselfs is dope.
6437	1	a	it is like Orion: Dino Beatdown only worth the price
6439	1	a	this game would be horrendous if it didnt have coop
6441	1	a	When i saw the meta score for this game i though it was bull dust. But this game has been so underestimated by the score beacuse of early scoring by meta. the Game is the MOST fun to have with freinds . Sure it has glitches But the graphics and the gameplay makeup for it all the way. The guns are all even when in pvp. this game is up there in my books for indie
6443	1	a	Very easy to pick up and put down. Fun with friends.
6445	1	a	This game is entertaining and fun. You get to shoot dinosaurs. It's not the most fluid game I've ever played, but it's well worth the money.  7/10.
6447	1	a	Bloody brilliant, great for the whole family
6449	1	a	It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs
6451	1	a	Very cool gameplay, rampage/dino vs humans is my personal favourite
6453	1	a	Fun Game watch out for those t-rex's!
6455	1	a	game is fun to play coop. Good for playing with friends.
6457	1	a	a t-rex ate me and i turned into a playmobil while my teammates were trying to run over a triceratops with a bike  game of the year every year
6459	1	a	Rather fun game when you play this game with friends plus it was only 1 dollar yeah.
6461	1	a	Got it cause it was only a dollar and im loving it! has replayability because you never know what might happen. Wouldn't say its worth $15 though. More like a $10 game but its still good and you should buy it while its 93% off! played a few hours and been having a blast with my neighbor!!!
6463	1	a	Dino Horde is the best horde
6465	1	a	I think this game was a smash hit a real 2/10 effort. whoever made this game did a great job with the following: putting dinosaurs in their game. i found myself on the edge of my seat as the T-rex's would throw boulders at me and charge at a break neck pace, and with a great storyline you cant go wrong. you will find after a solid playthrough along with the only other 1 person in the world that plays this game will enlighten you on how to fight dinosaurs with ridiculously strong weapns with zero recoil. i rate this game a 4 out of 5 out of 10. I hope to never play this game again within my lifetime. if someone held a gun to my head and told me to play this game, I'd choose death.
6467	1	a	Awesome for the .50 cents price tag alone!
6469	1	a	Personally, I think this game is one of the best co-op games I have seen..., even though the price is incredibly cheap.
6471	1	a	Great game for the money, but don't expect much more than shooting dinos with various weapons.
6473	1	a	So I had no idea about this game just that someone called it Killing Floor with Dinosaurs in past. Got surprised by it's low Meta score so went on YT to check review of Cynical Brit which was full of rage and hate. Followed by this I went ingame to actually try the game ready to experience utter garbage product but...  .. after understanding beginner's confusement (mechanics, level system, classes, perks and weapons) the game actually became a fun o.0  It IS Killing Floor with dinosaurs.. and vehicles (Woo). There is more modes (including one where you play as Dinosaurs against players) but the most common is Survival -&gt; 10 waves of defending, where every 3 waves you need to go to secure the outer outpost for better vehicles/choppers, healing/reviving team mates and repairing vehicles while being swarmed by tons of meat-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Simply if you have so low expectation of this game it can surprise you (hopefully) + only for 2,7 Euros.. bah.
6475	1	a	Spiral Games Studio’s newest game set in the Orion universe is Orion: Dino Horde. A supersession of Spirals previous game Orion: Dino Beatdown, Dino Horde expands the game mechanics and universe in every direction into something worthy of having James Cameron or Ridley Scott putting their names on. The cinematic visuals and lighting are some of the best I’ve ever seen in a game, and are something to be expected from a Spielberg film.   Check out my full review at     indieNewsNow.com   [indienewsnow.com] 
6477	1	a	By buying this game you spend money unnecessarily for Neak crap.  I would recommend this game to people who have a lot of friends, so that they can play (quite good) multiplayer, which  with a bunch of friends definitely enjoy.   Gameplay: 8/10  Graphic design 7/10   The price is a little overshoot.  servers are half-empty.  Even some bug is avoided.
6479	1	a	Got it on sale, afked was like lucky to get a WHOLE set of foil cards. PROFIT MADE  10/10
6481	1	a	trex scope acoos map 420\10 would rek dinosaurs again
6483	1	a	The metacritic score is misleading. Orion: Dino Horde is a wonderful game. Its like halo: combat evolved with dinosaurs and hats. If you buy the game now, it will update into the new game by Spiral that is coming out near the end of the year. And make sure to check out the kickstarter for The Orion Project  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project 
6485	1	a	cool game for $1 but, if you have a cheap computer/work laptop i would not buy this game. if you have an old computer with low amount of vram game will be semi unplayable
6487	1	a	A great game with dinos.  + Cheap + Many game modes + Nice graphics + Classes + Design style + Many maps + Weapons + You're able to play as a dinosaur.  -/ 
6489	1	a	I got this game when it was on sale for a couple of dollars, personally after playing it it would have probably been worth 3-5 times what I paid for it. I don't know why the rating score is so bad but this is a very fun game, not necessarily an enormious amount of depth, but still very fun and fairly memorable. Sometimes thats all that matters, so definetly if it goes on sale go ahead and try it, you may not LOVE it but who doesn't like killing dinosaurs :)
6491	1	a	Simple, Low Price, Dinos, BadG &amp; Laggy Menus.  IGN 11/10
6493	1	a	This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing best, Shooting dinosaurs whiel flying around. 50 cents? are you kidding me this is the deal of the century.
6495	1	a	Worst game? think again. This game is probably the best game I ever played: It is totally worth it for the price, it's a lot of fun with your friends and it has more gamemodes than any game out there (and good ones, like gungame, the usual survival and 1v1). The game is perfect, I mean, I played counter-strike for a long time and I thought it was like really good and the same happened to skyrim, but this one is different, in this game you are gonna have twice as much fun as you would on any coop game or even not coop games, you are gonna have way more fun in this game than in games like killing floor or portal (those games are pretty good as well tho). What I am saying is 'buy it, and buy it fast' cuz it's probably the best game you'll ever play in your entire life.
868	0	a	Eh you have to have a really good powerful PC to play this game and this game is terrible.
869	0	a	DO not play this game. It's not worth the bandwidth to download. Uninventive, ugly as hell, stiff, 99cents would still be a rip off
870	0	a	Here's all the 'strategy' in this game, fill a dino with bullets, buy a bigger gun, fill a dino with bigger bullets rinse and repeat.
871	0	a	Bought it for 93% off, one dollar, and was still disappointed.  At least the sound track is good. That's really the only compliment.  PS: They have a cash shop where they sell taunts and other stuff that is majorly unrefined, and is a blatant attempt at your money.
6497	1	a	I've paid a lot more for games not nearly this good. Halo plus dinos.
6499	1	a	got stuck into the body of a dinosaur  best experince of my life 10/10
882	0	a	For a game I have played for less than an hour, ORION: Dino Horde left a lasting expression on me. Not the kind of lasting expression that leaves a pleasent taste in your mouth, like tasting Auntie Anne's fresh home-brewed strawberry lemonade, more like the the type of expression that horribly scarrs you for the rest of your life.  I bought this game for a very steep price, like, dirt dirt cheap. I could have bought gum instead of this game, if that puts in perspective. This game, unlike gum, did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I'm pretty sure a piece of Trident layers would have lasted me longer than this game.  Upon launching, I was greeted with a nearly 780 FPS loading screen, which subsequently dropped to an FPS of about 20. I can run solitaire at a good 25 FPS, so this game had no excuse. When entering the very first game ever with one of my friends who I talked into buying this game, promising him we can shoot dinosaurs in the face until the early morning. He called me a nerd, and he was right. I was a nerd who was sucked into this game under promises of shooting dinosaurs and having fun.   My hopes were smashed, and upon dying to a lag-spiked Triceratops who appeared to be doing the thriller, I called the game 'bad.' My friend also agreed, telling me I sucked quite an exorbant amount of male genitalia for making him buy this game. Alas, he was true. I do suck.  Not as much as this game though.  
6501	1	a	Its a good game worth .99 cents i love how strange the guns look
6503	1	a	.99 cent i played it longer then i ate a mc chicken... its better then some games i've paid more for.
6505	1	a	Mant people say this isn't a good game but it actually is. Give it a try and see how cool is to fight those dinosaurs with friends :D
6507	1	a	Fun, dumb game dont take it too seriously :)
6509	1	a	You can run dinosaurs over with a tank 10/10 
6511	1	a	This game, after playing it for 8 hours, has shocked me. The gameplay was way over my expectations, as well as the graphics. The game has many different modes to play like rampage, a ctf like game, survival, and many others, making it an all around fun game to play. I mean ♥♥♥♥, it was $0.99
884	0	a	Back when this game was known as Dino Horde and cost $20 it was actually worth it however with the update to erase their metascore AGAIN they almost reverted back the wonderful interface they had from DH into the garbage beta interface that it is now, the gameplay is the same. Everything is pretty much the same except for the armors which now look even more horrible than how bad ♥♥♥ they looked before. Its a good thing its only a dollar, because thats about how much its worth as of now.
6513	1	a	This game gave my friend an existential crisis and made my eyes bleed. All for the low fee of 0.99€  10/10
6515	1	a	I play this game when my thirst for life goes dangerously high
6517	1	a	Never wrote a review this long about a game but the reason why i wrote this was because i was tired of the negative reviews so here is my story: Bought the game when it was 99c and can say its 110% worth it, dont listen to the metacritic score or even listen to the negative people posting about this game. MOST people say its too much like halo.. but really? just because this is a SC-FI FPS game doesnt mean its halo.. the Damn game has dinosaurs how can you even start to think its like halo. i might as well say this game is like the movie avatar because they both have SC-FI and Mechs in it..then i might as well ALSO say that this game is like the new game coming out called TitianFall just because their is jetpacks and mechs..  Think of this game off a crossbreed off halo+killingFloor+Turok Halo beacuse it has SC-FI aspect to it Killing floor because it has a survial aspect to the game ( such of waves of dinos after you with side missions ) Turok simply because the dinosuars  Anyway their is plenty of game modes in it, very fun COOP, and so far loving the conquest mode. has day/night cycle , large maps that keep you exited ( Open world ) Mutliple basses and can loot boxs for gear/money to buy new weapons. And if you are tired of pairing up with teammates you can pick from the PvP game modes thats just as fun and can have a good laugh from it. even has GUNGAME mode in it and to top it off, you can even play as a dino yourself  you can also customize your guy as well which is pretty fun, stand out from the other players.   Graphics wise is pretty good so far, don't expect a battlefiled 4 style graphics but for what your paying for your getting a top notch game that the devs are constantly updating. even though the Orginal game they made back in 2012 ( dino beatdown) had negative reviews and didn't go so well, the devs didnt give up and made a huge update on this game.   Also check out there new project they are also working on called ' The Orion Project ' will definitely take some time before their new game comes out but check out the link below and you will be amazed at the ideas they are aiming for  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/the-orion-project   Long story short, Dont judge this game and say its halo.. alot of games now days have zombie survial and having dinosaurs just makes this game different
6519	1	a	For others I guess it could be ok, more in F2P way. For me was a bad game overall. So I'll be never going back into playing this. But maybe you can check this and see how it suits you.  This seems to be the kind of game you need to try and see the results.  
6521	1	a	A game for 1€, and its still a fun a game, thats very rare. Its very fun if you have some m8's.
6523	1	a	Awesome game! one of the best in this genre!! just try it. 10/10
6525	1	a	This game is a great shooter that is tons of fun. A great game to play with friends and to play either PvP or rounds of horde against monsterous Dinos. The game can be a bit laggy and the animations are a little off but if you can put that aside it is a very addicting game and promises lots of fun. There are a decent number of weapons to equip and there are 3 classes you can choose from giving the player a nice variety when playing. Try out new guns and see how they destroy dinos as you try to survive.
6527	1	a	Funny. I liked it very much! :D
6529	1	a	Pure dumb fun. I mean, how often do you come across a game where you get to use lighsabers and flamethrowers and mechs against dinosaurs? It is certainly worth the dollar.
6531	1	a	this is a good game. great to play with friends
6533	1	a	Ten times better than Call of Duty. 11/10
6535	1	a	for 99 cents yeah.
6537	1	a	Glitch Simulator 2014 is an awesome game.  The overall experience is better than War Z. I give this game 9/10 because i couldnt find any dinosaurs! If the devs would add this, it would be Game of the year, all year.  Buy it, and give the devs extra monies via paypal!
6539	1	a	Would be flung by T Rex again and make love to on dark nights. 24/10
6541	1	a	An interesting mix of Dino's meets Killing Floor. Not a bad game but the lag is noticable, even as host which is annoying. Animations could be much smoother and enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Still though, for 1 dollar, it's a steal.
6543	1	a	It may be Glitchy as hell. Contain more bugs then any other games. Issues with just about everything but damn is this fun with a few friends!
6545	1	a	Now, I'm not going to say this game is great. It's pretty good. I enjoy playing it. But only the survival mode, usually on my own aswell. The rampage mode, where you play as the dinosaurs aswell, is buggy as hell. Humans are way too op. Can't wait for the Prequel, but right now, I'm not amazed. Still good game doh.
6547	1	a	If you have friends, you are going to love this game.  You will need a decent computer to avoid fps loss, however.
6549	1	a	I get it. You're looking at the Metacritic and going '36?!'  This is a SOLID game. It reminds me of Halo's horde mode. There's vehicles, jetpacks, perks, and giant dinos trying to eat you alive.  Many times, a game that is garbage is released and left to die. Not these guys. They kept working. After 2 years, they finally have the game that they promised.   http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ 
6551	1	a	This game is EXTREMELY underrated. It has improved so much since all the crappy reviews it got 2 years ago. This is probally one of the funest games I have ever played! This game is pretty much Halo and Jurrasic Park put into one fun Multiplayer funtime game. You get to kill Dinosaurs, blow up Dinosaurs, stab Dinosaurs and get Turrents to kill Dinosaurs.  Did I mention you get to kill Dinosaurs?  Get this game while it is $1.00.  You will not regret it.
6553	1	a	You wake up, drenched in sweat. 'That same dream again?' Asks your wife, you glance back and your wife is now an oviraptor. You scream and nothing but bullets come out of your gaping mouth, the words appear on your wall, written in blood. 'ORION: Dino Horde'. You scream the words '♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME' (5/5)
6555	1	a	i recommend this gamne especially at co op
6557	1	a	This game reinvented the genre of railroad building tycoons for me! It is such a fast paced, off the wall rail shooter that really shines when it comes to famliy building exercises. The game is centered around an unnamed protagonist who is giving birth during a dinosaur attack. Now if that sounds crazy this will really knock your caboose right off your sockle doos, you are black!!!1111!!11!1!!1   Only if you decide to heal people like a little buttpooplicking♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game is a great baby care taking simulator because it has everything that a little rhino would need in order to get a hexakill and get 123125 AP. This game is also a great addition to anyone's collection of games because it redefines the entire genre of tower defense!!! Without only 0 towers to place you have to be sure to place them in very strategical places in order to stop those pesky brazillians from breaking into the dunkin donuts across the street from you. All in all this is a fantastic game that all pregnant mothers should pick up instantly!      Also includes one free C-Section.
6559	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs
6561	1	a	This game is soooooo underrated its not even funny. I bought i for myself and three other friends and played it. I have to sa that i didn't expect to play it for 5 hours straight. Its amazingly fun and has many game modes. I was also impressed witht eh amount of detail the developers put into the game, the simple fact that you can play the newly added map and have to worry about your visor getting iced up is so funny and cool. The game is much better than the meta-score entails. If u read this before the free week is up try it out, and definately try out conquest. I would say more but i would be here for a while :D
6563	1	a	Don't trust in the Metascore rating, they're still upgrading the game. Best dino-killing game ever, give it a try!
6565	1	a	This game is comically bad. Kind of fun for short bouts of mindless shooting but it will never be the Halo it so desperately desires to be.
6567	1	a	Do you love COD zombies? Do you love to kill mobs of Dinosaurs? Do u love guns?  Then this game is great and very fun for you and friends.  Worth the price! Enjoy!
6569	1	a	It's aiight.
6571	1	a	Sold a duplicate Portal 2 trading card to get the money for this game. Went in, played, and was eaten by a t-rex.  11/10
6573	1	a	I was hiding on top of a cliff I accessed with my jetpack wielding a rapid firing grenade launcher since everyone knows dinosaurs only hurt when they bite. T-rex proceeds to pick up rock with his mouth, throw it, and instakill me.  10/10 would Michael Bay Jurassic Park again
6575	1	a	I've seen the steam key giveaway in the begining of the month... so I tried... Everytime I could not get one. Well the heck with that, I decided to buy the game some days ago (1 dollar is cheap) well... WELL... WELL.... MOST AWESOME GAME OF THE TIME. I mean FOR REAL! No micro transaction, no paying dlc, fun games, dinosaurs and kinda old school: all I searched for! A plus is the community ;) thanks for making this happen! I have faith in the future of video games again because people like you put passion and pleasure into your games and the players can enjoy it fully! :) Well be right back I have to eat some humans now
6577	1	a	This game is as terrible as its metacritic score, Steam should be ashamed for selling this junk...
6579	1	a	If you've got like 4 friends who really like either dinosaurs or shooting things this is going to be a blast for you. Easily 10 hours of gameplay.   And then theres people like me who like driving people around in awesome vehicles. I'm kinda wierd but this game scratches that itch too.   Just call me Mr. Transporter.
6581	1	a	Ever want to kill Dinosaurs?? but you never had the chance because they're dead? Well this is a game for you. All you do is just kill dinosaurs and run around doing small task and kill dinosaurs!  10/10
6583	1	a	You can powerlevel like mad  10/10 would grind again
6585	1	a	This game is truly a masterpiece if anything this deserves the top list i never found a game company who was willing to work on a game this long this people are comitted and are really nice the game is badass GET IT!
6587	1	a	Awsome game, very fast-paced and it can get overwelming at times, but once you get used to it you will enjoy it. now watch out for compies
6589	1	a	Now when I bought this game I thought it would just be a cheap dinosaur game, but I was wrong. This game is amazing, I recommend it to everybody who loves Halo because it kind of has that halo futeristic style feeling. Good Job guys at spiral!  Pros: 1. So many achievements (I'm an achievement junkie) 2. Gamemodes are great 3. Fun single player and multiplayer experience 4. Great gameplay 5. Great controls  And why did Metacritic hate this game so much?
6591	1	a	omg, this game is my game of 1994, the graphics are amzing, no bugs and a huge amount of servers to choose from with an active community.  10/10 would run on vista again.
6593	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥
6595	1	a	The support class has a bad ♥♥♥ black man voice. 10/10
6597	1	a	There are lightsabers.... 11/10
6599	1	a	its a kick in the ♥♥♥ cream and a Super Fat Dirty ♥♥♥♥ to the face
6601	1	a	WOW, this reminds me of unreal tournament and at the moment just 79 its incredible value, fight against dinosaurs or other human players, fantastic 
6603	1	a	This has to be one of my favourite games ever. yeah its a bit buggy so who cares. the graphics are not the greatest so what. the game is difficult who cares. You get to mow down the cast of jurassic park. i could make a whole list on why i would recommend this game but i don't really have to play the game and youll see why i think this is a great game
6605	1	a	the graphics look like Halo CE. Other than that great job :melon:
6607	1	a	If this game was an old dog, i'd have it put down. 10/10 will never play again.
6609	1	a	this game is everything i was looking for
6611	1	a	ARIZONA Vs. ORION: Prelude  I played this game for a total of 33 minutes, this includes the time I spent trying to find a server to play on. The game is worth $0.99 with no sale. Do you know what else is worth $0.99? A can of Arizona ice tea. I caculated the time I would spend to consume the beverage. ORION: Prelude gave me more time of enjoyment than an Arizona ice tea for the same price.   PLEASE READ: I didn't caculate the amount of enjoyment that one may find playing with the aluminum can after the liquid is consumed. Activities like squishing it aganist your head, stomping on it, cutting it open than poking your friends with the sharp edge and playing the game where you flick the can opener to see if you can flick it off. All these activities are equally, if not, more fun than ORION: Prelude, ORION: Dino Horde, Dino Beatdown etc.  
6613	1	a	This is one of the greatest steals on steam. For the money you would spend on a 2-liter you can have hours of dino-shooting-madness with 3 friends.
6615	1	a	Besty game 2010 cooldnt ask 4 betr game to b made, jk! This game peice of crap in bumhole! Cant even no scope nothin caus guns only pistols god damm jesuz plz! orio prelube is 0/100 even for 1 dollar is still squabbly to play. Cant even get startd to play be4 i die to DAMM RAPTORS OF DEATH! dc approved this game because of marvel iron man. plz ackowledg me cause i really good at leegue of leggings.
888	0	a	There is no learning curve or anything. When I started the game, I just got dropped in a menu, which let me connect to a game. I joined a game with the easy difficulty, and found myself dying very often in the 15 minutes I played. Furthermore, the game feels unnatural, and the graphics are weak for the system requirements. Furthermore, I experienced lots of lag when many dino's spawned.
6617	1	a	Cheap and awesome
6619	1	a	I saw the rating for the game was a 36/100, but that was a bit of a lie. This game is actually quite fun and challenging. I highly recommend this game if you liked Killing Floor or Sanctum. It's a bit of both games.
6621	1	a	We all bought this game as a joke because of the price and we had read the reviews of how terrible this game was. At one point, yes, this game was probably the worst game on Steam. Whatever the developers did in between then and now, it actually turned out to be quite fun. The graphics are actually pretty good (especially the weather effects), the controls feel solid, and it's fun to shoot dinosaurs.  There aren't are lot of classes (four) but the ones they have are unique and fill their roles admirably. The maps are huge and the vehicles are a blast to drive.  This game is 100% better if you have a small group of friends to play to log on with and just joke around killing dinos. For $0.99 everyone should probably own this game.
6623	1	a	i havent played it but from markipliers video on it i would have found it pretty enjoyable. my pc was too much crap to run it.
6625	1	a	this game is really fun, worth playing. totally worth it 
6627	1	a	This game isn't exactly one that has deep gameplay but well, shooting apart a bunch of dinosaurs with friends is just plain fun. If you grab it during a sale you'll probably get your money's worth.
6629	1	a	This game doesnt even work :) turn off!
6631	1	a	Good ol' dinosaur vs. human gameplay. It's similar to Dino D-Day or Primal Carnage.   You can play as a variety of dinosaurs in the Rampage gamemode, including a generic dromaeosaur, T. rex, Spinosaurus, and two pterosaurs. In any other mode, you'll play as one of three human classes; the Assault, Support, and the Recon.   It's fun to play with friends, but playing alone can be a challenge.
6633	1	a	'Just Do It' - Shia Labeouf
6635	1	a	Mmmmm i wouldnt say it's bad.. but i wouldnt call it that great either... servers need more workin on... other than that if u like hordes and hordes of crazed dinos chasin u then be my guest and get this game
6637	1	a	A bad clone of killing floor mixed with a bad clone of unreal tournament mixed with a bad clone of jedi academy. What's not to love?
6639	1	a	The metascore is ♥♥♥♥, this game rules.
6641	1	a	i love the game but every time i try to play multi player it frezes right as it loads the map
6643	1	a	awsome game
6645	1	a	The last few times I played this with friends I was eaten by a T-Rex 4 different times. A+ would play again.
6647	1	a	it's like halo but with dinosaurs 10/10
6649	1	a	One time I was killin a trex and then out came a mother flippin jet and I was like ahhhhh yeah.
6651	1	a	this game is underated but buy it on a sale
6653	1	a	Why did I buy it. ♥♥♥♥
891	0	a	Wonky Animations and Low Res Menus that will make your eyes bleed.  ****/10
892	0	a	This game is so confusing I have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on but there were dinosaurs. 0/10 game 10/10 dinosaur experience.
6655	1	a	I nominated it for the 'i'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.  I'll never see that 49 cents again :(
6657	1	a	Pretty much Halo with dinosaurs.
6659	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY ♥♥♥♥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA

6663	1	a	This game is easily the best game ive ever played, you get jet packs and advanced weaponry and the dino AI is easily the best i've ever seen/played/worshiped in all my years of gaming. Not only that but the super realistic rag doll physics will blow your mind and leave you on the edge of your seats when you kill a T-rex and watch in awe as it does double and even triple back flips and then proceeds to break dance on the spot. Truly the best experience one could hope to have killing dino's with advanced technology.   And at the low low price of 1$ (during the steam sale) you would be an absolute fool to not buy this game on the spot and giggle in glee as you and your friends shoot and destroy dinos with various vehicles and weapons.   Game of the year 2013/2014/2015.  Buy it now.  9001/9001  2 1337 4 M3

6671	1	a	Shoot dinos and hope for the best   9/11 i give
6673	1	a	A fun, Action, Adventure, and educational to how Dinosaur's hunting habits in a way. :3
6675	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends
6677	1	a	literally the best game of all time  ♥♥♥♥ dilos tho  11/10 buy now
6679	1	a	Since its $1 im going to ask myself this: Was this more enjoyable then something on the dollar menu at a fast food joint? Short answer Yes Long answer HELL YESSSSS brings me back to when i played turok as a kid 8/10
6681	1	a	great game.
6683	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!

899	0	a	Not even worth the dollar I paid for it. The dinosaurs always charge straight in on you. You have 60 seconds to run halfwya across them map to restock and back again which is unecessarily short. Most of the time I have no idea what's going on or why.
6689	1	a	You can kill T-Rex'es with a Lightsaber. You can also get eaten by them. 9,8/10
6691	1	a	Well worth it's price tag of $1. It has Dinos and guns! That's all you need. Dinos come at you in hordes/waves and you fight them off.
6693	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
6695	1	a	I love this game, better then tripple A titles such as AC Unity and Arkham Knight. 7/10.
6697	1	a	0/10 would not buy again
6699	1	a	A lot better than Dino Horde, absolutly love this from a open-world/dinomode/co-op perspective
6701	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
6703	1	a	Punched a dinosaur. 30-10
6705	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
906	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated ♥♥♥♥.
907	0	a	this game lags on my god computer, with glitchy dinos bad servers and weapons that feel as unsatifying and hard to aim as possible. the game mecanics arte repetive and often break. i went int this agem thinking this look reasonably good. NO dont even try. its all well and good adding more items and features they are good and its a good idea but they need to fix the gameplay and i dont think they would be able to address thewse issued as they would probibly have to rebuild the engine. F*** no never again.   as of 25th feb 2014 (i dont think it will improve)
6707	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
6709	1	a	Very few developers keep in mind what makes games fun but these folks are on the right track. Yeah, sure there are things needing improvement here and there but overall this game is F-U-N. It's old skool, it's ridiculous and cool at the same time. I've paid 60 bucks for games not even nearly as fun as this. My gaming buds and I find this title very pleasing to play and doesn't look half bad either :)
6711	1	a	This game is very entertaining. Even though the graphics are'nt the best and the controls take a while to get used to it is still a fun game.
6713	1	a	Great game so far!
6715	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
908	0	a	Junk.  Laggy, boring, ugly and (as should be obvious) very few people play.  This game has been out for 2 years, gotten several updates, and is still unbalanced and glitchy.  If you paid a buck for this, you got ripped off.  If someone gave you a copy for free, slap that person for having anything to do with this and get a real game.  Edit:  You know what? I'm not even done. I'm going to rant a bit more.  I gave this game extra time, hoping something, ANYTHING would get better. My time was wasted.  Most of the guns feel the same, aka single or burst fire, and very very weak. Depending on lag, a raptor may take up to 2 - 3 pistol clips to kill, and half to a full rifle clip to kill. The poison spitters, in addition to being able to hit you almost anywhere, shooting nonstop and leaving toxic puddles everywhere, seem to have maybe 25% to 50% of a boss dinos health (aka ridiculously hard to kill, especially early game, on easy, and considering how many spawn).  The average credits per dino is about 100, and the guns/upgrades start at about 1500 (for weak pistols) up to around 5000 for the better upgrades and guns.  And when you die? You lose it ALL.  There is a lives system that's actually more like the pickup system in Borderlands, but if you get locked in a corner where your team can't reach you and you can't get a kill (which happens quite a bit), all those extra lives basically mean nothing.  And while you do get some credits for damage done to a dino, it's going to be more like 20-30 credits if you have teammates helping.  There's not very much to say about the sound, as aside from the occasional roar, there is the non-stop, annoying TAPTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP of you putting dozens of rounds into a single dinosaur, over, and over and over.  Oh and hey, there's a leveling system, where you do get very very minor buffs in exchange for long hours of slow grinding. 10% damage boost for my super weak pistols? Yes please! Each class has levels of it's own with almost exactly identical skills as other classes, to give you that wonderful feeling of starting from scratch for trying different characters?? Woot!  Ok, Now I'm done.
6717	1	a	Probably one of the worst games I own. This is the most fun I have had in a LONG time.
909	0	a	What do you get when you cross rampaging dinosaurs with jetpacks,explosions,sci-fi action and co-op gameplay? An awesome videogame idea.What do you get when you play ORION: Dino Horde? A terrible,terrible experience. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played.Not only is it badly made,poorly executed,ridiculously framed, and badly coded.It's just unplayable game  Don’t bother.Save your money.If you want an engaging sci-fi cooperative experience,buy Natural Selection 2 instead !!! :)
6719	1	a	Simply Outstanding, the game co-produced by Peter Jackson really emits a sense of feeling and character to the player. The narrative is excellent, one in which all games should follow. The scenes have so much depth to them and when jimmie was molested by a pterodactyle i may of even shed a tear. The attachments that you grow with the players is like no other game i've ever experienced. The title of this game is extremly misleading, i thought it was going to be a wrestling game but i found out it was no other than a RSPCA animal saving simulator. The crew is incharge of rescueing the remaining dinosaurs of southern uzbekistan. One of the standout scenes of this game was when the raptor had recieved a splinter in his foot. You could see that the team were really doing their job, helping out with the local wildlife. Not only is this game compelling in both its narrative and its gameplay it also manages to be one of the must humour-filled experiences of my life. I couldnt help emitting into a cacophony of laughter clawing my eyes out in hysterics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncontrollably. There was even one stage when me and my friends where laughing so hard we liquified and proceeded to melt into a puddle together amongst feces, urine and blood. Samuel L Blackson also makes a cameo aswell as amanda todd, trying to join the crew. I still cant believe this was only 10 dollars, aswell as the extremly raving metascore it recieved. This is definataly my GOTY for 2012, and i have already logged over 2,300 hours. This game has shifted me as a person into a new form, and provided me with enjoyment of monumental levels. Im very grateful that the developers removed dino pubes in patch 3 or this game wouldnt be as enjoyable. With a trilogy in the makes and a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, aswell as its extraordinarily amazing soundtrack produced in studio by mozart and beethoven and snoop dogg (snoop lion). Aswell it is now sponsored by burger king, with their new Onion-Rings-In-Oil-Now item and Mountain dew's patented Dino Dew. This Is As Good As It Gets. 100/100
6721	1	a	Best Game for under £1 Great fun pure bants
6723	1	a	0.5 dollar play with 4 friends worth it.
6725	1	a	in this game u can shoot with guns so if u like shooting game u like this game but also not every one like shoot animals(dinosaur) so if u hate animal shoot u dont like this game :)
6727	1	a	If y0u like Killing Floor , then your g0nna love this game :)  Watch out for the T-rex   x
910	0	a	It's ORION: Dino Horde.
911	0	a	A shoddily made wave defense game.
6729	1	a	This game is really, really bad, but it's also pretty fun.
913	0	a	Terrible, 'nuff said
914	0	a	tHIS GAME IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!tHERE IS SO MUCH LAG AND IT IS LOW quality. 1/10
915	0	a	A game of the year contender for 1492. A great pile of dog ♥♥♥♥ is this game. I love the lag and how poorly optimized this is. I got for the price of free. My 'special' friend gave it to me. The multiplayer is just as great* i was a laggy T-Rex munching on wannabe Spartans from Halo. Of course the object of this game is to survive the world's laggiest envirments and cute Dino puppys. Overall this game is the aborted child of Jurassic Park and Halo. Its a gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8 jk i h8 this game and id rather masturb8 to german dungeon porn. A book of the year and a gr8 contender for the Grammys. In the end this game gets 0/0 would not rate again.   * Great=Bad Kids if you buy this game full price play russian roulete with a RPG. I am not liable for any injuries from activities i have suggested in this review.
916	0	a	I know why it's 99 cents. 'MICRO TRANSACTIONS'
917	0	a	The only thing that is cool about this game is that you get to shoot dinos otherwise it is like quake went stonage minus the fun.
918	0	a	i wanted to throw up
919	0	a	The budget for this game must have been $2 :(
6731	1	a	Is geym of shot dinosuar. Meny fun time to have. Can have roketlaunch an go boom on dino hed. HAHA! 10/10
6733	1	a	This game has some serious future. Only read new reviews, old ones are from the Beatdown period.  Ingame purchases aren't needed because you can get as much points just by playing.  Graphics are amazing, and if you put low-number-of-bugs besides, this is a hell of a game.  9/10, would recommend to everyone.
6735	1	a	Mad, Frantic, Buggy, AWESOME. This game has got it all. Punch a raptor in the face. Done. Get eaten by T-Rex. Done. Get carried away by a Pteradon. Done. A crazy game who's charm far outweighs it's buggy nature. Great fun to play survival. PVP is not the best but you be the judge. Check it out.
6737	1	a	Rode a T-Rex then got eaten - 9/10
6739	1	a	This game is like halo and dinosaurs combined into one! I would reccomend it to anyone even if your new to the game. 
6741	1	a	It has potential.  First Game - My ping was way too high, I couldn't communicate with my teammate, nor hit a computer controlled dinosaur. (I disconnected) Second Game - I hosted it myself, FPS was SO bad, said game in question isn't even close to being optimized for any gaming computer known to man. I lower all my settings which did nothing, so I decided I need to restart the game for this to take effect. (I disconnected) Third Game - I join another matchmaking game in progress, my FPS is fine with the graphics settings all at plebian tier levels, ping is fine, I have no clue what I am doing, the game is telling me to go from this point to that point. YELLING out commands. Host has left the server. (I am forced to disconnect) (I exit the game in disgust) 
6743	1	a	If you love Horde mode, and you love dinosaurs, get ready for the ride of nothingness, because this game is terrible.  EDIT: OK, it's currently a dollar. You can't NOT buy it for a dollar. You and 4 friends can get down for less than having 5 on it. You put FIIIIIVE on it. Dino Horde; get Steam Keys. You put FIIIIIIVE on it. Play it on that low end riiiig
6745	1	a	Nice game  good graphics
6747	1	a	I r8 8/8 m8 Totally worth my 50 cents
928	0	a	This game is literally not even a game. Like, what gives, dude. I played for thirty minutes and could not join a game and it would constantly crash. Then, I actually join in a 'game' and see nothing and I have to run 2500m to get to the 'playing' area. Then, there were dinosaurs and they
6749	1	a	This game fondled me greately. With such beautiful graphics and a compelling storyline how can you not have fun with it?  Definately worth the £1 i spent on it and I would go as far as to say I feel like I ripped off the creators! 10/9 what a steal indeed
6751	1	a	If you ever thought 'Man, I lreally ike Halo, but what it was really missing was some dinosaur action' and then they took away all the Covenant and Flood, all the story, and added nothing but dinosaurs that seem to want to eat power stations, and your job is to commit genocide on the dinosaurs....  Then this is the game for you! p.s. If you paid more than 99 cents for this game, then you paid too much
6753	1	a	To be completely honest this game really isn’t that bad, it has become a better game than it was before. The graphics are decent, the music is great and the gameplay is pretty smooth and fun. The game still is a bit buggy but it is worth a buy in my opinion. 7/10
929	0	a	save your money...bad optimization, poor framerates, super laggy even with good internet connection.
6755	1	a	One dollar and you will be addicted. This game is just so fun and simple to play. Team based fast paced shooter where you kill a bunch of dinosaurs. 11/10 a must have for everyone library for a simple dollar.
6757	1	a	Let's be honest - this game is seriously outdated. But you can still have some fun if you find any friends willing to join you, cause multiplayer is almost dead. I bought it for 13 russian roubles (which is $0.25 now) so it's the cheapest non-free-to-play game ever. Dirt cheap.
930	0	a	Wouldn't recommend it but can be a fun distraction. Depending on what you like you can find some enjoyment out of it.
6759	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.  Personal Rating: 2.5/5
6761	1	a	Doesn't seem to run very well with AMD graphics cards.
932	0	a	I wouldn't call this the worst game in the world, but it is definitly not a quality title. Before playing the game for free, I saw the trailer and instantly knew that the developers were giving their own game praise. The quotes about the game being good had no references. After playing the game, I can say that my theory was right. The human vs human games were poor man versions of halo and though the human vs dino parts are sorta fun with other people, there were three things that dragged this down; lag, crashes and extremely poor level design. It could be worth getting due to it being on sale for a dollar, but if you want to survive waves of enemies with friends, I suggest playing the man vs machine mode in tf2.
6763	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
6765	1	a	This game doesn't deserve as bad a meta-score as it has been given. I can honestly say, I was happy to purchase five copies. And everyone I know who took a chance and bought this game on a whim have all been excitedly surprised and have maybe even had as much fun as I have. The survival (which is all I can speak for) game-mode is really satisfying and definitely scratches that itch the original 'Zombies' console shooter infected me with. As far as I'm concerned, all the other game modes are just extra fun icing on a really yummy dino-blasted cake. If you were expecting Halo6Doom128 with the super epic plot twist bulletquicktime minigames...please resume playing the other shooters. But if you wanna try somethin' a little different and you enjoy shooter games that have 'vending machines' and waves of enemies to eliminate give Orion:Dino Horde a try, you'll probably really have fun with it if you give it a real chance.

6769	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
6771	1	a	I'm shooting giant crocodiles with tanks, buy it now it's on sale.
939	0	a	Well it turns out that my review of 'Don't buy this it's junk.' wasn't helpful. So here's a more in depth one.  ----  Don't buy this! Even at 0.79p it's to expensive! The net code is rubbish. The leveling system bad. The AI terrible. The guns, well, not to bad actually. It just feels unfinished and slow even on my over the top PC.  If you want to spend time on a computer game you can find much better ones out there.
6773	1	a	update for v3.0 This is my review of Orion Prelude I will not be comparing it to its past versions Orion Beatdown or Orion Dino horde, nor go into the devs back story. You want to know about THIS GAME not of its past. Orion Prelude is a first/third person shooter where its main game modes are to kill dinos to survive or to try and kill an opposite team.     There are a couple pvp modes but there aren't many people(you may find one or two servers) playing. The only pvp mode that gets love is Vital. This is a interesting Idea and is fun, but can have problems. Vital you have two teams of five each of you have a generator which you must protect from the dinos which only thing they do in life is kill you and your generator. As you kill you get credits you usually use them to upgrade yourself and get weapons but in Vital you can mess with your enemy's dino spawn. you can increase damage that dino deal, how many dinos spawn, and give them big dinos as a present and I feel its balance there. problems are with the players. It's doesn't have a balance system so instead it can be 4 old with 1 new vs 4 new and 1 old player its fun but you have to be careful . also this game mode will take you 1-3 hours(it may drag on) to beat and is really the greatest with a full team.    There are also three survival modes one named survival, conquest, and Slaughter. survival last around 40-50 mins in the most of the difficulties and your goal is to survival 10 rounds of dinos, how? by protecting your generator also you will have to go to outposts and capture them every 4ish rounds. You can buy weapons and upgrades in between rounds before the killing begins again.    Conquest is a copy and paste of survival but on a HUGE map, has 30 rounds, is 2-3 hours, and you can also buy jeeps, tanks, heles, and so on. It's fun but only use dedicated servers for if the host leaves then the game ends.    Slaughter is endless slaughter( I know what a surprise!) there are no rounds for you just keep getting hit by dinos you will be given guns and ammo over time and the longest I have survive is 20ish minutes and it's a good mode. in all, I play them at different times but each one is different and all are fun so I would suggest you try them all.   now that will give you a idea of the game itself I'm sure you have some other questions. (if I miss any please do not be afraid to ask for I will add it to the list, thank you.)  1. how does it run: it has always run well for me(60fps or higher) on ether of my pcs but I have heard that it runs better now than ever for some people who have had problems before.  2. sounds: Since 3.0 all weapon sounds have been redone/edited this has really made the games feel deadly. I have found one or two that I don't like but its an overall improvement.  3. graphics: Improved since 3.0, all maps look and feel better then they were and the new maps (2 which have been added in 3.0) are really well done.  4. how does it control?: good question, on mouse and keyboard like other good fps and controller  support is only for the 360pad, from what I hear its good there to.  5 modules: great don't have any problems with that. Although it's fun when the T-rex model flies in the air after killing it!  6. guns: you will see some guns that look semi normal but many are very cool and fun to just look at.   all in all its a great game. Its not a AAA title but you can sink some time in this. I would suggest this to poeple who loves first person and third person shooters. I feel you would have as much fun with yourself as you will online. also there is steam workshop to make maps so If you like making maps then you might want to get this to. (Note: workshop is stuck in beta mode until a bug can be fixed)  7. score: 9/10. v3.0 really has made this game shine its not prefect but its a great game.  p.s. If you have a question please ask.
940	0	a	Don't waste your time on this one.
941	0	a	the only fun thing to say about this game is to say how bad it is.
942	0	a	THIS is a paid game..? Even for 99 cents, ist a waste money...
943	0	a	4/10 It has its moments..Rarely
944	0	a	6/10
945	0	a	You are wasting money if you are going to buy this game for 0,99 cents,believe me it's not worth that money. The game is buggy and they are too many glitches,bad gameplay. Anyway it's ♥♥♥♥!
946	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
947	0	a	6/10

949	0	a	The best thing I can say about this is: 'it's a game.'
950	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
6775	1	a	Awsome game
6777	1	a	This game makes me think I'm retRded 11/10 but it's still kinda fun
6779	1	a	Emotionally charged, rampant with memorable imagery. Orion: Dino Horde is a philosophical adventure that only one with a liberal amount of experimental sexuality will properly enjoy. The rush of adrenaline is unparallelled to any carny ride or action film in current existence. Fun with friends and loved ones, not really recommended for young children or pregnant women.  In short: more fun than it has any right to be
6781	1	a	This game is the reason Ebola struck back. Let me explain:  Ebola was having a nice day on Steam playing a bit of DayZ. He went onto the store page and there it was, for the 7th time that month - Orion: Prelude was on sale for dirt again. Ebola wept for humanity as he clicked the 'purchase' button and supplied Gabe with a 79p donut.   Ebola joined a game with his friend Aids and started playing this badly ported Xbox original indie game. Ebola said '♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥' , went out of his mudhut and infected the West Africans.  The end.   INCASE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, THIS GAME SUCKS.
6783	1	a	this game is so cool i love it 
6785	1	a	This game gets a lot of bad reviews that are very true but what did they think the game was gunna be? its about Storm Troopers killing T-rex's and it cost way too much but if you by it on sale and want a fun lan party game its very good becuase of how bad it is like a lot of old movies. Artemis the space ship simulator game is a amazing lan game that i would recommend before this and is worth the large price tag but is as of now not avalible through steam. 
6787	1	a	The Customer base is relativly small, but this game has come leaps and bounds from when it was released. It is a satisfying experience upgradding your favorite class and taking down a T-Rex 1 on 1 or maybe even a spinosaurusl. So give it a chance and you wont be disappointed.
6789	1	a	It is fun :)
6791	1	a	When it first came out, it was totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now, they actually polished it real well and it is pretty fun. Great team game.
6793	1	a	Great dinosaur arena game eventhough the meta score is low i love playing it with friends. There are ten different types of dinosaurs and six different types of vehicles. You have to make it threw a few rounds and capture a couple outposts to win the game but all in all it is definantly worth the money it costs!
6795	1	a	Doesn't take itself seriously at all and doesn't really need to, either. Basic but fun.
6797	1	a	when i had this game for two day trail i was like AWESOME (when is this going to be another two day trail)
6799	1	a	Haven't played it, but it sure looks gewd
6801	1	a	This was such a mess after release xD But 3 years later and for a price of 1$ defenetly worth it. This is the best example to change a hughe mess into something decent and fun. See it as a Dino Survial shooter with vehicles and really nice maps. Grab it up for 0.49-1$ you cant do anything wrong for that price.
956	0	a	☆☆☆☆☆   Pure trash. That's why it went down in price to a mere .49 cents. But go ahead purchase it. Because some of you will think 'It can't be that bad is it?'.
6803	1	a	Bought it at 99 cents and it worth every penny and more! Haven't played it a lot yet but from what I did play it was already worth the 99 cents.
6805	1	a	someone said it better then cod ghost LOL for me this game cost 1$ i think it too low because quality of this game is good then cod ghost sorry for my eng and i hope you guy understand me :) 
957	0	a	It's Left for Dead with dinosaurs. Except you're protecting a thing, and it takes too long to get to the thing from the shops.
6807	1	a	I don't even own this game!
6809	1	a	Played this during the free weekend. Not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can grab a few friends it quickly becomes a very silly and entertaining game.
6811	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is an interesting, multi-player game. Although the concept of Dino Carnage With Friends has already come into play, Orion Dino Horde does it well, with science fiction laser weapons, the ability to play as a dinosaur, special objectives, and three special classes, all with a useful mechanic to help win a game. However, I found lag an issue on a computer like mine, 500 mb hard drive, 4 gb RAM, and lowest quality on the game, but i still had 20 fps. If you have a good computer, its a good game, but otherwise invest in something else. I still recommend it though. 7/10
960	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
961	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
6813	1	a	dont play this game
962	0	a	Don't buy it... you'll never play it
963	0	a	yeah if we could stop it with all the dinosaur games  that would be nice.
964	0	a	Piece of ♥♥♥♥
6815	1	a	Fly through the air with a jetpack cutting up T-Rexes with laser swords. 10/10
6817	1	a	the trexes are almost impossible to kill 
6819	1	a	better than sex
6821	1	a	Its amazing and awsome but pleas fix the lag and also add a allasaures. 
6823	1	a	Seriously, do not be fooled this game can provide hours of fun alone or with friends! The dinosaurs are bad ♥♥♥ and the gameplay is way better than you would expect. Buy it on sale though 15 bucks is a rip off. I got it for like 3 or 4 dollars.
6825	1	a	A must have Coop game to play with your fellow friend, family and your lovely girl friend. -Character customization and gender! -Hot graphic! -Ton of vehicle to drive and fly! -Large map to run around! -Time cycle and Weather systems! -Big dino! ETC  Cant believe this game cost me just 1$! Where are the donation button. 
966	0	a	Abortion of a game.
967	0	a	Why am I constantly strafing left?
6827	1	a	This game has improved a lot. Honestly, it's worth the $15. I have played it at a friends house quite a lot, and on my own PC here. I stopped playing when ti first came out, because to be honest, it sucked.  It doesn't suck now. It is suprisingly fun.   I think if you're on the fence because of the old reviews, you should go to youtube and find some newer gameplay, or ask some people here about the state it is currently in. I reccomend it.
968	0	a	There is a reason this game is 99 cents, because it's god damn awful.  The voice acting, the gunplay, the driving, the dino AI, and the PVP. Pvp is ♥♥♥♥, thats it, the voice acting is horrid, the gun play if you can call it that is like having a stroke seizure thing while in a whirl pool shooting a gun with a broken arm. Awful. Dino AI loves to run into rocks, and they can't understand that if your on the rock that means they can't get you.  Also, ♥♥♥♥ the god damn flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥ing awful trash. ♥♥♥♥ em.
6829	1	a	One of the best games i have ever played and i suggest getting it. 
6831	1	a	The best 79p you will ever spend, probably.
6833	1	a	Good Shooter game! Nice graphic!
6835	1	a	A first person arcade, survival style shooter versus dinosaurs :D It feels like Halo 1 with dinosaurs in it :)
6837	1	a	6/10
6839	1	a	This game is very underrated. It is definitly a lot of fun to play and I have yet to come across any of the bugs that it has been critisized for. It is deffinitly avery pretty game. Only issue I can think of are the dinosaur actions as they can get a little derpy. Still very fun.
6841	1	a	this game is great fun, shooting and being eaten by a dinosaur is amazing and for just a low price it is amazing.
6843	1	a	I think this game gets too much hate. It's an ok game.
6845	1	a	The game may have bad reviews, how after a few updates it has become a much better game, I say this from the free play weeks not from owning, but the game is still rather enjoyable.
6847	1	a	Just simply amazing!
6849	1	a	i love dinosaurs,when i was 5 i had a jurasic park themed bd party i had a shirt with Jurasic park logo,tons of plastic dinosaurs (i still have them) and a huge scaled jungle model now i have this sht and what can i say? just amazing,the ♥♥♥♥♥ t-rex ate me alive,tons of raptors and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one that spits venom,plus the small ones(i think they re Compsognathids) that come in hordes of 10 or 20,too small to shot and too fast! 30 minutes of pure action scenarios are big too you can roam around and shot around the jungle to get objetives ,the folliage helps you and them to hide(like in real life) and you feel like a prey special effects are cool and weapons are nice pistols are my fav cheap price,great game
6851	1	a	Kinda like Primal Carnage, but different. Really difficult with out a team, but add in some friends and its really fun.
6853	1	a	Such a fun thing to play with friends, definately reccomend giving it a try. I got addicted.
969	0	a	i wasted 0.99$ in that ....
970	0	a	Graphics are crap, but whatever it costs a buck, the community is terrible, but that's to be expected, and it kinda just plops you into a game with no tutorial, at least no tutorial that I could find, and if you have to search for the tutorial you're not doing your game right.
6855	1	a	Best game in the village
6857	1	a	1. Open map not open world 2. lots of cool weapons and upgrades 3. Great online play 4. Not alot of fun single player 5. Graphics pretty good.  This game is alot of fun online if your able to work as team. I find it most fun playing with just friends or family because team work is key its not like COD. This is NOT open world however. It is a small to medium sized map.  Guns+DInos= buy it
6859	1	a	The finest hour for FPS.
6861	1	a	great fun for your spare time
6863	1	a	F.U.N    Orion: Dino Horde is Halo &amp; tribes together with Dinosaurs   Its FUN GET it and join Dolla &amp; me in some dino killing!
6865	1	a	i recomanmend this game i played its beta thats why so i think its awsome i think u shoud try it thats all for now see ya :3 
6867	1	a	Just One Word...... AWESOME!!!
6869	1	a	I think this game is the best dinosaur game besides primal carnage 
6871	1	a	Greatest game ever you kill dinos and then you die the end. fantastic 10/10 nothing compares buy now
6873	1	a	I keep seeing reviews about steal this and theft that, who cares. 'In today's news, company sells stolen game for an entire dollar! 49 cents on sale!! What happened to this world???'  This is by far the most fun game i've ever played in this price range. A friend of mine bought it for our group of friends because it was so cheap, little did we know that it would be damn good fun.   Classes, plenty of weapons, vehicles, upgrades, lots of modes, and dinosaurs. Though i admit the graphics aren't top notch but honestly not bad, lighting and shadows aren't bad, the dinos look sorta low res but who cares. And glitches galore but thats all part of the fun if you ask me.   The only downside i can see is that probably not many people host lobbies, not sure for certain. And that all the visual upgrades for characters is handled through a slew of microtransactions, but this game is only a dollar. Atleast its not like Rockstar's wonderfully overrated and squeezed for every last penny with microtransactions GTA 5.   AAA studios take note! This is genuine fun for the whole family.
6875	1	a	IDK if it worth $15 but what I DO know is this. As someone who hates online games, I have found my first Online Gaming Addiction. Since picking this up for a buck during one of the sales; I can't stop playing this game. I fricken LOVE it! The best way to describe it is Turok: Dinosaur Hunter... if It had wave survival/horde mode. You blast wave after wave of dinos &amp; completing objectives with insane weapons weapons and vehicles while earning money for upgrade &amp; more weapons. I know the game use to be a buggy pile of **** and the devs pulled some shady ♥♥♥♥ on Metacritic early on by astroturfing its user score on Metacritic then relaunching it under a new name. That said, since then the Devs have worked their asses off fixing and improving the game and it shows. The devs may have ****ed up in the beginning but have since redeemed themselves IMO.
6877	1	a	Really enjoy this game, they've hit on a great formula; especially the co-op conquest maps. It's one of those games with a very simple concept done flawlessly. Graphics are great too, I have a fairly old graphics card and this runs nice and smooth at full res.  Vehicles are great, the ballistic tank weapon is great. It's fun. I really like how when you go up levels you have a decent starting weapon too.

6883	1	a	hey look this game is awesome man i really think this game is worth 15 dollars man
6885	1	a	orion dino horde is realy awesome and i am going to play again 
6887	1	a	L4D2 meets Borderlands... but with Dinosaurs. 10/10.  Also, Santa is a total Jackass in this game.
6889	1	a	PLease, get this game, its alot of fun you can even do pvp and they are planning a new title to be announced this month or coming one.
6891	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde doesn't look special at first glance. However, the gameplay is extremely fun and the developers CONSTANTLY add new content such as new game modes, new dinosaurs, new maps, and new weapons. Highly recommended.
6893	1	a	This game... i was extremely skeptical at first. But after playing it for a while, i'm in love. Definitely worth a shot. BUY IT!
984	0	a	wanna waste your money? Well, this game is for you!
985	0	a	I cannot put into words how painfully bad this game is.
986	0	a	Atleast refund the money for the people who spent money on your game before making it free. Kind of lucky i didnt buy more than 1 copy for the game.   If you didnt buy the game, go play it. It definately isnt bad, but the fact that the devs dont care that we spent money for nothing makes me not play the game now.  EDIT:  Although it has gone back to paid, Alot of people recieved the game for free, which still isnt fair
6895	1	a	Spawend and a Dinosaur immediatly bit my ♥♥♥♥ off. 25/24 would ♥♥♥♥ing have my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ torn off again.
6897	1	a	funny game to play with friends
6899	1	a	Its still after all this drama a good game!
991	0	a	It feels like I just dropped a 1€ coin on a rush sale. I open the game try out the solo and I notice how the dinossaurs movements looks like a plank with robotic legs. I still had some faith and tried joining a multiplayer game but all the servers I could find were either on the other end of the world with over 420 ping or were password protected. I mean, holly mother of dino jesus, even the T-Rex's struggle to move between wee litle dinossaurs.  Oh look, it also has hats, taunts and mutch more fun looking things, surely they are earned by skill. Nope just by money.    So remember kids, just because the trailer and pictures look fun it doesn't mean that is fun.
992	0	a	Feels like a PS2 game, very clunky and basic.  Devellopers are thiefs and fire their employees with no pay and steal 3D models and assets from other games.  Do not buy even for 1$ and do not buy their future ♥♥♥♥ products
993	0	a	Welcome to the dark side of indie games! Where games have little effort placed into them and we do our very damndest to make Minecraft's money because we can't make anything else but blocks!  'OMFG!!! Peetor! u fokn wot m8?! u oly hav 10 hrs in dis musterpeese!' hold your horses! I'm doing the internet a favor by reviewing this game! I'm surprised I played this for 2 days without drinking acid. Have I played 10 hours? yes, is it enough to review a game with a fair amount of game modes to choose from? no. But, this game is being sold off as a 'Unreal Tournament/Halo/Quake/Star wa-- wait wait wait! What?! Star wars? you mean to tell me a light saber knock off is enough to count this as a Star wars game? who rated this? 12 year old's? I'm sorry but the only thing that makes Orion related to those games are: regenerating health (Halo) and vehicles (Unreal Tournament) As for Quake, I'm not even sure what sticks out as being inspired by Quake...If you're talking about the rocket launcher...Sorry kiddies, but almost every shooter has a rocket launcher, so I guess Halo. Half-life. Unreal Tournament. Dues Ex. Doom. Battle Field. Star Wars: Battle Front, etc. Are   all   Quake clones.  This is a ADS game with   zombies   Dinosaurs and classic PvP. But that does not mean that this game is anything like what I have just listed! Do not f***ing confuse good games with this buggy indie mess!     the gameplay
994	0	a	So... The rewiew... Bought this game for 1 euro so i dident know what to expect. Now i know. This is the ♥♥♥♥♥iest game ive ever played. I dont think you can make a game any more bad. I put the graphics up to full and it still looked like ♥♥♥♥... When i got into my first game there were no other torturial than 'Use wasd to walk' And thats it... Nothing else was there and i just walked around without knowing what to do..  1/10 ....
995	0	a	This game is poop.
6901	1	a	Have you ever wanted to play a video game with state-of-the-art graphics, intuitive controls, and creative multiplayer modes? Neither have I, and the developers of ORION: Dino Horde seemed to understand just that. They have pandered to what is assuredly a golden niche market: true hardcore gamers. Because I am the type of person who can confidently identify 'skrubs' who 'get rekt' because they are indeed CASUALS, I can say without a doubt that this game is not for the faint of heart. To really understand Dino Horde, you've got to have the HARDCORE GAMER attitude. Just remember our mantra: 'Anyone who doesn't enjoy a video game that appeals to a select group of people for any reason- be it the challenge it presents or because THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERING OPINION- is a casual and therefore terribly pathetic.'  I think I speak for millions of elite gamers when I say that ORION: Dino Horde is the next Dark Souls before Dark Souls 2. Some folks just can't get into it because they find it too hard and give up in the early stages of this masterpiece. What these NAIVE FOOLS need to understand is Dino Horde is the type of game where you learn by experience. Once you get the hang of the game and start to understand it for what it really is, it presents you with new challenges that build on knowledge you have acquired by simply playing the game and not giving up. That is the beauty of ORION: Dino Horde.  The controls are FLAWLESS. Anyone who says otherwise clearly has no idea what they are talking about. The HUD and the gameplay do not at all feel like crummy ports of the Halo franchise with dinosaurs. Each gamemode is unique and has an entirely different feel from the last. Everything about Dino Horde is so fresh and invigorating, you will never want to play Call of Duty again, which as we all know is one of the most ever-changing game franchises in existence.  American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway once said: 'Sarcasm is difficult to detect on the internet,' and apparently so is honesty. What do dumb ol' books have to do with ORION: Dino Horde, you ask? You didn't hear it from me, but word around the office is this game is the best of its time, and will be for years to come.  I'll leave you with this final thought: Why buy ORION: Dino Horde? No, really, why?
999	0	a	free to play and didn't get anything for supporting the game, bought it for the original 15$ price tag, it was a complete waste of money
1000	0	a	How the heck did you mess up a game about Dinosaurs and Jet Packs?! Between the horrid control scheme, barren environments, and things don't even make sense, this game is horrid. Not worth a dollar.
1001	0	a	I played the 'game' for 30 minutes. I put game in quotes because i can hardly call this a game by definition. Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. 
6903	1	a	  well i played for the first time now after 1 year, and its a lot more buggy than before, it has a cheap price, but i find it frustrating and almost unplayable now.
6905	1	a	Okay so this game is pretty cheesy, let me warn you. But that's what happens when you have a Republic Commando-esque soldier firing a bow or wielding some kind of lightsaber against a T-Rex. Also, one of the reviews the devs chose to display on the trailer said 'Its not buggy anymore.' So it has that going for it.  Anyways, lots of fun, better with friends, graphics are a bit pitiful but not terrible generally. Except for the 'water.' Definately worth the 99 cents I paid for it, probably not worth the 15 it normally is. Also, you can explore dino innards.
1002	0	a	I played an entire game of this, A WHOLE 50 MINUTES. Word's cannot describe how bland and dull this game is if it was a sandwich it would be 1 slice of white bread, no butter, folded over a sliver of corned beef thats been opened and left in the fridge so it goes all dry and hard. Not enjoyable at all.
6907	1	a	still better than Halo 4
6909	1	a	Love this game, basically The most fun i have had playing a firstperson shooter against players that arent the same as you, 'dino VS Human' you really need to get this game :)
6911	1	a	This game...is just...Dinotastic, although it could get a bit repittive after a few rounds and I've expirecned some wall glitches I think if you like murdering things without 0 guilt, Orion is for you, I'm always willing to play, just send me a PM... Treyarch just got a run for there money. R.I.P. COD 7/10  -PROS- -Graphics are legit. -Gameplay is quite fun -VEHICLES+A FRICKEN MECH. -Weapons aare cool. -Rewards are rewarding.  -CONS-  -Involes real life money for extrap maps. -A bit glitchy -3 Classes gets a bit boring -No customization unless you spend real money -Playing it alone could be life dangering.
6913	1	a	I can't stop playing this game, and neither can my friends. The game can be described as, 'Did we just play for 3 hours straight instead of studying for our final?'  'YES' 
6915	1	a	This game is awesome! It's just $1, but this game is just a gift! Anyway it's cool! Buy it now!  EPIC GAME!
6917	1	a	I've had this game since 2012.   It sucked back then.  Now, it is flarking awesome.  This game only costs $1. That's one less breakfast buritto, and 20hrs. more of entertainment. This game is so much fun with friends, you get to llaugh and cry together as you puch and shoot hordes of raptors and T-rexes.
6919	1	a	For a game that you can buy for less than a dollar, this is the best you could ever hope for.  Yes there are some bugs and it doesn't exactly feel like a complete game, but shooting dinosaurs while flying on a jetpack just feels fun. I highly recommend this.
6921	1	a	this game is the best game i have seen in my life but realy the laser guns is not good
6923	1	a	The game cost $1 during the Steam Summer Sale and was the best $1 I spent. My brother and I had no clue what the game was about or how it worked. We jumped into a survival game and instantly enjoyed it. I expect that there will be many more hours spent on this game in the future.
6925	1	a	Left 4 Dinosaurs is a wonderful game
6927	1	a	very good game defiently worth your money
6929	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber while flying with a jetpack....Need i say more?
6931	1	a	5/10
6933	1	a	Chum is fum
6935	1	a	A Dino? Go Get my sniper rifle!
6937	1	a	!
6939	1	a	Fun to Play with friends
6941	1	a	This is the creation of the smartest minds of this generation working together to create the worst game in history.  10/10 I was mindblown. 
6943	1	a	Great game
6945	1	a	Very fun gushies
6947	1	a	Awesome game! Work together and kill some dinos.
6949	1	a	Lam as ♥♥♥♥, don't bother buying.
6951	1	a	Amazing Game nothing else to say  just amazing
1003	0	a	The graphics are pretty good, and there are some cool weather effects. I also like the voice acting. Other than that, it's not very good. All you do is activate a generator and defend it against dinosaurs. Why are the dinosaurs attacking the generator anyway? This game is basically a lesser Borderlands/Halo with a Jurassic setting. I did have some fun playing it with my friend, but I can't see myself going back to it.
6953	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes..... all the best parts of Halo, L4D, and Borderlands combined into one epic co-op multiplayer survival shooter. Hopelessly addicting, endlessly fun.
6955	1	a	Downloaded the game 4 days ago but only played it today. First match we were doing pretty well, holding off the dino's and progressing steadily. We then have to take an outpost. On our way there, my friend and I ran into a Triceratops in our 4x4. It rams us and we are sent flying across the map, we fly off the cliff and land on the side of the mountain, where we somehow remained alive. We manage to fall through the mountain and we are glitched into a cave. Our entire team rapidly failed and we were the only 2 left. Took us 10 minutes to discover we could teleport home, and when we did we lead the charge and emerged victorious. 5/10 opinion not yet fully developed...
6957	1	a	This game is much beteer than it's predecessor.I love it.
6959	1	a	If theres anyway to describe this game, it certainly is no Dinosaur on a technical level. With Hi-Tech Dino-Devonian physics,Cretaceolicious level design, an Jurrasictastic story, and Jaw dropping Weapon Array. There's certainly no going wrong with Orion: Dino Horde/Prelude especially for the outrageous asking price. 8/10
6961	1	a	Halo, with dinosaurs.
6963	1	a	Imagine if someone made a fantastic game that was a fusion of Jurassic Park, Halo, and Planetside 2.   This is not that game.  This will never be that game. This is ♥♥♥♥. That being said, it's very fun with friends.
6965	1	a	It's 99 cents. Buy it you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
1008	0	a	Trash.
6967	1	a	Vass: 'Have I ever told you the deffinion of insanity?'  Me: 'No, but I have played ORION Prelude so I think I know it'
6969	1	a	I bought this back when it was orion dino beat down, i bought four copies and i still have two,the game? its well worth your time if its free ,but the money I spent? Well worth it, I love this game honestly ,my computer has a hard time with it but my pc has a potato graphics card.   In conclusion,should you get it? yes,of course it always been good,even when dubbed 'worst game of ever' It was good,even the community is good so just play it already you ♥♥♥
1010	0	a	This would have been an awesome game in 1999, would have competed very well with Half-Life 1. But in today's gaming landscape, it is garbage.
1011	0	a	Not so good of a game, badly-optimized too. Developer stole assets from other companies, lie/threaten legal action to the community to protect themselves, and get away by removing those content when caught, excuses attached.
6971	1	a	Great game. Killed a TRex with a ♥♥♥♥in lightsaber. Then got ♥♥♥♥♥ by a Robot Santa that drops bombs disguised as Christmas presents. 7/10
6973	1	a	Great game to burn an hour or spend all day on when you need to! Has great graphics and concept. Cheap and easy to learn
6975	1	a	The only game where you can slap giant crocodiles to death. 100/10
6977	1	a	Jetpacks, Tanks, Helicopters, what do we need more?  ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game which you won't be able to stop playing this. First few hours will make you flustered since this game does not provide you any tutorials. Especially, fighting with big-sized dinosaurs when you are a newb will drive you crazy. However, after you finish learning how to play this game(It'll take no longer than 3 hours), then the real fun begins.  Teamwork is the key point of the game. Without it, you and your mates can die before you even hit the round 5. The great point of this game is, 'teamwork' and 'dino' can create a great action movie. You and your squads will face hundreds of dinos coming toward you. After your squad captures the checkpoint. Most of cases Hummer style vehicle equipped with a machine gun will be given to you. Then, somebody will drive while others take the shotgun, or grab the machine gun and feel like his playing Call of Duty.  Not only because my English sucks, but it's just hard to explain all the positive elements which this game will give to you.  9.5 / 10.0  P.S. It doesn't mean the actual graphic is bad, but screenshots uploaded on the steam store page is way better than the actual graphic.
6979	1	a	I've spent countless hours playing this game.
6981	1	a	its like call of duty if you replace the word call with dinosaur the word of with killing and duty with simulator. 10/10 IGN
6983	1	a	ALL CAPS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  GOD DAMN  LISTEN TO ME.    THIS IS THE BEST VALUE THAT YOU CAN GET ON STEAM.
6985	1	a	The sheer amount of content in ORION: Prelude is impressive. Not just all the equipment and weapons that you'd expect but also lightsabres, portable turrets, jetpacks, bows and arrows, not to mention the vehicles, from jeeps to tanks, planes and walkers, like the developers decided to make the game as purely fun as possible, and they succeeded in a big way.
6987	1	a	kind of simple still good
6989	1	a	this is the best game for such money ! some times big ping but still nice , so i can recomend it if you are bored or wanna kill some time!!!
6991	1	a	Knife OP! Dinosaur stabbing simulator!   IGN: 11/10 worth the price.
6993	1	a	8/10
6995	1	a	This game is so much fun, when you make fun of how bad it is with your friends.
6997	1	a	This Dino killing game is very fun to play, it is super cheap and the gameplay is satasfying.
6999	1	a	318 of 571 people (56%) found this review helpful 11  4 people found this review funny   Lightfall 219 products in account 6 reviews  Not Recommended 1.3 hrs on record Posted: 22 February, 2014 Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?   Yes    No    Funny 88 of 152 people (58%) found this review helpful 8  2 people found this review funny   Farlander 438 products in account 12 reviews  Not Recommended 13.9 hrs on record Posted: 17 July, 2014 ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be. READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

After reading all the negative comments about this game, I thought to myself; nah, it can't be THAT bad. So, stubborn as I am I decided to buy it anyway. Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much). Virtual garbage bin material. What a waste of time AND money. READ MORE  
7001	1	a	Shockingly Good. Must Buy 2014-2015.
7003	1	a	Lots of fun to play with friends but not many people play so the servers are kind of empty.  All in all though great game!
7005	1	a	Dis game? Best 0,99€ I've spent, EVER. That hooker I bought to give me a rimjob last week? Comes nothing near to the satisfaction I get from this game. This isn't what you would expect form a 0,99€ game.   10/10, would fly around on a helicopter with a MECH again.

7009	1	a	If this game was a dinosaur it would be a 'pretty-good-for-a-dollarsaurus.'
7011	1	a	Join game.  guy asks me, 'Are you having fun?'  'No.'  'well then have a nice life f*** boy!'  gets kicked.  10/10, would get kicked again.  
7013	1	a	'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous, survival-based cooperative gameplay and retro-inspired Arena Combat, 'ORION: Prelude' features massive, Open World Cooperative and PvPvE.
1019	0	a	The good part of this game is that i only waisted 50 cents 10/10 would buy again
7015	1	a	- Walked out of base - Chased by huge horde of dinosaurs - Watched teammate get taken by a Pterodactyl - Ran for cover - Found tank - Jumped in tank - Destroyed angry Stegosaurus with tank - Massacred dinosaurs for a 'MONSTER KILL' - Triceratops bashed tank to death - T-Rex ate another teammate - Died to horde  10/10 - Would die to play again!
7017	1	a	Better Than PRIMAL CARNAGE !!  Jst give it a shoot
7019	1	a	I paid for this and now it's free. Volvo and GaybeN, explain plz
1022	0	a	this game is complete ♥♥♥♥, and i think i may have received cancer from playing this game. Please do NOT ever develope another game to save the human race as we know it.
7021	1	a	yes it very GOOD........ i was spend 5 hour per day for level up it very good than old
7023	1	a	Let me start by saying when I first played Orion: Prelude (or whatever they were calling it) a year or so ago it was a terrible terrible game, and I really did not like it at all. Since then however Orion: Prelude has changed significantly with the updates it has gotten in the year or two since I first played it. It is at a state now were I can say that its no longer a 'bad game' per se just not one that I enjoy. By all means Orion: Prelude or whatever its called at the time you are reading this has gone from being a terrible empty mess to being a decent although somewhat mediocre Dino survival game. I still would not buy it myself, but for the price currently 0.99 cents I have got to say if you like the idea of a Dino survival game, this is worth looking into.    I myself still prefer Primal Carnage over Orion: prelude, and Dino D-Day is also another game I like significantly more than the Orion game. I even hear that game Stomping Land is pretty good, though I have yet to try that myself. All I have got to say in the end though is that you may like Orion: Prelude, it has come a long way since its (imo terrible) launch. Orion; Prelude may not be as good as the other games listed above (Primal Carnage, Dino D-Day, Stomping Land) but it is the cheapest, and that counts for something I guess. Orion: Prelude goes on sale all the time, so If you are interested I would get it during its next sale.
7025	1	a	One of the best dollars I ever spent on a video game. Take on waves of Dinosaurs in Survival modes, using a wide array of weapons, skills, vehicles and classes. Customize your character with hats, capes, Armour colors and more if you are willing to spend an extra couple bucks. If you a PVP player their is a wide variety of Deathmatch and objective modes as well although this game really shines in its survival mode in my opinion. Something adrenaline rushing about fighting against waves of Raptors, Pteradactyls, Stego, Rex's, Spinosaurs and a lot more.  Game Showcase-    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5-0QSalIis 
7027	1	a	This is a great game but I feel that the fight to survive feature is not good because you CANNOT kill a dino with a pistol.But still the game rocks :D
7029	1	a	Very good game and a lot of fun for not much money :) recommend for everyone that want to grind some prehistoric animals.
7031	1	a	Honestly for the price you will easily get your money's worth. This game isn't going to way you on graphics necessarily but it has so many game modes and enough jokes and craziness to make it worthwhile.
7033	1	a	ONLY FOR 0,49 eur, seriously WTF??!?!?44! Nice game brooooos!
7035	1	a	It was a fun game in its original form, had many flaws though. But after all of its failures it came back as an amazing game and is a great example of developers being able to turn a game around for the better!
7037	1	a	This game is very good, you have dinosaurs and ♥♥♥♥, very dramatic. I like, good weapons, strong and powerful. It is game for real men and fake women
7039	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points.
7041	1	a	  Karate chopped a T-Rex to death, roleplayed as Daisy Buchanan by running over a crowd of raptors, and then played as a dinosaur suicide bomber. 10/10
7043	1	a	  Dinos, explosives and robot suits. What's not to love!   [The good]:   - Pretty much everything is balanced. The guns, the creatures, the vehicles. Nothing is overpowered to the point of being gamebreaking.   - Map detail is really pretty. A bit like Rust on low-graphics or Firefall. And the texture models for the dinos are quite realistic.   - Literally just about every weapon and vehicle you could imagine. Sniper rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, smgs of all sizes, heavy MG's, bows, melee weapons, mech suits, tanks, ATV's, assault aircraft. If you can imagine it, this game has it.   - Everything is nicely porportioned. Distances between objectives and timings between waves of dinos are quite fair but not tedious.   - The weather. Probably my favorite thing about the game. Realistic rain is almost impossible to find. The drops actually fog up your visor and add a small but amazing touch.   [The not-so-good]  - Animations. Though the artworks is pretty and all, its not uncommon to see both dino and human models with their limbs contorted at unnatural angles.   - Clipping. Suffice to say, its possible to get stuck inside a dino or a rock.   - Optimization/latency. Random ping spikes ^300+ from a ~80 avg. Random fps drops to &lt;20 previously running at ~50 avg. If you die while inside a creature, after respawning your weapons will sometimes not fire.   - Map design. Looks aren't everything. In terms of playability the 4 maps I played on had fairly dull gameplay. Mostly flat/hill terrain. Little to no high ground for snipers. Too narrow of an area for vehicles to do work, yet too wide for explosives to be effective.  - Hitreg. Even perfectly placed shots will not do damage and shots that really shouldn't hit, do.   - Economy. While the weapons themselves are balanced, the prices really arent. On medium servers, there are ~13 waves of dinos. Assuming you kill 50% of the wave, you're going to spend more than half of the game grinding up to buying some semi-decent weapon other than a starting pistol. (protip, always go for the c9 revolver if you cant afford a good rifle. its a 2 tap headshot and deadly accurate for a reasonable price)   - Drops/loot. Mainly the fact there is none. It'd be nice to have the occasional airdrop of ammo packs or something. Having to rebuy ammo every round is really tedious.   All in all, its a really fun game and worth the price. The devs could do a few things too improve it but as it stands it's totally worth the price.   Full disclosure, I did get the game for free.
1029	0	a	Dont buy this. Even for just a doller it is not close to anything near ready to play. Just a warning to people new to steam, if a game is on sale for a ton of and it is not a store wide sale it is not doing good. The driving is made on a 16 sided shape. wich means that you cant just turn right you make wide turns that feel like the game is laging. But no its is just a crap game. The store looked like a thing a young kid made on ms paint, The textures are blurred and ugly. The gun play dosn't work because the engine cant keep up and just feels slow. DONT BUY
1030	0	a	this game was better a year ago when it was alpha and barely ran. this is now terribad and in the span of an hour it crashed on me three times, i couldnt host a multiplayer game for anybody, let alone friends, and microtransactions. id rather watch The Kardashians than play this steaming dino poo pile
7045	1	a	very very fun game 
1031	0	a	worst game in history
7047	1	a	Best. Full with actions. Recommended.
7049	1	a	I've recieved shots that where more fun than this game
1032	0	a	The optimisation of this game is horrible. The game itself is very repeditive, some of you may disagree but I guess the $1 it is currently on sale for is the chance for you to try it yourself. Might just be another number to add to your account. I'm not telling you not to buy it but it still may tickle your fancy. It's just not my kind of game.
7051	1	a	Body turned cold.
1033	0	a	I got this game for a dollar and i'm not sure it was worth it. The premise seems fun, but the lack of people playing it makes it pointless to play.
1034	0	a	Unfortunately I was not able to play this game; when it would get to class selection, it would lock up. I couldn't even ALT-TAB out of it, as it was holding the rest of the computer hostage.  It isn't as though I don't have a beefy machine though:  Intel Core i3 CPU with 4 processors nVidia GeForce GTX560 OC video card 8 GB of RAM (unfortunately, 32 bit Windows 7, so 3.45 GB available)  I may try this again later, but not interested right now.
1035	0	a	I'll give you 10€ if you delete the game from my library!!!
1036	0	a	Very basic shooter, I got... Well 0.3 hrs in according to the game timer. And the game client crashed. And I've seen more than enough. This is another game I suppose could be fun in a lan party or something like that... but it might be worth the 99 cents they're asking for it while it's on sale this week... If you're bored....
1037	0	a	Buy? No.  And that suggestion is after all the praise quotes from the current trailer about the game being improved and deserving a second chance.  Dino Horde is a sequel/successor to Orion: Dino Beatdown with was universally terrible. It is a first person horde shooter much like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, a between round weapon and augment store, and vehicle mechanics from a poor man's Halo. I felt a little disgusted after shooting my first weapon, which had a tinny sound effect and no recoil. Oddly enough, the recoil does come up sometimes. The guns just have this weak and unfinished feel. Dino waves are sent to you at lightning speed and most half-decent teams can wipe them out pretty quickly as they are sent in a couple packs that's easy to spray and pray at. When you're new, you might miss the opportunity to kill enemies or at least get a hit on them so you can get some assist credit. What makes the waves system even more terrible is the pacing. While you do have a variety of enemies, with some being faster than others, fighting them still often ends up being mass killing the Raptor-types, then finishing off the stragglers of larger, bullet sponge dino's and 'godd**ned bats' trope pterodactyls. Killing Floor has a better variety and pacing of enemies, as the speed of different mobs are more noticible and require proper prioritizing and handling by your group depending on the map you're playing.  Ammo is all handled by an ammo pack at the weapon store, so better hope you killed/assisted enough dinos and be able to make it back to the stores far away in the base after the game told you to go to the other side of the map for an outpost. I can accept the texture, model and animation quality for a cheap indie title. I think the texture quality is pretty good in comparison to Killing floor, and the animation is perhaps finicky in some cases, but the dinosaurs generally look life-like. Sound assets are pretty terrible as guns sound weak, majority of the voice acting sounds ham-fisted and terrible, save for maybe the announcer and the female scout, and the same one or two tracks repeat through the entirety of the game - menus, gameplay and all. Vehicles are extra handy in later waves, but can be a pain to drive, and lead to you demise if you get stuck and a Triceratops rams the ride, making it explode. The land hovercraft kept wobbling on the ground and I had annoyances managing the tank. Regardless, the game ended up feeling shallow very quickly - the fun factor wasn't there and I didn't see any reason to stay and level up.  I think the vast majority of the player base are probably younger types who got this on sale/as a gift and may not have much else to play. I'd hate to have played this before all the 'improvements'. There are plenty of better alternatives like Warframe, Payday series, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effecct 3, even Call of Duty Co-ops and Transformers Cybertron co-ops.  That being said, this game seem to have carved it's own niche, as there were a decent amount of active servers to join (like 20 or more), though that could be due to the recent .99 sale. That's probably telling alot about the quality and value of the game if it is going for 93% off when it's not a big Steam seasonal sale. I think kids and teens with more time and less money are willing to deal with this game (in fact, I probably would have been ok with it in my childhood), but adults like myself and most people on my friends list only have limited time and shouldn't waste it on this when there are better alternatives.  Don't buy it.The premise of Dino Horde FPS sounds cool, but you can get a similar and more entertaining as well as solid experience from Killing Floor. Once I got my opinion of the game, I only stayed longer to get my card drops....which I probably shouldn't have because they're pretty worthless.
1038	0	a	Seriously, take the 99p you'd spend on this game during the sale and buy one of those saver menu Cheeseburgers from McDonald's. It would be more beneficial to your health than this.
1039	0	a	This sucks dino balls! Literally!! But it was only 99 cents.
1040	0	a	This game is a bit like Halo meets Turok. My problem with this game is that the trailers, like most games, don't really do it justice. The trailer looks pretty awesome but it misrepresents the movements of the dinosaurs and the players. It is much more choppy. I would recommend personalizing the controls as well. One big thing that would make this a bit better are things like, headshots [either instant kill or massive damage]. I don't know how many times I drilled into a raptor's face and it was still chewing on my gun... Very frustrating. It has potential but it is not there yet, in my opinion.
1041	0	a	While .99cents, I would not buy this game until it is functional at least. No audio normalization, no customization without actual money, survival mode is a gimmic and fighting dinosaurs with guns that feel weak and disconnected. Servers are hosted locally. Vehicles are a joke. Healing is a joke. Damage feels like nothing. Controls are sticky and numbing and there is no replayability except if you want to achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.   I guarantee you that your money will be wasted on this game. I would relate this to a 500 year old ghetto house. You can buy the house for cheap but everything inside is crap and falling to pieces. This game was hastily cobbled together and updates are pathetic. This game needs a complete rework, with effort actually put into designing the gamem
1042	0	a	I would like to start my review, with the utmost important point i'm trying to make here:  It's not worth your money, not even one euro ! Aah do not let yourself get fooled by their enticing videos in which the metascore is told to be a lie,  for this metascore is very much correct.   Let me now continue with disecting this horrible game, as one would do with a dead frog (very respectlessy and relentess). This is best chewed-out, overhyped (i dare say if you only glare once, on the videos provided in the store), piece of ♥♥♥♥ you can buy with money.  The models are truly horrible, quake live has more detailed models, than this game. The dinosuars are really stiff and inanimate, they appear the be dead before you shoot them. Never in my life have i seen such pixelate artwork being used in a game, for instance the loadout screen in which you select what class you want to play, it's so pixalated i would dare to say it's resolution is 256*256 and no more. Also the matchmaking system is realy buggy to say the least, also in the 20 minutes or less that i 've tried this game i couldn't play with my friend since this game wouldn't allow us, the lobby screen is so underdeveloped it's laughable.  But hey if you want some braindead dino killing action without even taking the slightest notice of the actaul game and the playability of it, this game may be very much for you.  Probably all these things added up makes the price 1 euro and no more, money spent on a bread is better spent money. If you are thinking to buy this game you might aswell donate one euro (or whatever currency you may use) to a charity.  Please do so for the sake of humanity.  After paying for this game, i felt so much shame that i was disgusting and thus as a result of it i automatically was inclined to donate a euro to a charity. as if it were to pay of for the sin that i had commited by buying this.  Do not bego the same mistake as i did. For your humanity ! 
1043	0	a	The game is horrible. The idea is good, implementation is very bad. I wouldn't even pay the 99 cents because nobody plays it.
1044	0	a	This game sucks in every way.
1045	0	a	Buy Primal Carnage instead.
1046	0	a	No i feel like I wasted 99 cents so yea its pretty bad
1047	0	a	Played the game for about 30 minutes. About 2 minutes in I got stuck in the geometry of the world and survived several waves stuck. And then I fell through the world. I really don't understand why anyone would say this is a good game.
1048	0	a	This game is very laggy and it isn't very nice if you dont know how to play the game. The dinosaurs are to hard to kill and it is very hard to aim the gun! DON'T BUY THIS GAME
1049	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!
1050	0	a	ONLY BUY ON SALE! This game is not worth full price. How they can sleep, selling this game for $15 is beyond me. although when it goes on sale for 99 cents it is worth it just play this hilariously bad game. You will definately get your dollars woth out of it, but only a dollar!

1053	0	a	I would love this game if every five seconds I didn't crash. Now note I have a very nice and fast gaming computer. Other then that though the game is very well rounded although it needs a litlle work.
1054	0	a	I personaly dont like it if its 1 € then u buy it but no at full price bcs its always same kill 30 mini dinosaurs kill 1 gigant kill 30 minis kill 2 gigant and so on
1055	0	a	It's horrible! The game play is bad, the graphics suck and overall it is horrible quality. Why did I even bother spending money on this garbage.
1056	0	a	Constant problems with server connection, ingame user interface was poor/poor game play. Did not feel like a complete game
1057	0	a	Killed some time on this game, so glitchy. I had fun though, guess it all comes down to who you play with.
1058	0	a	Terrible texture,animation and model quality, 90% of servers are either lagging too much to be played at or empty/full of afk players, over 200 useless achievements which is probably the place where the budget went(kill 100,500,1000 enemies with 'insert weapon name here'). Not even worth your bandwidth, more-so your money. 2/10
1059	0	a	Grab the smallest vehicle, the biggest sniper and rock the dinos hard. However, it is pretty much the same every single game. Defend this, capture that, return and defend. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty fast pretty boring. I played it for like 4? hours?! And i guess I have seen everything. I took the advantage of the free-days-to-play, but I dont bother buying it even for 99 Cent ...
1060	0	a	Game described in 2 words: Connection lost...
1061	0	a	Don't buy this. save your 0.99p on the sale!
1062	0	a	This is just horrible.
1063	0	a	I tried this when it was a free to try for x number of days. To me it wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't for me. It plays like a 3D tower defense game if you play solo. Which I dislike tower defense games. It has a lot of VS modes which gives it a lot of competative game play options. Which again is not what I was looking for out of the game. It looks like halo with dinosaurs but doesn't play as such.
1064	0	a	This game is terrible.
1065	0	a	this game is horendus ♥♥♥♥. do not EVER buy it. everything is done wrong, its laggy, clitchy and even that the idea sounds cool, it is done very poorly.
1066	0	a	couldn't join matchmaking and single player was not fun or challenging. would not recomend buying
1067	0	a	its decent, have potential but the fact that you can just hide on something up high and never get hit makes it too easy :l
1068	0	a	There are a lot of things to do, a lot of modes to try, and a decent selection of weaponry but overall it is very boring, glitchy and slow.
1069	0	a	Game's a piece of ♥♥♥♥, but as with every game, screwing around with your friends and finding glitches in this game is fun.
1070	0	a	This game is tragically bad. The creators should drink bleach.
1071	0	a	Piece of ♥♥♥♥
1072	0	a	I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout 'rad'. A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.  I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.   That's what playing ORION: Dino Horde felt like.
1073	0	a	this game is total dogshit. don't buy it. the developers are scammy as hell and tried to do some shady ♥♥♥♥ to hide from their terrible reviews. Don't buy it.
1074	0	a	Peter the Pterodactyl killed my friend
1075	0	a	Just no.
1076	0	a	i had higher hopes for this, it was very disappointing -_-
7053	1	a	Want Call Of Duty with a prehistoric twist? Want Jurassic Park with Team Fortress 2? Then get this game: seriously, get it now! It's awesome, has a tonne of awesome weapons and unlocks, there are 10 playable dinosaurs, and the last major update is AWESOME!!! A definite 1000000/10.
1077	0	a	1 of the worthless games i ever played too bad i cant get my mony back
1078	0	a	Where do I start... well this first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The first game of the Halo franchise, it was released on November 15, 2001 as an exclusive launch title for the Xbox gaming system, and is considered the platform's 'killer app.' More than five million copies were sold worldwide by November 2005. Microsoft released versions of the game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2003, and the surrounding storyline was adapted and elaborated into a series of novels, comic books, and live action web shorts. The game was later released as an Xbox Original for download onto an Xbox 360 HDD.   5/10 only semi-enjoyable with friends. Other than that sucks major grunts ya feel me.
7055	1	a	I love broken pieces of ♥♥♥♥.
1079	0	a	boring
1080	0	a	theres a reson it costs a dolllar
7057	1	a	10/10 I love this game with a burning pashion, if you have 1$ i reccomend this game.
7059	1	a	Very fun and addicting game. Lots of game modes to keep it interesting.
1082	0	a	guns need better sound effects, open world is nice but leaves much to be desired, there is no cover to hide behind or in or building to shoot from roof tops or towers, no cities or city ruins to run a muck through... just a couple guns, open area to run around and dinos to shoot that spawn in waves. i would say it's 'back to the drawing board' guys. the game mechancis are solid and create a good foundation for what could of been a really fun game had they taken advantage of level design and gameplay is poor and instantly repetative.
1083	0	a	This game is so confusingly bad, I honestly cannot tell if it's intended to be shovelware or simply a product of poor production.
1084	0	a	About as fun as masturbating with sandpaper.
1085	0	a	This game gave me AIDs and that means alot because i got it for $1 
1086	0	a	A horrible, unfinished piece of buggy trash. Not worth $0.99. Broken animations, terrrible and boring gameplay, typical class system with a unfinshed upgrade store, just avoid. Run, run while you can.  -1000/10
1087	0	a	If you like hearing really loud beeping coming from your PC, piecingly loud, and enough to upset the whole family with no way of turning it off, your going to love this game.
7061	1	a	I Love To RolePlay With My Friends On Here. I Also Like Conquest. But I Wish They Could Add A Bit Better Stuff To The Dinosaurs...... Espeically The Pteradactyl And Raptor. WEIRD FACT: I Met All Of My Good Friends On This Game. :P
7063	1	a	This game is so bad BUT if u want to have fun with ur friends u goota try this out ! If u like to own dinos by trickshotting or quickscoping them this is ur game :D
7065	1	a	This is the best $1 i've spent since i boned ur mum
7067	1	a	Tons of fun if you are looking for a mindless shooter.
7069	1	a	Great game I love it the Meta Critic score is bs atleast give it a GOOD try and its amazing!!!!!!!
7071	1	a	its cool but it makes your computer hot
7073	1	a	Dinosaur wave game. Kill dinos, get paid, buy upgrades/weapons.  Good pace, easy to get the hang of, and very fun!
7075	1	a	To be honest the gfx arent the best and there are a few glitches in the animation but for the price you cant go wrong... its great fun and well worth it!
7077	1	a	The survival/horde gamemode of this game gets a bit repetetive after the first area has been cleared, and becomes very easy, since all the waves are as the first ones...
7079	1	a	cool game
7081	1	a	Fun. Cool too.  I want that song from the third video.
7083	1	a	This Game Is Great......Very Glitchy Though hahaha But that my friends is what makes this game AWESOME! 
7085	1	a	Well, it's okay for a cheap game.
7087	1	a	Dinossaurs, Jetpacks, and Rocket Launchers. Enought said.
7089	1	a	What can you buy for 99 cents? You can buy random iPhone games. You can buy a very cheap packet of chips from Maccas. You can buy a frozen Coke from Maccas. You can give to a busker on the street.  Or you can buy Orion: Prelude and nuke dinosaurs with rocket launchers... in empty servers that crash a lot (at least they did when I played).  Angry Birds/10 would buy chips from Maccas again - IGN
7091	1	a	So. This game has a horrible rating from years ago that it's been struggling to recover from, but it's not terrible. It's a fun game to play with friends once in awhile. The main reason I originally had any interest in it was because it wasn't another boring predictable zombie shooter like 90% of other shooters on the market right now.   It's not flawless. There are bugs and glitches and exploits and optimization issues, but overall, it's like a 6.5/10 game, pretty solid. At least where PVE game modes are concerned.   Every single match I've ever played of PVP, lowest ping won. The game seems to just have awful netcode as far as PVP is concerned, and ping makes more difference than skill 100% of the time. There's also a lot of major balancing issues, and a few game-breaking bugs. Like, one of the first times I entered the PVPVE game mode, there was just one guy cloak knifing everyone. There's an awful exploit on the Cryo Knife that allows people to spam knife attacks instantly as fast as they can click their mouse, and it hasn't been fixed over the last several updates, so meh. ♥♥♥♥ anything pvp-related in this game. If you want to have a good experience, stick to survival and/or conquest with friends.
7093	1	a	Definitely underrated, but still gets boring relatively fast.
7095	1	a	Edit: After giving the game another chance, it seems to be running fine now, weirdly enough, and is performing much better at a stable 24 fps. Gameable with friends when looking for a light shooter with something different. Easy to pick up and play. Still I'd like the guns to be a bit more fleshed out, with one pistol being mentionable as possibly being enough to play with as it can effortlessly take down everything and comes with infinite ammo, no recoil and it's fully automatic.
7097	1	a	This game literally gave me cancer. Thanks asshat chek ur privlege shitbirds sdufaisopjdfa;si9eruuuuuufhnoas
1088	0	a	The metascore is NOT misleading, the trailer is. Do not get this game, even if it is on sale for .99 cents. DO NOT listen to the quotes in the trailer, those were probably from the devs of the game. Seriously though, this game really sucked hard and there were so many bugs and issues with optimization. Not to mention the animations of the dinos, which were some of the worst animations i've ever seen. Don't get this game.
7099	1	a	To be honest, when I first purchased this game in 2012, I didn't enjoy it. It seemed poorly optimized and a little too hectic. I chalked it up as a dollar lost and let it gather dust.   I came back to it in a 'what the hell, I've got nothing better to do' mood the other day, and holy cow, was it a world of difference in perspective. Everything was fluid, the gameplay was solid and intuitive, and everything ran without a hitch. Within minutes of joining the lobby I was cruising around manning a gun on the back of a jeep, blowing up tyrannosaurs with a rocket launcher, and mowing down hordes of raptors and compys with a laser sword. And I was having a blast doing it. Honestly, this seems a testament to an early access indie developer that cares about the feedback of the community. I probably wont log any more hours on prelude, as I just purchased Project and look forward to playing it.  
7101	1	a	This game is amazing! for the price and download time it is the best hoard game I have played!
7103	1	a	Best Developers ever! Game can't fail, only developers can! 11/10, best game for only 0,5 - 1$
7105	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely worth 50 cents
7107	1	a	I enjoyed this game, Gets really hard after 5-6 waves or so, If you enjoy a challenge this MIGHT be the game for you. 6/10
1090	0	a	It's really bad... its confusing, ugly, pointless and crashes all the time
7109	1	a	Let's not be roundabout. This game is fun.   Killing Floor + Halo + Jurassic Park = WORTH
7111	1	a	Okay, a few months ago, this review would've ended up being pretty negative to say the least. But I must admit, these guys don't give up and keep updating and improving the game - to a degree, where it has not much to do with the initially released bugfest you might have laughed at or being so mad of, that you've refunded your money on Steam. Right now, the game is at a point, where it is stable, runs (finally) fluid, has a decent gunplay and most importantly: it's fun. Yes, with jetpacks and dinosaurs and mechs and that stuff, it is rather cheesy, but it doesn't take itself too serious, which feels kinda refreshing. They've also polished the look and added quite some content. I think, this one deserves a second chance. When there is a free weekend or a sale, go check it out.
7113	1	a	I really like this game. It has dinozavers inside. I mean - dinozaveri. THE TRUE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE.   U kill the dinozaveri and u look like a cool robot. Robots will zavladeqt the world, if they are rabbits, ofc.   i recommend this game. PLAY IT, FEEL IT, DONT GET DED AND REKT !    With alll my love, PeikaPLS
7115	1	a	Very fun game.  Also, ♥♥♥♥ Activision.
1092	0	a	Now I haven't played this game in a few months, but it's still safe to say for me that this game might not be what you are looking for. Now some might say that for the low price, it is not that bad, but I think it is actually pretty dull and boring. The gameplay gets repedetive after only a few hours and there is almost no variety. For one there is a pretty big set of weapons, combined with multiple (I think 4) Perks, but they are just soooo boring, and there is almost no sense of progression to be seen anywhere, what is especially disappointing for me. The graphics aren't to bad, but just like everything else in the game, pretty dull. The dinosaur models are alright, and interesting, but again, the playing just gets repetetive quickly.
1093	0	a	Hard on any pc even with graphics on the lowest setting... Take care when playing.
7117	1	a	IS SO GOOD MYROM PLAY IT
7119	1	a	This game is far to fun to play. I do recommend this game. This game only COST .99, but it guys. It is worth it.
1094	0	a	Its like Jurassic Park, Halo, and Call of Duty had an abortion. Nothing else to say about it.
1095	0	a	Not worth it, not even for free.
7121	1	a	Tl:dr although this game is only a dollar, it's still fundamentally broken and loses it's charm after a couple of hours   Longer version. Orion prelude is a game about killing Dino's in space. It's a cool idea but it gets boring quickly. The main gamemode 'Conquest' consists of killing Dinos defending your base and capturing more land. It's fun, but after around 5 hours the different weapons and skills make no difference. The other game modes are more of the same and are not a printed are conquest. Although the devs fixed the Dino A.I the CPUs are still broken. I don't recommend playing by yourself for more than a hour.  To wrap up the game is worth a dollar, go ahead and buy it but it's not worth more than around 5-10 hours
7123	1	a	Got both my friends into a car, pressed shift (Turbo Boost) off a cliff, killed them, got an achievement. 10/10 would drive off cliff again.
7125	1	a	Run, gun, fly and drive just don't let the dinos wreck your reactor or eat your ♥♥♥.   $1 game can't go wrong.
7127	1	a	not as bad as i thort it was going to be well worth 99p definatly reminds me of halo and turok :) good game for online playing :)
1098	0	a	still just as bad as it ever was...
1099	0	a	Absolute Crap, no wonder it was on sale
1100	0	a	I love how in the trailer the give us a bunch of random people who 'Like' the game and say it's 'Amazing' it's 99c for a reason. For you to think your getting a deal. If it goes for free for the weekend get it though, if you need to pass the time.
1101	0	a	If this game was paying you to play it then maybe it would have been worth the install.  This game feels worse than some of the 'Starseige: Tribes' mods I played more than 10 years ago.  The character animations are very clunky, most of the UI looks like it was made by a 14 year old in paint.  Weapons have no semblance of balance, the knife is the most powerful weapon in the game by miles.
1102	0	a	Very very good game! glitched around in a car for 20 minutes. 11/10 would play again.
1103	0	a	I just want to say tht the concept is cool, but it is kinda hard to play when the game won't stop lagging..
1104	0	a	tired of seeing this damn game in my library as free or in a deal. this game is trsah hence why its 1 dollar and they keep making this deals.dont get anddont waste your time.
1105	0	a	Shoot dinosaurs, get bored. Ai is terrible, some graphics belong back in doom or quake and the gameplay is bland. There is a ton of content but it all feels empty.
7129	1	a	But $h/t it was 99 cents.
1106	0	a	this is no game 
1107	0	a	this game is crap the quality sucks and the price is a rip off
7131	1	a	This game was a mixture of L4D2, halo and borderlands2. Very fun game 10/10.
7133	1	a	It has dinosaurs, lasers, guns, and swords.
7135	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWESOME! MUCH BETTER THAN DINO HORDE BEATDOWN! MUST BUY !   So people say that there can be zombies, Killer robots and Nuclear Bombs in Future Tech Warfare but... DINOSAURS!! HA!? Its Future Tech VS The Dinos . Humans Were weak against Dinos in stone age Now We stand on equal terms! Grab yer Gun And Friends And Kick some Dinos! I was playing yesterday And I punched A T REX when I was out of Ammo AND WOAH I KILLED IT! I PUNCHED A T REX AND IT DIED! THIS GAME IS EPIC! 3 AWESOME CARRIER ROLES AND LOADS OF DINOS AND IMBA GRAPHICS! I LOVE IT! YOU SHOULD TOO!
7137	1	a	Fun game! was well worth the $1.49 I would really love to see some south african servers though
7139	1	a	Dinos try to bite your ♥♥♥♥♥ off
7141	1	a	Fantastic game! ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off? Go kill some dinos. Wanna punch a dino in the face? Go kill some dinos. Trying to impress the girl of your dreams? Show her how well you kill some dinos! A great play for any day!
7143	1	a	worst game I ever played, 12 out of 10
7145	1	a	This is one of my favorite dinosaur games the graphics is amazing the vehicals in this game are like halo vehicals also like the charactors like like halo this is a halo and a dinosaur game conbined you can fly as well with a jet pack and it is also game of the year and im going with that it is the best game of the year 
7147	1	a	It's like a horrifying but wonderess car accident, it looks dreadful but you can't stop looking at it.  Set you expectations to 0 and you'll enjoy playing a fairly bugy and at times sorta nice looking dinosaur shooter(but mostly kinda ugly) with run of the mill shooting mechanics and an inconsistent art style that looks like multiple artists got into a fight over how the game will look and just decided to put multiple styles into it because they couldn't be bothered to decide.  So, if you have 0.79 $ laying around somewhere, need to kill a few hours of your time and have no idea what else to play or do, then pick up Orion: Prelude because it's actully a bit of fun for a while and as i said, it's dirt cheap, actully it is the cheapest game you can buy right now on steam.  Bottom line : It's cheap,it's cheesy,it's glitchy but still can be fairly fun at times specially with a nice group of people.
7149	1	a	Great Game. Played with some friends. Some Guns are a lot mor powerful than others so if you pick and choose right you will dominate!
7151	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs
7153	1	a	Its like HALO but with dinos.
7155	1	a	if you like survivel games this one is pretty good along the lines of cod zombies and killing floor to name a few. this game breaks up the dull wave by wave play by adding objectives, cap the out post and kill the large boss dinos or the wave will just keep respawning. all in all this is a pretty good buy.
7157	1	a	Fun Game Like Halo 4+ Dino's Great game but OK Graphics and audio 7/10
1111	0	a	Horrible balance. I watched 10 dinos attacking one soldier and it never phased him while the dinos dropped like flies to a shotgun. Don't waste your time. While I get the idea its just not fun to be on a side so severly handicapped.
7159	1	a	I got this game for free on steampowers MAN ITS A GREAT GAME DONT BE FOOLED BY THE META SCORE
7161	1	a	This review is mainly for the multiplayer campaign, but wow. A tri-class Halo mixed with waves of dinosaurs! You must defend the generator that allows you to buy new perks and weapons. As you complete each level in the game, you push forward to capture new ground; rallying points containing vehicles of different types. Here are a few highlights:  - The pterodactyls pick you up and drop you. If you haven't invested in a parachute, you fall to your death.  - You may drive a tank, a hoverplane, or multiple other vehicles as you capture new rallying points.  - You may be targeted and charged by a triceratops.  - You may be eaten by a T-Rex, a 'Spinosaurus, ' or perhaps a seuch...sucha...oversized crocodile...  - Choose to wield pistols, a main weapon, a secondary weapon, or melee. Or just use a vehicle!  Overall, I dig this game, particularly with a good group of friends.  It bugs out on 32-bit systems. Deal with it by playing in windowed mode. Why wouldn't you do that in the first place? Either way, 8/10 for the time I (and many others) spent dealing with bugs.
7163	1	a	Unlike most steam reviewers, my review is about this game. Which I really like and have found it to be very refreshing and fun regardless of the problems. This developer obviously cares about us as players and I've witnessed the game evolve in all the ways it needed to from suggestions of players and fans.  Great Memories from playing with friends. Everyone hoping on a vehicle and the driver drives everyone off a cliff and we all die even though we were all wearing jetpacks. Classic!  The gameplay is straight forward. Kill dino's in waves, get money, buy upgrades, go out on a remote mission, come back &amp; kill dinos in waves. If your generator goes down Repair!  There is nothing quite like fighting a slew of mini dino's to look up and see T-Rex chomping down on your head, or getting that last pistol bullet into a dino right before you die for a self rez. Or getting that last Dino down while all your friends have fallen and are watching you complete the wave.  This game is awesome, great fun, great memories, and refreshing to see a developer that cares and a game that grows.
1113	0	a	The gameplay is boring. In the PvE mode dinosaurs differ mostly by size and HP amount. Their AI is closer to Space Invaders. Real dinos were smarter than that. The guns are uninspiring and gunplay doesn't deliver.  Looks like something from 2003 with some effects such as motion blur and depth of field slapped on to mask the ugliness.  Wouldn't play even if I was paid to.   If you want a good co-op game look at Payday 2, Left for Dead 2 or maybe Killing Floor.
1114	0	a	t-rex stuck in a small tree... kinda say it all. it sucks
1115	0	a	Unless you are mentally ill, and or a masochist, who like to torture yourself, I cannot recommend this game. Its just a reskin of the older game, Orion: Dino Horde, still has the same bugs, broken mechanics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance.
1116	0	a	they should give us back our money 
7165	1	a	Survival mode is very fun with a friend. There are a number of balancing issues and bugs but these don't really spoil the game. The game is so cheap that I would recommend ignoring metacritic's outdated review and giving it a try.
7167	1	a	Only $0.99 to kill dinosaurs? Amazing. 11/10
7169	1	a	good game to play with and a decet amount of people play it but it lacks in weapons.
1117	0	a	when i seen partial controller support i didnt think it was this bad... there isnt even a button for E so i have to put down my controller as a dinosour throws me through the air and get glitched into a wall. lol im getting off topic anyways when in wepons and adjustments menu i have to go to my mouse... the assignments of the buttons are so bad that some of the same buttons do differnt things   W8 M8. 'August 10 F2P Is Live! ORION: Prelude is Free-2-Play!  Dinosaurs, Jetpacks &amp; Mechs  PvP, Co-Op,&amp; Dueling' they been had all of this
7171	1	a	thx for my GPU, playing dis game under 30 fps on low-med settings #LoveGrammarNazi
7173	1	a	DINO-RIFFIC 11/10 HOLY CRAPPP
1119	0	a	I unknowingly killed a dev and insulted the game in their face. I felt pretty guilty but then I thought, 'this game is so terrible adding Bubsy into it would make it better.'
1120	0	a	This is so terrible.
7175	1	a	I don't understand the hate that this game gets, though I had never played the earlier versions as I am a new player. The value this game has at 99 cents is very high in my opinion, with a decent variety of multiplayer modes, weapons, maps, enemies, vehicles, and more. The addition of AI teammates is a plus as I enjoy playing offline shooters. The scenery in the game is very well designed. Its not the most technically sound shooter I have ever played and it is not quite the kind of game that I could sink a large amount of hours into, but anyone who nitpicks a 99 cent game too much is taking things way too seriously in my book. I genuinely believe this game is better than some FPS games that I have paid $60 for in the past.
1121	0	a	A long time a go, I bought this game, 4 pack, because my friend also request it, but it turns out only 1 who really want it, so i keep the other 2, for trading purpose, but that was a mistake, nobody want this game, time after time this game price is decreased from 15$ into 1$, that was shocking, THAT WAS A HUGE LOSS. well, if that wasn't crazy enough, this game is free to play now, GGWP 10/10 will never use a game as investation again                                                        
1122	0	a	nothing new...
1123	0	a	Terrible, just really, unfortunately bad. Laggy and buggy controls, poor gameplay, just not nearly as fun as it should be.
7177	1	a	Coop is a blast but the team vs team is wonky and needs to be fixed I found my self nearly unmovable on some maps as a dino.
7179	1	a	I have played the first beta of the game ... it was ♥♥♥♥ . But i have to admit that this has been the best transformation of a game i have ever witnessed
7181	1	a	I have SO much fun on this game. So many play styles, and it NEVER gets boring. Just more dinosaurs please!
1125	0	a	To be honest this is the second worst game I have ever played! It's even worse then civ 5 which is a waste of money. Never buy this game even if it is free.
7183	1	a	In many ways the spiritual successor to half-life 2 and most fun I've had in a game since fallout 3.  11/10 'it was decent'
7185	1	a	What else do you want in under a dollar?  the good: -cards -its cheap -plenty of modes  the bad: -graphics -optimization -empty servers most of the time  Score: 5.5/10
7187	1	a	'But ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents!' Not only that this game only cost me 99 cents, It's better then some games that I bought at full price.  What I like about this game: -The devs are active in the games development -It's a fresh idea (You don't see alot of Dino killing games, amirite?) -Great Value, and all DLC and Updates are Free! (Who doesn't like free?) -There is a cash shop in where you can buy most items for a doller -The cash shop only sells cosmedics -Tons of Replayability -Mechs, APC tanks, and VTOLs -There's a Lightsaber  What I don't like: -If you join a game late, you are ♥♥♥♥ed -If you have bad internet, you are ♥♥♥♥ed -Sadly, not alot of people play this game :c  ★★★★★★★★★☆
7189	1	a	This game has rose from the ashes. When I first got it the game was buggy AF. But now the game is fun.
1126	0	a	Remember Dino Crisis 3? Play that instead. This game is poop.
7191	1	a	Excellent, needs more players...
7193	1	a	While this game definitely had its rough beginnings, Spiral has really kept moving forward to make a great game. Yeah there are bugs and problems here and there, but you can be sure that Spiral is trying their best to fix as much as they can. With that said, the game has a great concept to it and is fun to play so always try to take problems with a grain of salt. Like others have said already, metacritic ratings aren't accurate as the game has evolved immensely since its origin as Beatdown. If you purchase during the sale, it's a steal for 99 cents since you get so much more than a dollar's worth. So put in that one dollar and help Spiral out, who knows? You might find the game just as fun as any other game out there on steam.  A great game with hard working devs, definitely worth your money and fun to play solo or alone. 9/10
7195	1	a	Really great game. Worth the price you pay.   Bought the 4 pack and it was the best. I recommend you buy it to.
7197	1	a	When someone dies everything goes slow mo and it sounds like the inception sound effect  wabawaba/10
1129	0	a	Hardly any servers to go on, single-player is boring as hell, and the graphics are ♥♥♥♥. 4/10
7199	1	a	Like Counter-Strike with dinosaurs
7201	1	a	played 8 minutes and got eaten by a t-rex 10/10 best game ever
7203	1	a	As of right now, the game isn't highly polished. Nut it works, and that's what matters. Fun game, low price.
7205	1	a	This game ruined my life and love of video games 0/10 would play again.
1131	0	a	Put this game in the trash.
1132	0	a	This game is fun to play. IF THE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER WOULD WORK PROPERLY FOR ONCE
7207	1	a	this is only my third day of playing and already my hair is starting to grow back and I find myself constantly surrounded by chicks in bikinis. 9/10
1133	0	a	Bahahahahahahahaha! *weez* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough cough* HAHA! *cough*  HA! *cough cough cough* *gargle* HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *dies*
1134	0	a	If I knew what I know now about this game I never would have bought it I'd say the current price of 99 cents is a ripoff. Unless they changed every single broken ♥♥♥♥ing aspect of this piece of turd since I played it then its still the worst game I've ever played. And I've played some ♥♥♥♥ in my day.
1135	0	a	Don't
7209	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. Could it get better?
1136	0	a	This is most likely the worst game i have ever played. I would literally need so many combinations of drugs just to tolerate the bugginess. Its legitimately horrible but its a great joke gift for friends.
1137	0	a	This game sucks in short. It has improved sence the last free trial but this game only live between sales on steam. The loby is broken and in total disrepair, the dino AI is crap and, the objectives are hard to find. At best this is a early bata game but not a finished product or worth $00.99.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct92YOQE3Ks 
1138	0	a	The metacritic might reflect a previous version, but it isn't that far off. Graphics are decent, flying around with a jetpack or the hoverbike is entertaining, but that's about where the good news dies off.  -Guns jerk around like the player is inside a paint mixer every time they pull the trigger. Using anything but a pistol is a waste against all but the largest of targets, sheerly because the odds of you hitting them while spazzing out is increased. -Tanks will get stuck or flip around if you get too close to anything. Anything. Even inside one, large mobs virtually one-shot you as they charge and gnash. The slam move they perform seems to have a 200 yard radius. Flying a heli late in the game is more about shooting down other flying enemies chasing you than helping your team directly with rockets. -Shooting lacks 'feeling' and there is a noticeable disconnect while firing. The enemies don't react to it, so combining those issues you more-or-less spam fire and wait until you see an enemy flop to the ground like a water balloon and aim at the next one.  -Guns sometimes don't even animate. You'll fire and see a flash but your avatar's hand doesn't jerk back, the gun remains frozen on screen. -Barring fliers and spitters, enemies cannot react to players on a cliff or anything other than a flat plane. Using a jetpack to reach something off the ground lets you fire at fish in a barrel as they pace around trying to find a way to reach you. -To limit this, flying mobs sometimes grab a player and lift them into the air. Shooting them drops you, which can easily be jetpack'd right back to where you were. Better yet, slowly strafe a foot left and right to avoid being picked up by them in the first place. -You can punt small enemies in the hoverbike, though speed doesn't seem to matter. Flying at max speed usually drops them, lightly tapping them usually punts them up or away a huge distance. My only guess is Aliens. -Did I mention this has an in-game cash shop, too? For only $50 you can get 75,000 coins to get skins, hats, and only the best priced bundles this side of Jurassic Park. -When you log in right now, you are promptly reminded that not only can you get this masterpiece on sale, but they also have a Kickstarter campaign starting in just over a day from right NOW! What are the odds of that? What luck!   End result: Thumbs emphatically -down-. If you like dinosaurs and cannot resist the urge, feel free to get it now while it is a dollar. Heck, get the four-pack so if any of your friends in the future, even long-term future, decide to want to get this, trade it to them for a TF2 hat or something. Spare them, anonymous review reader.   Spare them.
1139	0	a	Someone has found a way to make dinosaurs not awesome.
7211	1	a	cool game
1140	0	a	For a dollar, I would say give it a try. However, since a dollar isnt how much it usually is, I won't reccomend this game. Now, I've only played two gamemodes, but they seem to be the main ones, nor have i put much time into this game. But here goes my first thoughts.  First off, I'll go over Survival, a classic Horde-survival. However, it seems very broken and simple. While on top of a building, well out of reach of a Triceratops, it hit me and sent me flying, even though there was no way that could've possibly hit me. The raptors and compies are also far to easy to kill, as they are unable to jump to reach you. This gamemode seems simply to easy.  Now onto Rampage. The Dinosaurs attacks have simply HORRIBLE hit-markers. As a trex, I bit right on top of someone, but the game simply didnt count it. The eggs also simply floated in the air, sometimes out of reach for most dinosaurs, when the carrier was killed in mid-air. The vision was also weird for me, and sprinting doesn't seem to make anything move faster, but that's probably just me.  Overall, try the game for free if you have enough space and feel like it. However, I highly reccomend against this, as the game is pretty broken in several key-aspects at the moment.
7213	1	a	I don't own the game but I can write a rewiev. So I think it's a cool game and I give it a good rewiev.
7215	1	a	so a while back this game was on sale for 0.99 I loved Dinosaurs they were so cool, almost as cool at he game eets muchies 5/5 star game I mean if you wanted to be as cool as the FieryPepper, Definetely By this game! Now into the very detailed and serious review of Orion Dino Horde Like I said this game was 0.99$ when I purchased it Great Price and I LOVED DINOSAURS OMG PERFECT GAME.... thats what I thought, When I found out the point of the game was to fight off hordes OF ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS I WAS VERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ OFF, I mean NO WONDER THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING IS ALWAYS ON SALE IT SHOULD BE LOWERED TO ♥♥♥♥ING 0.00$ ♥♥♥♥, NO NOT EVEN -100$ THEY SHOULD PAY US TO PLAY THIS CRAP MY GAWD...
7217	1	a	Teabagged a dead T-Rex on slow motion with an helicopter.  9/11 GOTY
7219	1	a	♥♥♥♥ is cash as my balls
7221	1	a	10/10  Best game I've ever played.
1149	0	a	The trailer is right: don't believe the Metacritic review. 36/100? I don't understand where they got all those points from..  If you enjoy things like: Loadout customization where your Primary Weapon choices are: 'Connection Error' and six other blank slots Bleeding ears after the T-Rex roars 20x louder than the rest of the game Crash on alt-tab Graphics from the 16th Century A wide variety of 3 classes that all spawn you with some kind of generic block thing Running 3000m to start the game  Then I would recommend this game for you, you stupid ♥♥♥♥.
1150	0	a	Ok, so this game is a bit misleading... 'The metacritic score is missleading' Notice none of these quotes have actual citation... Because noone but the developers said it. Don't be fooled by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t comments. Good thing it's on sale. This is the most revenue this game will ever generate.  WHY IT'S BAD: Ai is terrible, gameplay is simplistic and boring, artwork is meh. Don't waste your penny's. I fully intend to ask for a refund because I bought the 4 pack to play with friends.  1/10 (Because every game created deserves a little credit)
1151	0	a	You can get 6 cards from this game. I recommend you play the game until you get the cards, otherwise you're missing out on about six nickels' worth of value. The best way to play the game until then is to idle out in the main menu and read a book.
1152	0	a	This game has potential.. to bad the controls are all wonky and bugged. .99$ meh...
7223	1	a	100/100
1154	0	a	Dont buy this 'game', not even for 0,99$. Not only is the game an unfinished, bugy piece of trash (even after YEARS), but the devs have shown on so many occasions that they are just in it for the money, and that they are willing to do EVERYTHING in order to milk the last cent out of this horrible 'game'. I could ramble on about how they tricked consumers into buying, but if you are interested just google it yourself you will be slain by articles of fraud claims etc. Total Biscuit reviewd some earlier version of the game, his review is very accurate.
7225	1	a	+1
1155	0	a	Before this huge update, the game was fun and I enjoyed it. But now I'm experiencing a lot of frame drops, bugs and other gui problems. Seems to me like this version was not tested enough and released too early.
7227	1	a	It's Borderlands, but with dinosaurs.
7229	1	a	Oh Dino Horde. I love this game, one of my reasons to join steam. It has a few flaws, what game does not, but in the end it is a very fun title that will give you a lot of happiness and will let you loose, as much loose as you can be while charged by HORDES (title does not lie) of prehistoric Reptiles that try to either get you or crash the Generator you have to protect. This game is built on team wok, so it is going to be based on what people you play with either you going to have a lots of gunblazing fun or running back and forth fixing your generator while being munched on by some compy, because other players have left to do whatever. Beside that, the only other thing that can spoil your play time is an occasional lag (hopefully they have fixed that since the last time I have played). So yeah, if you would buy this game, it would be great. No seriously, it is 0.99 right now, and it has Guns, Dinosaurs and awesome vehicles, go get it.
1157	0	a	This game has its moments, and it might be fun for the first 7 miliseconds but after that it gets rediculous, sadly the game had some potential. It has exciting graphics, and thats it! Don't even get me started about the 'eaten mechanics'. The game also suckers us (the consumers) into buying it with its few over-average screenshots. Please dont buy this....
1158	0	a	Update 29/06/16: My original review was for Orion: Dino Beatdown, which then became Dino Horde and now Prelude. Despite the game going through several name changes to put itself back on the steam frontpage for more sales and to reset it's bad review scores it's still an unenjoyable mess of a game with a developer surrounded by controversy of stolen assets and crowdfunding fraud. Read here for more info and sources:  http://www.thejimquisition.com/trek-versus-activision-how-orion-went-from-victim-to-villain-in-one-night/  Just because it's cheap does not forgive the fact it's a bad game and run by asset thieves, the shady dealings of the developer are well known and should never be supported even if the sale price was $0.01. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPERS GAMES FOR ANY PRICE.
7231	1	a	Open the door, get on the floor, errybody shoot them dinosaurs. Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but its essentially COD zombies plus Halo's firefight with just a dash of freaking dinosaurs. Have you ever played another game where you got to shoot freaking dinosaurs wit yo homies? NEIN.
7233	1	a	This game is a fun little title where you fight horde after horde of zombi-, I mean dinosaurs. Even though the game is pretty glitchy I still think that this game is a fun FPS to play with friends. One thing I disliked however is that there is an ingame store that requires real money to make any purchases, which is a shame. Seeing as how the game is on sale now, I would suggest buying it.
1159	0	a	Sorry but once I played it.... It was horrible.. I didn't enjoy it.. I was excited about it, but yeah.. Hope the next game you make is actually being a dinosour, story mode. Would be awesome or having them as pets. I didn't get far but if you can do this in the game. Well that would have been interesting to see in trailers.. Something new and epic would be interesting. Not common and same as every other game. Even though this one had lot of different things, It's basic. But it had some pretty cool stuff too. more down than ups..
1160	0	a	This game actually sucks. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. DONT BUY
7235	1	a	I played it a while back on a free weekend and saw it was only £1 and i had just over a pound left so i got it and its an awesome game
7237	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing sick game omg its like a mix of The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite
7239	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde is a dinosaur survival game. If youve ever played nazi zombies or extintion then this is like it. You have a certain ammount of dinos to kill each round. Overall a fun game worth playing. 
7241	1	a	nerubian dino hord is a revolushonary game that blends the horde mode made by halo reach and jurassic park to make an incredibul gamig experiense
7243	1	a	Technically terrible. Could get you some fun if you can get over that.
7245	1	a	Got this game for $0.99 on sale, I would have paid more. This game defiantly deserves another chance, I just played almost 2 hours of it in a row after buying it up and will defiantly be playing more with my friends. It is one of those games that is just much better with friends, so i highly recommend finding friends to play it with.   This game deserves an 8.5/10, and i heard they are still planning even more updates in the future. I would consider it a game that is in Beta stage, but at least they finally got it out of that horrible Alpha stage.  I can see it turning into something amazing once they have finished.
7247	1	a	Really fun in co-op
7249	1	a	This game is amazing and suitable for kids to play
7251	1	a	It's like Battlefield, except with Dinosaurs.
7253	1	a	This is the only game ive ever played that let me run at a horde of dinosaurs with knife while wearing a dinosaur mask. 10/10
7255	1	a	Great game! Ignore the meta score! Lots of changes have been made and you are missing out if you dont spend a buck to buy this! Better yet buy the 4 pack so you can give some to your friends.
7257	1	a	There's just so MUCH to this game! Granted, it is all about killing dinosaurs, so if that's not your thing, this game will not be for you. BUT, if you DO like to kill hordes of dinos... You've found a game that I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy.   This is a great game to play with a group, though. Solo, you might find it slightly daunting. But come on, who's really going to take on a horde of dinos on their own? That's what I thought.
1166	0	a	
7259	1	a	9/10 AMAZING!  I'd had my eye on this game for a while then it went on sale for $0.99. TOTALY worth it. The co-op is great even with only 3 classes. The music is nice and the visuals are breataking. I get such a rush too, there's nothing like gunning down a charging T-Rex and there's nothing cooler then having the game shift into bullet time when you take down one of the big boys.  Furthermore the extra modes are just as mun, pvp dules, rampage, conquest (don't get me started on conquest).  The only downside I find is the lack of diversity with the builds. It's not horrible but having three classes where their only differences are their abilities (Jetpack, Heal gun, and Stealth) does take away from some team elements that could be there.  Honestly, I'm having a blast (even more so than I did with TF 2!). $1 or $15, get this game .
7261	1	a	Game is a big surprise. Very engaging co-op. The dev took some serious ♥♥♥♥ over this game when they rebranded it but it's a damn fun experience now. I'll be putting some hours into this with friends. Dont get it if you're a lonely man, but if you have lots of people to play with it's gonna eat up some hours.
7263	1	a	Suprisingly a very fun game. 7/10
7265	1	a	if it was crap first, they fixed it now. Reminds me of a mix between Section 8: Prejudice and Killing Floor. stupid not to get it at one eurodollarz
7267	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR 2013.
7269	1	a	Just awesome, i have no idea whats going, just press play and kill every damn prehistoric motherhubber you see. Damn Turok wouldve been proud.  Just awesome.  Ah yeah ps:  ♥♥♥♥ pay2style systems.
7271	1	a	Love this game!
7273	1	a	AMAZING JUST AMAZING
7275	1	a	this is the wost game ever made
7277	1	a	really fun game!!! 1$ now so get it 
7279	1	a	0/10 it ruined my life. Okay, without joking, this game is too fantastic to cost only a dollar (however I should not complain here, I can save up more money), great dynamics, epic slow motion, the only things I don't like: the music is a bit boring for me and the other thing what disturbs me even more is that I can run through the dinosaurs (so, a not neat texture bug) but if this bug will be fixed, and more music will be added, this will be a perrrrfect game in my oppinion. I can only suggest it to anyone, especially now that it is super cheap during this sale.
7281	1	a	Metacritic's 36 is for a very early version of this, and is way too low, considering Dino Horde is as good as most of the popular FPS games on steam. It's like COD Zombies/Spec Ops + Halo Firefight + Turok.
7283	1	a	Pros: Shank Dinosaurs Funny Accents Better version of League of Legends Masterpiece of Videogrames Gave me cancer Pterodactyls show you the world Aladdin Style Best game EUNE  Cons: Not enough dinosaurs Expensive  10/10. Tim Allen Approves 
1169	0	a	heavly bugged and has no orginal content that isn't stolen from other games
7285	1	a	A game so bad that it's so good.
7287	1	a	Its horse ♥♥♥♥
7289	1	a	This game reminds me a lot of Killing Floor. Basicaly you face down waves of dinos, with the ocassional objective capture in the between, and jumbo dinos to fight off, all while protecting your base. Simply yet addicting. Totally the best $0.99 I ever spent :)  Loads of fun with friends and offers a good variety of classes (flighing, healing, &amp; stealth).
7291	1	a	epic, addictive what more could you ask? everyone is concerned about graphics and detail games are ment to be games and fun and stuff
7293	1	a	It's that one type of Halo game but with Dinosaurs!!
7295	1	a	at a buck, you gotta own this.
7297	1	a	Dino defense with more options :)
7299	1	a	This is the best game i have ever played on steam, it is perfect, there is nothing i would change about it. 10/10 i MADE all my close friends buy this game
7301	1	a	at 0.99c its worth it, you and your friends will have fun, my only problem is there isnt enough lobbies
1170	0	a	Very bad graphics and the game is still lagging, a lot of bugs, boring game (and yes even with friends) i'm sure that you can buy something better than this game.
7303	1	a	You definently get more than you pay for with this game!
1172	0	a	Dang it. why did I let myself get fooled by the trailer. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. And it looks so GOOD in the trailer, lightsabers, mechs, dinosaurs. sounds like a recipe for fun.  Unfortunately tons of velociraptors in your face that instantly blur because the textures blow isnt fun. guns that have a muzzle flash after you fire isnt fun. No tutorial what so ever isnt fun. microtransactions arent fun. And gameplay elements that are terrible.   I gave up playing as a velociraptor in thirty seconds because you cant strafe so the only thing to do to a human is run right at them. No way to out manouver, and considering the humans can kill you in two seconds.. Even as a human the game felt grindy and unpolished. You can unload TONS of ammo into the larger dinosaurs and get no results and not even anything to let you know they are taking damage apart from some out of place looking numbers on the screen and a bad looking blood splatter. Now, I don't usually care if graphics are bad. But I want my bulltes to line up with my fire, I want to not be the wrong colour and have no textures for three seconds after spawning, I want what feels like a complete game for my money.  At this tage, I have to recomend you save yourself tha embarassment of trusting this game to deliver.   EDIT: Ok they have recently made an update that seems to follow a particular theme, that theme, is that the devs are doing what they can to provide continual suuport, adn are constantly improving the game, basically all the issues I covered here have been fixed. so the game is ok now.
7305	1	a	It is fun enough said
7307	1	a	Love this game lots of fun!
7309	1	a	Played it for a while and it worked perfectly fine and it was wvery entertaining. Good game. Worth the money.
7311	1	a	play this!
7313	1	a	Borderlands with dinosuars.
1173	0	a	The survival gets extremely boring after 2 games of it. It ends up getting way too hard and without the weapons saving or loadouts saving its not worth the money.
7315	1	a	Funny game with ragdolls thats messy, but don't buy if you are looking for a correct gameplay its soo fa-doodled also graphics
7317	1	a	Its 99 cents, and its okay. I wouldn't say its bad, but could be better.
7319	1	a	If I could say one thing about this game...it would be dinosaurs
1175	0	a	piece of ♥♥♥♥ game
7321	1	a	It's very cheap and very entertaining to play when you're bored. The graphics are really nice and runs very well on my computer.
7323	1	a	It is now allmost free,soon,soo im giveing this a like
7325	1	a	For 99p its a good deal, he maps are very big and open and everything looks pretty. Its difficult to keep track of players as they tend to die in two chomps, the sounds are repetitive and the voice commands are so cheesy they would be rated extra mature. Fun for multi player if you can have a laugh at some of the physics, its no Serious Sam and you get exactly what you pay for!
7327	1	a	nice game but the grapics kinda suck
7329	1	a	This game is so good i give it 9 360 no scopes out of ten. This game is better then call of duty.
7331	1	a	Lagged quite a bit when i started but when i put the graphics down it became great and quite a fun game.
7333	1	a	BEST GAME EVER GET IT
7335	1	a	dis game is good, had a rocky start with dino beatdown, but the developer has stuck with it and made it an actually good game, i had alot of fun playing this and its dirt cheap now, so there really is no excuse not to have this in your library!
7337	1	a	Dinosaurs. Jetpacks. Rocket launchers. Currently 0,75€. Totally worth it.
7339	1	a	I took what appeared to be a Future Tractor with a jet engine strapped to the back of it and proceeded to run over a line of 10 velociraptors, at which point I ran headfirst into a T-Rex which decided it was time to throw me and Future Tractor 300 meters through the air. Future Tractor didn't survive, but I somehow made it and then took my laser sword to some more dinosaurs.  10/10
7341	1	a	Great concept, lots of options, nice co-op, it's a keeper!
7343	1	a	play this game with friends... its way more fun that way... 8/10
7345	1	a	it is a video game 10/10
7347	1	a	Amazing amount of fun for the steam sale price, why did this game get only a 36 on MC?
7349	1	a	Killed T-Rex.  10/10 would save the Earth again.
7351	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. The physics engine is flawless. I was wrecking dinos left and right and then a T-Rex through a boulder at me. 10/10 would buy the 4 packs for friends.
1178	0	a	Probably one of the worst games ever made.
1179	0	a	I tried playing this game, but not even the slightest indication of how to play or what you are doing is given. 0 out of 5 stars.
7353	1	a	Decent game, good with friends
1180	0	a	I purchased this game when it was $1. I mean for a $1 game, this game is decent and actually you can say it's a good price for what you get, BUT at $15, the game is just not worth it. The gameplay is basically what it looks like, slaughtering dinosaurs wave after wave until you just win the game. The gameplay is super repetitive and gets very dull easily, I guess it's a little more fun when you play with friends but still, the gameplay is the same each time. Reading the positive reviews about ORION, I'd have to say this game must have been a lot worse without all the updates it has had. I enjoy the game and all, but I would not recommend it if there are no discounts. There is supposably a big update coming this month, but I will change my review then if my opinion has been altered.  The Pros: - Co-op, play with friends!  - Vehicles: Jeeps, Hovercrafts, Tanks, Robots, and more (Fun!) - Dinosaurs: T-Rexs, Stegosaurus, and some other fairly big ones - Just a LITTLE character customization included  The Cons: - The gist of the game, very dull - Repetitive gameplay - Limited class choices - Small array of guns to select from - Limited amount of players in servers - Limited enemy types, considering it's a dinosaur game, there are a very limited type of species. (All there is is regular raptors, pterodactyls, and the larger version of them, then the big dinos that are similar to bosses) - Limited map selection (Maps have sub selections which allow you to switch the game from day to night and vice versa, but... it's still the same map) - Limited game modes  - There is no real motive to the game, it's just for fun (If you don't include achievements)    
1181	0	a	Launched it 2 times. 2 crashes in a row. 10/10 Auto-delete.
7355	1	a	Possibly one of the best Survival Genre games i have ever played
7357	1	a	I bought this game for 99 cents. I thought it would completely suck. It turned out to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. Buy a 4 pack and give it to some friends. You won't regret it.
1183	0	a	Though fun, the game falls horribly short as the dinosaur. They feel unpowered, squishy, and mostly target practice. Where this is good playing as a human in survival or even in versus; It leaves much to be desired as the supposedly powerful beasts. As the smaller dino's, you're so soft that you can rarely take more than one quick shot. The larger ones seem so clumsy and slow that it's nearly impossible to hit the humans. It could really do with some rebalancing of the team/species-based combat. The solo play is fun, and playing humans v. humans is also enjoyable, if not reminescent of another scifi shooter. If you wanted to play this game simply to be a titan, squishing puny humans and eating them up, this is not for you. If you wanted a good online shooter where you can switch targets between walking fossils and other sacks of meat; then you've come to the right place.
7359	1	a	I would complain about the sometimes ugly effects I would complain about how much of the game seems to be copying aspects from Halo and borderlands I would complain about the upgrade icons in the store being super low-res  But who the ♥♥♥♥ complains about a game that costs 80 pence when NOT on sale.
7361	1	a	AWESOME but slow load speed and shooting reaction 
7363	1	a	need optimization
7365	1	a	First of all. some of the latest haters are a little bit stupid cause they didnt noticed (like some big magazines ) that THIS IS NOT THE GAME WITH THE DMCA PROBLEMS. Most of them played the game for only 0.5 hours. Orion prelude isnt a bad game and ORION (2016) also.  And something i also want to say:'Activision' always have problems with everything and everyone.  I played this game long enough to know that the most haters never played the game more than 10 minutes. This is my second positive review.
7367	1	a	Dinosaurs, space, vehicles etc. are all totally worth the price
1188	0	a	Very poorly made game. Logic is cringeworthy but it has it's moments. Would reccomend ONLY on cheap sales.
1189	0	a	Kinda ♥♥♥♥ but still dumb entertainment, recommended for the $0.99 price tag as opposed to the $14.99 price tag unless you are dumb enough to buy it at that price...
7369	1	a	This is the best game I have ever played.  Half-Life 4, forged in the greatest altar of the High Heavens, made from Gabe Newell's sweet, sweet, tears, could never compare.  Needless to say, this game gets me Tyrannosaurus-E-REKT.
7371	1	a	Rustalions always had a issue with 'The Dinos' this game helps teach my Rustalions warriors how to 'Deal' with them.
1190	0	a	NO, this game sucks, look at the old players from 1 year ago have to pay 6euro, now just 1 dollar, just not worth it, this game's developer should do something about it, because just changing the price over night ain't change the fact 1 year ago it was 10 euro!  Edit and add: the game became positive for some reason let me see what people see in the pros?  Pros: Memeing every possible way of killing a t-rex Memeing every possible way of bugging out Memeing every possible way of the potential nazi t-rex invasion  Cons that i see for myself: -Sluggish animation that is even worse than Ride to hell -Guns work like free FPS browser game -Dinosaur bugging the ♥♥♥♥ out of u if u are in a vehicle  1st the Aligator will bug out in the water with the rest of the dinosaur if u are in a jeep that face backward to them at the begining of the round 2nd T-rex are sometimes invisible  3rd Flying dinosaurs are the worst thing to kill cause they ♥♥♥♥ing bugging out at the top of the skybox 4th Helicopter is the worst maybe worse in some case as it cant shoot flying dinosaurs without flipping out 5th Tanks will fly  - Map design are too big , making an attempt for (open world) . And there is a mode called open world but it is just a bigger map with some random crate that have the same modes of other maps in various part of it
7373	1	a	There is a $wagzilla, nuff said.  11/10
7375	1	a	damm this game is just superb for 79 cents it´s worth it , if you buy it longside with friends and you play with them it´s a really funny game
7377	1	a	Best game ever played it for DAYS!! Thumbs up god work!!!!!!
7379	1	a	Not only is this game the best of it's time, but its mechanics and gameplay is remarkable. The fact that it tells me to press 'E' and it does absolutely nothing causing me to die is a game feature that itself is a deal breaker. And the fact that it's a PC exclusive and not optimized for PC makes me leave this an 11/10
7381	1	a	A very fun game, and only for 1$!!! 
7383	1	a	Laughed at friend buying this game thought it looked ♥♥♥♥. got given copy spent the next 2 hours epically fighting Trex's. A terex through a boulder at my face. 11/10 would take a boulder to the face again.
7385	1	a	Reminds me of Halo back when Halo was fun and had dinosaurs in it.
7387	1	a	The true CoD killer has arrived. For only $0.99 you can ♥♥♥♥ up coloured blobs that are vaguely reminscent of dinosaurs.  Beyond that this game will give you crazy dino-fighting instincts. No reptile will escape your righteous fury. A Geko was crawling across my roof the other day and I just point blank shot it down with my trusty m16 assault rifle. No mercy.   Buy Oreo: Prenoodle for your children and watch as they turn from mewling baby into a roaring dinosaur poacher who will bring about a level 5 extinction event before they are even in preschool.  16.7/10
7389	1	a	It was....a fun game with friends.
1191	0	a	Just no no stop looking at, yeah you dont even for a second think of buying this turn around and go buy something else this is not worth time, Download, Hard drive space, or anything. Trex mechs no noooooooooooooooooooooooo 
7391	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs with lightsabers
7393	1	a	Still debating if my $1.50 was really worth it or not. hilaribad
1192	0	a	The thing is about this game, it is poorly made, bad shooting mechanics, bad AI, driving vehicles handle worse than GTA IV, and the slow motion is annoying (but can be disabled upon further discovery). Orion: Dino Horde is the re-release of ORION: Dino Beatdown. Just a copy/paste of the game to get a new score on Metacritic, but still recieves its old score of 36. You can't really customize your character, that part is microtransactions. You want to be red? Too bad! Have pitch black instead. Trust me, it doesn't really look good either.  But, there is a few good things Fun co-op Hilarious ragdoll physics A great game to make fun of.  I only got the game because it is 1$, as this game isn't worth 15$ in my book.
7395	1	a	This game costs 79 cents. 79.Cents. It's worth it. If you want a few hours of fun with your friends, buy this. It has dinosaurs, an in-game shop,did i mention dinosaurs? It's fun.
7397	1	a	Sexy fun all day every day. I loved being ravished by big dinos.
1195	0	a	after watching the first trailer on store page, and read the 'comments' in this video i thought 'wow that must be really cool- so much positive comments - and wow they say its like killing floor and borderlands and turok. wooow'. but it was not.  after few seconds on title screen the backround music makes you puke. then startetd the game. ♥♥♥♥ graphic, ♥♥♥♥ sounds, ♥♥♥♥ viewmodels, no atmosphere. this game maybe good.....if you are 12 years old and we have the year 1997 and you re totally in halo or dinosaurs.
7399	1	a	'11/10 like League of Legends with guns' - Carlos Donger
7401	1	a	i say 50 50 and this is a RE releash to put it  This is just a name change and more updated game (just saying) it was called   But back to the point it is a fun good old game  i say it a good game you may love it i find it fun and enjoyable i mentioned the top so you would know but i find it more fun then Cod Ghosts to put it it has a lvling systems and 3 classes
1196	0	a	WARNING THIS IS JUST ME RANTING ABOUT HOW ♥♥♥♥ AND UNFINISHED THIS GAME IS.  The rant: This game is a cheaply made clone of halo trying to be original by throwing in some ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs. At first I was excited when I booted up the game and played for a few minutes, 'aww yeah this is fun' then it hit me these guns all feel like toy guns that shoot little plastic balls and feel really underwelming. so you are either shooting at enemy players that all look like a ridiculous version of Zero from borderlands 2 but with more LED lights glued to their suits or you are shooting some stupid as ♥♥♥♥ dinosaurs. It is full of bugs, glitches and this game should of at least been finished before they released it. Oh wait this is the finished product, let me just shove that £0.59 up my ♥♥♥. Oh and all the maps are big open planes with a few rocks and if you're lucky a puddle of ♥♥♥♥ing water.  The pros: This game would be okay if you were playing it with friends for less than 30 minutes before deciding to go back on PAYDAY 2 because all your friends you were playing with have killed themselves.  Thanks for reading, now im going to go play with my balls.
7403	1	a	You can kill dinosaurs. This fulfills my childhood Jurassic Park fantasies. 12/10
7405	1	a	I have wasted $0.68, now that the devs made this game free-to-play. For me, this game is good, i just play with bots, because i live in Asia, and there are like 5 servers on this game. 400 if not 500 ping on every server, do you expect me to play with that ping?  But overall, good game. DEVS made this game free for those who want to try.
1198	0	a	&gt;Last played February 21st 2014  As it should, and always will be.  I really have no idea what they added since then, but based on what other negative reviews have said, I don't think I have any other insightful comments to add, so I'll just a story if you want to read more.  I got this game in 2014, probably the 21st of february to be exact, all because someone I knew back then told me to get it to play with them. They really enjoyed playing this piece of tosh $1 arena dino shooter game at the time. Well I guess their taste in this game was indicative of them overall, garbage. The end.  Just play TF2, Dirty Bomb, any other F2P game besides this.
1199	0	a	Terrible Halo ripoff however it's still mildly fun for a couple of hours to play regardless of how bad it is.
1200	0	a	This Game is a Dinosaur.
7407	1	a	this is such a awsome game but i wish the performance for it would be better on my laptop :x -highly reconmmend dont worry about the meta score its false the developers are doing a awsome job adding new stuff to the game so far ; 0
1201	0	a	Since it got free to play for a few days I decided to give it a go. I'm not a real fan of shooter games but if they're interesting I play them. From the videos I thought I should give it a go.   After installing the game started and I was scurrying trough the options (I always do). Out of the blue I got my first achievement, yay! Anyways, after that I decide to 'Play Game' apparently you first have to FIND a game so I did that. However the room list doesn't update and it takes forever if you make one by yourself (because it doesn't update for anyone)...   So I went solo. I don't like solo. But hey I tried! Apparently the goal is to steal eggs and drop them off somewhere, while you keep shooting like a madman on the dinos. However the game wasn't very smooth for me so aiming was not an option, and you can't shoot while carrying eggs. I tried many, many times to do this game and when I finally put down the T-Rex, IT RESPAWNED. Yay! So you can't even really finish this game anyways because you get ♥♥♥-raped the whole time -.-  Sorry to say but, personally I absolutely hated it.
1202	0	a	I do not recommend this because it's a buggy, unfun mess.
7409	1	a	The Metacritic is misleading , the game got completly remade after the bad critics wave they eaten up with courage and now the game is combination beetween halo and a survival game with dino ! Simply awsome , the coop aspect is essential to keep being alive. 7/10 With more updates it will become epic , oh yeah and there an open world gamemode.
7411	1	a	ORION: Prelude has changed me forever. It has made me a different person.
7413	1	a	This is an awesome game I really like the idea of the game but its a bit overpriced :D Recommended if the price drops
7415	1	a	anything with dinosaurs and guns is AWESOME
1203	0	a	Worth the dollar to laugh at how utterly terrible it was, but only barely.
7417	1	a	Hell yes. This game is awesome. Reminds me of the wildly inventive mods of the early 2000s.
7419	1	a	Dinosaurs are destroying your generator! Are you a bad enough dude to kill them all?  Dinosaurs/10
7421	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.
7423	1	a	very fun game  i would recomend it to my friends
7425	1	a	In a lot of ways, this isn't a very good game. However, it's incredibly fun, and there's a lot of attention to detail.
7427	1	a	Shooting Dino's and ♥♥♥♥. Hell why not.
7429	1	a	A very awesome game i Love the whole Dino feel and hunting them down i rate this game 7/10
7431	1	a	Pretty fun party game
7433	1	a	Fighting against hordes of dinosaurs? How much better does it get?!
7435	1	a	Dinosaur genocide simulator with T-Rexes that do flips.
7437	1	a	halo + dinos = 8/10   Never pay full price for this game, buggs out too much. That being said really fun.
7439	1	a	Better cost to replay value than BF4
7441	1	a	Personally I don't like this game, just don't like it and I still want to recommend it anyway. L4D 2 is way better and I got it for free.  3/10
7443	1	a	Sold my AK-47 and m4a1-s on Cs go then purchased this game for 0.99$ Totally worth it.
7445	1	a	For the two hours i've played. I highly rated this game, considering it cost me a whole 4 dollars on sale for 4 copies. However, i just wish the multiplayers worked for me, as it seems to for my friends. I want to murder some dinosaurs :( I'm going to blame the game, but i should probably blame my ISP. Would buy again, if on sale for 99c.
1207	0	a	This game is so broken. I haven't experienced any actual bugs, but the Dinosaurs are so overpowered that all the gamemodes aren't even that fun. Survival is okay for a couple of hours, but it is the only DECENT gamemode. All the others are just boring, overused by most games, and if there are dinosaurs involved, considerably unbalanced. For this game to go on 93% to get some sales just shows the desperation of this producer...   I would give it a 4/10 at most, and that is being generous. This game is pretty much a waste of a dollar, so unless it is on sale that much, I highly recommend not getting
7447	1	a	  Sure, it might not be the greatest game ever and there are some funny ♥♥♥ glitches at times. And sure, maybe there are many FPS games that are funner to play. And sure, maybe one of the dinosaurs i ended up looking inside of.  But you know what, i enjoyed the wackiness of this game and plus the developers seem to have no problem admitting the faults of the game either! So yeah, you could say this game grew on me....a LOT. I would highly recommend buying it since it's so cheap, but if you can't buy it, than maybe you could get a friend to gift it to you like mine did.
7449	1	a	Very Good Game heavily suggest it... however get you connection ready for the amazing dino chaos; they swarmp you litrely it's... SOOO COOL!!! 9/10 (could improve on the paid customizations make a in-game monet system for to look awsome without spend too much money *not complaining on the prises*)
7451	1	a	Played one game of survival...................... WHY IS THIS GAME ONLY 49 CENTS TAKE MY MONEY TAKE ALL MY MONEY! I have only gotten a chance to play the survival mode and what I saw was well worth the 49 cents and then some, I loved watching the T-Rex tear my teammates to shreds..... 10/10 would let them get eaten again
7453	1	a	Oh look. A bunch of people jumping on a witch hunt and ruining someone's livleyhood based on activisions unprovable claims on a non-competing franchise.   Get real people -- errors have been corrected; hence why the game is back up for sale. The worst are the people changing overhelmingly positive reviews based on here-say like truly ignorant white knights.  If you want to go blast something go hate on the re-re-re-released version of the WarZ -- Shattered Skies. Those people deserve all the hate the world has to offer and more.
7455	1	a	  even though i tried this game for abut half an hour while it was free i love this game there are a lot of dinos and cool weapons and to make this even better this game is really cheap.   Definitely better than it was in 2012
7457	1	a	i actually bought a skin for my character in this game with my hard earned cash. immediately regretted it  10/10
7459	1	a	(Going to update this as time goes by, but just know that the dev does update the game to this day, and it's really good fun! I'd suggest the reason a lot of people don't like it, is that it's in a different gameplay style than they're used to. But seriously it's a 8/10 for me.)
7461	1	a	Picture a mix between starforge and killing floor, Ill be playing this for a long time
1208	0	a	Dinosour games should be like dinosours...extinct.  3/10  -Sїᾔṧ
7463	1	a	this is the best dinosour game ever creatide  
7465	1	a	great game and very cheap! I boght this for 24 cents :D 11/10 just buy this game :D
7467	1	a	This game is probably the best game on steam for 99 cents. It has really unique graphics, and stuff. However, there was one glaring problem-- I don't know if it's just for my computer but I keep on getting a connection lost message even though I can play CS:GO for 3 hours with no wifi errors, as far as I know. If you know what's going on, please reply.
7469	1	a	The game is ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. they only good thing about it is the hour i spent laughing at how ♥♥♥♥ it is
7471	1	a	Not ground-breaking, but not bad either. The devs have been really nice to the community, making continuous content updates and patches. It's fun to play with friends.
7473	1	a	This game is great grahpics may not be the best but content has lots of things in it definatly recommand this game its quite cheap too
7475	1	a	Imagine Killing Floor...BUT DINOSAURS AND JETPACKS!!!!!! 10/9  A T-Rex eated me and i deaded.  SO MANY LAUGHS with friends. Must get. Especially when it goes on sale for $0.99. Good dollar spent.
7477	1	a	This game is good for simulating human VS Dinosaur. The rampage mode allows you to be a dino and is fun. I highly reccomend the game
7479	1	a	Actually reason it lagged due to video settings my bad turn them down if you don't have a very good pc.
7481	1	a	This game's change soo much! Multiplayer with your friends is a blast. Killing the dinos is always soo satisfying!
7483	1	a	I have had so much fun with this game. I bought it as a joke to my friends and me to laugh off but its kinda hard when its acutally a good game :I  Its really entertaining, and seriously, where would you go if you wanted to shoot a dinosaur in the face with a shotgun while flying over it with your jetpack?!  Can only recommend this game.
7485	1	a	This game is so horrible, it's awesome. The perfect choice of game to get bevved up with your mates and just screw around playing a game together. I would suggest waiting for the game to go on sale before picking it up though (Which it does frequiently enough) It's harmless fun of eating your friends as a dino and they try to shoot you in the foot.
1211	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
7487	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
7489	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
7491	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
1213	0	a	- create a public room - a friend join - start game - wait for the 1st wave to start - wave start attacking - shoot at dinosaurs - client crash (2/2)  E5, NVIDIA 1060 6G,  This issue needs fixing before I can re-try this title and write more of my experience. Currently not recommend.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  I wanted to give this game another try, so I launched it on another PC with different hardware specification. This time it worked. So the above issue is only about hardware compatibility. However, now I encountered another issue:  - create a solo survival mode room and start gameplay - fight and capture the side objective point - mount a battle vehicle and continue to fight - a Triceratops appear - drive the car toward the dino and hit it - car get tossed over  Found: the view angle auto-switch to 1st person. I'm still inside the car. whatever button I press, like 'w' to move forward, the game mysteriously paused. the only way to walk around is by pressing Space button. But once press other buttons again, the game will enter pause state again. A dead cycle. Have to reboot the client. So appart from the gameplay itself, I still can't recommend this title on current stage.
7493	1	a	10/10 I saved a dudes life by quickscoping a Pterodactyl. Then I turned around at lightening speed and quickscoped a baby Velociraptor 300 feet away. This game is awesome!
7495	1	a	play this game if you bored with survive from zombies
7497	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
1219	0	a	Do not buy this game. I bought it when it was under a different name which was Orion Dino Beatdown that game was a buggy mess and so is Orion Dino Horde DO NOT be fooled by it's new name it is still the same piece of trash when it was first released. This game has a small community if you can call it that and the servers are dead the peak is about 60-80 players. The guns feel like cheap knock off BB guns and the AI is just bad then combine that with the dinosaurs getting stuck in objects such as buildings, rocks and mountains that sort of thing. This is by far one of the worst games I have had the horrible misfortune of playing sure the devs seem to be making a vague attempt to make it playable but with it's dead servers and bad gameplay with a dash of microtransactions make this game a slap in the face to the gaming community and hard working devs who produce top quality games. Do not support this product at all.
1220	0	a	When you paid to get f2play game that feeling is priceless...
1221	0	a	To be fair, the games not too bad. But thats it, its average AT BEST. Sadly its not horridly broken which wouldve honestly made it more enjoyable as sometimes glichy randome events are fun but thats not the case. I only gave it a negative review becasue i spent like $0.40 on a 4 pack of codes, which are now completely worthless. Thanks Spiral Games.
1222	0	a	...
1223	0	a	Im kinda angry that this went Free, but Im also not surprised. It feels like baby's first gaming project and a lot of the stuff in it just feels absolutely atrocious.  Good for drunken nights of fun with friends but just a mess of a game, I cant reccommend it.
7499	1	a	I got this game for a dollar. Definetly worth it.
7501	1	a	i ate chilli last night so i can take a ♥♥♥♥ that is better than this game 
7503	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
7505	1	a	Best piece of plagarised content you'll ever regret spending 50 cents on!
1225	0	a	♥♥♥♥ tier game, how do you ♥♥♥♥ up dinosaurs 0/10 would rather fist my own ♥♥♥
1226	0	a	NO DAD I DONT WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF
1227	0	a	I tried this game on a free week. It always attracted me because of the nice screenshots and the coop mode, but because of the previous failure from this developer, I always retained myself from purchasing it. I'm also an indie lover, and I can bear with bugs and underdevelopment if the game is actually good and fun, and this one looked like one such case from the conflicting comments of the players.  The reality is this game is not actually fun, but funny. I laughed so much when I played it, because if you can do anything wrong when making a game, you'll find it here. Even the graphics, that looked like the only thing that was made good, looks so weird because of the bad animations (or lack of in some case).  The gameplay is a lagfest, even with a low ping, and amazingly it also affects animations, that will lag aswell, making it look like an old cartoon, when animations were made with just 3 drawings repeated forever.  Nothing is fun here. The shooting, the driving, the walking around for miles to catch up with teammates, the lag, the animations, the gameplay.  Seriously, this game has potential, but looks like a v0.2 of an ongoing free project made by an amateur team. And, for now, even at 91% off for 0.99 euro is not worth the time spent purchasing, downloading, configuring and playing it.  Go buy a bundle with those money. The worst it could happen is you'll get five bad games instead of just one.
1228	0	a	This game is trash the controlls are ♥♥♥♥ and the combat is teribad. Humans are favored in this game with more then one attack, unlike a dino. this is by far the worst dino game ever. Prepare to die and lose everytime if your a Dino.
7507	1	a	In other games do you run into people with vehicles and think 'man I wish that was a dinosaur' If so orion dino hoard is for you.' Do you think 'man if I could only hit a tyrannosaurus in the face with a laser sword yelling 'Boink' everytime you hit them? If so Orion Dino Hoard is for you. If you never want to know why in the heck dinosaurs friggin love power generators soo much, then Orion Dino Hoard is for you.  
7509	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
7511	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
7513	1	a	I regretted not buying this when it's on sale. Who wouldn't want to fight dinosaurs?
1230	0	a	I bought this games and its F2P now? Do i get a free in game bonus?
7515	1	a	Reasons to play! 1. Super fun  2. Completely free!  3. Supportive and open developer  4. Character progression and customization 5. Different classes for different play-styles and class roles 6. Dinosaurs (Duh!) 7. Jetpacks, mechs, helicopters, tanks, hovercraft, jeeps etc. 8. Lasers Swords and good sword play! 9. PvP and coop, and PVPVE too (players protect bases in teams and can sick dinosaurs on other teams) and gamemodes where you can be the dinos too 10. You can surf on the hood of your buddies jeep/hovercraft/tank/helicopter  Reasons to not play :[ 1. You hate fun?
1231	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1232	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
1233	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
7517	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
7519	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
7521	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
7523	1	a	This is a good game. Maybe even great. It sure isn't the best game in the world, but it's certainly worth playing.   I don't care about what this game was called before or any negatie reviews. I sure as hell don't care about Activision going after the other ORION game. This is not that game.  Picked this game up on a sale for 50 cents. Haven't tried the PvP modes, but right now I've sunk about 30 hours into the PvE wave mode. Sure the bots are absolutely terrible, the graphics aren't at Crytek levels, and it gets fairly repetitive, but I've enjoyed all 30 hours. The survival mode is fairly simple: defend a generator for three waves, move to capture an outpost somewhere on the map, repeat twice, then finish with a final tenth wave. The waves of small enemies, ground and airborne, are accompanied by a few very large, very strong dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurs and Stegosaurs. The game can be very challenging or very easy depending on the settings. A personal favorite of mine is to turn the dino health down and spawn rate up to dramatically increase the size of the wave.   Recomending a game is all about the value-proposition. Do you get a sufficient amount of enjoyment for what you pay? I payed 50 cents for currently 30 hours of game. That's a 60 hour per value ratio. 60 hours per dollar is equivalent to 3600 hours in your standard $60 AAA game. Very few people spend 360 hours on a game, much less 3600. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Even if I don't play another hour of this game, the value of my 50 cents is apparent.
7525	1	a	Got given as a gift but would pay full price for game- really suprised me.
7527	1	a	Definetly a good co-op game for 99 cents
7529	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
7531	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
1234	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
7533	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
7535	1	a	Good game, couple of bugs, but you can get used to live along with it, great gameplay
7537	1	a	Great Game! So worth the one dollar. It does crash often though.
7539	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
7541	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs

7545	1	a	More fun than porridge. Also dinosaurs.
7547	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
7549	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
7551	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
7553	1	a	The T-rexs throw rocks better than a MLB super star pitcher.
7555	1	a	it's like blood n bacon but with dinosaurs!
1240	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE ♥♥♥♥
7557	1	a	This game is awesome and worth more then its price i recommend this game for evreyone who want an amazing cheap game. best 99 cents i ever spend, 10.5/10
7559	1	a	Played one match, meh. good for a dollar I guess.
7561	1	a	This game is brilliant! it's tons of fun! me and a few friends just got it for the hell of it to have a go and oh my god! it's one of the best games i've played it's addicting looks nice and funny as hell!  Trust me grab a few friends and try it out!  Don't let me play time say otherwise!
7563	1	a	Not even gonna bother reviewing it. 80 cents for this game is great. You got dinos and guns and pew pew pew and stuff. Just buy it.
7565	1	a	Nice game

7581	1	a	It's a good game .
7583	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
7585	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
7587	1	a	Love this game &lt;3 i even thought it was awesome when it first was realesed
7589	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
1253	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
7591	1	a	Very addictive.
7593	1	a	Dinosaur halo for $1? Why the hell not. Fun game, still a little rough around the edges though.
1258	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
1259	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
7595	1	a	Everyone! You must get this game! This game is sooo good. They lowered it to .99 so that everyone could get it!
7597	1	a	Killing Dinosaurs,in one moment scary and adrenaline rush. Great MP Worth Price 9.9/10
7599	1	a	I bought this game for two of my friends and I.  Now all three of us hate me.
7601	1	a	Rather than review the game, I'd like to point out a few things about it.  1. What's new and groundbreaking? Nothing. What's fun? Everything. What's a ripoff? MAYBE some of the aesthetic items from the in-game store, but they don't change the game at all.  2. Remember the days of Blockbuster? Pay five dollars and you can try a game for one week. If you don't like it, you're out five dollars and you have to give it back anyway. Well for 20% of that ($1) you can try this game, and believe me when I say it's worth trying. If you don't want to spend that dollar, just sell some of the trading cards you picked up from other games.  3. If you get only four hours of fun out of this game, it's a victory. That's $.25 per hour of fun. To get that same value from a AAA title you need to have 240 hours of fun. Be honest, did you play CoD: Ghosts for 240 hours and enjoy it the whole time?
7603	1	a	I do recommend this (as many problems of the past have been fixed) to people who like survivalist style games like: Killing Floor Serious Sam  Its a fun game if you can get it $15 or less. The idea is certainly very solid. The only problem is, dont take the game too hardcore or serious, because there is NO balance whatsoever. Any big dino can one-shot your tank which you probably just spent an hour trying to afford.  Best way to enjoy: Get a group of friends, play Co-Op in the Survival style gamemodes, play casually for fun because there is fun to be had here.  Tips: *Land Vehicles suck, youre actually 10x more powerful on your feet.  *Do not play PvP game-modes, too many cheaters, too little done about it.  Graphics: 7/10 Some lighting issues but its acceptable. The weather adds real conditions to your situation. Cant help but feel like im playign Command and Conquer Renegade when im flying and looking at the bases. Sound: 4/10 Generic stuff really, music isnt all the good and the voice actors are your racist stereotypes. The sounds let down the game a little. Gameplay: 8/10 Lots of FUN to have, just dont take it too seriously aight? :) think non-competetively. Go shoot stuff!  Overall 6.5/10 - Great Potential, but its not quite there yet. Besides some polish, the game needs a greater feel of direction.
7605	1	a	orion: dino horde is like the steve urkle of steam games. 8/10
7607	1	a	I was triggered by the unrelistic dinosaur physics simulations. But it does have jetpacks.  5/10 Heavily somewhat kindof recommended.
7609	1	a	Bought this game for about 50 cents, and although its a little glitchy its just a fantastic game. For the money, its definately worth it.
7611	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
7613	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1268	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1269	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
1270	0	a	Ill note good and bad things with + and - +i got it cheap +trading cards -stupid AI -bugged guns -bugged animations -laggy commands the list can go on overall DONT buy it
7615	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
1271	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?
7617	1	a	Muahaha.. its free to play this game now!!   i got this 2 months ago, then refunded it 'cos the game wasnt played nicely on my pc. Multiple crashes in the game, laggy in some parts.  Should just lower the price to .10 cents so those trading cards will still get drop.
7619	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
7621	1	a	the computer that i play on is not very good and the internet is worse so i had to turn down most of the settinng and even then the game lagged so its not ment for my computer but still for the price and the ammout of content its pretty goodd
1277	0	a	it sucks 
7623	1	a	With this new update i am shocked with what i am playing. doesnt even feel like dino horde, it feels like a brand new game and i fell in love with it all over again. i liked it b4 and now i like it even more. great game to play with friend :D
7625	1	a	This game is the best. GOTY 2014  In all honesty this game is fun. A good time killer fun with friends.
7627	1	a	A game very hard, really worth it to try it. 10/10.
7629	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
7631	1	a	its a good classic
1284	0	a	A great concept with poor fit and finish, Dino Horde/Prelude has come a long way but has farther to go before securing a lasting place on my hard drive. Score 6.0
1285	0	a	This game is like the last guy to be killed by Kony before everyone stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ about him. Forgotten....
7633	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced. The dinosaurs were photorealistic, but I guess you would expect that from a top quality studio like ummm... whoever makes this bloody game. 10/10 very good. btw i love the jurassic park movies if anyone has a spare copy of jurassic park 1 id be happy and id probably blow you. Lots of love Adolf Linkin.
1286	0	a	It says that I own this game so I am reviewing it. It is not a good game. I have not played the game, but I have read what people are saying about the game. They don't like it. Plus, how good can a game be if it was released for $15 but now is routinely sold for $1?  I also think that the developers may hate dinosaurs. Don't support saurian prejudice.
1287	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
1288	0	a	i played this when it was free, and basically it's alright, if it were 15 years ago. sadly, it's not, and this 'game' can't hold up to today's standards, not even to indie standards. what fun is coop if the ai ain't good, the guns ain't satisfying to use, and the game is repetitive all round?

1289	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
1290	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
1291	0	a	its a dollar. still plays like ♥♥♥ though. why do i have hours into this? thats a good question.
7637	1	a	Never Played a better game. I love it I wish that everyone could experience what i have experienced.

1298	0	a	About as fun as masterbating with sand paper.
1299	0	a	Runs poorly for the size of the maps and the graphics.
1300	0	a	While the game might well be worth the dollar price it dropped down to, I cannot recommend the game simply because of the actions of the developer. The game was buggy, simplistic, and took a few tries to get to work, but was an amusing dino horde game. I'd be the first in line to recommend it for a few bucks.  However the name has been changed twice in an effort to throw off previous negative reviews, and I've heard numerous stories of saying the developer didn't propperly compesate his employees. If you don't care and just want a cheap dino horde game, this might be for you. Personaly I'll wait till the next one comes along.
7639	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
1301	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but ♥♥♥♥, it was only 49 cents!
7641	1	a	Its good.
7643	1	a	I liked the mechanics, the waves, the round stores and all that jazz that came along with this game. I'd have to say that it was worth a dollar. Although 'Guardians of Orion' has left a dark mark on my the developer's history. I still appreciate the small price and content of this game.
7645	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
7647	1	a	Dinosaur heads that run around, pirate dinosaurs, soldiers riding dinosaurs and idiots, your teammates who will better camp on a rock than revive you. 10/10 would die again.
7649	1	a	Good Game, you can play dinos or humen.
1307	0	a	This game is ok it has a few bugs and it is just dead its fun to play with friends but if you want to play online, theres just no point.   I woud rate it 5/10
1308	0	a	This game needs to make it's mind up weather it's a free 2 play, or a payed game.
7651	1	a	A great game . Very addictive . Would get chomped by TREX again 10/10
7653	1	a	One heck of a game if you start playing it ,hard to stop. Cuz so much fun ^^
7655	1	a	It's enjoyable, and better than most FPS I've seen on the PC. They allow a large amount of room when it comes to how you want to play and develop your character depending on the group you are with. Of course if you keep playing the same people you will eventually develop a routine and some amazing synergy with your fellow hunters.
1309	0	a	Basic wave survival and was not worth the money (even your spare change). Try it if you want to get some trading cards or to pad out your Steam library.
1310	0	a	This game is literally cancer, whatever you do... don't even consider buying it! It first wants you to pay for it, and then pay for in game currency, just after you bought the game. Worst... P2W... game... ever!  Edit: they changed the name... again!
1311	0	a	Awful game, waste of 99p
7657	1	a	Negative review about a game for 0.79€ should be a crime ...
1319	0	a	Avoid this game. Broken beyond repair and it's just no fun this way. Had some hopes for this game as a fun survivor shooter, but broken mechanics, overwhelming amount of bugs make this game unplayable
7659	1	a	Wow. Just wow. before i was saying this game is bad because it was having a lot of bugs and glitches. Now with the new update its the best game EU and the cheapest game and awesome i really do recommend this game.  Gameplay 8/10 A.I 9/10 Graphics 7.5/10 Soundtrack 8/10 Multiplayer 5/10 (Because it does not show a lot of players and servers)
1321	0	a	Lol besides the fact that they changed the games name...Its a pretty bad game
1322	0	a	This game is garbage. The devs are shady scumbags that have changed the name of the game twice to dodge bad Metacritic reviews. Look up Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dinohorde. Those two games, and this one, are all the same. Their other game, Project Orion, was taken off steam because of a valid DMCA by Activision where these devs blatantly stole assets from Black Ops 3. And now they are trying to bleed more money out of gullible steam users by having an indiegogo campaign that was allegedly to let them fight Activision in court, but has now been changed to claim its to make up for damages Activision has caused them. Don't fall for their lies. This game is garbage. Project Orion, or whatever they decide to change its name to, is garbage. Don't give these people any money.
1323	0	a	What could have been an awesome game is ruined by bad performance and even worse FPS mechanics. It just isn't fun.  Verdict: PASS
7661	1	a	OMG what awesome fun this is just get it
1326	0	a	'we will not be pursuing legal action...'  ...because we would lose so fast our heads would spin.   ♥♥♥♥ DEVs that steals assests, lies about it, gets caught lying, then gets all defensive and self righteous when the whole communbity turns his 'evidence' upside down on his ♥♥♥♥ filled head.  for the record, those photos which 'prove' he didnt steal assests have been pretty much proven to be lies as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of better non biased photos showing clear copying have surfaced.  for the record, I think Activision are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s too, but at least they put the ♥♥♥♥ on a nice silver platter for you to see before you eat it. and they don't rerelease the SAME game under different titles to try to cover up negative reviews...this is now the 3rd or 4th name change since 2012.  oh, the game you ask?  .... it sucks.   it has and pretty much always will regardless of all the stolen COD/starwars/other assets.   (keep in mind I paid 10 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for this garbage back in EA) *(working on refund for Gaming's sake)* deleting it regardless to make my own point if it fails.  gonna go play a GOOD game, like ARK.
1327	0	a	Literally an atrocity.
1328	0	a	Orion: Dino Hoard is an extremely bad game. I also think it's pretty cheesy. It's just a wave defense game featuring dinosaurs with bad servers and a dead community.  Bad gameplay, bad online multiplayer, bad story (it's non-existent), bad production value, bad developers, bad time.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  **Do not buy Orion: Dino Horde!!!!!**  And this ignoring the fiasco of how bad it was when it was Orion: Dino Beatdown and then having the developers change the name to get rid of the negative stigma (and reviews) surrounding the original game - this is a review of the current game on the market! It's terrible.  Don't take my word for it though:  Reviews:  Impulse Gamer - 4.5 / 10 - 'Dino Horde is not the improvement Dino Beatdown needed...it never feels like a finished product...this goes deeper than just a lack of polish...rudderless.'  NZ Gamer - 3.0 / 10 - 'Shoot in the back of the head and bury it. Awful. Dino Horde is easily one of the worst games I've ever played. Unplayable. Abomination. Broken.'  Gamespy - 1.5 / 5 - 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs in the same game? How could this possibly fail?...the same way as if Jurassic Park had used sockpuppets for the dinosaurs and someone had accidentally set fire to the final reel mid-way through the premiere.'  IGN - 2 / 10 - 'Painful. You probably deserve a beatdown if you waste your money on this disaster.'  I cannot recommend this game in any way, shape, or form - it's not even a worthwhile gag gift for a friend. Don't even buy it for your mortal enemies as the developers are shady. ORION Dino Horde is a stain on my Steam Library and if I could remove it I would. It is easily the worst game in recent memory that I've EVER played and I have no problem giving it an F
1329	0	a	a whopping 0 playerbase. not even worth a single dollar.   10/10 main menu simulator
1330	0	a	Wish steam refunds existed when I paid 14.99$ for this pile of garbage. Might be worth it at 99 cents but not at what I paid. I'd say the only real selling point of this game is that it has dinosaurs.
1331	0	a	This is the worst game ever created all things considered. If a free Android game is bad, you don't really care because your expectations were so low to begin with. When a Dino game is this bad, it can be considered to be near the top of the list of worst games of all time. With the budget and the supposed good reviews this game received, David Prassel should be sued with a major class action lawsuit of everyone conned into buying this game. The graphics are terrible, the dinos were mindless, and the multiplayer is idiotic. There is no strategy, the maps are way too open and large for nerds to play. With the jetpacks your game becomes broken as ♥♥♥♥♥.  9.9/10 ~ IGN legit reviewer
1332	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
1333	0	a	Just an awful, awful game. Even at the cost of a Euro the price is too steep.
1334	0	a	This game was completely broken at release months later it was just as bad.. hoorible rip off steam should hide thier face in shame for even selling it and not refunding peoples money
1335	0	a	It's like Left 4 Dead but with slightly more advanced weapons and Dinosaurs. Oh and vehicles. Oh and there's no map that you progress through, in Orion it's more of just defending a generator (which for whatever reason these Dinosaurs have a vendetta against) and occasionally running away to capture some point that has no relevance to anything. You also get an in game currency for killing the dinosaurs which you spend on other weapons, which are quite expensive. There's a microtransaction shop as well in the game which is a huge turn off even if it is a very cheep game. Third person animations are ridiculously stiff. Also what's with this misleading 'Work together to survive the devastating Dinosaur horde in huge, endless environments.' on your store page? Is it huge or is it endless? It's neither. How can you legally just throw words like that around when it's completely untrue? 3/10, Dinosaur poop.
1336	0	a	 Worst Game Ever!  [static2.wikia.nocookie.net]  
1337	0	a	♥♥♥♥ i buy this game before now it's free
7663	1	a	I paid a $1 Can't Complain
7665	1	a	It's pretty good
1350	0	a	This game has some very nice maps though some of the things are too spread out....very nice objectives....and some not too bad models for things. Even the controls are not too bad....  The problems though.....wow....alot of them...going to slowly go down the list here.  Like int he game 'Killing Floor' the enemies simply go in straight lines try to get to things....like for example if you are playing the protect the genrator....they will go to the generator...no matter what like a homiing missile....only good thing is that the developers ont his game improved the engine a little bit...so unlike killing floor the enemies dont ignore up down physics.  If a player gets in a certain radius of any dinosaur....they become the next magnet...all enemies ignor everything else and go after that one player. The only time they lose interest is when the player goes into fight for their life mode.  Weapons....i dont know...they seam sub par.....they do barely any damage.....i was one shot killing by using the standard melee attack and because the AI was so bad.....i just had to stand in one spot....let the line of enemies come at me while i punched them all....didnt take much skill.  Grenades seamed to not work much at all and the grenades and my own gun fire seamed to be able to destroy the generator more then it could the enemies....and when i say grenades didnt work much...out of 20 being thrown, only 3 seamed to detonate...kind of annoying.  Another issue aside from the magnet enemy AI and poor performance weapons...my character always seamed super fragile...and my powers seamed kind of pathetic....like the assualt guy gets a jet pack....which is sort of neat yet any form of fall and you take massive damage....in real life i can jump of a 1 story building no problem...in this game such an act gets me badly hurt....yes i am inthe future with advanced armor and unable to survive very well...the irony does not escape me. The recon character class gets a very short sub-par cloak field....as in everything sees through it.....but then with the way the game auto tracks to you well guess thats just how it is.  Now when you die...you do get a fight for your life....which made me laugh alot....because as soon as you get to that state the dinosaurs ignore you and run off....and weirdly enough your weapons start doing even less damage. I had to melee 3 times instead of 1 time to kill things....that actualy made me laugh on the bad mechanic.  The game mode i played had a genrator i had to defend ala like a tower defense....waves of enemies would hsow up to assault that generator from all over. Each wave made enemies stronger and also would introduce new enemies. Between each wave i was given 60 seconds to spend cash i had recieved for killing enemies.  Ok first off the generators are always far away from the resupply points...you take 20 seconds to get to the those points even while sprinting....bad machanic....they should have made it so you can buy what what you want then maybe activate the generator to start the next wave....but no...the made a stupid way of doing it....ala like killing floor.  now each wave shows how many dinosaurs you have left to kill....these are shown with markers over them.....unfortunately anothe rbug makes more enmies appear inthe game who will randomly appear right be hind you or somewhere else and attack you.....again a flash back of killing floor and its poor game system.  Those random not needed to be killed enemies will appear right behind you...no matter where you are...inthe air...on a cliff....back to a wall.....suddenly you are getting hit....you turn around and see a dinosaur is on top of you and the wall and attacking only you.  I dont like games where they suddenly appear like that....with no defense....doesnt make this exciting...just makes it stupid.  Purchase of weapons requires alot of cash to get them...you wont be able to buy the next pistol untillyou have killed 10 enemies....you cant even by a rifle until you kill 30 of them.  My total time playing was maybe 10 or 15 minutes....why so little time to pass judgement....my game library on steam and raptr, and xbox live, and u-store...and a plethora of places speaks for it self.  I am biased...becasues i have played really good games and played really aweful ones...and this one although its not the worst....its still bottom of the barrel....i am surprised the meta-critic score is not lower. Persoanly i would rate this a 10 or 9 out of 100.  In my opinion the develoeprs failed bad onthe AI and the spawn on top of players mechanic. They failed on the run to the store to buy new stuff in 60 seconds mechanic...and they failed onthe cloak mechanic whihc doesnt seam to work.  Multiplayer death match following these mechanics simply will make the matches un balanced and no point to play...as it will follow the system the winner will get cash to buy new slughtering devices to kill faster and better while a person who is unlucky and loses to much will be left far behind.  I dont recommend this game to anyone in its present state....the being on sale for a dollar....well not sure if its worth the trouble to get it.   Pictures onthe site do a great job of showing its art work...game play though is not getting shown at all...they show movies....but no real game play...and the reason is becasue its not too good at all,
1351	0	a	needs to be optimized for amd graphic cards
1352	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
1353	0	a	Beware this game is not for everyone.  I give it 6/10 and here's a few interesting things about it.  The game feels like a Halo 1 mod. The locations, the power armor, the weapons, most of it's design choices. You could pretend you where playing master chief and you'd feel somewhat at home.  There's a reason for this beyond the art style. It's because many of it's game resources where lifted or “stolen from Halo 1. I've played Halo 1 for 5 years give or take and I've really got to know the game, it's physics, it's weapons, maps, everything.   Playing Orion: Prelude I saw a warhog, then I saw the exact same animation when you get off the turret. Then I saw animations from using the melee button from guns. You also realize for a new game it sure looks like it came out in 2001 same as Halo 1.   I had no idea this game was a kickstarter, and it's a perfect example why I've never supported a kickstarter and probably never will. (including paid Early Access).   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/orionprelude/orion-prelude/description   The number of things they say in the Kickstarter and it ends up just all being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even the in game shots look nothing like this game when you play it. Just watch the video and then compare it to screen shots and videos of the actual game. They promise things like a deep lore, etc. I'm sorry this is just a Horde mode game, and a easy one at that.  The game itself is lots of mindless fun, but so many other games do everything this one does better. There is no sense of challenge, you can easily go on a mountain and shoot all the dinosaurs out of range. You have many weapons and augmentations you can buy to make turn this game into Very easy mode even on medium settings. I can't say for the higher settings.  The game does lack polish. Things like getting stuck in graphics, warping dinosaurs, unpolished animations, etc. When I said it feels like it's a Halo 1 Mod, it sure does due to it's unfinished quality.   The creators are already on their sequel so I wouldn't expect this one to be polished, they probably learn that from EA games.   In itself the game can be lots of mindless fun, but don't expect anything amazing, just like a cheap mod, it's fun to try out, but rarely better then the original.  A few annoyances;  One thing I'd like to point out, you know how in Halo 1 the sniper rifle leaves a white trail, well in this all the bigger guns seem to, so after a while you only see cloud lines and not your target so well. Then you got rain on your screen, you know the dripping water, I was never a fan of this. And in this game it's constant. There are a number of things that make it harder to see your targets but it's mostly just annoying and pointless. Especially then it's raining on your screen in third person view.   I bought this game for 1$, I would be willing to pay up to 2$ but no more. If you want a good horde mode game I'd say Killing Floor tops this hands down.   This is the type of game you have fun messing around and shooting easy targets, but you'd probably never recommend it as anything worth wile. Not ♥♥♥♥, but not great.  
1354	0	a	I used to play it with my bro but now the addded an update which for us ruined our fun i loved how you could be the dinosuar but now its not the same,thank you
1355	0	a	Incredibly underdeveloped, Incredibly broken, Incredibly boring. Stay away from this.
7667	1	a	I'm almost ashamed to say that this game is stupidly awesome. It's HALO crossed with Jurassic Park. Co-op play is really fun.  Dozens of weapons, ability upgrades, maps. Lots of game modes including PvE, PvP, PvPvE. You can even play as a dinosaur and eat your friends. Custom (Prehistoric) difficulty is where it's at. There are vehicles, explosions, jetpacks and much, much more.  The persistent leveling system unlocks permanent bonuses; if you ever get the itch to feel like a complete badass, this game is for you.  The best $1 you will ever spend. Just do it.
7669	1	a	The idea behind the game is awesome! The game itself ... not so much... Support the KickStarter they are bringing up i think on the 27th i have high hopes for this company and expect them to do well!   But this is what i think of Dino Horde  Buy while its onsale for 1$!! Not for 15$! Why?  The game is poorly optimized for one, the crosshairs on weapons are the same color as the winter enviroment so it's difficult to even aim at anything unless you are using something you can hip fire with the PvP is bad because any sort of lag just is killer lag is handeled very poorly. The 'Open' World map they released theres no sense of freedom in it all it is, is a bigger survival map with nothing to do between points i did run in to a t-rex once out side of a point that was fun but out of every other time i played i never once ran in to any real engaging fights.
1367	0	a	I might change my opinion, but for now, my review is short and to the point - like my play expirence. It SEEMS like a really good game, and soloing with bots it feels like it would be fun with a group, but joining a server is impossible because of the numberous issues that come up.  Yes, yes - I know the forums list solutions, but there are a zillion to try and they are insanely involved - more so than one should expect to go through for any 'finished' game. This feels like a buggy alpha, not a full release.
1368	0	a	Did not like it, felt horrible and bulky to play, UI is horrible, idk how there are so many good reviews?! Lack of server hosting, customisations is minute to nothing, would not play again, did not enjoy  3/10
1369	0	a	The game has horrible optimization and it crashes all the time.
1370	0	a	What do you get when you release a buggy game, with stolen art assets that are slightly modified, glitched sound files, and gameplay that randomly restarts? Orion: Dinobeatdown.   What do you do when the community rages at you for it, do you:  A: Create new art assets completely from scratch. B: Smash the bugs as quickly as possible. C: All of the above or D: Rename it something else, add another game mode, and don't do anything else?  Well, these folks went with choice D.  D, For Don't Buy. Not Dinosaur.
1371	0	a	This is a Terrible UT mod. Ideas stolen from other good game out there. Changed, and made bad. Really awful animations and poor game play with extensive maps that are really boring to get around.   It sounds cool by premise, but honestly, this game sucks hard. Avoid it!
1372	0	a	Don't buy it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on almost every level, and no where to be worth $8.99.  Bggest issues are sound cutting out, constant crashing, horrible and ugly UI, dumb AI, god awful animations for everything.. etc. Another reason not to buy is because the guy who created it is a crook.  That is all I have to say.
1373	0	a	MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE A JOKE  I am at least double the requirements of this game and cannot play at anything but 1fps on the lowest settings!! Fix this game and I will change my review 
7671	1	a	Very interesting 1 euro game. The game is nice but the achievements are boring... too booring.
1374	0	a	Awful textures from 1998, hideous color schemes, poor draw distance, ugly menus, the worst sound design and weakest musical score you will ever hear in a game. Ever. This game is bad and a major waste of your money.
1375	0	a	  Cool game but i dont play it very often.
1376	0	a	Even at a dollar this 'game' isn't worth it. Developers are shady, gameplay is ancient. Level design is a joke. Nothing is intuitive. This company deserves no support what so ever. They even turned off comments on their facebook. i want a refund.
7673	1	a	Honestly the best 50 cent game I think exists. Literally paid for itself from all the laughter and fun between my friends and I.   9/10, worth it.
7675	1	a	Im not a graphics guy so I dont care but, the graphics were meh.  But besides it being rushed, and not really telling you what to do, its a fun game!
1377	0	a	this game is absolutely terrible. i bought a 4 pack when it first came out. (at full price) they its had its name changed twice since then. terrible terrible game. dont believe my hours played either. the game didnt close and kept running in the background. save youself some money and shoot yourself in the leg for the same experience.
1378	0	a	waste of time and money.
1379	0	a	its badly designed,not very good looking, not very fun and not even worth 99 cent, and the metacritic score is misleading it should be under 20 percent 1.5/10
7677	1	a	  Worth a dolla if u like killing hundreds of dinos + want trading cards and achievements! Fun to play with ur buddies
7679	1	a	This game... if it can even be called that... is   clearly   the most awe-inspiring and story driven interactive experience to date. This trumps almost every form of entertainment I have ever experienced. It outright blows other games, and even movie and television mediums, out of the water with its sheer impressiveness.   Truly a masterpiece  . It is outrageous to think that one could recieve the right impression of ORION: Prelude just through words upon a screen, or any other known method. Nothing can capture it's raw beauty and power, which still keeps me awake at night wondering what all the other asshat game developers are doing so very wrong. This experience can only be compared to the wonder of birth itself. ORION: Prelude has given me new eyes with which to see the vast, empty existence we call life. It has allowed me to percieve more than you or I could ever imagine.   I have now seen the face of god,   and he wept at the absolute majesty of what can really only be the end and beginning of a new age. He has rightfully submitted himself, as this creation of mortal men has towered above everything God himself has done. ORION: Prelude has begun humanity upon a path to beautiful absolution. I can not rest. Not until every soul of this wretched sepulcher we call Earth has been awoken by ORION: Prelude. It is impossible to tell where its gentle hand will lead us, but I am certain it will not be astray. I place my faith in thee, ORION: Prelude, as I know you will show me the release that mankind has been missing since its very roots.   May ORION rule forever more.    
1388	0	a	♥♥♥♥ game. terrible port. if you want to play alone you're good. but if you want to play online, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. this game can't multiplayer very well.
7681	1	a	  Play nice and have fun environment Rating 9/10
1391	0	a	Horrible graphics swallowed lage ♥♥♥ cracks
1392	0	a	literally garbage
1393	0	a	This is a very clumsy and bad game. Fuzzy controls, horrible game play and sub-par graphics. Seriously overpriced even at .99 cents. Download the free weekend version for giggles and mourn the disc space and band width wasted. The metacritic score is not a lie. Couldn't stand more than five minutes of this stuff. The dinos do look rather nice even though they move like sorry stop motion animation puppets. Maybe the devs should reprogram this game as a screen saver?
1394	0	a	Concept is great, but all I got while playing it was a game designed for human characters, with poor handling on the dinosaurs and other reptiles. Difficult to navigate and figure out how to play in the first place.
7683	1	a	Spent $1 and a few minutes convincing 2 people to also spend $1. Got the three of us in a hummer and drove it into a Stegosaurus.  We exploded and died.  10/10
1395	0	a	its awful, simply awful
1396	0	a	Thought this woudl be fun with some friends. Lasted for 2 hours, it's just too clunky and slow. Getting into the same server is a pain, and play is just not great.
1397	0	a	Blood Vomit. All over. Rotten Apple out of 10
1398	0	a	horrible game does not work do not buy it is so horrible don't buy it don't pay for it
7685	1	a	Really fun, old game. But ffs 251 Achievements. 11/10.
7687	1	a	Cool
1399	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
7689	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
1402	0	a	A ♥♥♥♥ poor game with laughably bad mechanics, a lot of bugs, guns that feel like a weak ejaculation and ugly looking graphics. Not even worth it if it were free.
1403	0	a	Your connection to the host has been lost.
1404	0	a	The only game I ever regretted buying for 99 cents.
7691	1	a	LIGHTSABERS AND DINOSAURS (The game still has bug's) 10/10
1407	0	a	Dont understand why people are saying metacritic is wrong? The game is beyond broken, probably one of the worst games ive played. Rampage is the only game mode worth playing and thats just a flipping mess. The whole game is a mess, its in a sorry state and no update can fix this.  Its like the developers released a half ♥♥♥♥♥ alpha and said it was the finished product.
7693	1	a	These are the type of developers I support. They admited their mistakes, they started working on it and updated it for 3 years. They deliverd a stable game--for only 1 euro. This is Worth A Buy, even when you're not into this type of game, I advise you to buy it. We needs these type of developers on Steam or we will pay the price eventually.  
1409	0	a	bad copy of csgo and borderlands 2
1410	0	a	They changed the name of this game several times. The name changing is so out of hand that the review on the game's page is from the wrong game. It's constantly being discounted to 99 cents for a reason. Not very fun, and multiplayer is a real challenge to get working. Plus no one plays it. Still doesnt feel like a polished game for some reason.
1411	0	a	Played for 30 minutes and failed to find a reason to ever do it again. This could in theory be a really good game I imagine, it just doesn't quite work for a number of reasons. I didn't get any good explanation as to how anything works. The weapons and upgrades system is fairly basic and a little overwhelming at the same time for a newcomer, all the guns look and feel the same. The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.  P.S.: V as the default melee key and a second wind game mechanic that allows you to avoid death by getting a kill quickly enough... why does this feel familiar?
7695	1	a	Really fun game
1413	0	a	Wow they made the game worse. Gimme back my dollar!
7697	1	a	IT GOOOD GAME PLS BUY DO IT 200$ PLS OR I KILL YOU MY TIGGA
1415	0	a	This is so bad, not even worth 49 cents.
1416	0	a	I paid for this game and now it is free to play !! WTF ?   Game is not that bad btw...
1417	0	a	Do not buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥
1418	0	a	this game is stupid
7699	1	a	  Got 5 hours out of a $0.49 gift. Worth.  Actually pretty fun with friends, not sure about this whole copyright issue though.
7701	1	a	Did you love Turok on the N64? Did you love Halo when it was cool?  If not, still doesn't matter because this game is pure fun.  This game brought back sweet memories when I used to play Turok 2 on the N64 and then when I played Halo CE for the first time on PC.  You haven't lived if you haven't punched a T-Rex till death with your bare hands.  1$ and tons of fun!
1424	0	a	LITERALLY the worst game I've EVER played.
7703	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosaurs.
1435	0	a	I just got this game. I don't know wtf is going on but I can't connect to any servers. It either takes me back to the main menu or doesn't do anything at all. It won't even let me play solo mode. ♥♥♥♥ this game.
1436	0	a	it wuz gud during da free weakend wen da jitpaks wrkd, butt gayral studios did sumthin to maek da gaem soopr s h i t bitwween then n now!  5/10 cuz da gaem cuntanes dinosaurs
1437	0	a	I don't know how this game is on steam. Constant crashing, disconnecting, bugs, etc. This isn't a finished product, not even close. Sound design is pretty bad, animations are mediocre, player and weapon models are kinda bad too. Dinosaurs are alright, but the environment is actually shockingly beautiful.  A bundle of bad/boring/broken mechanics, a generic grind game style, and no real reason to be grinding have this game coming in substantially worse than almost any other multiplayer free-to-play game, making it a bad purchase. Only played for about an hour, but most laughter and enjoyment came from just how absurdly bad some aspects of the game were.
1438	0	a	Hilariously bad coding, icons quite possibly stolen from Apple's iOS, and unintentional surrealism (read: bizarre ragdolling) combine to produce a quite mediocre dino-killer surprisingly reminiscent of Halo (with dinosaurs), but nowhere near as good.
1439	0	a	This game is a peice of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. It was gifted to me..so thank you for the gift...but my god....no...nononononononononono
1440	0	a	all comments in trailer are lies. this game is not worth to 1 dollar... lets just end it there...
7705	1	a	♥♥♥♥ matchmaking, ♥♥♥♥ programming, could have been great
1442	0	a	Do not buy this game. No matter the discount, it is not worth the price. There's too much to go into, and I really don't care much. Just noticed that for some reason I had a positive review on here, and since it's on sale wanted to update the review to reflect the current game.
7707	1	a	I paid £0.79, to ram a Triceratops with a car, he flung me across the map and i landed on about 5 velociraptors. 10/10
1446	0	a	Meh, it's incomplete, glitchy, ugly, and repetitive- but it can be fun for a couple hours, i think it'd be worth a dollar if you have friends willing to play it with you- but otherwise , it'll be just another game to become untouched in your library after the first couple plays or so
1447	0	a	Prelude to what? Oh god, what am I playing?!
1448	0	a	Orion: Prelude (previously known as 'Orion: Dino Horde' and before that 'Orion: Dino Beatdown') exemplifies poor design with just about every detail, from the graphics to the gameplay. Visual effects (Motion blur, lens flares, water droplets) are overused to an extreme, actually making it very difficult to see what you're doing in some cases. It's as if the developers saw an effect they liked and put it in because it looked kind of cool, without any thought to how it meshed with the rest of the experience. This pattern holds true for the rest of the game: features are either half-baked (class system is totally useless) or just poorly done (sound design and animations are just awful).  Perhaps the only thing worse than this game is its the community: they really put the 'cult' into 'cult classic'. Look at any review online and the comments section will be littered with comments ranging from claims that 'the game is much better now and deserves a re-review' to outright accusing the reviewer of slandering the developers. It holds a 'mostly positive' ranking on steam simply because fans bombard the review board with meaningless positive recommendations (probably so they can appear in one of the games trailers).  The idea had potential, but there really isn't anything redeeming about what Trek Industries made with it. The only selling point is that it's so cheap, but I'd actually recommend not buying the game just on the principle of not supporting such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ product.
1449	0	a	I never asked for a 90's shooter.
7709	1	a	.
7711	1	a	Bad game. Don't play. Play Halo instead.
7713	1	a	Orion (insert subtitle here) is a super low budget crappy looking Halo ripoff that pits Master Chief look-a-likes against wave after wave of brainless angry dinosaurs that want to bite him to death.  Its not creative, deep, or original. It is a crude and simple game. And it is fun enough to be a guilty pleasure. The enjoyment doesn't last for long however, since Origin gets impossibly difficult a few waves in. For $1, you get what you pay for.  Its the ultra low quality attention to details that amuse me the most. I like how when most of the guns are fired, the recoil animation is the model's hands sliding up and down their forearms. Or how one of the character poses for holding the pistol is the same as holding a rifle.
7715	1	a	I never enjoy buying games. But I got pressured into buying this because of my friends. I was thinking 'It'll probably be a ♥♥♥♥ game but it's just a doller.' But holy ♥♥♥♥ was I wrong. This game has a major lack of fun when it's singleplayer but the fun is all in co-op. 10/10 dank meme m8.
7717	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
7719	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
1457	0	a	Huge rip off. I paid about 80 cents for the second time this was released (this is now it's third release and it's free 2 play now). Wish I could get those 80 cents back.
1458	0	a	Became free to play because it was not even worth 1 cent
1459	0	a	This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. dont waste a dollar on this thing. This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that i almost choked to death on my own ♥♥♥♥ing hand
7721	1	a	So bad its good. Pretty much just a crappy halo but with dinos as ur enemy would say u should play it with group of friends or else it may not be as humerous it just a silly game u can mess around in with friends, ull have more time laughing than actually bothering about wats going on
7723	1	a	Good, but a bit hard.
1461	0	a	i honestly don't have a clue what is going on
7725	1	a	A glitchy buggy mess of game with broken ai and Laggy hitboxes. They were smart to make their tagline 'It's only 99 cents!' And to their credit... It is only 99 cents.
7727	1	a	Had this game for a while now,  10/10 would always recommend
7729	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a great game that i got for only £0.99!!!! i was amazed at how good it was as i had never heard of it before, it has a great singleplayer and multiplayer experience and the graphics are phenominal!!! 100% must buy!!!!
1469	0	a	I purchased this when it was still called 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'. It looked very promising. It turned out to be the worst game I had intended to buy.   If any difference came in 'Prelude' then it should be celebrated because changing literally anything about Beatdown is a positive.
1470	0	a	Orion : Prelude is a step back from Orion Dino Horde. More lag, crappy gameplay made for controllers and a ingame cash shop ...... blargh!
1471	0	a	If you like broken games that uses about 100% of your GPU and still looks like crap then this is the game   for you.   It's like Goat Simulator, only that this game is unintentionally bad.
1472	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1473	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
1474	0	a	paid 99 cent... then it was free :(
7731	1	a	For $.99, you can kill dinosaurs with 4 friends or play PvP with 9 friends! Best decision in years!
7733	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
1477	0	a	Not worth even 99 cents !!!  Don't buy IT !!!   Too booring!!!
1478	0	a	Characters run like they have sticks up their asses. Had no animation when firing weapons. No clue why dinosaurs are attacking energy generators. And I'm told this game has been greatly improved from what it originally was? Do yourself a favor and play something else.
1479	0	a	That´s the first game I bought in the new steam interface....couldn´t be sorrier. How come 73% of more than 10,000 user could possible recommend this crap!? One visit at metacr... site and all I see are terrible reviews by the critics and a very low metascore, but I had already bought it.  Difficult to play, need to put all video quality on low and still bugging. On other computer with more power the game was a little better but the gameplay is not ok, too messy and confused. 
1480	0	a	Even when it's fun, it isn't.
1481	0	a	No one plays it, the physics are uncontrollable and it's laggy, other than that good game. 3/10
1482	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
1483	0	a	Steam says I own this ♥♥♥♥... I DON'T
1484	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
1485	0	a	6 minutes well wasted.
7735	1	a	It's like playing Left 4 Dead but with dinosaurs that are also mentally challenged. Also you're mentally challenged. And the big dinosaurs are especially mentally challenged and op 8.75623/5 stars
7737	1	a	Great and Cheap for $1
7739	1	a	STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10  The game has been updated to make it like 100 times better now.  My goodness, this game has evolved to something unbelievably good. I played it for a couple of hours three months back when I purchased the game. I didn't like it then. I uninstalled it and thought I would never play it again. Back then, the whole world looked blurred and murky. It deserved the $1.00 that it costs. But today, the evolution of this game is unbelievable. It is so so so beautiful. The gameplay is good. I just kept running randomly in my first game to appreciate the scenaries. Plus there is Steam Workshop supporty, I mean you really get a lot for the $1.00 you pay. My appeal to those that have not played this game in the past couple of months - visit the game once... you won't believe you had such a beautiful game lying in your library (probably hidden by now).  STRONGLY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10
7741	1	a	ORION: Prelude (formerly ORION: Dino Beatdown and more recently ORION: Dino Horde) is easily one of the most underrated games of the last 5 years. It's been torn apart constantly and consistently by the gaming press and given a right beatdown of its own. Since its release in May 2012 I've put a solid 100 hours into the games and I can say with great confidence that it deserves much more credit than it is given. Spiral Game Studios has come a long way with this title and ORION: Prelude is a fresh, fun, and exciting gaming experience.  If you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Killing Floor, Gears of War Horde Mode, or Halo's Firefight you know what to expect from ORION: Prelude. It's a co-operative FPS where up to 5 players work together to defend or capture objectives by fighting off wave after wave of dinosaurs. To vanquish said dinos there are three classes to choose from at the start of each match; Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault sports a jetpack, Recon a cloaking device, and Support a healing gun. Each kill earns a player cash depending on the damage they contribute which can be spent on upgrades between waves. Those upgrades range from bigger guns and bigger knives to Augmentations like a double jump or stronger melee attacks. There's enough to choose from that you'll be mixing and matching with the different classes to create unique builds each match. This really helps the game stay fresh.  On top of the class customization there are plenty of different modes available to chose from including a VS mode called 'Duel' which is akin to elimination style modes in other games. There's Survival, King of the Hill, Free for All and many others including a mode where you are able to play as the dinosaurs themselves VS other human controlled characters. Controlling the dinosaurs is a bit difficult at first as they are large and stiff feeling, but after a round or two you'll be crushing human face like a true prehistoric behemoth and laughing the whole time.  When it was first released in May of 2012 as ORION: Dino Beatdown it was, admittedly, a mess. The word 'glitchy' comes to mind with a hard lean towards broken and many of the game modes mentioned above weren't available. It was playable, but dinosaurs didn't behave intelligently. They would clip through the stage and animate like caffeine loaded squirrels with rigor mortis, guns wouldn't make noise and would even sometimes disappear altogether. Not to mention the announcer getting stuck repeating lines such as 'threat eliminated!' and 'threat down!' over and over until the match ended. But, for what ORION: Dino Beatdown was at its core, a co-operative horde-mode FPS with dinosaurs, it was amazingly fun.  Yes the game had its moments, to put it lightly, but it wasn't so bad that it deserved the media meltdown that ensued after its release. Spiral was quick to respond to community feedback and within a few short weeks issued a number of patches that corrected graphical errors, class balance issues, optimization problems, all the while preparing large and free content packs that were released the following months. Eventually the game was re-branded and soft re-released twice to what it is known as today: ORION: Prelude.  If you were to compare the two games side by side it would be like night and day. Should Spiral have released Dino Beatdown as it was? No, probably not. But I'm glad they did. After playing the game day in and day out over the past few years my friends and I all realized that playing it together was the most fun we'd had since Super Smash Bros. Melee on our old GameCube. Time and time again we found ourselves laughing to tears and getting chomped. Much like Melee, L4D and Street Fighter did before it; ORION: Prelude has earned itself a spot on the shelf as one of our go-to party games for years to come.
7743	1	a	This game has had some improvements, ignore metacritics, its being constantly updated. The only problem I have is micro transactions. 8/10
7745	1	a	Ran over a herd of velociraptors. 12/10

7747	1	a	This is the most underrated game on steam.
1487	0	a	this game sucks its sooooooo laggy they did not make this better than the last one it  suuucks
1488	0	a	Dont waste your money on this game its really slow for average computers as well as a bad game keep looking for a better dinosaur shooter like primal hunter!
1489	0	a	Sucks. You get what you pay for.
1490	0	a	Won't even start up. Tried to restart steam, computer, and reinstalling the game itself but nothing works. I just get the loading wheel then it just says it crashed :/  Honestly I was looking forward to this game but now, I can't even play it! Quite dissatisfactory.
7749	1	a	Steam Free-2-Play ‘ORION: Dino Horde’ event / 75% off sale
7751	1	a	Worst FPS i have ever played! But cuz i love huge cluster ♥♥♥♥s that dont make sense i give this game 10/10 Bad game! But good game..........Im bored..........seriously im bored............
7753	1	a	wtf is this game? It`s so funny, that i slapped my mother so hart in the face, that she started laughing too.  10/10 would slap my mother again for this game!
7755	1	a	its a nice game, but before you ask no i wouldent pay the 15 bucks for this game but 99 cents yeah its fun.
7757	1	a	best 1 euro spent of my life
7759	1	a	Game of the year
1501	0	a	REALLY I WAITED 3 MONTHS FOR IT TO GO ON SALE  FOR A 4 PACK then i bought it for $2.99 NOW ITS FREE AND I DONT GET ♥♥♥♥ TO SHOW FOR IT AT LEAST GIVE ME A COOL WEAPON THAT UNIQUE OR EVEN A CUSTOM SKIN  HOW ABOUT A REFUND? oh no steam will not cover that you played to long other than that game is fun just gets to boring tedious and repetitive  but if u love 2 grind play this   EDIT 1: i bought this game Feb 22, 2014  and i still got 2 copies left which i can trade but since the game is free  WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT
1502	0	a	The only good thing about this game is driving your teammates off a cliff.
7761	1	a	This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of our universe has to offer.  10/10
7763	1	a	Get It While Its Free 
1507	0	a	its not even like they genuinly tried, its just such a lazy game.
1508	0	a	This is one of those awkwardly medicore games. Even their options menu is clunky (with typos). With resolutions that are a bit off (especially if you show windowed). Hell, you can't even turn off things like head bob, so even your human bobs his head like he has a two foot neck (great for headaches). The combat has the awkward down with the dinos twitching around as they run half sideways as their attack.   Funny enough it even has a store to buy 'Spiral Coins' from, which is impressive for a non-F2P game. Though they seem to be putting a lot of updates in, so they probably are working for it.  I picked up a 4 pack on sale, just because even a bad game can be amusing on co-op. So I really wanted to like it, but it looks like I'll just keep those for gag gifts.
1509	0	a	I decided to play solo, and I've been killed by a raptor who was at least 5m away from me. Then I decided to run a little test on their AI = basically walking heat-seeking missiles with claws. -10/10 would not play again
1510	0	a	Terrible... Just terrible. The least they could do is make the in-game purchases menu look a bit better right?
1511	0	a	I paid 16 cents and I feel like I payed too much
1512	0	a	Screaming 'Team mate down!' is more fun than actually playing this game. It's ♥♥♥♥ in short. Dino chasing you? ♥♥♥♥ing cloak. Bam. You're invincible. There's nothing fun about it. The slow motion is ♥♥♥♥ and the dino ai is atrocious. I'm glad I only installed this for free week. There's also some ♥♥♥♥ing 'spooky christmas' map or some ♥♥♥♥. There's ♥♥♥♥ing ghosts and robo reindeers with lasers. Only buy it if you won't miss a dollar and have friends that have a sense of humour. Like no ♥♥♥♥ing joke it's hilarious how bad this game is.
7765	1	a	Basically dino D-Day but in the future, and with more tanks. Gameplay is janky and hard to follow, and the majority of the weapons make no sense to use, even for fun. But it's good fun, again don't pay retail for it
7767	1	a	♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ Game.. never before i played such a broken and poorly devloped Game, stay away from it.. only Revelations 2012 is probably worser then this,yeah i know hard to believe, but thrust me lol
1522	0	a	This game would be amazing if I could actually start it up. All my friends love the game, they bought it for me... I can't even ♥♥♥♥ing play it. Fix your game please. I did everything this is the 5th hour I've tried to get this thing working. Please fix it. Steam support doesnt help me at all, someone please help me.
7769	1	a	Ohnestly You Realy want me to buy this im a evil AI i already have it!
1525	0	a	meh. It's ok
1526	0	a	If you're buying this game recently, don't it doesnt work.
7771	1	a	An absolutely awesome game to play with friends whether it's a co-op survival against a horde of dinosaurs or a deathmatch between players. Although this game has quite afew bugs and things that they should improve on, I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!
1529	0	a	The game is okay. The developers are not.
7773	1	a	This game has improved a lot since it first came out. It is a very fun game now, especially when you play with friends. A fun game+giant boss dinos that tower above you = Recommend.
1531	0	a	I bought this game for a doller. I was suprised that not only did i get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game but that I was not able to refund it!
1532	0	a	graphics and gameplay sucks
7775	1	a	I don't care what people say, this game is worth at least $15 but I payed .99c for it. I killed a Triceratops and a Stegasaurus with an op tank but was run down by a massive Spinysaurus. Get it, play it with friends and enjoy it. 10/10 It's Halo with dinosaurs.
7777	1	a	I remember when it was dino: beatdown and it was 15 dollars... So ♥♥♥♥.
7779	1	a	Perfect
7781	1	a	What is there left to say. I payed less than 1€ for this and it delivered such. Nothing to regret.
7783	1	a	that game iss very fun
7785	1	a	Good game!! worth Money!! (1$)
7787	1	a	You can go Chuck Norrirs on a T-rex from inside a combat walker a.k.a. mech. How awesome is that?
1540	0	a	WHAT THE FLYING FADOODILY ♥♥♥♥KKKKKKKK. THIS GAME SUCKS DIRTY BUTT HOLE. EVERYTIME I TURN AROUND THE DINOSAURS ♥♥♥♥ ME IN THE DAMN ♥♥♥. ITS A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ STORY BORING AND ♥♥♥♥♥♥ X2.♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ASS ♥♥♥ DAMN ♥♥♥♥. THE GUNS ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND MADE IN AFRICA BY CHINESE MEXICAN ON CRACK WHILE GETTING ♥♥♥♥♥ WITH A FROZEN BANANA. BYE
7789	1	a	I think this is a fun small game. Sure theres not much to do but its still can be fun.
7791	1	a	Got in a jeep and was eaten by T-rex. 11/10
1549	0	a	Where the ♥♥♥♥ do I begin? I have a machine capable of running this game on 60 FPS but it's so terribly optimized that it lags atrociously. I don't understand how this game could possibly have such high reviews. Even with such a low price on it, I still feel until it's optimized better I just can't suggest this game to anyone.
7793	1	a	As a man of simple tastes, this game strikes my interests at heart. I like shooting and blowing things up, and I also have a tender love for dinosaurs. When I saw this game, a game where these two interests collide, I bought it. I have not regretted it one bit. Although the game doesn't have the amazing technical aspects of other shooters, it still retains the fundamental goal of the game; make dinosaurs playable and shootable. That's all I need.
7795	1	a	You get to be a dino which is f*cking awesome
7797	1	a	Make the large dino spawn to 400%, huge cluster♥♥♥♥. People except you healing the generator, no problem. Guy goes afk for most of time and then comes back, takes your ♥♥♥♥ Nice game to play with ♥♥♥♥ing idiots  10/10 would call someone a jew again.
7799	1	a	An enjoyable way to pass time
7801	1	a	the only thing i dont like is that i dont know how to get the mechs 
7803	1	a	One thing I can't figure out... I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale. Now, all of a sudden I have to buy it a second time, and at full price? Why is this happening, I thought I already owned this game.. Other than that. The game itself is awesome in my opinion, I love the halo-esque feel when playing it, then throw in dinosaurs. Done... All in all, it's a great game and would love to continue playing it, if it wasn't for the fact I apparently have to purchase it again. Hopefully this problem will be fixed one day.

1558	0	a	not even worth the dollar i paid for it
1559	0	a	Gun shoots are not really that real, need a long distance of running before jump into action, abit of boring game.
7805	1	a	Otion: Prelude is funny game, much better now then it started!  + Various weapons; Vehicles; Perks; Habilities; Chalenging; Leveling; Weather changing;  - Optimization; Maps Quantity; A.I; A lot of bugs; Physics.  Score: 7/10 
7807	1	a	I got the option to make a review for a game I never played    The trailer looks cool,might pick it up
1560	0	a	A never ending party game
7809	1	a	fantastically cinematic shooter action, listening helplessly to your friend scream as he's torn apart by a T-Rex in slow motion, and avenging him with your bare hands is a rare experience, play with voice chat for maximum adrenaline
7811	1	a	You can ride an entire mech ontop of a VTOL in this at full speed - it's seriously ridiculous fun.  It's unpolished, but the old reviews don't take into account that this game has gone a long way through updates.  It's cheap, with lots of content and gamemodes sure to keep you playing for many hours.  While it has buggy animations and other small problems, it's still a really fun game and the scale of fighting huge dinosaurs is fun - refreshing from the zombie game crowd.  Lots of gamemodes, maps, and things to do.
7813	1	a	If It only didnt lag as hell I could write a decent review.
7815	1	a	This game is the description of 'so bad it's good'.
1563	0	a	This game is still HORRIBLE after three years of support. Please stop supporting it and let it die. If this is seriously 3 years of effort, you need to find a new career path.
7817	1	a	A lot of people rip on this game, but it really is a fun game. For me, I don't have a lot of free time, and this is an easy game to pick up and play in short bursts. Only have 15 min? Enough time to fire up and play Rampage for a bit. Have a few hours? Conquest mode will take that.  With that said, some of the complaints are true. Early on bugs were pretty frustrating, but offset by a lot of free add-on content. None of that is really much of an issue anymore - the worst bugs are worked out, but there are still some (minor) issues.  The online community isn't large, but what is there is pretty welcoming for a casual gamer like myself. Typically the online games are set to the easier modes (which are a little too easy). It is a little annoying that it's hard to find people willing to play on harder modes...  Overall, the game is fun, and for the price that it is, It's worth an add to your Steam library.
7819	1	a	7/10
7821	1	a	this is an awsome game please make more of thease games there awsome
1566	0	a	Look at the pretty screenshots.... This game blows.
1567	0	a	WORST GAME IN THE WORLD IT SUCKS DONT WASTE A DOLLAR ITS A STUPID GAME
1568	0	a	I just don't like the game, my personal opinion.
1569	0	a	I do like this game but not as good as everone said (i got it for $0.50) but its ok i guess....... 5.6/10
7823	1	a	its an amazing game for its price the grapics are good i would recomend anyone getting it
1573	0	a	as humorous as i thought it was playing for the first five minutes, this game did not sway me into buying into it. even with the sale price of 99 cents at the time of this review. is it entertaining? i'd like to think so? is it worth a dollar? debatable, at times it feels literally unfinished. wait, I take that back, pretty much all the time it feels unfinished. but I did enjoy the few minutes i played it but didn't see it go anywhere past 1 or 2 plays. if free gameplay and a 93% discount doesn't sway me into buying your game then i'm sorry i cannot reccomend buying this game. do play it at least once though. it'll be interesting.
7825	1	a	awsome 
7827	1	a	thank god they lowered the price
7829	1	a	i mean, its bad, but it IS a fun game with friends xD
7831	1	a	I love this game a bit laggy if u play on a laptop with pretty nice graphics but still awesome
7833	1	a	Honestly, I'm torn as to whether it's actually worth a dollar or not.  On one hand, it could be great fun if you've got a full group of friends to play with.  On the other... good god, the bugs, the pointlessness of an entire class (of only three!), the repetitiveness, and the fact that a god-awful player can screw you over on Conquest by stealing your vehicle...
1577	0	a	Why did the name change and re-download. No. I got this because I thought it was funny. It runs poorly.
1578	0	a	This game is more shity than my ♥♥♥♥
7835	1	a	It has dinosaurs. What else can be said.
1580	0	a	download this game  
1581	0	a	This game was a pile of ♥♥♥♥ when it first came out. They have came a very long way than what it use to be.  Give it a try but only think about how lame it is already.
7837	1	a	bought the game for 50c, got trading cards sold for for 80c. Profit :)
7839	1	a	its is quite a fun little first person shooter i think if you like these sort of games you should defenatly have a try
7841	1	a	Loved the game it was by far the best dinosaur game ive played i got to do lots of things be dinosaurs, kill dinosaurs, ride vehicels, lots of gamemodes, it was the most fun ive had.
1583	0	a	...
1584	0	a	Clunky and unattractive menu just generally something you'd make on scratch its just ehh 
7843	1	a	Team Fortress with dinosaurs, spawningdinos/10 would play again

7847	1	a	This game is VERY FUN! I would highly recommend it! 8/10
7849	1	a	its ok
7851	1	a	LOVE IT
7853	1	a	They have a Turok reference in Achievements  15/10
7855	1	a	what am i doing with my life
7857	1	a	what the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥
7859	1	a	ORION: Dino Hore is a action packed RPG MMO with robots. It is a forth person shooter with many different guns to choose from including, My favourite, the pistol. The Graphics are revolutionary for the dinosaws moths move and even when you die you get a very good insight of what a dinosaws digestive system looks like there for it is also educational. You can play many classes such as the mage, the rouge and soldier or even the random guy who does not do anything and still win by pure luke. Now i know what you fink, Meta score ist bud but screw the sustem. What the lego movie taught me, dont trust the government for they give you false information 99999999% of the time. I give this game a 11111111111111111111111111/1 in my opinon. The specil ting bout dis gam is you can play as a dinosaw which everybody wanted. Overal, ds gam is gut and i prefer th tim i cilled a dinosaw but relized it was my friend with a hat on. 
1599	0	a	very poorly made game
1600	0	a	dont bother with it, its crap.
1601	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are terrible and the best computer can't handle it weith the worst graphics on possible. And the game is just laggy and glitchy. This is the worst game to ever be in existense. The dinasours just like to fly around and attack you while you can't see because of the laggy peice of shot game ♥♥♥♥♥ tits.
1602	0	a	It was really cool until i played it
1603	0	a	This game have good gameplay but you get bored preety fast and there are a few players.Don't recommand it.
7861	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again
7863	1	a	I've played it once with a friend and actually had a fun time doing it. While it may be underwhelming on the surface, it is very fun if you're willing to relax and just play a game a bit without too much thought involved.
1605	0	a	bought this game as a joke after betting with my friend whether this game is worth a $ . played this game only for cards and later deleted this game . 10/10 would rate meh8/h8
7865	1	a	I think this game is pretty fun, but I cant say that I like the devs. Most of the reviews that are negative have to do with the devs, just disreguard that stuff. This game is $1 This game is 100% worth $1 I wouldn't say that its worth $20 by a long shot
7867	1	a	its an fun amazing chaotic game!
1606	0	a	Horrible game. The guns feel horrible like they aren't doing anything. The devs say that they've improved the game, I would argue that they made it worse. The jetpack DOESNT work off the jump. The gun skins feel just thrown in.
1607	0	a	its a bit crap  more like oreo precumlube/10
7869	1	a	It's like Borderlands with dinosaurs.
1608	0	a	Back when this game was call Dino Beatdown the game have fewer dinos the graphics were 10x better and the gameplay was smoother. Now updates dino horde and prelude came changing the game into this bloody rubbish, and a major graphics downgrade to make the pretty ok looking game look like 32bit S*h*i*T and the only good thing to come out of it was the weather effects for the snow lvls  i used to love this game in 2012 but the updates ruined it
1609	0	a	Not working with Linux (Ubuntu) ?
7871	1	a	This game is so much fun, and so under rated. Don't pay attention to the metascore because if it was me scoring it, I would probably score it maybe a 83 or something around that, it has decent graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and i'm sure that a lot more content will be added in the future. Let's help this game grow and get even better than it already is by supporting this game. It is awesome.
1612	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
1613	0	a	Terrible. I got this for almost nothing and I still want my money back.  For one thing, I can literally buy iron boots or w/e after one wave, jet pack up on top of rocks, and then become immortal because nothing can touch me, including the large Dinos like T-rex. The Pterodactyls can ram me, but they do so little damage its laughable  There is a day-night cycle, which makes the game basically unplayable because you need to kill all the dinosaurs in a wave to advance, including pterodactyls, which are completely invisible at night.  The big weapons like rocket launchers you cant even USE, or I havent figured out how without looking it up.  You can literally farm credits nonstop during non-wave missions, because unless you kill the large dinosaur, weenies spawn endlessly, and during non-wave segments you can buy power ups at any time. The first Non-wave mission I sat on a rock, untouchable, as pterodactyls rammed into me, shooting things with my peestol and making tons of cash, only going down to buy more ammo, then I bought almost every single power up and the highest power gun in every category.   The game itself is terribly optimized, and even though I can play skyrim decently, I cannot handle orion without disabling nearly every graphics option and even then, it's still like 20 fps. On the high settings, IF it ran right, it looks like something from the early naughties, not the 2010s. No reason at all to be so poorly optimized for pc.  2/110, good for some cheap laughs, but so much other stuff is much more fun.
7873	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
7875	1	a	Very good game overall. It has great graphics and a huge variety of game modes and playable characters. You can get levels, encouraging you to get higher and higher levels to get better. I think personally the music is great too. I'd have to say a 10/10.
7877	1	a	It's not a deep game, but a very fun one. If you combine this with the good gameplay mechanics and decent graphics, this is a really good investment for $1.00.
7879	1	a	Best 69 cent spent in my life.  Online FPS with many guns, upgrades, superpowers, vehicles and DINOSAURS!! The game is easy to get into, has nice graphics, is well optimized and most importantly, it is damn FUN!  9/10
7881	1	a	It will change your life for ever.

7885	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. It got bad scores for coming out incomplete but has been updated a ton soon after. It's a good coop survival game to play with some friends.

1637	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
1638	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
7895	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
7897	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.

The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.

1656	0	a	Awful graphics and awful game play. no wonder it's being flogged for 99p this weekend.
7907	1	a	One of the best dinosaur games I have played in a long while. I would have happily paid around $5 for a game like this.  Pros -It is a steal for 99 cents! Far better than any 99 cent iphone game - It has dinosaurs! -Every battle take part in seems unique, anything can happen! -It is moderately open world -Contols are easy to use -those particle effects! -any multiplayer game mode you can think of -Hats, hats and more hats -it can run on anything if you know how to adjust your system settings and the game initialization file  Cons -the game can be a bit buggy and has lots of random FPS drops even on my gaming rig - The Ai dinosaurs can be a little goofy at times. - No single player campaign (I got over that since the game was apparently made by 2 people and I don't want to put to much pressure on the devs,) -The maps are all very similar in style and design. -the 3D characters, guns, props and textures are not as high quality as i would like. (still very good though!) -its not as realistic as crysis 3 (Get over it) -I felt that the devs could have taken this game just a little bit further to make it trully amazing  Awesome dinosaur game,  good multiplayer indie game   Rating: 8.7/10  
1662	0	a	i played one match and thats good enough for me i had glitches every room i walked in i had teammates that just stood there when i was down and had no fun
1663	0	a	  A masterpiece that revolutionises the gaming industry. Truly a spectacle to behold. The best game in my library without a doubt. Worth every cent.
7909	1	a	  Not a bad game. It runs well on my ancient box too. I wished we could play as dinosaurs though.
7911	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
7913	1	a	The Best Halo Games on pc lol just kidding  Orion prelude its a good game for just 1$  if you have a spare money on your wallet you should check this game out
7915	1	a	I think that despite the criticism that orion prelude has been given I think it is a very solid game... for only ONE dollar. Its so cheap that it doesnt have to be good but they still made it decent. It is a vey fun arcade shooter and I would say it is the most casual out of the three dinosaur shooters that I own. Its a great game to buy a friend who has naver used steam perhaps and is multiplayer so you can play together. It is very satisfying to kill large hoards of dinosaurs. Personally I would have liked to see a few more guns as well as bigger differces between the character classes that you can choose. It is also too easy to camp because of the jetpack although there is a brid that will sometimes pull you off your camp spot after a while. Lastly there are not so many servers for the vast number of gamemodes that the devs have created.  Pros: -fun arcade shooter -cheap -decent graphics -good game balance -many dinosaurs -many gamemodes -good powerups -multiplayer (you can make your own lobby)  Cons: -repetetive after a certain amount of rounds -some glitches -maps are sometimes too easy to defend -few guns -classes dont do much -after upgrading guns and armour ect the game can become unbalanced -Should be different types of bosses in harder levels, not just more of them   
7917	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
1666	0	a	its graphics are terrible and its gameplay sucks
1667	0	a	This game is full of glitches and problems and should be labelled early access with a disclaimer. When I shoot, I don't see bullets coming out of my gun and when I use a vehicle turret the screen just shakes, with nothing coming out of the gun. It somehow still does damage to the dinosaurs though. I would not recommend buying it, even at the price of $0.75 unless you just want to get the trading cards or something.  I was wondering how the game got a rating of 'Mostly Positive', but after looking at several other comments, I found out that this game has been removed and re-added to Steam several times due to terrible ratings, so I wouldn't expect long-term support for this game either.
1668	0	a	Before I begin, I would like to point out that I can run Far Cry 3 on high graphics.   This game could be great. It already would be great, if not for one killer - fps. On low everything, this game lags like hell, and my gun appears to be hovering in my hands, which often go through it. Also, there are no tutorials. I know you can probably find them online somewhere, but it would be nice if there was an optional one you could participate in if you needed to. I really tried to enjoy this game, but the fps, which was probably about 7, ruined my experience.   When they fix the fps problems and major lag, then, and only then, will this be a reccomendation.  It will be an awesome game when that happens. But for now, it is terrible.
7919	1	a	0/10 They're changing it.
7921	1	a	The best 79 cents I've ever spent.
7923	1	a	didn't know i had this game 10/10
7925	1	a	sWAG
1674	0	a	I have literally never played a worse game.
1675	0	a	It's alright for like 20 minutes at a time but gets boring pretty quick and it's hard to look past the gleaming flaws to actually enjoy it. Needs lots of work.   The price of a game is irrelevant, the fact that it's less than $1 doesn't excuse a broken game, too many lazy devs these days seem to think so though.
1676	0	a	the graffic's ar HORRIBLE AND TO MUCH LAG
7927	1	a	Its awesome and worth the money! I have not bought it but I will try to as soon as I get the money. I have this far only played it when it has been free.
7929	1	a	Didn't play the game Still get to make a review 10/10 would review again
7931	1	a	FRICKING REDIC LAGG JHOLY CRAP IT TAAKES A WHOLE SECOND FOr MY MOUSE TO START TO FOLLOW MY MOVEMENTS EVEN WITH EVERYTHING DOWN ITS STILL SUPER SLOW! PLEASE FIX, as well as the controller support! 
7933	1	a	Fun game, but suffers from some frame rate issues, and lag when you are not the host, regardless of host's internet connection.
1677	0	a	I don't even know why am I tried it.
7935	1	a	OMG! BEST! GAME! EVER! totaly worth a 10/10
7937	1	a	Just great !!!!
1681	0	a	♥♥♥♥ing terrible, even worse than Dino Horde
7939	1	a	This game has gotten some bad reviews but I actually enjoy this game. While the lack of documentation or tutorials was a poor choice, the combat mechanics are similar to Borderlands 2 or Payday and my friends and I (after the initial issues getting to connect together) had quite a bit of fun in it. I feel it's worth the price while on sale if you enjoy quick action games with some replayability (although the same maps over and over will get old after a while). I mainly play it for the co-op and not the competitive styles (but the Rampage mode where one side can play a dinosaur is entertaining).  It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy games like Payday with repeatable missions and a persistent leveling system for unlocks it's quite an entertaining little diversion.
1683	0	a	The third release of Orion: Dino Beatdown is no better than the first, they fixed some issues but a lot of technical stuff is still broken, and even for a dollar, a tenth of what i paid, I don't beleive thisis worth your time. There are better free games on steam.
1684	0	a	It's ♥♥♥♥, but when they decided to make it look better, they just made the game more ♥♥♥♥, so now its ♥♥♥♥ covered in ♥♥♥♥ 10/10 its ♥♥♥♥ `ign
1685	0	a	A poor quality game, poorly optomized, barely functional, and all around garbage. Everything that this game does, is stolen from other games, which do it a hundred times better. I mean this game isnt a -20 out of 10. but its like a 1 out of 10. its not even so bad its funny, its just dreadful. I got a four pack of this game for like 3 american dollars on sale, and I want my three dollars back. Id rather buy a soda or something.
7941	1	a	Got It Free Cant Really Run It Got Bad Specs
7943	1	a	super great game u have to get this game
7945	1	a	Is good... Don't let those damn critics let you down... Give it a try for pete sakes! Though this review may not sound promosing, try it, play it, and then come here and try to prove me this game is a downfall.
7947	1	a	Some of the most fun I have had in any FPS besides the half life series.  It's worth 5 times the pricetag.  You get dual pistols, flamethrowers, jetpacks, and mechs, and you fight FRICKING dinosaurs, with beautiful gameplay, this is one of the best co-op FPS's ever made.
1687	0	a	this is the worst game ever I paid for it and the grafics are bad most of the game is noobs the worst thing there is no planes or tanks 
1688	0	a	One of the worst games I've played in a while. Worth about $1. Maybe. Player has one life and that's it. When you die you lose ALL progress. Every weapon you purchased, every augmentation and you start over at the beginning of the game. That's honestly worse than the arcade games I used to play in the 80'S. At least with those I could put in another quarter to continue.
1689	0	a	This Game is Horrible
7949	1	a	ITS FUN at bit laggy but fun all the way! 
7951	1	a	Great fun, cool cartoony graphics, bugs seem to have been cleared up pretty neatly showing that the developers behind it care and are willing to support the game and its community.   It is extremely cheap so I do recommend buying a 4 pack to share with your mates as the most fun is offered in CO-OP with friends. :P overall, definitely get this game! :D
1693	0	a	Server's dead. Bored now
1694	0	a	I remember playing this game on launch. Multiplayer was unplayable, singleplayer was barely playable. Since then it has come a long way, now I can call it a game without feeling too bad about myself. BUT saying it's a game now, doesn't mean it's good. Weapons sound like peashooters, graphics are washed out and ugly (this is what happens when untallented person gets hold on an Unreal 3 engine) and the general gameplay is not very entertaining. But it is much more stable now and you no longer see raptors spinning in place, so that's a step up.  There's just one more thing that needs to be mentioned: the game has changed it's title multiple times, it came from Orion: Dino Beatdown to Orion: Dino Horde to Orion: Prelude. Why is that? To escape the bad reviews it's gotten in the past? To trick people into thinking it's a different game?
1695	0	a	This game is so bad, it's like watching Louis Smith doing maths and english AT the SAME time.
1696	0	a	The worst game i ever bought! Bad graphics, not at all fun game mode, ugly looking character, not creative weapons and the boring dragons.
1697	0	a	The frame rate is so low, it is unbelievable, I had an incredibly low resolution setting on, and on an I5 Processor Windows 7 Ultimate hardware and it was unplayable, my friend has a fully working operating Windows 10 Computer, his was still laggy, DO NOT BUY, laggy to hell.
7953	1	a	This game got a 36 for a metascore. Are you kidding me? This game does not deserve a 36. It's a great fps, and the different modes are really cool. The graphics arent great, and there are some bugs. I've gotten stuck in many rocks and stuff, and dinosaurs get stuck too. Also, the game should have bots. Sometimes i just feel like playing a team deathmatch, but i wanna play alone. But you can't. Your guy just stands there and it says waiting for players and every few minutes a dino will run by. However the game has some very cool features including many guns and upgrades. Plus, I bought the game for only 99 cents. It goes on sale all the time. In fact, as I'm writing this it's on sale 1.49. With a few updates it will definetly be worth the $15. I'm not sure it's there yet though. It's definetly worth $1 though. If it gets really cheap, you should try it. Some people love it, some hate it. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10, because it still needs a few changes in my opinion. But it's still fun the way it is.
1698	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless you have a very good gaming computer. I can normally run any game at 50-60 fps on good video settings. This game? Absolutely not. To get it to run at 60 fps, I have to make it look like it was made a looong time ago. At that point, all the intensity and excitement are pretty much gone, the tall grass blocks half your screen, and its pretty much just pointless to play. Worth the money but if you want a fps with dinosaurs, buy Dino D-Day.
7955	1	a	Its okay, it could use ALOT of work.  The Good Multiplayer/singleplayer Tons of weapons Tons of vehicles Customization Gamemodes  The Bad Weird Animations Being unable to connect to the servers  Buying outfits (Really Trek -_-) Glitchs/bugs Able to get to spots and survive for insane amounts of time TEH LAG!  Thats about all I can think of. No game is perfect, I like how Trek is stil working on this game and updating it.  My opinion: Would play 6.5/10
1699	0	a	It's endless rounds of the same objectives over and over, there is no winning this game. You instead keep fighting hordes of dinosaurs until you die, then you can try to do better again I guess. It has ZERO plot, dinosaurs and unnamed futuristic Soldiers. This game must have taken the designers all of three minutes to come up with. I was hoping fr something like Turok and was very disappointed.
1700	0	a	its a crappy horrible game. 0/10 wouldnt install for anything.
1701	0	a	Doesn't work. Thumb down.  Pc specs:  Asus 8GB ram. Intel core i7.  The game doesn't even work on low settings... 
7957	1	a	This video sums it all up.  https://youtu.be/zoHFWd1qi0c 
7959	1	a	This game is amazing it has warthogs lightsabres hornets and spartans. If you like star wars and halo this game is aids
1704	0	a	Nearly reached 1hr of gameplay i played 59mins in fact it was so awersome that i decided to delete it right away By the way devs i enjoyed best uninstall simulator evur gg iluminati out of 10
1705	0	a	I thought I'd give this a shot since it was so cheap but honestly I could not enjoy this game in any way, shape or form. This is just my opinion and who knows, maybe you'll like it more.
7961	1	a	i love it I GET TO KILL ALOT OF TREX 
1706	0	a	Game sucks
7963	1	a	ORION: Prelude is the best buck I've ever spent on Steam. That single dollar got me a game that's half Turok half Killing Floor with awesome weapons, fun perks, expansive maps, nearly ten different game modes, and offline bots. Admittedly there are still some glitches to mend and polish to apply, but for the dirt cheap price of the game, you get what you paid for and more! So what are you waiting for?  Purchase the game Download the game Launch the game Open the door Get on the floor Everybody kill the dinosaur
1710	0	a	Very confusing for someone who rarely games, and even my brother who games a lot said it was very confusing. In at least the demo there were absolutely no instructions at all on how to play/what the controls are. I had to search a bit online for some help, even then I didn't figure out all the controls(I just started pressing random buttons to see what happened). Glad I didn't buy this game to be honest.
7965	1	a	♥♥♥♥
1711	0	a	This is absolute trash. Avoid.
7967	1	a	It is an ok game and it is definitely worth the fabulous price of 1$, it is pretty fun with multiplayer, there is workshop content and it can be played with a controller. It is laggy a lot but worth 1$, I had fun with this game. it is decent
7969	1	a	Best game for 1$ you can find on steam.
7971	1	a	This game is LOADS of fun its like a combonation of Halo and Jurassic Park!
1713	0	a	What a waste of 99 Cents.
1714	0	a	Play it only with friends.
7973	1	a	Its a game about killing dinos with swords,lasers,bows,rockets,etc. and theres hats and its 1 dollar  It be stupid not to get this game No seriously buy it! You think i left? im still here. Waiting for you to buy it...... I can do this all day........
7975	1	a	Killed a stegosauraus by shooting it in the ♥♥♥♥. 12/10 BEST GAME OF ALL TIME
1715	0	a	I did not like the game
1716	0	a	♥♥♥♥/10
1717	0	a	bad optimization. I meet minimum specs but still forced to turn town resolution and graphics-everything looks like ♥♥♥♥
1718	0	a	Orion: Prelude a game where you get to protect power generators and shoot dinos! Sounds fun right? Tried it out, guns sounded generic, abilities seemed a bit uninspired. Dino models looked great, gun models looked pretty decent, but the game crashed. Combine that effect with a lack of single player story and well... you get to shoot dinos right? Unfortunately the games not for me, you don't get to build anything permenanet, design any dinos, and from asking around all the matches, waves, and spawning rates are typically the same. I am not able to recommend this game.
7977	1	a	Graphics: 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Performance:10/10   When I bought this game I was expecting a broken peice of crap game. HOLY &amp;%$# I was wrong This game is addictive fun and great for co-op teamwork though a few of the gamemodes and a little broken. But the makes that up with Halarious Ragdoll glitches like a T-rex doing a flip. or a Raptor freaking out halfway in the ground. This game is not something new it reminds me alot of other co-op games but thats the point of this game it's a time killer game, for say you got 40 minutes to kill. This game will eat that 40 minutes right up. My verdict is a 9/10
1719	0	a	I dont realy like this game, the graphics..nah not that good.Best graphics since Atari 2600 :/ the gameplay, more like ♥♥♥♥ play.the idea of hunting dinosaurs in the future,what i thought they were dead.sorry 2/10 :/
7979	1	a	The best game you can get for that price :)
7981	1	a	really great game! Zombies gameplay but with dinosaurs is brillant! the weapons and graphics fit quite well with the era(whatever era it may be anyways) and the objectives and conquest are deffinitly the winning game mods here! they've done an amazing job with this game and i can't see it going anywhere but to the top!
7983	1	a	Although I have only put about 5 hours into this game (as I have to update it and been wanting to install other games first), this game is addicting!! Halo meets Star Wars vs Jurassic Park! Incredibly broken but my brother and I couldnt stop laughing from the sheer insanity of it all!! Shows what a .99 game can do and outshine some of those games that want $19.99 and are just subpar. What are you doing here still? BUY IT MEOW!!!
7985	1	a	It's a fun game, simple, slightly stupid, and way more fun than I had expected from it. It's worth the 15 dollars you can usually get it for, but I've seen it on sale for 93% off a few times, and i'd recommend you stock up on a few copies for you and your friends any time it's on sale.
1723	0	a	Game is ok if you are borring. This culd be Free to play... not worth spending money for this. 
7987	1	a	the best thing is if they will come with a dino mode where you can play as a dino vs the humans  
7989	1	a	I have this game from 2013. This is my review. -2 million copies sold becouse game is good and only cost 0.79€ (for me idk for dollars) -good snipers -while being downed don't need player to get you up.just kill dinosaur! :D -skins for pistol? i perfer golden one. :D or magma -Customizing charachter and showing middle finger as taunt :D -Can be Fps and third person -i didn't play 2 weeks game and i accidently got 12k. Was that helpful to buy game? Maybe
7991	1	a	This game is amazing... Screw all the hater... Any game that you can use a piece of ♥♥♥♥ piss colored lightsaber is obviously a pretty amazing game. This game is so good that you can run into a trex and he doesn't die. The creators of the game should now own call of black ops 5 san andreas fault edition. It makes me want to make love to a dinosaur... In my dreams I picture that dinosaurs are still alive and ready to be made love to. I have completely changed my way of life. I now worship dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs. Dey R mye fyverote tyng. Eye Love them with a passion.. Withoute Dynosurs i would have no luve in my life.. If i could make love to evey dino every I wood.
7993	1	a	When this game is on sale, it is TOTALLY worth it. Its a fun, fast paced, easy to get into first person shooter. I bought it for $0.49 and it was worth every penny. I have only played about 2 online rounds but still like it a lot and will be playing it more.  If you're looking for some kind of long story line, and tons of depth, this isnt it. Its meant to be SUPER easy to get into and get out of.  Although, it is buggy and I think the dinos get way to close to you and its hard to see them. But all the settings are there, FOV slider, textures, AA, so forth... Like it is going to get more and more attention as more people buy it. But it is not meant to be this super realistic game, just meant to be fun.
7995	1	a	better than takedown 10/10
7997	1	a	This is Halo of Jurassic Duty 2 or Call of Jurassic Halo 2. This game is so cool and very fun to play
7999	1	a	This game is the reason I wake up in the morning.   Acid shooting dino/10
1728	0	a	WHERES TUROK ??
1729	0	a	this game contains so much aids
1730	0	a	it sucks  
8001	1	a	This game is wierd. Dinosaur nazi zombies, except without the nazis or zombies. I have a mixed view about this game. It is well animated and the graphics are great. The weapons work well and fighting huge dinosaurs in a round system could not have been done better. I feel this game isn't deep enough, even though you pay to play, you have to pay to customize, which might not be so bad. Also I think it would have made a good freeroam game. Not survival. But for what you pay for, I suppose its all right.
8003	1	a	Such a fun addicting game worth 100x the price I bought it. Deserves GOTY. What. A. Game.
8005	1	a	Worth a dollar. In all other regards-... god awful.  Glitchy mess, feels like premade unity assets.. controls in general feel muddy. Could also really do with a tutorial.
8007	1	a	Killing dinosaurs was never this easy!
1733	0	a	Didn't have any intro or any tutorial. Graphics are bad. Really, I don't like any part of this game
8009	1	a	This gud game make me happy, fun playing with friend.. ( can i get spiral coin without paying real money? maybe i can get it with complete a leve? )
8011	1	a	I LIKE IT BUT IT REQUIRES A VERY GOOD COMPUTER TO PLAY..
8013	1	a	This is a mainly multiplayer game but you can play versus bots if you really need to,though it is really not recommended to do so since that really takes away from the whole 'stay with your team to survive' feels. There's alot of diffrent gamemodes to choose from but mainly there's 2, atleast what I found, which is survival and Deathmatch. The game dosen't take that long to learn and the controlls are relativly easy to learn.It's a relativly fun game to play with some freinds on a LAN party.  It will most probably turn pretty boring after some hours of gameplay.    **** PROS AND CONS****  + Easy to learn +   Only cost 0.99€   Free-to-play + Lots of modes   - Edit: Early supporters that bought the game gets nothing in-game for their support - Not alot compelling about the game after yyou play certain matches on the main modes      *** Overall rating***  ***6/10***     
8015	1	a	Buy this game , if you want to waste your money.
8017	1	a	this is a great game. even if you dont play it you should buy it just because of what these guys have achieved here. to take an absolutely terrible game and turn it into this is just magical!
8019	1	a	For 99p you really need to be scummy to give this a bad review. (I'm surprised halo hasn't sued)
8021	1	a	Such a fantastic game for such a low price! Really like the concept of the game and the gameplay is ridiculously fun :)) I could run around and stab dinosaurs in the face all day! :D

8057	1	a	  Got this game for super cheap one day, and it is actually a lot of fun, you will run around with no idea what you are doing and still enjoy yourself. No it isnt the BEST FPS out there, but it is absolutely worth playing.
8059	1	a	what
8061	1	a	This game feels like halo 4
8063	1	a	amazing game would reccomend to 9/10 people if you like cool dinosours then buy this ♥♥♥♥ is some good ♥♥♥♥ like even dj khaled would play this game if he wasnt always riding his jet ski on the path to success
8065	1	a	Why'd you make it Free2Play? It's a total waste of my money!
8067	1	a	A game where you run around a huge, picturesque map killing dinosaurs what else do you need
8069	1	a	Friend bought this game as a joke. We played it for 3 hours straight. 10/10 we're getting more friends involved.

1753	0	a	'Incredible visuals and addictive combat.' Hmm, is it possible to file a lawsuit due to false advertising?
1754	0	a	didnt grabet me on first plus but i have to say that this game was the first game that i see a ''team vs monster''game
1755	0	a	The single and only shitest most unbalanced laggy peice of crap that I love for no reason. Now I'm off to uninstall.
1756	0	a	Do you recommend this game? a big NO
8071	1	a	This is some good ♥♥♥♥ right here
1758	0	a	I can't even joke about this. One of the worst games I've ever played.
1759	0	a	Get to the chopper
8073	1	a	Very great game to play for only $1 its got the best graphics
8075	1	a	I love this game, mostly because it's simply dinosaurs and futuristic guns/stuff. Also, I recommend the prelude to ITSELF, Guardians of Orion. 10/10.
8077	1	a	I honestly thought this game looked awful at first. Then i played it! Its a freaking fantastic little game, its fun, its different and it has dinosours! what more could one ask for?! The meta critic reviewers are just pompus ignorant $#*!'s who rate CoD:ghosts 73 for christ sake! Ignore the professional reviews and look to the actual gamer reviews that are mostly positive. The game is best played with a group of friends as playing with randoms can get a little iritating but over all its a good game. For its price, its un-beatable!
1760	0	a	like dinosaurs but with jetpacks and guns kinda  not very good
1761	0	a	I'm not going to rate Orion Prelude positively, as I found it to be lacking in different aspects such as soundtrack, regular updates, optimization, animation, ai, balance, etc. I will however say that you may as well give it a try with friends now that it is free
1762	0	a	Literally only 10 people are allways online
8079	1	a	This game was bad, now it is good
8081	1	a	its a fun little game if you can get some of your friends together, and with its cheap price its nearly impossible to say no... Now all i need to do is make some freinds...
1765	0	a	Pretty damn horrible even after 60+ updates The audio oh god , Sounds like it was made by a retard Grahpics were ok it did render horribly gameplay was ok it could get fun but it was mostly boring  voice actors gave me ebola 3/10
8083	1	a	Needs mor of that japanese puss puss
8085	1	a	A friend gifted this game to me. Though I'm not a big fan of these types of games (in fact, I suck at most shooting games), I decided to give it a try. At first I wasn't expecting much from a game that was a buck, but boy did we have a blast.There's a ton of crazy shenanigans you can pull off. Sure, the game has its own share of flaws, but the point of a game is to have fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more T-Rexs to clobber.
1767	0	a	I dont know what i bought it was 99 cents
8087	1	a	its cooh 
8089	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs.
8091	1	a	This game deserves all the money and high ratings it can get.
8093	1	a	Best game I have ever played in my entire life. My single life goal is to become a dinosaur and attack furturistic humans that have outdated weapons and jetpacks that last almost 5 seconds.
1769	0	a	Horrible, I feel ripped off for 99 cents right now. Bad game.
8095	1	a	Fun and super cheap right now
8097	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
1772	0	a	Buy it only on sale.
1773	0	a	officaly the worst game i have ever played thank god i only spend £1 on this peace of ♥♥♥♥. I have a pritty good gaming PC and this game can only run on 20 FPS on high settings and it looks like a monkeys ♥♥♥. It is falsely advertised as the screen shots look nothing like the game its self please just on one els buy this game it want even be worth it if they made it free!!!
8099	1	a	It's pretty good, but gatling gun is way too op. Just get it and you've already won.
1777	0	a	Orion: Dino Beatdown is an entirely broken FPS.
8101	1	a	A little buggy , glitchy and of course WTF Game , but for 1€ its just amazing with lotta game modes , Dinosaurs and that meh things . BUT! yes , There is BUT! If u have a slow Connection DONT BUY THIS GAME !
8103	1	a	really good game.. the rate of this game is not updated.. really fun worth the 1$
8105	1	a	this game needs a steam workshop for mods. NEEDS.
1779	0	a	Not bad but the animations are a 'bit' weird and not worth 11 €,i would take primal carnage and dino d day any day of the week..
1780	0	a	Worst game i've ever bought
1781	0	a	Not even worth 99 cence, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing pile of dog ♥♥♥♥ topped with asscheeks
8107	1	a	You NEED to have this game compatable with mac. all steam games should be for that matter.
8109	1	a	Extremely fun with friends. Casual game that yet requires skill and team work.
1785	0	a	Don't be fooled by the trailers. This game is surrounded in controversy, mainly due to it's main developer David Prassel. Among a long list of nefarious acts, Prassel has been accused of stealing elements from other games, laying off employees without paying them for work, and manipulating message boards to deflect negative criticism towards the game. In addition Prassel tried to rebrand the game formerly known as 'Dino Beatdown' into 'Dino Horde' to increase Metacritic scores; claiming it to be a sequel when it's more of a content update. Even if one were to ignore the game's depraved upbringing, the game with it's comically short T-Rex arms fails to grasp the lofty claims and over-hype created presumably by Prassel.  Ignoring the game's heavy influence from Halo, the gameplay revolves around a stereotypical group of 'space marines' defending bases against swarms of prehistoric predators, which in of itself sounds okay on paper. However, within the first hour of playing, any seasoned gamer with a critical bone in their body will start to see the game's inherent flaws emerge. The game which marketed itself around commiting mass dino-cide features a surprisingly laughable AI that would make a Stegosaurus roll in it's sedimentary grave. The dinos tend to path in a completely linear fashion towards the player which makes 'Dino Horde' feel more like 'Dino Queue' which really brings the atmosphere in the game to extinction. Taking high ground will often result in dinosaurs running around in erradic beelines as you frantically spray at them with shoddy hit registration until they die. Don't worry about the hit registration though, because all of the basic ground dinosaurs can be run down inside of invincible ground vehicles such as the Wartho- I mean 'Gladiator' combat buggy, making firearms completely pointless outside of killing large dinosaurs. No seriously, I ground dinos into lizard burger for an hour and was awarded top score for being the most unskilled player on my team before I logged off in bitter apathy.  I tried giving this game a fair chance, I really did. I tried looking past Prassel coddling his 'baby' like an overprotective parent, his apparently questionable business practice and his deplorable attempt at dodging Metacritic rating, Underneath it all though was only the husk of a game, a grand idea with poor execution, and unfortunately it will not keep the interest of experienced gamers. Don't get me wrong, this game can be a fun waste of time with friends, but you should be laughing WITH the game, not AT it. Until someone can nail the 'dino defense' game on the head, my dream will remain fossilized in amber until it's DNA can be extracted and brought back to life, which sadly will most likely not be anytime soon.
8111	1	a	What Can You Say About Orion Dino Horde??? Well This Is All BUY IT
8113	1	a	Super Random game that kicks ♥♥♥
1787	0	a	Buggy, boring, and the same thing every level. Fun at first, but gets boring fast. Not worth the $1.  3/10
8115	1	a	Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is so addicting. I absolutely love it. I immediately bought 2 extra copies to giveaway so my friends could enjoy it with me.
8117	1	a	GRATE GAEM I PLAI EVRI DAY AND I CREI EVRI TEIM. I qUIT MAH JOB TO PLAY THIS GMAE....SHREK IS LOUVE SHREK IS LIEFE...
8119	1	a	This game is like Turok on steroids. I really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes PvE games or dinosaur hunter type games.
8121	1	a	i'd say 4 hours of fun was worth AT LEAST $0.99
8123	1	a	very aweseom game buy buy
8125	1	a	this game is friggin awesome! deff would recommend it!
8127	1	a	Its like Skyrim but with dinosaurs! 10/10
8129	1	a	A little laggy and unresponsive, but probably because I barely meet the minimum pc requirements. Great from what I've seen. More than worth the dollar I paid for it.
8131	1	a	is this even a game-dankay kang
8133	1	a	Escaped by holding ctrl. 10/10
8135	1	a	Great game play it with friends :DDD
8137	1	a	This is the best FPS I've played in a long time!
8139	1	a	Awesome game! I was able to get it for €0.99 and I have to admit that the game is really worth it!  I love playing this with a bunch of friends, good times! :)
8141	1	a	IT LAGS LIKE CRAZY BUT THE CONCEPT IS REALY COOL SO PLAY THE GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS
8143	1	a	This game is Great but the thing is you need good graphics to run it my pc was running the game so ♥♥♥♥ing slow but if you got the graphics then buy it
8145	1	a	Amazing. Purely amazing. First i want to say, 93% off? That's freakin cheap. And i love it. I first played this yesterday for the 'limited time free game' thingie steam has. Instantly i checked the store page to see how much it costed. $0.99. Wow. Here is what i liked/didn't like about my experience.  PROS: Ya get to kill freakin dinosaurs with machine guns and rocket launchers! Great weapons (depsite being only about 25) Various gamemodes (There were only like 1 or 2 that i didn't like) Amazing concept, which was executed perfectly. Co-op PVP PVE Solo mode Slaughter mode (i freakin love it!) Play as a freakin dinosaur  CONS Single player is a bit too hard (so ya better have some friends) Could use more customization  Would i recommend this? Heck ya! i give this an 9/10 
8147	1	a	Wow... got this for a dollar, sooooo worth it. Funnest dinosaur game ever, and you can play as them, well how bout that ;)
8149	1	a	very nice game still better than battlefield 3 :D
8151	1	a	THAT IS ONE BIG PILE OF ♥♥♥♥!
8153	1	a	ITS AWESOME YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT 
8155	1	a	there are dinos and i guess one mode is kinda like halo. its really stupid... like really really stupid, but i paid a dollar for it. i've played like only 10 minutes of this game and i don't ever plan on playing it again but i guess it's like kinda okay. it seems like just owning the game is some sort of like elite club or whatever so it's kinda cool. the game itself sucks though. it's pretty boring and i didn't really have fun. if it's on sale for less than 2 dollars buy it though i guess.
1792	0	a	this is a buggy piece of shiz i literally have not gone one second in this game without it lag furthermore its not even a good game in the first place
8157	1	a	This game is very fun, although I doubt it before I played it. Absolutely worth buying. This is actualy great. I rate it 9/10, but it has sound problems and takes too much PC performance.
8159	1	a	Yeah This game is great the graphics could be alittle better but im not complaining . if natural selection 2 and halo had a baby, this would be it (even though u cant play as dinos) overall awesome game
8161	1	a	Just got it, can't wait to play
8163	1	a	DO NOT BUY. I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR 99 CENTS AND ITS NOT WORTH IT
8165	1	a	Selling gift of this game, invite me, we will make a deal! :)
8167	1	a	Hell, if I didn't have ping problems, it was 9/10
8169	1	a	Love this,not the best but it's really god :D
8171	1	a	Brought me a pizza.  10/10
1794	0	a	How to remove game from my account?
8173	1	a	I dont know .... like 7/10 -2 becouse the gameplay -1 becouse i waned to be DINOSAURS VS ROBOTS or something not BOTS DINOSAURS i want like in Dino d day .
8175	1	a	One match was really all I needed. It's my type of game but not polished enough for me. The graphics and sound aren't very good and the music is nothing spectacular either. Not to mention that the animations are really clunky and stiff. The gameplay is okay; it has a Turak and Halo combo. I must warn you though...I got bored right after my first match. There's no story or anything to this game. You just simply jump in and fight dinosaurs. There's 3 classes to choose from and they all have their own abilities. Assault has a jetpack, medic of course has a medic gun, and a stealth class that can go invisible for a short time. I also noticed I had a lot of connection problems which shouldn't happen since I have a gaming laptop. But some games will do this. I recommend it for a dollar only. 6/10
8177	1	a	Worth it
8179	1	a	This game is awesome! The idea of the game is that dinosaurs are trying to eat your team but you all have a different idea! Blast your way to victory! I really like how you can do like in Halo and have one guy drive another shoot the turret and as many people as will fit ride along and shoot there own guns like mad! It is really awesome when a T-rex grabs your car in its mouth and trys to eat it with you in it! Eventually it just throughs the whole lot up into the air! Tons of fun and you can play with your friends! The gameplay is awesome and the grahpics are too, especially at maximum! I defenitly recmomend this game!
8181	1	a	What a blast to play with friends. Some minor annoyances allong the way but for &lt;1$ I reccomend this to any and all people
1803	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played.
8183	1	a	Steam tells me I already own this game. I do not. What gives?
1808	0	a	Its pretty terrible. Not even worth .99 cents.
8185	1	a	It's fun but for a few hours play it doesn't look like a finished game but it's fun and i recommend it if you are looking for a game to kill half an hour with
8187	1	a	This game reminds me of Turuk
8189	1	a	dino's and swag 10/10 would jurassic
1811	0	a	This game is terrible, luckily it is the type of terrible that you can laugh at, do not buy in uless it goes under 2 bucks
8191	1	a	It is the best story game i have ever seen . Play and you wont cry!!
8193	1	a	super fun game but it needs work it has stability issues with random crashes and im geting 40 45 FPS but wan it works super fun i hope they add more guns maps and dinos
8195	1	a	5/10
8197	1	a	Its an amazing game, cheap and so worth the money. I'd definite suggest it, but i will warn you that the graphics could use some work, as well as the frame rate, if they could fix that, this game would be out of this world!
8199	1	a	10/10 would have rocks thrown at me by T-Rexs again
1818	0	a	its still pretty bad
8201	1	a	i played this game before when it was free for 7 days (twice) and now im waiting for a friend to buy it
1820	0	a	What a pile of ♥♥♥♥ for the third time.
8203	1	a	Played this game before seeing the metacritic review and was surprised to see how low of a score it got. It's actually been a lot more fun than i thought it would be, I've found myself putting hours into it so far and for the price it's worth it. Maybe because I grew up playing turok and loving dinos ( especially Killin um) that makes this game so much fun!
8205	1	a	Awesome game! Soldiers with hi-tech weapons and equipment against Dinos is just soooo cool hahah!! Really fun game, there are a few bugs here and there but It wont be a waste of money if you like First Person Shooter games AND KILLING T-REXes!! Plus the GMs are really active, so if there's any bug and they find out, they'll fix it as soon as possible!!
8207	1	a	Halo+Borderlands+Dinosaurs = The best 80p I have ever spent EVER!
8209	1	a	its not GREAT but i mean you can kill dinosaurs, and face it, how many other video games can you fight dinosaurs in? for .99 i would get it
8211	1	a	For $1 it has better graphics than call of duty and less glitches than battlefield.
8213	1	a	its trash 
8215	1	a	So I tried the free week with this game, its worth a dollar, but I wouldn't pay much more because the dev's are double dipping. Their selling you a game for $14.99, and than charging you for content in game using their in game shop.  Gameplay is really fun, it plays like a really big mod from a game like halflife 2.....its main downfall is lack of players really, thier co-op gameplay is pretty interesting, it feels like a mix of tribes and halflife 2  If you haven't tried this one and are bored, the co-op is worth a try.
8217	1	a	This is a great shoot the dinos game and a lot of fun :)
8219	1	a	cheap and fun
1830	0	a	it is so bad i can even think anymore
1831	0	a	the trailer made this game look like it was going to be a spinoff of ARK: Survival Evolved... but it turned out to be an arena game. At least it was only 50 cents! 
8221	1	a	Favorite game.  10/10  Maximum fun achieved with a group of friends.
8223	1	a	Don't go out and buy that packet of Doritos!   Spend it on this, it's amazing! Be sure you have friends you can play with though. Then you can 1v1, survive hordes of dinosaurs, or 5v5 pvp and even lightsaber duels!
1834	0	a	boring game don't buy.......... :P
8225	1	a	nice coop shooting game, they made the graphics better even.. well worth the euro 
1835	0	a	What am I even doing here?
8227	1	a	It was okay.  More towards a Halo Theme.
8229	1	a	This game's best quality (its price) is also its worst. Nobody knows how to play. Nobody seems to have their sound/monitors on to hear/see the giant 'Objective: 0%' sign in front of their faces. Nor can anyone hear 'protect the generator'. Its fascinating, really. Its like I'm playing this game on Xbox Live.
8231	1	a	omfg,evolve must be like this.There is 0.50$.T-rekt 
1840	0	a	LAG.......GY......A......S......HE.......CK.....
8233	1	a	This game is okay...   16 Hours worth of okay. 
8235	1	a	catchy game!!!
8237	1	a	Upset I bought this game and got nothing in return for them making it free.  Was a good game years ago.  EDIT:  I got helmets..
8239	1	a	This game is an amazing exmple of great developers. A few years ago, this ame was everywhere on steam with the reputaton of one of the worst games to be made and sold on steam. However, the developers instead of doing what a lot of game designers do (abandon their game), they stuck with it. They knew they had an interesting idea and in there, they just neede to improve upon the game, and they did. This game is now one of the most stupid fun games I have. I the developer's new saying, Games cannot fail, only developers can.
1847	0	a	i purchased this on my windows pc that meets the recommendated software and stuff but then when i go in the audio is all f'ed up and i get 1.5 frames per second and you said you fixed it if its not fixed in 1 week (a week because i dont think you did bug fixes in a while and i want a refund if its not working) ill get a refund
1848	0	a	Oh wow, this is free now?  The optimization is complete ♥♥♥♥, and motion blur is only noticable on dinos, not the camera.
8241	1	a	Much lag, is a hard game for the lag
8243	1	a	I buy this game and now it's free to play wtf DUDE i want money back please.
8245	1	a	i cant play it seid i had to donlode what i had 
8247	1	a	Paid £5 for a free game 5/7
8249	1	a	it's a game that's all :D
8251	1	a	A pretty awesome game I bought a year or two back, back then it awesomely sucked. You could walk through walls and the textures looked like super mario 64. Today me and my friend (that bought the game too) were bored, we thought about this but it just seemed TOO bad. Now, after I tried it , I can say this game is amazing. Its incredible to see how they developed it from a crappy dumb game to an actual good FPS . I was skeptical at first, but this game is ******* awesome. 
8253	1	a	Doesnt work properly.
8255	1	a	  This is a great game for only 2 quarters, it has actiojn, custom characters, good gameplay and nice graphics. This seems like you could charge like $20 for this. I really like the game and i highly reccomend it
8257	1	a	Orion Prelude is a weird game, you either like the game or completely hate it in every way, but for $1 i had to try it out and in my opinion its a decent game. Its not utterly terrible, but its not an awesome game, its an all around fun dino shoot em up. If you have a couple of spare bucks then by all means try the game out, if you like Halo and Dinosaurs then this is your type of game.
8259	1	a	this can all be decribed in one word... superfuntaculasamazeingaddictingbestthingeverdinosaursfulmazeing (pronouced- super funtaculas amazeing addicting best thing ever dinosaursful mazeing) NOW PLAY IT OR DIE OF OLD AGE!!!!1111ONE ONE ONE ONE UNO UNO UNO UNO BEARS BEARS BEARS BEARS  now walk the dinosaur
8261	1	a	I love this game. Its definitely worth the 99 cents. My friends and I like to take the cars and run the dinos over or take the flying ship things and have two people on the sides so 3 of us get air lifted to the next site. Its kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when one of us falls off and doesnt have the no fall damage perk.
8263	1	a	needs more harambe
1849	0	a	I hate it
1850	0	a	ripped my money
1851	0	a	The frame rate was horible, but its probably just my computer. I dident see an Open World gamemode only a Humans VS Dinos mode but i only played for 3 minuits because it was too laggy for me. the game looks really cool (the open world part) but i cant play it on this computer so i returned it.
8265	1	a	Cool
8267	1	a	Pay .99USD and then 2 weeks latter its free
8269	1	a	when I saw the game I fought it was bad, but when I started to play it. it was so awesome. Give it a TRY.
8271	1	a	Epic graphics, Epic weapons, Epic cars, Epic helicopters! Even better with friends!
1853	0	a	Interesting concept, trying to be a 'survive the wave' type game, I guess like a cross between Halo, Left 4 Dead, with dinosaurs. You can level up your characters to give them better skills, and drive around in various vehicles and buy new weapons to help kill the dinosaurs.   Very dated graphically, but even worse is it's not particularly interesting/barely existant gameplay, AI on the dinosaurs is a bit rubbish, they just run straight at you. Nowhere near as entertaining as the teaser trailer seems to imply. The level ups aren't particularly interesting, and the game maps are poorly designed.   Sure it's only a dollar, but there are a number of Free to Play FPS titles that are more entertaining and a better use of your time. I can only guess that all the positive reviews are trolling.
1854	0	a	this game is as bad as me being alive.
8273	1	a	Very nice game for only 0.49 euro :D
8275	1	a	So many people complain about such a failure the game used to be, just stop complaining and play the game for FUN, and not constantly talk about business within the game. Try it for yourself if you think you'll like it, thats why the price is down.
8277	1	a	I enjoyed this game for the first bit. It was better when there were more than 2 people online.
1857	0	a	One playthrough of 4 minutes and I've already been annoyed by buggy ♥♥♥ bots, buggy ♥♥♥ enemys and poor excuses for maps. I can handle the severely outdated graphics from a half life 1 engine but god damn this isn't fun.   Halloween Map titled 'Hell' is poorly recycled, with ear ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound effects and music in the startingbase. The map consisted of poorly reused flaming pumpkins littered everywhere. The only game changing feature being a incredibly unfair and seriously stupid looking pumpkin boss. This boss however made the game really frustrated by downing our poorly organised squad in the matter of seconds. Reminder that this all happened barely 4 minutes into our experience of the game and im already sick of this game.  Bad game 3/10
8279	1	a	bought it for cards. played it and its fun enough to play for a bit
1858	0	a	This game seemed good, but the graphics suck and it doesn't tell you how to do anything, such as buying new weapons. Also, the dinos horde around you after like 2 rounds and its pretty much impossible to escape that. DO NOT waste you 49 cents on this trash.
8281	1	a	10/10
8283	1	a	Some people hate this game others love it, if you are unable to play it is most likely your computer and/or your intenet connection.
8285	1	a	10/10 This game is pretty good. Also its easy get money to upgrade your weapons and the dinosaur are really  strong yeah. more games the dino are easily died and also i apperciate this game coz it really good and the map  are big and when came on the round 20 or 30 the dinosaur are getting to many. but the best for me the halloween  map 1 coz its pretty hard to kill the all the pumpkin dino. and this game is good. who make this good but the graphic  are not so good but anyway this game good.   🆅🅰🅻🆅🅴
1861	0	a	Sure the game is less that a $1. But it's real bad. About an hour of gameplay before you'll get bored of it. I guess you get what you pay for.
8287	1	a	10/10 Orion Prelubbed
8289	1	a	It was $0.60 so I bought it, idk.
8291	1	a	I feel badass fightimg dinosaurs with a lightsaber 10/10
1863	0	a	Worst game ever, but is still alright 
8293	1	a	Great game!!  Addicting and simple. 10/10
8295	1	a	I Saw My Frined Riding a Cockroach-Like Vehicles... While I do 1080 With Helicopter.  'Best 1080-Heli Simulator Ever' - 11/10 IGN
8297	1	a	Spend a little bit of time this holiday season playing this... festive spirit 
8299	1	a	It is a great game, but i am unfortunately no longer able to play it (not enough RAM) which is sad, due to the obvious amount of great content.
8301	1	a	Great and educational.  Now I know the difference between a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops. Sadly my friends have not yet caught on.
1869	0	a	This game has some cool features but I don't think they executed their plans good enough for it to be a good game. Gunplay is terrible on this game, dinosaurs are poorly textured if you ask me. It's always the same, you can go on for ages. A little bit too easy. After all I wouldn't recommend this game, this is also the reason why it became so cheap in the first place. NO.
8303	1	a	It's on sale 24/7 jesus just buy the damn game it's decent for the price
1871	0	a	black screen at launch:(
1872	0	a	0/10
1873	0	a	I haven't played this a lot yet, but so far the experience has been quite terrible. When I play with others the game seem to randomly lag like crazy. Also, monster animations are a travesty. Completely boring combat. I think it's safe to skip this one.  2014.10.02: I've noticed the game has changed its name yet again. It's at least the third time it has changed name. Pathetic.
8305	1	a	Got this game i dont know why steam counts hours wrongly i've played it for 900hours its worth the price its loads of fun even though it has some glitches i bought this 4pack 30times to support the developers :)
8307	1	a	A few things that make this game a damn good multiplayer: 1. You get to play as a T-rex and a Spinosarus 2. You get the same kinda gameplay as Halo and other high tech shooters 3. You get to fight said T-rex and Spino with mechs and tanks 4. Im The Bay Harbor Butcher  And yup those are all the reasons why you need this game
1875	0	a	For 99p this game is well... it's 99p so it's not a waste of money.  But for anything more then £2.99 let alone it's original £11.99 price tag.  --Cons -Bad graphics -Terrible game machinics -SUPER repetitive -Simply the fact that it's normal price is £11.99 is stupid in all -SUPER loud sounds for no reason -Nothing is explained and nothing seems to works correctly -No good sounds for guns or hit markers sounds -Not satisfying in anyway to actually shoot the dino's -Terrible model detail -Lacks FOV slider from what i could see -Buggy (Terrible dino clipping and pretty unbalanced and random)  -Pro's It really was only 99p on SALE. It had good game option
8309	1	a	This game rox
1876	0	a	Played A while Back When It had a free weekend deal thing ( Before this F2P version) It was Okay Then. Now it is bad. I think people who paid for the first game should get a refund. (not including me)
1877	0	a	Why would you buy this? It's awful..  No really it's awful..  GFX are in line with PS2.. This is like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's good, cept nothing is good. Save your $ and buy something else.
1878	0	a	i got this confused with primal carnage... this is not primal carnage.
8311	1	a	-10/10 beats cod and bf4 grafics togeter -its hard to learn the mechanics (like master yi )  -it cost a lot more than killing floor 2  -community filled woth 10 year old kids  -is no fun  -BUY IT
8313	1	a	A mash up between the future and the time before man. Daring conflicts to defend things that aren't really needed to be there. A cheap game and worth a try.   Only problem is, if your computer's crap. You'll face lag.
8315	1	a	Fun for a few hours with your friends, and is incredibly cheap, so I'd buy it just to play for one afternoon
8317	1	a	Good Waist of time, and money...
8319	1	a	looks pretty in 4k and runs well too.
8321	1	a	I dont even know what to say. It's a first person shooter.......against dinosaurs. Its......brilliant.
1882	0	a	Bought this game as a four-pack for some of my friends with amazing computers. NO ONE CAN RUN IT!
1883	0	a	This game, although cheap, is not worth 79p.
1884	0	a	I don't write reviews. But when I do, it's cuz the game sucked.
8323	1	a	10/10 got butt ♥♥♥♥♥ by a T-rex
8325	1	a	Dinosaurs, Guns, Vechicle combat and HUGE MAPS  What more would you want
8327	1	a	I actually expected this game not to be good.. Boy was I wrong. I love this game with a passion. It's better than games I've payed 60 dollars for. It's really fun. &lt;3
1885	0	a	As decent as this game is, it continues to randomly decide that I don't own it, and tells me to re-purchase it. It is in no way worth it's full price, but if you can snatch it for a buck, then you'd might as well.
8329	1	a	Be the only dude with guns to kill dinosaurs  They realize how good I am  Everybody in the server team up on me 1434/10 would play again
1886	0	a	its ok, crashs more than I would like and a lot of server drops.
8331	1	a	Things I got to do on Dino Horde: 1) Mech fight with a Stegosaurus 2) Knife fight with a Triceratops 3) Ride a TRex while shooting smaller dinosaurs from it's back  Why is this game rated so damned low?  Be interesting to see what happens if/when modders get ahold of it?
8333	1	a	10/10 would play for never 
1887	0	a	Boring Buggy Mess
1888	0	a	no server for sea, play at 200 ping
1889	0	a	I cant really play this game right now, until i get an better connection and see why this game is loved much, im not recommending it, personally i found it an bit confusing.
1890	0	a	played this and immediately hated myself for even buying it. 10/10 whould buy again.
1891	0	a	this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The first thing you see in the game is the main menu. Everything normal right? Well it isn't. As soon as I launched it and saw the main menu I witnessed my graphics card's temperature ramp up from 40º to 75ºCelsius. I changed my graphics settings to the minimum possible and I saw no difference. My framerate was still locked to 60 and my GPU was still running hot.  That's just one issue: Optimization. Let's get to the next part: Gameplay I haven't tested any gamemodes other than survival so I can't really vote on this one but I got bored almost immediately, using every class and playing in different ways. The weapon system is lacking and sure needs work.  Just don't buy this. Even for 70 cents it's not playable. Don't kill your gpu for a 70cents game.
1892	0	a	Your bullets teleport to the target, this game sucks.
8335	1	a	Still Better Than Jurassic Park  I Like This
1893	0	a	I played 16 minutes of this game and i hated it. The game is very slow and laggy and yet I feel like even though that it is free, I still feel like I want a refund for wasting those 16 minutes of my life. 0/10 would never play again.
8337	1	a	A really addicting game, which with a group of friends and the help of the community can provide endless hours of dino hunting.
8339	1	a	It's certainly fun, however at the moment the current playerbase (very small majority but enough to notice) is either rude or constantly being vulgar towards (usually new) other players. -- hopefully the movement over to Free-to-Play will settle this down since there will be new players almost every day.  Otherwise, I recommend.   NTM it's going F2P, support it while you can.
8341	1	a	fun game i just need friends to play it with :(
8343	1	a	Extremely poorly made game. Devs obviously have no idea what they are doing. ♥♥♥♥ poor visuals. Utterly disgusting gun sounds.  The game even has an in game cash shop where you can buy hats and looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥!
8345	1	a	i bought 4 copys of this game, might buy another 4..  its so great lol been gifting it to any of my friends willing to try it! it is crazy intense tho i only just got into the game i can see my self loving it for a long time to come
8347	1	a	defenitley worth ninety nine cents. I'd probably still get it for two dollars.
8349	1	a	1$? Must be some cheap little game not worth the time. Right? No, not at ALL. This game is L4D, Killing Floor and all those other survival games with a bigger and better twist! You gain levels similar to KF but you fight not zombie, not mutants but DINOSAURS! Not just cookie cutter dinos either, each and every dino has its quirks, TRex will throw boulders at you and eat you whole. Trikes will charge you and slam the ground. Oh, and don't forget the fliers, they will pick you up and slam your face on the ground! Best 1$ I've ever spent and its gone thorugh a big upgrade since then. I would definitly throw the dollar at it, as it is literally the BEST bang for a buck.
8351	1	a	Great game Transformation!
8353	1	a	Were the devs on an acid trip when making this game? 10/10 would have a good time with my best friends again.
8355	1	a	Sure, pick it up for a buck. It's broken, buggy, surface-functionable, and someohw the only game with a decent damn flamethrower, but it's HILARIOUS to start up a survival game with max $ and max dinos. It's like playing superman with no moral restrictions!
8357	1	a	I think it really is worth more than its cost. Good game
8359	1	a	Have you ever wanted to shotgun a T-rex in the face and fly away with a jetpack only to realise that he has the ability to bite the ground and throw it at you? Oh, you're in for a treat in this one...
8361	1	a	So this game is kinda like Turok. Like it's a dinosaur hunter  But it's also a defend the base, upgrade your weapons, ect. thing. Anyway. So we had a ♥♥♥♥ing tank. Like full on Halo Scorpion. Like this thing was heavy. Missiles and turret and ♥♥♥♥. And I was a medic so I could also heal us. And I was likewell dinos, I've got the invincible tank of death. GO MATT (my driver)! And then out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere a giant ♥♥♥ crocodile dinosaur pops out and we're kiting it and then a Stegosaurus rams us into him and then he hits us back into it while it's ramming us and we literally just ALL (dinos and us) fly into the ♥♥♥♥ing air while spinning as the dinos hump us to death and we explode in a firework of tankitude. Laughing so ♥♥♥♥ing hard I can't even. What the hell.  It won't win any awards and realistically speaking it's not out of beta or anything but man. Worth the $1.
8363	1	a	For 89 cents per copy, the game is totally worth it. If only for the ability to shoot dinosaurs- its fantastic. Despite a plethora of bugs, its the best dinosaur fighting game yet. That being said, the developers are pretty marginal as a business and studio. But for the price it is, the game is amazing.
8365	1	a	If you ignore the politics over game assets then this is a fun game!
8367	1	a	Why is this so godamn addicting
8369	1	a	halo x jurassic park= best game ♥♥♥♥ing ever! make sure u got some friends to play with or skype and have a great time 
8371	1	a	A very under-rated game that with a few friends is a VERY enjoyable experience
8373	1	a	This game is so MLG PRO. People that dislike this game are all n00bs, because the game has de best Graffix ever. Its all about trickscoping the Dinosaurs with Snipar rifles.
8375	1	a	It's €0.99  You can't lose.
8377	1	a	great idea very simaler to alot of sandbox shooters/consturction games my pc had trouble handeling the screen rate
8379	1	a	Really cool game its like playing Halo with dinosaurs on it
8381	1	a	Guns and dinosaurs? Much wow, such bite, much pain, so hospital, much swag, much death.
8383	1	a	a sick game
8385	1	a	Make sure you watch out for those Spinosaurs, dem mother♥♥♥♥as ain't just jackin' off in the corner, they'll ♥♥♥♥ in your cornflakes.
8387	1	a	Very good but too laggy for my pc and can't be played on my mac.Enjoy if you're not stopped like me.
8389	1	a	Great game only if it didn't try to burn a whole through my proccesor.
1897	0	a	should be a free game
1898	0	a	Definately no similarity to the Carnivores series of dino hunting games. Might be fun with friends, but when playing solo, it's nearly impossible to survive more than a few waves of dinosaurs. I hope developers create something similar to the old Carnivores games...this definately isn't even close to a real dino hunting game.
8391	1	a	This game is amazing. I'm woundering how could the metascore for this game is low. Coming from someone who loves playing co-op games, this is really fun. Gets really hectic and hard and it's just the way I like it.  Gameplay is Good Graphics is Pretty Awesome Scenery is Amazing if you take the time to look around  There are some bugs here and there that I found but nothing really significant that will alter the game.  Overall I really enjoy this game and is a blast to play with friends :)
1901	0	a	♥♥♥♥
8393	1	a	Somehow a game so cheap can be so fun. 100/10 IGN
8395	1	a	I dont even own this
8397	1	a	Halo, with Dinosaurs. Enough Said.
8399	1	a	First off, Metascore is way off. This game is very fun, very fast paced, and can be very challenging. Think Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs. They're fast, deadly, and they are relentless. Raptors, Compys, Tri-tops, T-rexes, as well as many others make an apperance, and that's just the horde survival mode. Level progession system gives you more tricks to keep you interested, while scailing dinos keeps you from plowing through unhindered. Believe me, when you've got a T-rex, stegosaur, and dinosuchus chasing your ♥♥♥ down, you'll wish it didn't. :P Highly recomended.
8401	1	a	It a ok game i think it need to look more realistic and have more graphics good job on the way the game work tho keep it up the work .
8403	1	a	Essentially, this game feels like Halo with dinosaurs and funny hats. And it's great!  Even by the time of writing this, I've not played much of it but I've already found it fun to play in. For the money you pay, the game is more than worth it. It's suprisingly solid for such a cheap game - the graphics are good, it has inclement weather and day-night cycles, there are pretty large maps, the AI work decently. It can also be pretty challenging in solo mode, plus it has multiplayer and co-op, so it can be fun for groups to play as well.  It's a well made game, albeit with a few bugs, but for the price you pay, why the hell not?  12/10 would dinosaur
8405	1	a	like halo... but with Dinos 8/8
1905	0	a	it doesn't seem to be running properly. i'm not sure if that's because of my system or an internet related problem, but its too frustrating to hold my attention.
1906	0	a	Barely playable.
1907	0	a	this game is very annoying everytime i try to play theres a computer type person who circles me the entire time i try to play. very annoying!!!
8407	1	a	fun PURE FUN the objetive is survive dinos or fight in team death matchs super fun glitchy yet fun i have ther way to say it 7/10 somtimes youll get fusterrated but thats ok just keep killing enemys i recomend survivle for people that like fight a horde of what evers but you survive grab objectives and rune back or even drive back cant wait to play some more :D
8409	1	a	LOl there is one question..... why is this game so demanding????????? i play chrysis 3 on medium settings with better fps then this game with low
1909	0	a	This game is the embodiment of an awkward child you don't want to sit next to at lunch.
1910	0	a	Just, not finished game...
8411	1	a	I AM CRAZY TO THE GAME
8413	1	a	I want a death match where a team is made ​​up of dinosaurs
1915	0	a	This game is so broken it hurts.The dinosaurs glitch around,the animation is garbage,the game runs like ♥♥♥♥ on my high-end PC on the lowest setting,and the fps keeps dropping and increasing every five seconds.Really don't buy it.Buy ORION instead.It's better in every way
1916	0	a	I expected a lot after watching the trailer for this game, but they still haven´t fixed a LOT of bugs, they should´ve started development of this game from the bottom. There is missing full controller support and it´s just not as good as I thought it would be.  4,5/10
8415	1	a	I find this game extremely fun. Not sure why, but it is. Maybe it's because it looks like L4D2. I mean, the objective is to fight with the horde. Back to topic, i recommend it, you'll find a lot of hours of fun here. I like the vehicles a lot. I found only one little problem in steering some of them, but it's not something upsetting. The idea is so cool. I wait for new upgrades.
1918	0	a	It has potential but its not fully realized the game's menus are absolutely horriffic and the chat menu is annoying as hell in game. It seems like a cool idea shooting dinosaurs but needs more polish. ALOT more polish.
8417	1	a	Trash publishers; good game though
1921	0	a	Not only has this game changed its name 3 TIMES. But its hasnt changed anything in the game itself, infact with the new 'and improved'''''' Prelude update, NOTHING is different from what have i found. I paid 15 dollors for this. Now its less then one..... Lie honestly. i dont have many hours in this game because it honestly sucks, like seriously. It looks like it was made on the unity engine, The gameplay is terrible, and the new 'horde Bots' that theyve added are reeally just random characters FULLY decked out with all the pay to win gear, plus, they dont even get attacked barely, It would be as if the dinos dont see them and come straight torwards the player. The screenshots are nothing like the game itself, it shows itself as a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends. WHen in reality it goes as follows ' Hey dude you get Orion?' ' No it looks like ♥♥♥♥' ' so what play it with me, il even buy it for you' I buy it for a bud, we play and after 20 minutes we give up, because its just that bad of a game. Multiplayers a drag, the guns are basic. The guns look all futuristic and that they shoot lazers..... No.... Its just bullets. No lazers or any of the sorts. The stuff that you buy in game affect the game in absolutely no way possible, There just ' Hey look at me i look cool i spent 5 bucks in game, Wait no one plays this game.' ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE IN PURCHASE ITEMS, AND THE LOWEST PRICED ITEM IS MORE THEN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF. IS ♥♥♥♥ING. RIDICULOUS. Dont buy the damn game, after this review I uninstalling as i just spent 10 minutes in the game. NOTHING IS CHANGED. just the name, for the third time. The meta score is right, it sucks. Even the loading images are the exact same. the class pictures are the exact same. the dinos are the exact same. the maps are the same. The AI is still the same. It is still the same ♥♥♥♥ ass game it was a few months back when i regret paying like 15 or whatever bucks for a game. Stay away from this. Seriously, unless your absolutely bored and u have less then 2 GB of storage to mess with, along with a mouse that if you can click 16 shots in less then 1 milli then your absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed in online PVP matches, run by the little kids who think there cool Because they host a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ listen server off there parents internet. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥, im out
8419	1	a	This game is one of the worst games I've ever played. The only two good things about this game are: 1. It actually opens, 2. It has an FOV slider. This game is an awful waste of time made by a bunch of lazy ♥♥♥ devs who can't make a proper game. -5/5
1922	0	a	Wait times are too long to get into the fun. You join a game, have to watch other people play for 5+ minutes before any fun starts.
8421	1	a	:)
8423	1	a	only when its on sale
8425	1	a	Its a cool game i would buy it even tho its $1 but really fun game to play with other players co-op game 
8427	1	a	I am able to pursue my dreams as a dinosaur hunter. I also punched a T-rex in the face. My life goals are complete.
8429	1	a	take jurassic park into your own disgusting neckbearded hands
8431	1	a	Very addicting!
8433	1	a	Yes, worth the laugh for 99 cents.
8435	1	a	dinosaurs for a dollar what not to buy
8437	1	a	Despite the metacritic's score, I found myself coming back to this game over and over. While I still use the same strategy and class, it hasn't stopped the game from being fun yet. My only complain at this point is the difficulty in hitting flying dinousaurs, as they sometimes get stuck in strange places.  Apart from that, it's a really fun game to play with friends, or with others online.
8439	1	a	GREAT GAME!!!! GOT IT FOR ME AND MY FRIEND AND ITS GREAT!!! (Is 40p on summer sale) I WOULD PAY £10 FOR THIS GAME!!!
8441	1	a	This is cool. U did gr8 m8 20/10.
1927	0	a	To simply put....Stay far away from this game if you have really, really poor server connectivity or a bad gaming rig or don't have a gaming CPU to begin with first off 7,000+ are playing this game and that's because they have GREAT server connectivty these dev's want you to create your own lobby and sit on your butt for about 2 hours or so until it's filled up but that will never happened do to a laggy, or buggy interface during finding online matches   I really want to love this game but the fact that it doesn't have it's own 'sever check program' and what that means is that the game if it has online mode should've checked the player's online/internet connections to see if his or her rig is up to playing and or connecting to a game or even play it for that matter the fact that it may cause spazzing during loading time and has the main menu glitched into the loading screen causing THAT to spazz out....what that really means basically is that the game 'can not connect to host'   If you don't have the patience to wait hours and hours on end for people to join your sever then don't play this game, delete it and play something else with better server connectivity and a very next to nill buggy interface.  Lastly two things:  1. Don't trust Metacritic because that review was from a different game honestly the game by checking out the screen shots feels like a 8/10 for some but for me? a 7/10   2.Don't trust the reviews by the gamers for this game what they failed to mention is that this game will be great to those who have a really, really good gaming rig with best online and internet connections and really, really bad to those who don't have a great gaming rig
8443	1	a	My thoughts: At first this game was unplayable because all of the lag but I fixed it after playing the game I just have to say that it's 'ok' not the best game ever but it's ok this game is worth 99 cents.  About the game: This game is a shooter you go wave to wave shooting and pistol whipping the ♥♥♥♥ out of Dinosaurs theres a bunch of modes. King of the Hill, TDM, Free for all and survival ETC.  Pros and Cons: Pros.  You get to pistol whip Dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs!  Mother ******* Dinosaurs!!!!  It has Coop  Cons.  A lot of lag on some platforms: how to fix it   http://steamcommunity.com//app/104900/discussions/0/864976115810928810/   It would of been better if it had a story.  Anyways I hope this helped you have a nice day :)
8445	1	a	fun game and now its one doller i couldent resist :3 thx for changing the price.
8447	1	a	i love every thing in this game i givce it a rate of 19/10
1928	0	a	the game seems like its an amazing concept. but thats it. after 5 minutes in game i fell through the world 4 times, failed to buy guns, was thrown into a server with no explanation on the controls and was eaten by a dino twice. after which i figured out how to use my mic by going into options and was explained to by another newb how to buy guns. the next time i respawned i couldnt move or use in game chat. i havnt seen a game this buggy since i played CS 1.6 with a ping of 800 on dial up. the developers are just trying to boom support for their kickstarter which i hope they fail because they dont desserve to be in business with a game this buggy. i fear to even consider what it was 'before' they 'fixed it'   0 stars
8449	1	a	i have never seen a company care so much about there players. they pump out updates every almost every month and there completely free. This game also has some of the best co-op of any game i have played. Keep up the good work guys!
8451	1	a	Drove my friend off a cliff while driving and survived. He's dead.  Watched someone use their final breaths to crawl towards the broken generator and I cheered him on. He's dead.  Chased some poor guy as a spinosaurus, caught him, and grabbed him with my mouth. He's dead.  Played Vital (PvPvE) against some guy and he was mauled by dinosaurs. He's dead.  I'm all alone.
8453	1	a	IT S COOOLLL AS HEC
8455	1	a	Game is actually really good. Would buy again.
8457	1	a	Too little time played, but I sure did enjoy what I have played. Don't mind any issues in the slightest, other than the disconnection my net caused. gunplay is fun, killing dnos = fun, price? not an issue in the slightest. 'Tis a must play with friends.
8459	1	a	Move over Turok, there's a new batch of Dino slayers!
8461	1	a	0.72 euro , preaty cheap for a game like this play cs:go one day , get this game , shoot some dinos , have some fun for free !
8463	1	a	The video game equivilant of the dinosaur toy you buy from the 99 cent store as a kid: you can tell it's cheaply made, but you love playing with it anyway. Also, it was only 99 cents.
8465	1	a	Have fun with your friends or the bugs or both.
8467	1	a	they changed the name 3 times now.
8469	1	a	i mean it was $.99
8471	1	a	Punched a rude T-Rex then a Pterodactyl tried to show me this really cool cloud and he dropped me, overall a very good looking and feeling game. A solid title worth picking up.
8473	1	a	Laggy and crashed during my first game but seems fun.
8475	1	a	good except I CANT CHANGE THE ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROLS PROPERLY. ♥♥♥♥ING FIX IT. IM TRYING TO CHANGE SCORE BOARD TO SELECT BUT IT CHANGES JUMP TO SELECT
8477	1	a	make a version of it for ps4 it will be awsome 
8479	1	a	This is a very interesting game. I've only played it for a little, but I think it could be interesting. However, right now it seems a little rote. Perhaps the more I get into it, the more I will like it.
8481	1	a	one of the only games where im better than everyone else one of the only games that cost 99 cents and i ask why a game where you can get chewed up though a wall  34/16
8483	1	a	A bit buggy at this stage, but at its heart a bundle of mindless fun!
8485	1	a	Charged into a pack of dinos with no regret, Didnt die 8/8
8487	1	a	Good game. Offers lot and lots of fun, even more with friends. Fun concept and easy to learn. High variety of guns, you can play with ( obviously not with dinosaurs ). I found it more enjoyable in co-op mode, not playing as dinosaurs that much. Again you have to decide on your own playstyle. Recommended!
8489	1	a	THIS IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME ON SURFACE OF EARTH 
8491	1	a	this game is fun and very addicting.
8493	1	a	absoolutsly awsome, i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes action packked FPS games
8495	1	a	GET THIS GAME!!!! I have played this game for 100+ hrs over 2 accounts, lvl 29 and 39. and its only a dollar, so u dont have to spend forever saving up you money if you are younger.
8497	1	a	For $.99, 10/10,000 BC/AC (In what year is this again?).     While flying I killed a flying dinosaur, then I landed to kil some walking dinosaurs, and then a person from the other came to sabotage our reactor/core/whatever it is and f***ed our team (but I don't care, I killed taht b***ard anyways). [/spiler]  
1930	0	a	Controls are bad, visuals are bad, options menu does not save changes.
8499	1	a	This game truley cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. One moment it was Orion: Dino Horde. Now it's Prelude It once cost £1.35, then it was free for a while, not it costs £0.79. Once it had a leveling system instead of a ingame real-money store.  Overall this is only good if played with friends.
1931	0	a	Eh this game gets boring after 30 minutes when bullet sponging, repetitive layouts, and terrible connections plague your experience.   &gt;inb4 gr8 b8 m8
8501	1	a	  DOPE game for 99 cents....
8503	1	a	i hate this 
8505	1	a	Cool game but I'm preety sure you need high graphic PC to play this game but it's really fun had fun shooting Dnosaurs and teaming up with people to kill and last a long time against fighting dinosaurs.
1934	0	a	One of the worst games I have ever played. No instructions on how to get started or what you're supposed to do.
1935	0	a	Very buggy, alot of glitches, fun for 10 mins... 
1936	0	a	not a very good shooter. Good if you have no money and a subpar computer .
8507	1	a	holy cow the uninstall button really works best 1 dollar ive ever spent 
8509	1	a	This game will leave no jimmy unrustled
8511	1	a	meh. better than cod i guess
1940	0	a	Even though it has a gamemode where you can play as a dino but its not that fun deinosuchus hardly works for me i cant kill anyone I hate that my fav dino raptor only has one attack never choose raptor if your playing with pro players I dont even try to play as compy ptera the only dinos that are good spino,trex,triceratops,stegasaurus i didnt even remeber the rest of the dinos if there are more even for the price its at i still dont like it
1941	0	a	I do not recommend this game considering it was gifted to me by a friend to play early, now they want more money again. Something wrong there. Not worth it as far as im concerned.
1942	0	a	Although it is much better then Dino Beatdown, it is a poor excuse for a game still.
1943	0	a	Horrible game with horrible graphics... Also there are a lot of bugs for example sometimes its not showing that the gun firing effect while I m firing... Also graphic optimization is horrible as well and there is not goal on playing any map. This game do not deserve to play. Do not buy it and do not make some useless pc programmers rich...
1944	0	a	This is Bad
8513	1	a	Get it on sell I bought a 4 pack for $3 me and friends love it so much
8515	1	a	this is not a good game i have to say. but if you have a day off at work. maybe spend your spare time playing this.
8517	1	a	this game is great!!!!!!
1946	0	a	Frame are complete ♥♥♥, and it's not because of my PC. Worst optimized game of all time, uninstalled
8519	1	a	Drive around in a jeep with an auto-aiming gun, firing at extinct dinosaurs with high technology.  I'd play more if it wasn't extremely laggy for me. Fun game, though. Cheap, too.  Play it. 
8521	1	a	GET THIS GAME...just do it.....its ♥♥♥♥ing nice
8523	1	a	10/10  best game ever  because DINOSAURs
8525	1	a	If you combine Call of Duty Zombies, Halo, Turok, and Jurassic Park, you get this game.
8527	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the ♥♥♥ with a bow and arrow and it died. 10/10
1948	0	a	i was tricked by all the good reviews into downloading orion,its nothing new and not worth ur time,terrible bad grahics,bad font,game screen looks dated and biggest downer was tht as i started playing i thought' what the heck?' im running faster than dinos and its almost like a arcade shooter or a shooting range hitting carboard like dionos,so u can hate me for putting it like this...but u dont want to do this - go play on ur mobile!
1949	0	a	I dont like this game and I dont recommend it to anyone,you will have to pay it for 6 days,you just shoot in this game it has no point,so if you like first person shooter games without a story this is for you,but if you dont you shouldnt play it.It should be free to play,because its to stupid to pay for it.
8529	1	a	Definitely worth $.99. You can probably get it for less if you trade cards for it on the trading forum.
8531	1	a	dirt cheap for dirt gameplay
8533	1	a	I ♥♥♥♥ING RECAMEND THIS GAME 
8535	1	a	I RECOMMEND THIS GAME! or mybe not? hehe
8537	1	a	This idea should be picked up by a more capable developer, updated with better graphics and gameplay tweaks and could become like L4D with dinos
1950	0	a	Heyyo,  I bought it because the devs continuously build onto the game and that's cool and all... but it's still sadly broken when it comes to the AI... lots of the AI can be easily defeated by just strafing in a circle and it'll never catch you... so with easy to defeat AI? I can't recommend this game. There's better Swarm games on PC like Hard Reset.
8539	1	a	some pretty fun co-op for a buck.  
8541	1	a	Ok, I finally figured out how to rig my settings up correctly so Mr.Thriller-Rex doesn't find me, so lets try this again. WITH FEELING!  Pros: -Dinosaurs -Vechicles -Jetpacks -Gameplay thats fun enough to make it worth a try -A.I. isn't just going to run after the objective or you, they actually have somewhat of a plan. -Did I mention a large selection of large maps for PvP, witch incorporate all the above elements into the gameplay? Cons: -All the guns feel the same -So do all the dinos -Not exactly understanding why my controler will randomly stop responding, but ok. -When you buy one thing from the shop, you get another. Verdict: Overall, if you want a fun game about shooting smartISH dinosaurs, with futuristic guns and jetpacks, this is your game, while I didn't get to play coop, I would probably reccomend playing though it with friends, and not random internet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Best of luck to the developers, Luigifan.
8543	1	a	this game is awesome enough said
8545	1	a	Kinda like if Turok meets Halo meets Counter Strike. For 99 cents it's really fun. Even though the graphics are on Halo's level for some reason this game cooks the hell out of my video card.
8547	1	a	Good fun with friends, though there are some annoying bugs every so often, it can still be enjoyable.  Got kinda boring though.
8549	1	a	Drove off a cliff with a bunch of people       10/10 would drive off a cliff again
8551	1	a	i played it... But, The Animations of the Dinosaurs and the People are sucky. cool and awesome graphics though! R-Really Awesome Grapics!
8553	1	a	Use to be free for a weekend costed 4.99 (or 0.99) then now Free to play...         NO MONEY WASTED! :D
8555	1	a	I love this game! Its one of few games that I own that I not only like, but I am pretty good at as well. You really can not beat the price of only $0.99 which I am not sure if that is what I got it for or not because I do not remember when I bought it, but its worth more then a dollar! Most times when I play I host the game, and most times I stream it via  Stream.AWFordJr.net  which I use D3DGear to stream to Youtube. If you like FPS type games, then you may like this one. Its well worth the low price its going for. So get it!
8557	1	a	Nothing can go wrong with dinosaurs!
1951	0	a	Altough its cheap its not bad, but its not too good, lets go to plus and minus  +Its cheap +Dinosaur +Good graphic +Good control  -It doesnt have any player online -Its single mode suck -Bad AI  Maybe you should buy the new Orion game, its on Kickstarter
8559	1	a	Everyone needs to buy this game!!! It's amazing, and should be sold for much more then $1!!!
1952	0	a	4/10 it's not worth the $15
1953	0	a	never let me go into a game i just looked at people and things run by
1954	0	a	This game has good gameplay, but the idea of having to WAIT in order to respond, is simply ANNOYING; I'd rather be the dinosaurs and hunt the soldiers, instead!  But no; the GAME DOESN'T LET YOU CHOOSE TO BE ONE! Not in Survival mode, at least. This game is a decent deal for 3 bucks, because it currenty acts like cheap overrated shovelware. So, for effort, the designs and music are great, but waiting for SEVERAL MINUTES makes the only fun of waiting, being a 'troll' by making cheesy puns and jokes. If the game doesn't allow you to do that, then I'd be having much more fun, by playing Xbox 360 'kinect' games; as long as the controls work okay, and the gameplay is ACTUALLY FUN!  My advice? You can probably find better USED games for less, from certain 'bargain' stores; heck, I even found a copy of Freedom Force, (which still has the code, on the back of the CD case) for only 1 dollar! Heck, if I can't find a patch to make it work on Windows 8, I'd probably have to buy it on Steam, so it WILL MORE LIKELY WORK!
8561	1	a	cool
8563	1	a	Best Graphics ever. Possibly the greatest dinosaur shooter ever. - 1/10
8565	1	a	Fun and Hard meat Boy stile but chaotic wih friends
8567	1	a	Bought a lightsaber went to play Star Was with dinosaur  Dinousaur didnt like Star Wars Killed dinousar 10/10 will fight over Star Wars again  P.S RIP Dinosaur 2015-2015
8569	1	a	great game love it good gun good game play maps and cars so i can give it a 10/10
8571	1	a	an combo of starwars, dirsic park, tf2 and lots of fun
8573	1	a	ORION is a great game, I love it so much!
8575	1	a	HOLY !@#$ THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. DISREGARD THE METASCORE!
8577	1	a	This game is so silly. Play it with your friends without any expectations and laugh at how bad everything is. Hint: grab a car and run over veloceraptors and watch their bodies fly into the stratosphere. I'd avoid ramming a triceritops, i did it once and my car exploded, jettisoning me into a mountain and my friend into another time zone, dead on impact.   Buy this game for a dollar and enjoy a few hours of fun with your friends, then never play it again.
8579	1	a	Pretty fun game if you like facing off against waves of enemies.
8581	1	a	Kill the dinos
8583	1	a	Its a dollar, buy the freaking game. Its pretty damn good. Honestly, I think its worth 10-15, but im cheap. If you're cheap aswell, but it for a dollar.
8585	1	a	Fun, addictive game.  Arcade style shooter (think Counter Strike) with Halo fascia, and damn it's fun!   Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 8/10 Sound 5/10 (I've heard the music in other games, hmm..) Addictive 10/10  I can't wait to try out Team Deathmatch modes too (I've only played 2 'wave' type gamemodes, MANY different game modes)
8587	1	a	I highly recomend this game. there are dino's to kill people! bring this game back from the dead! as in there isnt many players nowadays.
8589	1	a	Halo 2 meets dinosaur survival.  One of the trailers quotes this game is a mix of Halo, Jurassic Park, and Killing floor, Id say thats spot on. I think this is the most fun game Ive played in a while. I reccomend everybody play this game for a few hours. Its just pure joy, and its not to intensive. Im playing on a laptop and it still runs very smoothly.  10/10 play this game
8591	1	a	Don't let the Metacritic review turn you away. This game is really good, and deserves another chance. Through months of vigorous patching and updating, this game is lots of fun to play. Really feels like Halo with dinosaurs plus mechs.
8593	1	a	Very fun game . PVP , PVE and shoot shoot and shoot :) Nice upgrades , nice weapons . I love it . And Nice Dino's :)
8595	1	a	-Installed the game because my friend said it wasn't as ♥♥♥♥ as it was before  -Joined a game  -Halloweene themed  -Fight a couple of dinosaurs and having fun  -Boss battle  -Friend says it's a T rex  -Same friend suddently starts screaming and yelling ♥♥♥♥ we can't understand  -Keeps repeating 'PUMPKIN!! PUMPKIIIIN!!!''  -Turns out boss is a giant pumpkin that throws you in the air  -Pretty intense battle with jetpacks and a lot of reviving  -Boss has still almost full health  -Teleports on a mountain and rains giant fireball on us, killing us.  10/10 Spooked out of my mind.  (Actual game is pretty fun tho if you get with friends. Kind of a shame that the whole character customization is a cash grab)
1960	0	a	PLS, Make me a favor, and don t buy this game, it s a poor ♥♥♥♥
1961	0	a	The game is bad. Probably one of the worst games I've played in many years. 0.5/10.
1962	0	a	This is madness
8597	1	a	- Disclaimer I am here for the gameplay, not the Legal issues, the amount of games that have had copy right strikes are deeply loved and no-one cared.  -Review Time. I actually enjoyed my time on this game, especially for a 1$ game, it is fun, character is customisable, aswell as being able to play as a dino.
8599	1	a	when people ask me if i like to play orion: prelude i look at them and say 'I CAN'T STOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP TOP' DOO DOO DA DOO DOO
8601	1	a	After seeing the price and the screen shots and game videos I knew I had to get it. Gameplay is great. Although I do wish their were more waves with bigger/more bad ♥♥♥ dinos. My only critic of the game is that it is extremely hardware intensive. Most games i play make my computer temperature around 40 at most but this game made my GPU almost at 56 at some moments.
8603	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Cant customise jack ♥♥♥♥ and the dinosaurs look like something my cat ♥♥♥♥ out.  -69/100 wouldnt play again.  Even for 99c it was ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.
8605	1	a	Rammed my friends tractor with a tank. Plenty of laughs for 1€.
1965	0	a	Its like a vegas wedding that you cant remember
1966	0	a	Selling tf2 key for a hat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8607	1	a	i would recomd ths game only if they put some new guns and maps but otherwise a fun and time killing game
8609	1	a	its bad, you should try it
8611	1	a	mlg seal of approval
8613	1	a	SO this game from customer side, looks little boring. But. this game is much diffrent when you play. its AWESOME !!! kill dinos, buy weapons (but you will lose them after last wave). i dont know why its too cheap. but its cool.
8615	1	a	This game has everything. Amazing glitches, laser rifles, and dinasaurs!  MUST BUY!  IGN - 10/5! GameReviews - 11/10! FunHaus - 9/11
8617	1	a	Very fun to play with friends you will have lots of laughs but playing alone can be sort of dull.
8619	1	a	Very good action-fps game, with motion blur and all that ♥♥♥♥'s.
8621	1	a	Amazing. Halo and TF2 mashed up with dinosaures and bathed in the madness of borderlands. Cheap houres of riduculousness .
1968	0	a	There's a reason its a dollar...
8623	1	a	This is my preferated game.
8625	1	a	Halo + COD + Destiny + Battlefield + Dino Day = Orion: Prelude  This game is AWESOME and I'm wondering why is so cheap?
8627	1	a	My friend got picked up by a pterodactyl. Then the pterodactyl dropped him and he got headbutted by a triceratops. 11/10
8629	1	a	U like killin dinos? Well i certainly did, funny game, though wont be fun to play solo or neither to long at a time.
8631	1	a	it didn't give me cancer. 5 stars.
8633	1	a	perfect game 10/10 easily best game ive played it has the fps feeling of call of duty but the strahtegy of chest. realist dinos its almost 3D horror action romance comdey all u can ask for packed into one game with famouse voice acter mr NOLAN NORTH!!!! vouce acts dinos and humans! at the same time! specialy desinged weapons for dinosores called dino guns you use ur dino hands to shhot people. grpahics like skyrim, action like mw2 and fun like league of legends get urs today and get urself a free dino gun in the mail.
1969	0	a	No wonder this game didn't cost more than a dollar.
8635	1	a	OMG LIKE LOL WTF ONLY 3 DOLLARS FOR 4 PACK AND 99 CENTS FOR GAME UNTIL FEB. 27!!AJSDKFOPIHPi!ohpou!UHP!!!!oihpOIHASPOIHIH!!!!!POIASDHFPAISHDFPOIDSHFPIHpoIFHpsdFpDFIHZSPODFIH!!!  
8637	1	a	Dinosaurs to sxc for me
1970	0	a	All i can say is the game is too repetitive...
1971	0	a	Polish a turd it's still a turd. Wouldn't recommend for anybody.
1972	0	a	I read some reviews of this game and heard it was really bad, so of course I bought a 4-pack to play it with some friends and laugh at the badness of it. I wish I didn't waste € 2.24 on it, it's ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous, don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game, it's not worth it even with the 51% discount right now.
1973	0	a	I died of a brain tumor playing this game. Support my ghost by not playing this game.
8639	1	a	The Metascore is really bad, but the game is so amazing its like halo but with dinosaurs ! Who wouldn't want that?
8641	1	a	it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
8643	1	a	I saw the meta-score. It was 36. I get demo. I fight T-Rex in a Tank. I buy :)  Tbh i have never seen a game transform so well. other than cod. ghosts was amazing am i right jk im go die now  9 out of 11 would crash jet into twin baracks
1977	0	a	Is boring!
8645	1	a	Well firstly,I thought is S**t,then i bought it and it was really cool,i do recommend this game
1978	0	a	BLAM THIS PEICE OF SH!T
8647	1	a	A great game to play with friends, sure it may be clunky but all in all a hilarious shooter where you can fight dinosaurs with mechs and tanks etc.
8649	1	a	the amazing prelude to Guardians of Orion, this game will give you endless hours of fun with friends online. definetely take advantage of the price, this game is worth well over the dollar you paid for it!
8651	1	a	Greatest game ever produced, the greatness is so epic, I am not worthy enough player to purchase such a godly title.
8653	1	a	The physics are terrible- in a good way!  The gameplay is exploitable- in a good way! The premise is stupid- in a good way!  A game so bad it's good. Dinosaurs are over the top and fun to fight. The visuals apart from the dinos are almost ripped from Halo (Which could be good or bad depending on if you like that) and has vehicles almost ripped from the same source (which once again, could be good or bad depnding on your opinon of the vehicles from that game) It took the jetpack, medigun, and stealth from Tribes and a gameplay very reminiscient of Killing Floor to create a game that is so unoriginal it is completely original. Too much fun not to play.
1979	0	a	THIS STUCK DAM T-REX CAME AND ATE ME 
8655	1	a	I may only have 0.2 hours on this game but let me tell you that with it being a mix of like Halo and a dinosaur game it is that good. rate 10/10 best $1.50 on the sale ive ever spent
8657	1	a	♥♥♥♥
8659	1	a	Fun game, best one of the best Co-Op FPS game since Killing floor. Love the concept the maps are big and easy to navigate. Graphics are bad, some stuttering when switching guns and muddy texture. The reason I reccomend this game is it is CHEAP and easily playable with a group of friends. Would like to see the player count go up to 8 or 10 due to maps being very large.
1981	0	a	I paid $20.00 USD, for this. Now it's $1.00 USD, I feel ripped off honestly. I bought the 4 pack. So this is not putting me in a happy mood. i'm glad I can buy it for friends now, but change your price back to twenty. Or are you just that cheap, like the Thai Hooker down the street! - Crimson Bolt.
1982	0	a	This game for me was too laggy. Can't join or play. Even if I could, the gameplay wasn't as fun as one may think. Sorry, but this game honestly isn't worth it.
8661	1	a	10/10
8663	1	a	bought it at full price GIVE ME SPECIAL STUFF
8665	1	a	it was a good game with freinds but alone its boring
8667	1	a	This game lacks polish, support and a good PvP multiplayer. However, i think it has very strong coop/singleplayer gamemodes, most notably Survival and Conquest. These two modes (even with all the mentioned issues) are entertaining enough to keep me playing. There are vehicles, epic guns and battles on big maps with changing weather and time of day. The difficulty can vary from really easy to extremely hard, so there will always be a challenge. The game has so much potential, yet it is wasted by the developers, but I still like it.  The game provides a great PvE experience. I recommend the game for people who prefer PvE and don't mind minor bugs. 8/10
8669	1	a	i like the game. i bought this for like 20$ and it came with 3 gift copies. wife and i played it alot had a good time the only complaint i have is that you need a good graphics card to play.
8671	1	a	awesome game love it
1984	0	a	Horrid.  You are much better off with Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day.   1/10
8673	1	a	ORION Dino Hord is a firstperson shooter/survivel game.You need to protect a genarotor while surviving you gest it hordes and hordes of dinosaurs. The way you look is like halo and you acn bye cooler armor to make your person look better. in all this game is a 7/10 and maby not worth evry peni but a good game!
8675	1	a	I got into a knife fight with a Triceratops and lost. 10/10 would play again.
8677	1	a	Great game with dinosaur fighting and good stratergy :D
1985	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
1986	0	a	Controller support is there but cant invert Y axis. So that's useless to me. Most servers are locked. I got STUCK on a building in first 3 mins of game play. Graphics look like original xbox.
8679	1	a	Cheap and fun.
8681	1	a	Flipping the bird while running over dinosaurs with tank -9000/10
8683	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
8685	1	a	what the ♥♥♥♥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
1987	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
8687	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
8689	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For ♥♥♥♥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF ♥♥♥♥.
8691	1	a	Nice game
8693	1	a	Had a great fun in this game and will be playing more during next lans. So good lan game
8695	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
1990	0	a	unoptimized garbage runs terrible on beast machines
1991	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a ♥♥♥♥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
1992	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
8697	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
8699	1	a	Few bugs there and here. Little bad frames, but you kill dinosaurs.  I give it T-Rex/10
8701	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
8703	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
8705	1	a	I love this game even if my computer can barely handle all the awesomness, its like I'm choking on minor lag multikills with the adreneline weapons (my comp's fault not the game). I give this game a solid 10.
8707	1	a	Savage Dino and Reptile killing simulator 2016    Best game..
1996	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
8709	1	a	Ad a campaing
8711	1	a	The best firest P shooter ever made and whith DINOS
8713	1	a	This game is definitely worth the price of a few cents. If played with friends it is extremely fun, however that won't cover the fact that the animations in the game were sloppy and jittery, the graphics were low poly, and the hud was too transparent. Yet despite all of that I really enjoyed playing the game definite reccomend.  TL;DR: Buy it to play with friends, it is like dino zombie survival.
8715	1	a	  ♥♥♥♥ graphics but is funish
1998	0	a	Played this game for not even 20 minutes, I got into a game at everything at medium and I get constant stutters, my team mates teleport everywhere and I had no f_uck1ng idea where any dinosaurs were cause I crashed a car into a f_uck1ng wall and died.  This game is honest ♥♥♥♥, I would've played with friends, but they refunded it, before it became f2p
8717	1	a	This ♥♥♥♥ing game is always a damned dollar. just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it. It's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's fun to play with friends. Or give the dollar to a homeless man. Whatever
8719	1	a	Gud game. Trailer sold me on game. Best 2k19. Worse than ark. Buy ark instead.
2000	0	a	Bad gameplay, horrible graphics, even worse optimization (I have 2x the reccomended specs!) And the lensflares are horrible, they burn my eyes!
8721	1	a	i wish if u can be a dino it will be so awesome
8723	1	a	This game is fun. Do you like fun? well, if you do enjoy fun, get this game. It is fun.   For ♥♥♥♥s sake IT'S 99 MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN CENTS YOU PIECES OF ♥♥♥♥.
8725	1	a	Fun game:  Pros: Great combat lots of action good voice chat for teamwork lots of maps lots of dinosaurs  Cons: only 1 air veichle only medics can revive the quickest game mode (if you do decent) is oven an hour. The longest is 4+ hours very bad port (it says press B (xbox B icon) to go back but you actualy have to press ESC and other stuff like this)  Overall I would give this a 6/10 because it is a fun time killer and game to play with freinds, I pearsonaly liked the game cube version better but then again 8 years ago that game was great for its time.
2003	0	a	I want to like this game, so bad. but inbetween a terrible player base and constantly losing connection ive yet to play a full game from start to finish. the 7 hours i played is not alot relatively speaking, but ♥♥♥♥, youd think youd at least play 1 game all the way through. Other players leave you to die, steal your vehicle leaving you stranded and take your equipment after you die. Not to mention the constant series of kicks ive gotton after simply going down once after i join 4 or 5 waves in.  If by chance these things dont frustrate you and you manage to hurdle past these issues, the connectivity is so wonky youll disconnect in the midst of a fire fight.  This game has a great premise and wonderful execution, iand i desperatley want to like it, but god damn is it hard. maybe my experience is unique to me alone but thats my review
2004	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.. It doesn't ever want to work whenever i start it up. It loads for a second then stops working when i try to play solo. It also doesn't let me join any online games. 0/10 no joke.... i paid money for a game that should be F2P since it doesn't work 
2005	0	a	its currently $0.99 i would reccomend you spend that dollar on a burger from mcdonalds...yes this game is that bad
2006	0	a	Buggy as ♥♥♥♥. Couldn't play as a result. You better off with a free flash game.
2007	0	a	Trash. but ♥♥♥♥ it was 99 cents

2010	0	a	Don't buy this, no one plays
2011	0	a	Overall clunky and unbalanced. There is a lot wrong with this game that I really don't feel like making a big review about it. It's just not worth spending any money on.
8727	1	a	cool and good co-op 
2012	0	a	I hated the first ten minutes of it.

2020	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
8751	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
8753	1	a	I found it a very fun co-op fps well worth the money, and I played it for hours on end.
8755	1	a	what the ♥♥♥♥ is this game and why do i like it so much   10/10
8757	1	a	Nice game

8761	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
8763	1	a	METASCOREⓡ is LYING !!!  Insanely fun coop survival / shooter game. Kill Dinos with bunch of guns and vehicles. ( Also lots of achievements for Achievement Hunters )
8765	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
8767	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
8769	1	a	It's cheap, runs smoothly, has servers running, some always populated, can play alone with bots to learn the game, LOTS of game modes, looks pretty awesome, sounds are good to okay, BIG maps, everything is customizable, has full X360 for Windows pad support, you can remap all controls on mouse+KB, or controller, did I meantion it's cheap??? A very under-rated game IMO, if more people played it, it could become popular, these guys did a good job with this game, My only gripe is 'some of the dinos are SO tiny/hard to shoot, but mele works okay on them (maybe they're baby dinos)'... everything else about this game save a few sound effects is awesome!

2024	0	a	Okay, so. Basicly your a dude who fights humans and waves of dinos. Pretty cool right? Wrong I didnt like how it was, there was nobody to play with and it was really boring.
2025	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
8773	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
8775	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
8777	1	a	there is no blood on the ground, only at walls 
2027	0	a	Not worth 20$. When I play Orion:Dino Horde, I think I'm playing Halo but I'm slaughtering hulking dinosaurs instead of convenants. Overall, the graphics aren't too bad, but the AI for the dinosaurs are a bit messy.
8779	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
2028	0	a	Listen Ok I really enjoyed this game it was pretty fun but not for the price I got it for you guys got it for only a buck do you know what i got it for 15 dollars the only reason i wouldnt recommend this game is i didnt get my money back if i get my $14 back I will recommend it
2029	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
8781	1	a	Really fun for a bit, but I get very bored very fast, which is not the best of things to happen in a game.
8783	1	a	0 hours played but hey its 1$ and it has guns and dinosaurs thats a winner in my book  will release a full extensive review on this game
8785	1	a	Astonishing gameplay - Extreme fun and proves a challenge.
8787	1	a	I wasn't expecting much  I am very happy I bought this, and in fact purchased a copy for my buddy in Mexico! I ried Dino D Day and it left a bad taste in my mouth, so I checked this one out and I LOVE IT! Yes it's a bit low budget, but it's not a bad game by any means. It has elements of a good RPGFPS that has some obvious influence, and a lot of dinosaurs to shoot in the face. Getting in a tank and blowing a trex out of the sky is awesome, but the cool part was that the tank wasn't over powered in defense and was quickly blown to pieces by a triceratops, which I was sad and satisfied at the same time with.  Overall there are enough guns to make some choices for, the classes are cool, and has a great value to it as well. I had to tweak some settings due to slow mouse tracking, seemed kind of laggy/choppy in the way the aim moved but tweaking some things, it's now working fine. I've not tried the PVP out yet but overall found this to be worth the dollar, and then some.  I'd love to see the devs add more to this game, and for the community to keep it strong. Loads of rooms online, very active, very fun!
2030	0	a	This game is really not that well developed. The graphics are very good but the game is not optimized well at all. I only get about 50-60 fps on max settings with a gtx 760. I can run more demanding games past 100 fps. Also not to mention th animations for the dino's are very cheap looking and in all I really wouldn't reccomend this game. The servers are not hosted by the game developers which means someone will be hosting the game through their internet so if they lag the whole game does and almost every game I joined everybodys ping was through the roof.
8789	1	a	Wow 'Worst Game Ever' to 'Wow i love this game!' I totaly love this it is amazing!
8791	1	a	One of the fun and funniest game that comes with good price
8793	1	a	Very Good Game,Amazing Multiplayer. 8/10
8795	1	a	really fun free game. i enjoy just slaughtering all those helpless dinosaurs. enjoyed this game over full priced games.
8797	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
8799	1	a	I Paid for this game when it was first released and now it's free to play. No Bonuses for buying it either.. Thanks....  Game play is good though.
8801	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
8803	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
8805	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game!
8807	1	a	It's a game with Dinosaurs in it. Why are you still reading this? WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT IT YET? LET ME SAY AGAIN, IT. HAS. DINOSAURS. IN. IT.
8809	1	a	You can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and machine guns. 11/10 - IGN
8811	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
8813	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
8815	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100

8821	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
2037	0	a	The game itself has/had good promise. When I first saw it I thought 'Jetpacks and dinosaurs? Count me in!' But the game turned out to be decent fun, but with glaring issues. It is very poorly optimized. It was impossible to aim right to hit anything, and yet things still died. IDFK. The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update. (It was really just a few logos, like train simulator 15/16/17/etc.) and then moving on to orion. Of course, I didnt realize any of this before putting down my cash for both games. (I'm a sucker for $0.49 deals). The second game is also crap, though i won't go into that here. Long story short, don't give these guys your money. Even for a $1.  TL;DR STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ITS DEVS.
8823	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.

8835	1	a	Because this is our heritage... if it wasn't for our forefathers, the dedicated shock troopers they were, Dinosaurs would have taken over the universe...   This is a piece of history and I demand it be recognized! -MURICA!
8837	1	a	uhh i got this for free but now it's gone why?
8839	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
8841	1	a	A co-op shooter where you fight waves of Dinosaurs. Very similar to Killing Floor. Would murder waves of extinct animals again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v44GiUhVAbw 
8843	1	a	I really love this game. here's why:  Pros: -ok to great graphics -wide selection of guns -wide selection of upgrades -LOTS of dinosaurs -pvp modes, which are really fun -meh to ok servers: in other words, there are lots of servers with people, lots without people -dinosaurs,dinosaurs...who doesn't like them?   Cons: -It is kind of buggy, sometimes you cant use your aibility,others you can't DO anything -dinos running away when you are down, and need to kill one to survive. It's just annoying -bug with infinite health dinos  and that's pretty much it.. so go buy this, it's totally worth $1. It should honestly cost about $100 though.. yes, it's that good.   EDIT: they fixed all the bugs, mnade the game look and play even better, and after the horrible mess it was in 2012, it improved to the greatest game of 2015. Think of your favorite FPS, and multiply it by a billiion. That's what ytou get from $0.99 Orion Prelude (or for you long term players such as me, orion: Dino horde). The game has improved so much it's unbelievable!

2048	0	a	This game has a potentially fun concept, but confusing graphics, awkward maps, stuttering dinos, and a host of other issues leave much to be desired. Perhaps future updates will change this review, but as of now, I can think of way better ways to spend time shooting stuff.

2055	0	a	If you major in psychology than Spiral Game Studios is perfect subject for Dunning-Kruger effect study. So it might be worth your time - it's fun to watch, to read forums and to laugh at devs. Self-confidence boosted by vocal minority. Isn't that cute?  The game itself is not worth mentioning. It's your typical 'rip-off-everything' made by complete amateurs. Yeap, you may play it and even enjoy it... if you have absolutely no taste, your IQ is lower than 50, you are 6yo and it's the only game you have at the same time. And even in that case you'll be bored in a half an hour. So buy yourself some iOS game instead.

2057	0	a	The developer of this game stole assets from the CoD series!
2058	0	a	Fun for a laugh but considerably less polished than co-op shooters like Payday and L4D.
2059	0	a	Well, the system requirments are way off. I have a AMD Phenom 2 970 Quard @ 2.2GHZ 4 GB DDR3 and an ATI HD 4250 with 256 MB. When I checked the specs on this, my system should have been able to play this. All settings to low ... still lags very badley.
2060	0	a	Once upon a time I gave this game some praise and said it was janky but fun! Unfortunately, then all the content dried up, a microtransaction shop was added (along with the maps cut in the last pre-Horde patch), and the game effectively turned into a just-fixed-enough-to-be-dull game instead of a hilarious drinking game.  If you buy this, only buy this with friends who know what they're getting into, and who will certainly play with you. Also have fun waiting for a sale, because the devs have sat out the past two major Steam sales for... ♥♥♥♥ knows why.
2061	0	a	The developer keeps re-releasing the same game under different names, and they steal assets from other games and then try to paint themselves as the victims. Plus, the developer goes around on Internet forums threatening to sue people for talking about those two facts. Complete scum.

2090	0	a	The Metascore is misleading? This game got a user score of 3.9, yeah, misleading; sure;)
2091	0	a	This game is so much fun for a couple of hours. When you play it with friends. Then it loses it's luster. It's got a nice premise, but it is also repetitive. As I'm writing this, I suppose they're adding more content. That should do the game a world of good. The graphics are nice, but the controls need some work. I have an Xbox 360 controller that didn't seem to work with this game. It was still alot of fun, but I can't imagine playing this alone.
2092	0	a	After spending half an hour going through lobbies and never entering a single game, I uninstalled.
2093	0	a	This game is basically Call of Duty Ghosts: Extinction mode or Black Ops: Zombies mode - but no way near as good in terms of quality; and with Dinosaurs.  Only buy if cheap.
8861	1	a	Cool Idea 
2094	0	a	Running from giant dinosaur. Dinosaur gets stuck on a small rock step. Free kill easy wins gg no re topkeklol. 10/10 would not recommend.
2095	0	a	99 Cents huh? why not.... thats what i thought. ok this game might be good but my problem is that the game just doesnt work, i can have this on the lowest GFX and get 20 fps i can have this on the highset GFX and get 20 fps...do you know why? i dont. i can run games like bioshock and blackops 2 just fine bioshock at 60 on max gfx and blackops 2 at 40-50 fps med GFX. so why cant i run this game? i just want to know because this (to me) doesnt look better than blackops 2 or bioshock. and for that reason a solid NO will be in order. (its the steam summer sale go get a good game like system shock 2... i wish i had)
8863	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a game that I recommend because: - it is a method to banish boredom - it has a good price - it is indie - it has dinosaurs - it has adventure - it has co-op mode - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
8865	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a game. The game is alright and the content is pretty solid for what it is, decent weapons and class choices to be made, vehicles and game modes to keep the title fresh. With variations to difficulties and XP to farm for class progression this game has good reason for returns.  Edit: Game is called Prelude becasue dodgy COO types.  Has achievements and badge progress. I like this game, and like what it has to offer, the people behind it though....
8867	1	a	YUP! THIS IS A DINOSAURS GAME!
2100	0	a	trash. theif. don't play
2101	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
8869	1	a	this game is amazing and fun 10/10
2103	0	a	What a terrible game
2104	0	a	I want my dollar back! Enough said.
2105	0	a	Worst game ive played in a while what a waste of my life.
2106	0	a	i have played some crap games befor but this takes the cake, i wouldent even bother downloading it for free. i dont know were to begin it sucks that bad, maps are huge for a single dude walking the weird way you got to get money to actualy have more than a pistol, its like the point of the game is to bore you with tantalizing upgrades you could possobly get, that are not very good any way then the game ends or you all die and you got to start all over again. i would rather play warhammer spacemarine that crashes 50% of the time then play this game.
2107	0	a	...Wow, that was pretty bad.  This is what took place In the ten minutes I could handle playing.  I was placed in the tropics with no back story. After a couple of minutes to prepare, a horde of Luddite Velociraptors started ♥♥♥♥ing up the generator 100 meters from camp (I think it's a camp). Once you kill them, another swarm of dinos appear with the same vendetta. That's it...if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. It's free for a week.
2108	0	a	THIS GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE TO BE BOUGHT FOR A DOLLAR  ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME
2109	0	a	i have just four words to say DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
8871	1	a	Really,kind of good game
2115	0	a	this is literally the ♥♥♥♥♥iest game ive ever played in my entire life. Its just plagued with so many issues and the developers must have had their heads up their ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥ to implement some of the gayest things ive ever seen in this game. All in all i give this game a -20/10 and sentance the developers to go suck a ♥♥♥♥ and learn how to make an enjoyable game
8873	1	a	Ok, where to start from...1st Marto(Baba Qga) has told me to write this review.   This game has made to uninstall it at 2 hours gameplay. This game made me to be afraid of dinos. This game has made me to murder people with a spoon because i imagine them as dinos.  11/10  Strongly reccomend this game if u want to uninstall it at 2 hours gametime  Piece
2123	0	a	Good mechanics and graphics for a 1 dollar game, but too unpolished and unplayable.
2124	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.
2125	0	a	Less fun than drowning.
2126	0	a	Ewww...  While this Game may look like fun on first sight it has some serious flaws.  It runs on Unreal Engine 3 utilising Direct3D9 as it's API and is just on default not utilising Hardware Great which only gets strengthened by 3rdparty developers(T-REK 'Industries?') not having heard of Texture Porting and proper VRAM allocation , speaking of the game not even trying to really using those juicy amounts of Virtual Ram your Dedicated GPU has. yea those 4/8 GB lying idle while your frames Keep dipping is how a game is ment to be played.  Second Concern . As above already the game is already not doing too well regarding performance right out of the bat , want to hear a bigger joke. the choice of closed source PhysX as Physics Engine by a 3rdParty Company which already struggles with making peoples hardware work in their game.  Mediocre choice of Graphic options : Oh boy . yea as you launch it you'll find yourself in the Menu with . uhm pardon . A few Options to change. Such as Textures , 'FX Quality'.. the usual.  what it doesn't give you is anything you'd want .: Sound Quality? , cap your FPS at anything else than your monitors refresh rate , half of it or uncapped. set custom Qualitys for Anything included in any setting. Bloodsplatsize, WeatherFX threshold , decal quality , disable Weather FX , lightning , shadowmapsize and so on.   I think as far as this goes we're done with how well the game is ment to be played. pun intended.  Gameplaytime bois.  -Static weaponmodels. -Stiff Animations. -Imported Gametextures are lowresolution and high on performanceloss. -The Charactersounds seem to be recorded in a bathtub with the cheapest ebay mic and directly put into SV and rendered into 192kb/s. -Ai (to be fair even making a semi adequate one is really hard) is outright stupid , gets stuck in defaulted maps which i would ignore if not for the fact that they're made in a fixed loadout and not fully RNG and has weird hitboxes. -Maps are buggy , you can jump seemingly out of bounds , get stuck in random spots , reach spots where you're invisible to the ai , Flat Design , poor detail , and is one large map rendered on launch which explains the poor fps on some machines( Conquest). -Characters and lines are plain and boring , while fun at first you'll get bored of it after a few hours. and maybe annoyed by it after a while longer.  I do not recommend the purchase , it might be fun for an evening or two but it just fails to offer replayablity. in addition to that it runs like Crysis on a post Millenium PC. ( Having no PhysX hardware support that is.) 
2127	0	a	only played it for about 20min before i deleted it. bad level desgin bad game play. only good thing was the graphics. it was 0.99 but even if it was free i'd ask for a refund

8877	1	a	fockin' bought this game for fockin' 15$ and now it's f2p  fockin' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i tell ya  FOCK Me fockin' british  
2138	0	a	I honestly really like this game, its fun, fast paced and easy to get into.  Its actually really fun but the reason why I made this review a bad one, is that the community of this game is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I have died in the past because I got crushed by my own CAR! So you know what this tard does, he doesn't revive me, he grabs my car and drives away and leaves me. Mind you, this is not the only time this had happened. There have been many times where I sometimes got crushed by my own vehicles. Now I understand if you are against a T-Rex at point blank range and you can't revive me, but sometimes, there are like 4 people attacking the same damn dinosaur and while I'm dying at the back, they will ignore you and leave you to die and lose all your gear. Another problem is the vehicles. Let's say for example I go do the objective, and once I finish it, I get a helicopter or a jeep as a reward, but then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ charges in while I'm killing dinosaurs, preparing to get into my car and this guy just takes it and drives away and leaves me a with a T-Rex while I'm heavily wounded.  So here is my overview of the review. The gameplay is awesome and really fun and the graphics are pretty good for a one euro game but the community is absolutely terrible, they will leave you even when they are in no harm at all, people who done nothing for the team will charge and steal all your vehicles.  5/10
2139	0	a	A long time ago, my mother made me go outside all the time. I did not want to, as I believed that I could do something better with my life, such as play quality games. And, I had heard the odds of cancer forming within my poor little body if I obeyed her wishes. I did not want to get cancer. During the times I refused to go outside because of these two factors, I looked far and wide for quality gameplay. Low and behold, Steam was found. I downloaded Steam. An eager chap I was, wishing to play all the fun and popular games. I avoided cancer at all costs. I did not smoke, I did not partake in any nefarious activities, and most importantly, I did not go outside. It appears my efforts were wasted anyways, as this game gave me cancer.
2140	0	a	I haven't bought this game and I can write a review? That is pretty dumb.
2141	0	a	Rewrite time! Although this game is, most definately, fixed from its Dino Horde days, the game is quite poorly optimised. I bought the four pack, and gave one copy away so I could play it with a friend. He managed to play it. I was getting 15 FPS on the title screen, and I was worried about the gameplay, so I went and set the graphical settings as low as they get. Me and my friend create and join a game. 8-10 FPS. Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.   EXPLAIN YOUR OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS PLEASE!  My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.
2142	0	a	This game is a terrible joke.
8879	1	a	This game is really cheap will be one of the greatest/funniest experiences for you if you have a friend with you on call, and just play for fun, the mechanics are ridiculously funny when you're in a good mood.  Play this game with a friend, preferably on call, that makes this the most fun.
8881	1	a	I no-scoped a T-Rex in the face.  10/10 Would 1v1 T-Rex again.
2146	0	a	Want my money back since now it's free and I paid like $4 for this game.
2147	0	a	Even free it's not worth it.
2148	0	a	Total waste of money, i could feed a whole african village with that 1$. The game runs like complete **** and looks like a bad version of halo and borderlands together.
2149	0	a	Complete and utter trash. The guns are unbalnced, exploits every where, hackers,and servers with exp boost.
8883	1	a	THis is one the worst FPS I have ever seen

2201	0	a	Its Free WTF and i and have my money back :/ this steam  
8901	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.

2223	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.
8911	1	a	Why is this game rated 36/100??? its like frigging halo meets jurassic park, with upgrades, special abilities, and giant ♥♥♥ dinosaurs trying to eat you and your base! SWEET GAME! Multiplayer is the ♥♥♥♥!

2230	0	a	this game wasnt worth the cents paid for it. pretty much on par with bad rats, but bad rats is a bad joke.  Orion is just bad.
8919	1	a	worth the 99 cents

8921	1	a	i have played this game for half a hour a already had loads of fun i mean its mother******* lightsabres chopping up dinosaurs whilst mechs are shooting away at the giant trex who is trying to eat you i would highly recommend this to anyone 
2232	0	a	This is fantastic game ..if you are seven-eight years old
8923	1	a	This game is the bomb diggity with friends. &lt;3
2233	0	a	i got it for free and its saying i need to buy it even if you got it free
2234	0	a	69
8925	1	a	excellently broken. It a bit of a pain but a blast of fun. If you try not to take it to seriously it can be one of the best games you play. That is if you're with friends.
2235	0	a	this game sucks
2236	0	a	broken, and unfinished feeling, i really dont reccommend this game
2237	0	a	I can't even turn the res below 1000x32 and i have a bad pc.
8927	1	a	This is amazing....
8929	1	a	I just impulse bought two copies of this game: one for me and one for a friend. This game is....   INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I love this game, it's awesome! You can punch dinosaurs in the f**king face! I bought a bow, the jetpack augment, and I stood on a rock popping raptor heads like Macklemore pops tags. After that I got a walking turret and killed 10 raptors with one rocket. This game is so damn fun, I'd have paid $5 if I knew this game was so good (but I don't have that much so don't make me)  I just wish I could get a cape. I love capes. By the way, the only paid stuff (real money shizz) is vanity items from what I can tell. This game is definitely worth your moneys.
2242	0	a	Had to buy ths game and then they make it free to play what a rip off this game is loads of fun but the dev have a long history of changing this games name to avoid the fact that they steal assets from other games.... but is a fun game once you get past the scumbagry of the devs 10/10 would get ripped off again
8931	1	a	this game is good it came out on my birthday
2243	0	a	Game has great potential but it's spoiled by the mass amounts of lag and uncomfortable experience.
2244	0	a	stephan hawking runs better than this game.
2245	0	a	Its cool if you have so much lag and cant tell whats going on and just laught with your friends but when the lag is gone...
8933	1	a	UPDATE: SO the devs have been constantly updating the game , After years of release , There are virtually no BUGS , and content is added on a regular basis!   The game is very enjoyable fast paced and good for having a great time with friends or your girl friend .   DO NOT listen to ♥♥♥♥♥uckers from call of duty negging this game , they are mindless idiots with less than 0.1 hours in this game and just 1 line reviews , it shows their worth and class and that they are clearly negging the game because their daddy company activision was involved with an issue with orion devs  Regarding that issue , Anyone who has half a brain would know working with online contractors often results in palgarism , its not the teams fault , upon notification they pulled out the content that was offensive to activision , Hell activision bullied them before even notifying them  So all in all what did i learn ? THIS IS A GREAT GAME , but most gamers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that like sucking ♥♥♥♥♥ of big corporations that charge them 60$ each year instead of honest developers that provide free updates years after realease .   This is the reality , buy and judge for your self. ---------------- old review   SPAWNED WITH MY GF  DINO EATS MY GF   10/10 WOULD PLAY GET RID OF MY GF SIMULATOR AGAIN

2252	0	a	Terrible game play. Terrible graphics. Terrible music that makes want to vomit. All for 1 dollor.... If you want a game that will last for about 2 hours, go ahead. But if you though that this will be anywhere near decent, I'd suggest just pass
8935	1	a	-buy game for $0.74 or something -why not seems cool -install game -try to play solo -i have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what how  -get ♥♥♥♥ed -okay why not try to just find an open server -join game with 4 others -everyone has vehicles and obviously knows what they're doing -get kicked within 30 seconds -loading screen tip says  -'if you come across a new player, help them out' -ggwp  from what i've seen of it though, it looks cool with a nice concept. i'll try to play more of it so i don't get shamed again.  try again later/10
8937	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a $1.20 (that being NZD) thrill for a weekend. After a few years (and occasional name changes) this game is pretty good for a while. It's as the description tells clearly a Humans vs. Dinosaurs game and aimed at a multiplayer audience. ORION is best played multiplayer with friends but does have it's issues such as a fairly small community. With a variety of vehicles, weapons, dinosaurs and maps it does have a sense of replayability. However this is let down with technical flaws like a terrible framerate and poor optimization and the feeling of it just getting old fairly easily.   The game has it's flaws, however is still easily one of the best games you can buy (better than Bad Rats anyway) when you have a spare dollar in your wallet. It won't satisfy you for long and the multiplayer may be dead, but it's still worthy of being a 'blue moon' multiplayer game if you have friends that are willing to play it.   Pros  - Fun for a while. - Cheap - Has a good variety.  Cons  - Unoptimized - Small Multiplayer Community  Rating: 6.5/10  P.S BreakfastBae leave this Review alone.
8939	1	a	You can ride the backs of T-Rexes while stabbing them with a sci-fi knife. Pretty hard but you'll learn it.
2257	0	a	I tried it for 20 minutes and I want my 20 minutes back.  I wanted to give it a chance to see if it felt like a good shooter. It doesn't feel like a good anything. Even if it was a real piece of human excrement, it wouldn't feel like a good piece of human excrement. The weapons have ridiculous recoil, but sound more like stapleguns. I could forgive the late 90's graphics if the game had a good feel to it, but they couldn't even come close to the combat feel of something like Goldeneye.  On sale for 74 cents, eh? Free would be too expensive.
8941	1	a	Awesome as ♥♥♥♥, says this Massive Duck
2261	0	a	♥♥♥♥
8943	1	a	Have some weird bugs and really lame shooting animations but other than that it's an okay game where you get to shoot dinosaurs with a bunch of other people.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkzAVf8x9_8 
2263	0	a	frame rate are too low..
8945	1	a	It looked quote promising but its extremely barebones with ZERO community.   Is this game pre-early access or something?

8949	1	a	Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show.

2269	0	a	As someone once said 'If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything'. 10/10 IGN 'Didn't like the dinos'
8951	1	a	Driving people to death for 60 cents , totally worth it.
8953	1	a	IGNORE THE BAD REVIEW ON METACRITIC -- that was for a prerelease of the game. All the issues are fixed, and this is fun (and brutal) as heck. and for 99 cents???? whats not to love!
2278	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbtXwbkZU9w   all poeple who like this game are like this guy
8955	1	a	Has fish cars. 10/10
8957	1	a	Hey everybody so I played this game and I'm impressed it's very good and haters gonna hate saddly I stoped playing because I'm on a laptop and my graphics card sux and It's laggy alot and I really mean ALOT but yea I recommend this game and it's under one dollar
2283	0	a	this game is not worth it
2284	0	a	This game is actual ♥♥♥♥. but thats just my opinion. as soon as i started it up 1 my game lagged so bag on the title screen. 2 the game was fine in the actual game? idk why. 3 flying raptors? huh 4 dinos walking sideways. basicly flipped on there side walking on a invisible wall. 5 Lag 6 me and my friend where playing and there was a dino walking across the sky box... 7 sliding dinos with no walk animation. It might be worth it to some people but PLEASE do not waste your money.. because i can guarantee you will want a refunt in under a hour..
2285	0	a	This game is terrible. On release it felt like an Unreal Tournament 3 mod but a very incomplete one, and now it is full of content, still feels like an unpolished UT3 mod. I'd give it 3/10. Not worth it. It has potential but needs a lot more work.
2286	0	a	this game sucks
8959	1	a	The deinstallation works fine. 10/10
8961	1	a	Yeah, this game is weirdly fun. But it is quite broken at times.
2293	0	a	10/10 Do not buy this pile of cluster ♥♥♥♥, stinking sand eating, frogsniffing, tryhard, anal breeding prolapse.  
8963	1	a	Dear Developers [clears throat]  Make this game free,Just for the banter.  
2294	0	a	Bought the 4-pack to play with my friends, but this game is nearly unplayable and isn't worth the $0.3725 per copy I paid. It's also funny that the devs are accused of stealing assests and right in the trailer for the game it shows quotes saying that it is a combination of other properties as a positive XD
2295	0	a	Ok, so ive had this game when it was first released as Orion: Dino Beatdown. The game then was not good. The game now is alright but still in no way good. It has been through multiple scandals and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t involving theft of other ips work and assests. Skins from Primal Carnage, taking the original despender from Natural Selection 2 and then ♥♥♥♥ing the devs of NS2 over etc. Theres just been a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with this company which renamed itself and this game. It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so ♥♥♥♥ to that.  TL:DR dont waste money on a bad game or a ♥♥♥♥♥ company even if its just a dollar.
2296	0	a	This is easily one of the worst games i have ever played. The game looks and plays like trash and the developers are disingenuous pigs. DO NOT GIVE THESE MEN MONEY.
8965	1	a	Its free weekend and I think im gonna buy it. Surely its not that much of a good game but its not bad either, especially for only 1€. For just 1€ im fine with what the game offers me and I really like the effects of the maps. However, im not that much of a multiplayer person so I stay with bots until friends (that I dont have) want to play it with me so I dont think I will enjoy this game much for long but anyway I am satisfied for 1€. Only think I dislike are the balance issues. Gunship costs 40k and is not as good as I expected it to be. I think I can take down Dinos faster with my sniper than with the gunship. Maybe more players have to enter it, I dont know but whenever I tried to swap the 'seat' it did not worked so I guess it only has 1 spot and is in comparison rather weak. I only found that one aircraft as well sadly...I would really like it if there would be more vehicles or aircrafts but what to expect, its 1€ and what the game currently offers is really fine for 1€. +
2297	0	a	no wonder this game is 1 dollar dont even bother with this game its really bad
8967	1	a	You get alot of content for $1... And if u get it half price, like me, it's INSANELY cheap.
8969	1	a	It's alright, probably not as bad as a lot of nerds are making it out to be
8971	1	a	Must  Keep  Playng
2298	0	a	fun cool game. but my computer wont run it so i have to give it a thumbs down
2299	0	a	just pure garbage. for little kids and not even. this is just stupid.  Dont bother commenting if youre butthurt. I will delete your comment and block you. This is my review my opinion deal with it.
2300	0	a	Ridiculously bad. I mean, I downloaded this thinking that it might at least be funny, but it's really very terrible. Not even in a so-bad-it's-good way, if you've ever played any other FPS at all, it'll take you one wave in survival to decide that this was a terrible decision.
8973	1	a	Don't listen to all these call of duty fan boy haters about the relaunching of this game and the art theft or whatever. These guys have been making a great, super cheap game for a long time now. Yeah there have been some ill advised copying of armor or gun art from other games, but ♥♥♥♥ happens. The game is 99 cents, no one is getting rich over it.   That being said, this game is worth every penny. If you don't have a lot of fun blowing up dinos with your friends in this game, there is something wrong with you.
2301	0	a	It looks good but when you play it it's really not, graphics on guns and dinos are nice but everything else looks terrible. Honestly this game is not worth the $.99 it costs
8975	1	a	1) Load Jurrasic Park theme 2) Play with a bunch of friends 3) ??? 4) Profit  10/10 would medic gun a T-Rex ♥♥♥♥ again
2302	0	a	It's still ♥♥♥♥
2303	0	a	What a coinkydink, this game is similar to what comes outta my pie-hole when my diarrhea starts acting up! This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥, and with what has been going on with their stolen models, I'd recommend my bowel movement products over this.
8977	1	a	better fps on desktop than laptop xD 
2306	0	a	Do it only as a joke to annoy whomever recieved it. Do not buy this for yourself as a great game to play.
2307	0	a	It worked extremely slowly on my old computer and no servers were up. Keep in mind, this was some time ago. I do not understand why I must re-buy this game to play it now.
2308	0	a	This is not worth the 50 cents i paid for it.
2309	0	a	the game sucks laggy crappy no story lame outdated graphics cant hear sound effects cheap weapons over powered dinsaurs dlc overprice you will die :)  i would not play this game with strangers or friends
2310	0	a	I paid 0.79 and i feel cheated.... After i bought this my parents are questioning my ability to make decisions. Just wait for steam sales maybe its will be worth it when its cheaper. 
2311	0	a	This is just my less-than-a-hour look at this and I must say it is no where ready for being released. It seems that this was rushed to be released without anywhere near a finished product. With no guidance or help, I started a game and became completely lost as to what I was to do next. After wondering around for a bit I stumbled on what seemed to be the right combo to get things going. Next thing I knew, after about 3 or 4 waves of creatures, I ended up in a LARGE wave with at least two T-Rex (boss) level creatures. And lots of other sized creatures. The game is confusing and slipshod... At least all of this is just my opinion after playing less than an hour. I think if they gave this more time then maybe it would be worth playing...
8979	1	a	i got it when it was .99 cents and it was worth it, but im not sure about it going f2p
8981	1	a	I think this is the cheapest best game around
8983	1	a	That Game seems really bad but when u playing once its really fun
8985	1	a	Its a fun and cheap game, bought it for my friends
2316	0	a	3/10
8987	1	a	Fun with friends, it's hilarious, stupid, amazing, fun, bullcrap, and definitely worth the price.
8989	1	a	It wont work I hate it
8991	1	a	right now as it stands the game is really good. It is a knock off of halo, however it is done really well.   Pros: Its just like halo, there are a ton of things to do. Endless replayabiliity, I have 124 hours into it and looking forward to another 124 easily. The dlc for this game is auto updated for you and always free. also for the price its unbeatable.  Cons: It used to be buggy but not anymore. you do sometimes get stuck in cliffs if youre jumping around on them, however that is fixed by just using the teleporter.  I 100% recommend this game to anyone, not just halo fans. Its a fun way to spend 100+ hours and not get bored with it.
8993	1	a	I 460 BLAZED A DINO FOR 74 CENTS TOTTALY WORTH IT
2319	0	a	To be honest this game offers nothing new. You're better off playing halo, or team fortress.
2320	0	a	A buggy mess of a halo ripoff that dosen't understand what it wants to be
8995	1	a	Best game I've ever played.
2321	0	a	This garbage is worse than garbage.
2322	0	a	This is my first review ever. It's unfortunate it has to be a negative one. I installed this game when it was still 15$... Played it.... enjoyed it... 1 year later or so i reinstall it (today) and it wont run. Very upsetting seeing as how it is 79 cents now.. Dont feel like i am getting my moneys worth.  
2323	0	a	It....really is just poorly made. But it is what it is: a humans vs dinosaurs game, and it honestly is nothing else. Don't buy this expecting a solid experience: it's buggy, clunky, audibly empty, and not very pleasing to look at. It's a pre-early-access title, meaning it had the same principle of early access before early access was a thing on Steam. Don't buy it unless it's on sale for like, 99 cents, which often times happens with this game.  Fun fact: this game had a different title when I first bought it years ago, which really says something about its development.
2324	0	a	I seriously think the people who like this game have never played another coop shooter or something because the 'coop' is the only thing that could ever be considered fun about this garbage and no I don't think it's fun... Sure, I'd like to shoot dinos but this game is a joke.  Dislike: 1. Crap framerate yet the dinos are fast as balls half the time so theres nothing fun about shooting a speeding incomplete animation.   2. Buggy... don't get stuck  3. Guns aren't even fun to shoot. The pistal doesn't even have a shooting animation it just stiffly sits there making gun sounds.   4. I get that it's a buck and that's 'soooo cheap' but I feel like I wasted my money. If I buy games like Killing Floor on Steam for 2 bucks that are immediately great games then a buck for this broken, ugly, laggy, crap is way too much.   5. It seriously just sucks  Likes:  1. Jet pack was actually fun.    If shooting dinos with friends sounds fun to you it also did to me and I think this game is crap. If you want a truely good coop FPS with giant things to kill get the Serious Sam games. This game doesn't deserve your money.     
8997	1	a	it is buggy (the movents) but if you have friends with who you can play it it should be fun, not as in i am looking to play something by my own then i advise not buying this.
8999	1	a	its a good games becaus it a rpg game so amzing i rate it 99999/99999 
9001	1	a	epic thats all i can use to describe it 
2326	0	a	I have a crappy computer but this is very very slow.
9003	1	a	Gameplay is awesome but the game makers have an issue in programming skills or something cause game is really laggy and flying dinos just appear in sky and i dont have time to kill them if everything laggs and i am on extreme difficulty. PLEASE FIX GUYS GAME IDEA IS GOOD BUT UPGRADE THE GAME BY ITSELF CHANGE GAME CODE TO LESS LAGGY AND GIVE US MORE WORLDS AND BETTER OBJECTIVES!!!!!
9005	1	a	Great game, the survival mode in single player is the best part. Dino's and Guns! How could that not be at least a little fun. Worth the price!
9007	1	a	I just imagine it as unreal tornament 2004 with dinos 11/10
9009	1	a	What can be better than shooting a t-rex in the face with bullets? Shooting a SPACE T-REX in the face with bullets. When's the last time you picked up a friend in a jeep and spent the after noon cruising the land scape, running over velociraptors, runnning from a triceritops, and dodging pteridactyls? Come visit the jurassic park of the future where you make the endangered extinct! Caution no small children or Jeff Goldblum allowed.
9011	1	a	hello friend this game is um pretty sweet you know what i'm sayin but it's like idk pretty lame so yeah
9013	1	a	Whilst its on offer YES GRAB IT for £1, totally worth it! For £10 or whatever its normal price... not so sure, but its definately fun blasting around with your mates shooting huge hordes of dinosaurs in the face.
9015	1	a	CoD Ghosts:  - Kids on multiplayer - Spamming on Voice Chat  - Very High Price - Unrealistic Gameplay while game takes place in this universe - Crappy graphics  This game: + Great multiplayer experience  + No voice chat for spamming + 0.79 cents + Fantasy FPS with an alternate universe + Still better graphics than CoD. 
9017	1	a	beta for battlefield 4's upcoming dinosaur dlc
9019	1	a	Have endless fun fighting dinosaurs in ORION: prelude. 3 main classes with lots of variations, woth the buy.
2336	0	a	Cancer
2337	0	a	You really get what you pay for with this game.  The idea of shooting dinosaurs with future guns is a cool idea, I mean, its just plain bad-♥♥♥! But this game really falls short of expectations,   Graphically, its very nice. And on top of that, it not too hard on the computer. The framerate is smooth. Textures are quite appealing to the eye.   Combat is overly repeditve. About 10 minutes of play, i got bored fairly bored.   Its hard to get into the game's lore. Like seriously, with a few minutes of play, you have no idea as to whats going on. Here are some of my un-answered questions; Where are we? Earth? Some other planet with Dinosaurs? Who are we? Are we human? Are we an alien race? Why are there dinosaurs here? If we have futuristic weapons, and we are fighting dinosaurs, what time are we in? Like seriously, there is nooooooo story what so ever. You have no idea whats going on.  Athsteically, it REALLY needs some work. The its seems that the sounds in the game are SUPER repetitive. For the HUGE amount of weapons there are in the game, they all sound the same! The cars in it literally sound like the have 1 or 2 gears. after you start driving for a good minute, the vehical sounds cut and loop. Its HORRIBLE. There are No sounds for the game what so ever. I mean, there are no birds chirping, no wind blowing, no waves, no NOTHING. You can only here the sound of your own foot steps. That mixed with the GIANT maps that are completly EMPTY, the game feels more empty than fallout 3!   The animations for the dinosaurs, are just terrible. They move sooooooooooooooo fast, but the look like they arent moving at ALL.   The econemy of the game is horribly broken. You either always have TOO much money, or have no money at all. This works horrbilly witht the difficulty. On easy, the cash flow is so mondain. Killing one thing gives you ♥♥♥-loads of money, so it makes it even easier because you have great guns. Then on medium or even hard, you never have money at all because you get little money, too many enemys, and you can never afford guns.   So far, its not the best game ive played. Ive heard that it used to be much, MUCH WORSE. But seriously, this is BETTER?  I strongly reqimend NOT to buy this game
9021	1	a	Got a couple hours into it. ha the first halo feel to it, i think it has alot of potential but it needs to be heavily optimized in the sense of LAG. hope to see what it grows into and for .99 cents whats to lose. 
9023	1	a	top notch!!!
9025	1	a	Really cool game, loved the gameplay. It would help to have a tutorial system that explains the controls while using a controller
9027	1	a	good game, ive not played it a lot, but it cost 9.99 € i think. i bought it for 0.99 € and the default price is now 0.79 €? what the quack? but anyway its a good game with dinosaurs .  8/10
9029	1	a	great game, recommend
9031	1	a	Its awesome! But how do you buy stuff with your credits you earn?
2341	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS 0.99 $ BETTER BUY JETPACK JOYRIDE OR ANGRY BIRDS OR WHATEVER JUST DONT SUPPORT THE CRAPY WORK OF THE DEVELOPERS
9033	1	a	Great Game But The 1 Thing Thats wrong is that the dino are way to fast but its a fun game highly recomned
9035	1	a	Do you like dinosaurs? Want to shoot one? want to run tiny ones over with a car? this is the game for you. if you come in expecting nothing this is a great game. you kill dinos, you get money you get bigger gun to kill bigger dino's. good little shoot em up highly recomended.
2342	0	a	A good Idea with the Carnivores-meets-CoD concept (anybody old enough to rememeber WizardWorks' hunting games?); but it's just too buggy and unstable. It kept CTD'ing and the interface is also a little irritating. I deleted it litterally minutes after I DL'd it. Even though it is only US $.99 I'm glad I caught it on free weekend. Even 99 cents would feel like a sickening,terrible waste on such an unstable (and if you ask me, obsolescent looking) waste of 8 gb of storage.
9037	1	a	I only love cod zombies and the survival mode is a good alternative to zombies.
9039	1	a	Metascore is way low!! this games actually pretty fun.. PvP needs some improvement but honestly I would pay full price after having such a good first experience playing this game  Definitely reccommend!!
9041	1	a	Crazy, stupid, but FUN!
2343	0	a	AWFUL it's total crap, maybe in 1995 would had seemed interesting now is outdated awful crap.
2344	0	a	It's pretty bad, unfinished and full of microtransactions (not pay to win, only cosmetic). Overall....it's free and I still didn't my money's worth.
2345	0	a	Worest Game Ever
2346	0	a	Can I have my money back?
2347	0	a	I am ashamed to own this game.
9043	1	a	I would tell you to play this game but in the end it doesnt even matter..... 5/10
9045	1	a	so swag me and my bud quick scoped some dinos they dident see it comeing!
9047	1	a	This is one of the best games I have EVER played. It is a fast paced FPS sort of. Basically all you do is upgrade,upgrade, and kill kill. I haven't seen this kind of game in a while, so it is highly recommened. :D P.S: Anyone willing to gift this game to me? Add me on steam if you can.
9049	1	a	Honestly this game isn't that bad. it has a wonderful concept but if it had better graphics and less bugs it'd be godly in my books.
9051	1	a	Isn't tf2
9053	1	a	Better put some prelude on that, you dino♥♥♥♥♥

9059	1	a	Really nice and really fun! Game have great potential.
9061	1	a	  its awesome fun and so fun you dont even wanna stop. keep up the good work
2356	0	a	Fun for about 10 mins
2357	0	a	bad graphics, terrible audio and sounds wich give you a headache, badly optimized, massive frame drops, bad animations, bad models, etc, i dont recommend this game at all, the only good thing about this game is the ragdoll physics on the dinosaurs, nuff said
9063	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
9065	1	a	Really fun game specially with friends. Not the most extreme epic graphics and textures but the game is still very much fun all around. A must have as part of a LAN party pack.
9067	1	a	*Steam Workshop *Achievements *Cards *CO-OP *Great Graphics *FUN I dare you to find a game as good as ORION: Prelude for $1.
9069	1	a	It is a funny game to lose time, for him price is ok. 3&gt;
9071	1	a	it was ok but i hope it can get some more updates an stuff
9073	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
9075	1	a	Do not let the bad reviews and the terrible Metascore fool you. This game is awesome, no joke.  The bad reviews were carried over from their previous game, ORION: Dino Beatdown, which was buggy and unfinished.  My only gripe is that the animations are a bit awkward at times, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and loads of fun, especially with friends.  Besides, the base price is only €1, with the price dropping as low as €0,50 at times. Sell a few trading cards, and get this game!
9077	1	a	  i dont remember this game all that well. it may have been during a free weekend or maybe i just got a refund.        idk.

2366	0	a	don't  just don't    Tip: IF YOU SEE A GAME WITH 'MIXED' THE CHANCES OF THAT GAME BEING ♥♥♥♥ IS LIKE 87,25%
9083	1	a	for the 1$ i paid(and if you intend to play with friends, even the full price justifies it) i got many hours of fun.  a horde survival-shooter with a large sized map, classes and vehicles tossed in the mix and epic boss fights(well... t-rex counts as a boss, right?)  if you liked killing floor's style of survival, chances are good you'll like this. thats all i can say.
9085	1	a	This is what Jarissic Park should have been about.
2368	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
2369	0	a	The idea sounded cool, so I tried it. I really can't get into it. The voices were annoying and I feel like the graphics on some things (rocks, grass, trees) are on an overkill level and I had to manually turn the graphics settings down. The is a solo mode but it's not a story mode, it's just a play with bots mode which I found disappointing because being new to the game I had no idea what I was doing. The gameplay is choppy at best. Sound quality is horrible for a FPS. My surround sound is pointless for this game because it doesn't seem to use it. Also, I kept getting dropped from servers. I would love to see this game redone (again) with the Unreal engine.
9087	1	a	I have to say this game is pretty good for $1
9089	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.

2382	0	a	My friend got the four pack of this, we played for a few minutes, quit, never played again
2383	0	a	Firstly, all respect to the developers.  This is a game that started out bad. Like, really bad. One of those bad games you remember, yeah, you know the ones.  It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic cluster♥♥♥♥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.
2384	0	a	ohh god i tought that they said they made it better i see basicly everything same except for some funky new borderlands graphic style which dosnt fit the game at all if you dont want to get laid atleast once dont play this game, 0/10 bad very bad
9101	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
2386	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
2387	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
9103	1	a	Best dollar I've spent on steam.
2394	0	a	great game, but nothing i hate more then that ♥♥♥♥ing fight to survive 6/10
2395	0	a	Great optimization! 2/10! CS:GO runs on my laptop in 4k highest settings i 70-100fps, dis shet runs at same settings with a shetload of 14 fps! Eyes dont hurt! But thats not all, if i put it down to 720p on low settings i get a beloved 2fps more! Dunno if its my 860m gfx card thats the fault or something else on my pc, or is it just the game itself :/ Because of those problems, i didnt test the game fairly good :P Defineitly (or hau dafuq is it spelled) recommened dis game if u wanna get a pair of glasses, but ur eyes are perfect and ur mom says u dont need dem!
9105	1	a	good game, much yes. 12/10
2396	0	a	Things I didnt like about the game:  Played for the trading cards, which are dirt poor in value. No anime No anime ♥♥♥♥ No anime butts No anime   -Gibus Sniper
2397	0	a	The graphics are nice (thanks to Unreal Engine) and it's fun for a while, but the game is very buggy, the maps are too big, you have to travel way too far to buy upgrades and weapons, and it get's very repetitive pretty quickly. The only way I'd actually recommend it is if it's cheap, especially since it has lots of in-app purchases and seems like it should be a free to play game. I don't regret buying it since I got it cheap but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they're really into dinosaurs.
9107	1	a	Hi-tech guns, light sabers, jetpacks, invisibility cloak, and Dinosaurs. Killing Dinosaurs have never been this fun. Especially when youre with your friends or with a stranger.
9109	1	a	i bought this and now it's free to play!!!?? i just waste my $1 for this           but the gameplay is good
9111	1	a	Game seems alright, but whenever I shoot, there is no animation for the gun firing. One of 20 shots works. I'll update this later if it seems more smooth.   I bought 4 copies for $3 so I still recommend the game, if I can squeeze 45 minutes of gameplay out of my investment, this game owes me nothing.
2414	0	a	I can't run it in offline mode steam!!!!
2415	0	a	Not even worth the download on a free week. They somehow cloned Halo with dinosaurs but yet still managed to make it suck somehow.  It's almost not even possible to do and yet somehow Spiral managed to screw up the marriage of Halo and Dinosaurs even worse than the way 800 North screwed up Nazi's and Dinosaurs.(Dino-D-Day)  So now begs the question......will Dinosaurs ever kick ♥♥♥ in video games ever again?
2416	0	a	I promoted this developer and their games for quite a while, including buying several copies for friends. In light of their years of employee abuse and stolen assets, coupled with their playing the victim card each time, I can no longer recommend this company or their games. Considering how much information is available, and not knowing what sources you personally trust, I recommend googling 'ORION stolen assets' or 'ORION employee abuse' and deciding for yourself which side you believe.
2417	0	a	The developer is a scumbag
2418	0	a	The Land Before Time Game is not that great without the original voice actors
2419	0	a	Do like Dinosaurs, Jet Packs, Mechs, Tanks, and all sorts of other cool accessories? You do? Well guess what? Orion has all of that! But Is it any fun? No, It's not fun at all. The idea of blasting down Dinosaurs with you're pals is a great idea, It really is. However, It's prestented poorly with this game.    GAMEPLAY
2420	0	a	it's cheap and it feels cheaper
9113	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
2421	0	a	usedto be great when it had a diff title now the ai is complete ♥♥♥♥ the graphics are complete ♥♥♥♥. and i paid 15 euros for this game while this is a 0,00$ version like i would be ashamed if i asked money for such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. gg dev team ope u hadfun with ur trolls please return this to the previous title STILL ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥
2422	0	a	Today's Review: Orion: Prelude (Formally Orion: Dino Horde)  Let me tell you a story about a bunch of 'developers' that thought that would be a great idea to launch an indie game, poorly optimized (i'll say not even tried), multiplayer game with dinosaurs and guns (FPS) and how they fail at the point they had to drop permanently the price from 9.99 to 0.99 due the fact that no one will ever buy this crap or accept it for free, because they game sucks in every posible way, and i've played the slaughtering grounds, ride to hell retribution, RAMBO and other crappy games and this one it's the worst one, but hell, they reach steam without even passing trought greenlight so, there.  I'm not even gonna put a score to this crap, stay away from it!
9115	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and game mechanics, the overall sound is okay. Keeps you entertained and wishing for more.
2436	0	a	This may be the literal worst thing on steam. I think it's definitely a contender at the very least.
9117	1	a	Buy now whilst it's cheap!
2438	0	a	Ok, i know i haven't even played this game for 30 minutes, even 10 minutes. But here me out anyone looking at this review; the SECOND i got on, i thought this game was GREAT, but it turns out that the loading/menu screens were sexy looking.. When i got into a game and tried to connect; BAM, i lost connection. I tried 12 unsucessful times to get into a game and FINALLY got into one on my 13th try. The second i get into it, what does it say? 'Lost connection to host/failed to maintain connection' so i go back and i try again :P  When i DO finally manage to get into a game, the graphics were poor, the controls were CLEARLY meant for an Xbox 360 controller, NOT a console, and i could barely move around or anything due to that fact. And when i saw the Dinos i nearly ♥♥♥♥ a brick -_-  They were awkward looking things, albeit their obvious attempted graphical enhancements.. so no, i won't recommend this game even though it was 1$  This game HAD good potential back when it came out awhile ago, now, however; it doesn't which is sad to say.  but HEY! who am i to tell people what to do/not to do? Go on and buy the game, try it out for yourself! But this is just my recommendation to NOT play the game. :) enjoy -_-
2439	0	a	I do like that this game is in the regard that it is updated often and it displays that the developers care for the game and want to promote the game as they update it. Though, I was still disappointed with the game even with the being updated so often. The game play is like many shooters but with sub par controls and broken game play. With the teamwork being the most important in the game but even with skilled human players, they dinosaurs have the advantage most of the time. Maybe in the future this game will be satisfying.
2440	0	a	Noooope.  Do not buy, horribly optimized, EXTREMELY bad gunplay that makes nerf guns feel like weapons of mass destruction. Animations are laughable and it's massively boring. I saw the reviews here and thought it might've changed - it hasn't. It's still as appalling as when I first saw it on a TotalHalibut/Biscuit video, and it feels exactly the same as it looked - and it was shoddy.  Even for 99p, which was how much it was on sale... no, don't get it. It's depressingly bland, boring and has such a bad feel to it, and it'll make you ashamed to see it on your steam library.  
2441	0	a	if you review this game saying '39 cents lmao' you definitely should consider suicide because nobody above the age of twelve finds the meme funny
2442	0	a	I killed a few mindless dinos while some Australian man yelled at me. Also, the gunshot sounds didn't sync with the animation. Would not play again.
9119	1	a	Definitley the best game on the marketplace for a buck. Halo/Borderlands/Carnivores packed into one. It runs on my ♥♥♥♥ty laptop, and it's simple but addicting. SO MANY CHIEVES. and it's got fuxxin dinosaurs my negros. BUY THIS, NOW. &lt;3 Gaabbe
2447	0	a	Now that it is free for a week you should definitely try it out. Afterwards, you can safely claim you have played the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. Jesus F**king Christ, this is absolutely garbage. Giving this game a 1/10 should be considered too much praise.
2448	0	a	I paid for the game and its now free. watta ♥♥♥♥ move.
2449	0	a	This game just downright sucks. For someone who likes to play dinosaur games this one isn't even trying just another survive the wave game nothing special. Just buy primal carnage extincion you get more worth outta your moneys then this game. But why do i hate this game? It's not even something only just a game with ''skins'' ''classes'' and ''different'' dinosaurs same colours, Graphics aren't even being updated. This ''game'' just needs to be stopped.
2450	0	a	makes you buy 5 dollars in funds to get a dollar game wtf?
9121	1	a	Jurrasic World (Gone Sexual!) (Gone Wrong!) (In The Hood!) (Gun Pulled!) (Cops Called!)              (Spoiler alert) You're the f**Kin cops.  All in all the, the games pretty good. There are a lot of reviews saying it's a crap game, but honestly it's quite good for a dollar. Enjoyed fooling around with my friends.
9123	1	a	'HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IN FICTIONAL CREATURES LIKE 'DINOSAURS', BUT NOT GOD? BECAUSE YOU ARE FOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY SATAN, WHO IS IN THE WORLD, WHICH MEANS SCIENCE, TOO. GOD DID NOT CREATE 'DINOSAURS', SINCE THEY ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE. PLEASE START A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, OR YOU WILL BE CAST INTO ETERNAL HELL! MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU! :)﻿' - KALIA CIRELLE JOHNSON   iz gud gam
2459	0	a	This game has some serious performance problems, to a laughable extent. Dinosaurs will float across the place and your gun can't really even move when you shoot it. Might be fun if you like buying games that are funny because they are bad.
9125	1	a	Lol this is a joke, the game in its current state is worth NOTHING, i have faith though
2460	0	a	I can't play the ♥♥♥♥ing game without barfing everywhere.
2461	0	a	buyed this game to play with my friends in other country, but it is not possible to connect to oversea servers. and my freinds cant also not connect when i open a sever in europe. okay, it was just 1€⌂ ....but a wasted €.
2462	0	a	This game is completely reprehensible filth. Even the low price tag cannot justify this 'game'. I bought two copies, one for me and my friend. We played for a while and had many technical difficulties. Let it be noted that we do not have poor computers or low specs. He was experiencing lag for a lack of a compatability pack that wasn't installed with the core download. It gave no notice that it would cause issues and no method of installing it after.   The gameplay was abhorent. I've played Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, and it was significantly more complete than this. I literally could not find an aspect of gameplay that was complete or satisfying. The dinosaurs AI is dumber than a stump, and their animations are just repeatedly walking into you while your screen has a violent red seizure. The graphical fidelity is not present. These visuals aren't bad necessarrily, there just isn't any style or charm. They're similar to the Call Of Duty graphics. Bland. There was no impact from the gunfire and shooting guns seemed to be problematic. A core element of the game was not even functional. The vehicles are awful. It's similar to driving a ghost from Halo without any physics. The sounds were generic, similar to stock sounds you can find online or on YouTube. The music wasn't even something I acknowledged was present. It's bland. The game modes are just sitting there and fighting bland generic raptors. There is no exploration, there is nothing interesting. You stand there, shoot raptors and then die. The servers are dead empty for a reason.   DO NOT BUY  This is the WORST game I have ever paid for on Steam. Thank god for refunds.
2463	0	a	Game contains stolen assets and is run by greedy devs, not worth giving them any money.

2480	0	a	ORION: Dino Prelude Beatdown Horde is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. And anyone who willingly spends money in this virus of a games microtransaction store needs to be sent to a Mental Institute and evaluated. Even though its priced less than a dollar, don't buy it, its a trap, what seems like a dumb joke becomes an immediate regret. Run, while you still can, and avoid this game at ALL costs.

2501	0	a	My friend bought this for me. Thank God I didn't waste any money, because this is literally ♥♥♥♥. Constant lag, horrible graphics and gameplay, and more combined to make a literal pile of ♥♥♥♥ that came from the developer's ♥♥♥. Oh wait, there was more than ONE developer? Jesus Christ, they must've gone and got the most autistic people they could find on the street, because this game sure seems like it.
2502	0	a	I cannot think of a more horrifying experience. I'd rather have militant terrorists penetrate my eye sockets than play this again. My neighbors all moved out of my neighborhood and the value of my house is degrading because of how severely awful this game is. An ♥♥♥♥ is more exciting than this game. This game is probably used in small African societies to scare small children into walking 40 miles to get a bucket of well water. It is easier to untangle 10 miles of braided steel cable than it is to enjoy this game. I would easily never recommend this to anyone. I do not understand why this game ever was accepted through steam green light, but it seems to me that whoever accepted it has a major mental deficiency. This game is so terrible that I don't even know if it is legal to make something on this level of scum. If I wrote anymore on this review, then I would be giving the game unnecessary attention that it clearly does not deserve.

9155	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead really i have mixed feelings on this games so eat some pancakes!  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

The only thing bigger than those horrible blobs of bloody slobber burtsing on your face like perverse water balloons out of a killer clowns darkets fantasy, are those TEETH, those razor sharp 75MM talons lining that whole huge terrible mouth ! BUT YOUR IN COMPLETE CONTROL BUDDY... YES SIREE ! You have the power here, and the choice is all yours !!! You can stand still, and be SLAM SWALLOWED RIGHT DOWN THAT BLOODY THROAT into a waiting vat of a delightfully strong solution of sulfuric acid, amound the other assorted gastric juices of the day, or for the more or less resilient amound you out there, you can move left or right a little tiny bit, before the inevitable snapping shut of those guillotine like teeth and jaws, and win the DAILY DOUBLE !!! YES SIREE, for no extra cost you will be treated to a two part journey, just as GOD parted the seas for Moses, those jaws will divide your mortal coil into two (2) somewhat equal parts, each of which is gauranteed to experience the same fun filled journey to exactly the same destination, that everyone else in your squadron just opted into...
9163	1	a	Screw the Meta-critic this game is heaps fun!
9165	1	a	Good dumb fun, let your brain take a breather as you run around shooting dinosaurs in the face. I don't know why it's so fun, it just is. If you're thinking about buying it, just go for it. For the price you can't even play an arcade game for 10 minutes, and I got 7 hours out of this so far.

2548	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is ♥♥♥♥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.

2576	0	a	Hello, today I am here to write a review for the game - Orion: Prelude. Let me start by saying this game is absolutely terd awful, and I don't think anyone should have ever even tried it let alone it get to over 1 million copies sold. I have played this game for some time with my friends and after being avid fans of killing floor this seemed like a complete rip off. But with aspects from other games like borderlands and it's second wind. I think this game is poop and everyone should know im only writing this review for a steam badge. Thank you.
2577	0	a	They steal assets and claim they never did it. Great.  Activision may be scums, they clearly got robbed anyway.
2578	0	a	I played Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies longer than this.                 And Counter Strike Nexon:Zombies won't even start up. best.
2579	0	a	This is a massively awful game. Don't even think about picking it up.
2580	0	a	This game is an awful piece of dinosaur poop, and doesn't deserve more than one sentence in a review about it.
2581	0	a	UPDATE ON MY YEARLY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME REVIEW   Shock in the gaming community as the developers of ORION once again caught Stealing assets from other games
2582	0	a	I've played this game, and it's alright, but nothing special. It's missing a lot of polish. I was hoping to play the newer one, but after learning that the company ripped off assets from other games and then LIED about it (seriously, just say your models were inspired by theirs. That's at least partially believable), I have no desire to support this company any longer, and I wouldn't recommend buying anything from them.
2583	0	a	I purchased this and was gifted ORION project and at first thought Activisions DMCA takedown was unfair, since then I understand that the asset theft is fairly clear and this is the shadiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game developer I've seen, the game has been renamed multiple times to avoid negative reviews on steam (Previously ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde) as well as a complete rename of the developer and publisher in an attempt to avoid other DMCA takedowns, do not buy any ORION game, it really isn't worth supporting
2584	0	a	The game is as empty as my pockets
9181	1	a	♥♥♥♥ off
9183	1	a	If your reading this review it means you want to buy the game, if you want to buy this game it is because It is dirt cheap. If you are buying this game because it is cheap it means you are broke, if you are broke you have a garbage potato computer, if you have a garbage potato computer you can't run this game. 10/10 best game ever would buy if I was not broke.
2593	0	a	I don't even own this game lmao
2594	0	a	The game's a shoddy Halo clone with goofy dinosaurs. Didn't have fun with it when it was new, but your mileage may vary.  However, the developers of this game are shady hacks. They've done multiple re-releases of this game in the past, in order to bury the earlier iteration's extremely poor reviews. They dropped the price to a hilariously low 99 cents [or less during a sale] so they can take advantage of people thinking, 'This game's super cheap, I won't lose anything if I buy it'. They've stolen assets from other developers on several occasions, such as an armory model from the game Natural Selection 2.  As further proof of this second point, another identical halo/dino game by them simply titled 'Orion' was recently removed by Steam as of the writing of this. They ripped a *fictional* sci fi gun model [a very different scenario than if they stole a modern-day, real gun] out of one of Activision's newer CoD games and shamelessly used it as their own. I don't normally side with Activision, but I really wish more big companies could strong-arm these scumbags out of the industry.  Having paid the original price for this game when it originally released as Orion: Dino Beatdown, which was 20 bucks, and of course long before the days of steam refunds, my regret for buying this piece of garbage will never cease haunting me.  Don't buy this. Don't support these devs with this game or any other game they make. Let it all die.

2613	0	a	Clunky. My laptop can run DA:I, Mass Effect, and other much more demanding engines with ease. However, this game still runs like molasses.   The premise is enjoyable, however. For a game that proudly calls itself the worst game out there, a great success.

9193	1	a	Have you ever wanted to feel the sensation of stepping on a rusty nail with your bare foot? Then this is the game for you. I tell ya, Oreo Prelude was a great way to curb my hunger. Unfortuantely, it really spoiled my appetite as I played this at 5:30 PM and I normally want to eat dinner at 6:00 PM, because of this I was unable to enjoy my pizza ravioli platter. The milk mechanics in this game are almost real but in the end you just remember that it's all an illusion: like actual equality in America. Some people may be lured in by the low price of this game, but I'd say you're better off going to see Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur' because the word 'good' is in the title and will never be used in conjunction with this game, also it's always great to lather your hand with butter and rub one out during a kids' movie. 6/10

2631	0	a	Bought this game back when it was 'Dino Beatdown' and still Early Access. It cost me 20$ at the time and it was so worth it. There were no microtransactions that I could remember, people actually played the game, and it ran better. I'm glad it's one dollar because if it cost any more, it wouldn't be worth it.  Full of microtansactions and bad graphics, it was better 4 years ago.

The Dinos movment is not realistic

2652	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

9205	1	a	'ORION: Dino Horde' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that seamlessly blends together incredible visuals and addictive combat. It puts you and your friends together into intense, cinematic battles using some of the most incredible weaponry and amazing vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore giant worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.   In addition to the return of the adventurous and survival-based cooperative gameplay, 'ORION: Dino Horde' features intense, retro-inspired and over-the-top PvP competitive action via 'The Arena' in which each mode focuses on a specific homage or battle-type.   Can you survive the Dinosaur Horde?

2661	0	a	I made the mistake of purchasing this game when it was first released and before I knew about the stolen assets. This game has been released multiple times in order to wipe out all of the massively negative reviews in the past.  This developer steals content from other games and then tries to play the victim when legal action is taken against them.  Don't support ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q77rg/psa_the_developers_behind_the_orion_project_have/ 
2662	0	a	A poor game all around by a developer with very questionable practices, I'd avoid it.
2663	0	a	Devs blatantly stole models from Activision.  Activision isnt my favorite. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Call of Duty.  Content stealing is wrong.  Pretending to be the victim and misleading people when the person you stole from calls you out is even worse.  I'll never buy from this company again, they're only a small step above those plagiarism riddled mobile games.

2667	0	a	This game is incredibly buggy and unfinished after years of the work, the dev is a hack who stole assets and actively stole money from the player's base via indiegogo.  This game isn't worth supporting ignoring all of the terrible things the dev has done, the game is unfinished, buggy and not fun.

2669	0	a	Why do people keep supporting this developer. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The developer is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ person. And they should not be able to sell a game ever again. Oh wait. But if anything negative happens towards them, they will just rename the game and/or their developing studio name and the casual audience will not even notice. This developer is so ♥♥♥♥ing scummy it isn't even funny anymore. It never really was. And the game isn't even good. Like Fez is a good game but this game is absolute garbage. Just buy Killing Floor.
2670	0	a	This just does not work, is not complete, may be labelled a tech demo or concept draft. Certainly it's not a game. May be jolly in 2014.
2671	0	a	 https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/  TL;DR: The developers have been stealing copyrighted content to put in there games, however, this is not the sole reason I am giving this game a negative review, the developers have also been trying to victimize themselves by trying to make a big social media backlash for the DMCAs, and threatens to 'take legal action' against anyone that 'spreads false information' about their situation...
2672	0	a	I bought this game as 'Orion: DIno Horde'. Now, the dev has re-released it under yet a new name, and before I got it the game was Orion:Dino Beatdown. The good: A wave based survival game you can play with friends co-op. The bad: Most of the vehicles seem lifted from Halo, the dev keeps pulling and re-uploading the game to make negative reviews vanish, and now for their latest game they wholesale lifted assets from other developers and got caught, and are throwing a fit. Avoid this game to now reward them for their behavior, avoid the dev. I regre that I cannot refund it at this time due to getting too many hours into it.

9213	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.

2696	0	a	What can I say... I couldn't pass on a game for 99 cents with screen shots like that!!! But alas, it was only false and high hopes. Personally, I really preffer to try to avoid knocking someones hard work (as I assume someone did at one point put some sort of effort into this at some point) and I wish I could think of something positive about this game but I just can't. Really, it is that bad, and the only thing that this game has working for it is the price on sale. Oh... that's it!!! That something positive I was looking for!!! You should buy it for the price! Just because you have 99 cents laying around that should be in some starving developers pocket! Or you could wait til its regular price and help that starving developer with their alimony payments too!  But seriously, I feel like I've waisted too much of my time (and life) on this game as it is. Which is where I'm coming from when I say that you'll have to trust me on this and donate that 99 cents to help all the neglected and abused dinosaurs of the world. For just the price of a cup of coffee, you too can help save a helpless dinosaur.  Oh, I just though of another positive... Hats! Yes, the game has hats! And best of all you can wear them... Virtually! Yes! In the game! ... Okay yes, hats are not that exciting but it might be you like things on your head! So lets summerize this...  You should buy this game if you:  -Are a Philanthropist for:  -Dinosaurs  -Game Developers or  -Are balding or is bald   -Likes things on you're head  -Likes virtual things on your virtual head more  -Don't need 99 cents or   -Missed the sale and  -Don't need $14.99

2711	0	a	ORION: Prelude  This game is fun enough, fairly basic but fun to spend some time shooting up dinos and whatnot. But the reason I don't recommend this game is due to the company actions and the CEO David Prassel.  The Trek Industries and the CEO David Prassel have lied and mislead customers multiple times, two instances being them trying to 'rename' the game in order to get a new MetaCritic score and get people to essentially pay twice for the same game, and the most recent being Trek Industries initiating a slander campaign against Activision. Previously, David Pressal has also treated employees with disrespect, firing them once they completed their work and before they were paid.  DO NOT SUPPORT THIS KIND OF DEVELOPER

I was going through some rough times and the 30 minutes I spent on Beep changed my life. This is the best game ever it stopped me from drinking the full 10 ounces of bleach in order to kill myself. The complex and emotional story had me in awe. The bonk engine made this game look like it was real life. The vibrant colors and effects makes this game look on par with games like Battlefield One. If you do not already have this game buy it RIGHT NOW.
2715	0	a	Okayish game, horrible devs. Changing the name of their game, TWICE, to avoid bad metacritic scores. Stealing assets. Playing the victim after Activision calls them out on it and slaps them with a DMCA notice. Pretending to take the high ground by saying 'I won't retaliate against Activision' and then writing walls of text doing exactly that. Laying employees off after taking their work. Threatening to sue the 'kids' of reddit for all they're worth. Throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'OMG I WAS HACKED BY ANONYMOUS.' 'Flexible funding' on indiegogo and then funding the required $500 themselves. Deleting negative comments and anyone who disagrees with them the slightest. How anyone could continue to support him is beyond me. I'm returning these products immediately and I encourage everyone to do the same.
2716	0	a	I used to like this game, but with so much things going on with the company and CEO pretending to be victims of Activision's actions, while Activision have the truth, now I can not feel anything about this game but hate, this is disgusting.

2719	0	a	As the game stands, it's not half bad for a $1 game, a lot better than most $1 games on the google play store. However this is not the google play store. In fact, i've seen better games on google play that are free. I honestly would recomend this is you're really bored and have $1 to blow on a semi-ok game. However the dev team, or whatever portion of them that wheren't fired so they wouldn't have to be paid for their work, have blatently stolen assets from other games. Honestly i hope the development team tries to drag out any possible future lawsuit between them and Activision so they go bankrupt from the legal fees and loose the hypotetical case

2739	0	a	Very bad game in my opinion and it shoud be free to play becouse its garbage
2740	0	a	'Polished turd' is the best description i can come up with for this game. after playing it for a while, and doing some research, i honestly can't think of anything else. considering how long this game has been in the works, it looks like about three people spent their free weekends on it. it's overall quality is on par with PS1, but with slightly better graphics. if this was a free game on a site like New Grounds, i'd be impressed. after four or five years of 'professional' development, it's just sad.   The 93% discount plus the extended free trial smacks of desperation. or perhaps something more insidious? as though they are hoping you will get hooked, and become one of the rationalizing legion of followers feebley attempting to defend their poor choice.    not to mention all the controversy. but you'll have to look into that yourself.  P.S. I got a one week forum ban for 'If you can't say something nice...'
2741	0	a	this game is garbage. the ai is bad and the teradactals are s op you usually die from them.Also the guns are garbage and the dinos are just focused on the genorator and if it goes offline you loose.  so dont waste the dollar this game is this game should be .0000000000000000001$

And I don't care what you have to say. Your opinion, unless it agrees with mine, is invalid based on the fact that you voted for a game to be 26 cents less. A game no one plays.

9239	1	a	great game for a cheap price.  a lot of map glitches and exploits.
2805	0	a	I payed $1 for this game then it became free
9241	1	a	this game is soo cool i want it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
9243	1	a	This game is the best game ever made I r8 it 8/8
9245	1	a	Ever have that urge to punch a raptor in the face while you wear a high tech suit? I thought that would be stupid. Then I got a knife and broke the game. Dont try to make this game deep, it doesnt work. Just fly around with a minigun wrecking anything you touch.
9247	1	a	I picked up this game along time back and it was unplayable so after looking at it again what an inprovment great game good job team!
9249	1	a	It's a mindless shooter. Reminds me of nazi zombies from Call of Duty series. Waves of dinos to kill, points to score and spend on guns and upgrades. I wouldn't pay $60 for it - maybe 4 years ago I would've. Graphics are kinda dated... but $#!t it was 99 cents!
9251	1	a	Been a fun game to play from the start, should try it too it is only 0,99 cents..
9253	1	a	LETS KILL SOME FREAKIN DINOSAURS AND STOP PLAYING...........3 hours later. I USED MY TIME MACHINE TO KILL REAL DINOSAURS but then died
9255	1	a	This game consists of killing hoards and hoard of dinosaurs, its great, it has a solo or an online mode
2808	0	a	...
9257	1	a	Bought it for 0,49€, no regrets.  Have you ever felt the desire to fight unlimited waves of dinosaurs? Well, here you go!  Pretty basic horde gameplay that wears off pretty quickly but I mean, what are we to expect a lot from a game that was less than 1€?`  Great to play when you are extremely bored, downloading something or if you don't have access to the internet for a bit (kinda like a last resort)  11/10
2809	0	a	This game needs alot of work, feels clunky and unfinished. Would not recommend this to anyone.
9259	1	a	what did you expect when you paid a dollar for a game. that being said its a good way to kill time with freinds. 10/10
2810	0	a	Played it once, uninstalled, no regrets.
9261	1	a	It's like a killing floor, pretty much but with more tech and dinosaurs. Much more mobile than killing floor too. For 74 cents (During sales or even lower!) or 99 cents this game is hard to pass over. Think twice before you judge a game due to it's low pricing. Although killing floor has more of challenge to it. This is fun and somewhat challenging. I'd buy this instead of killing floor to be honest.
9263	1	a	I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO OTHERS. IT IS AWESOME.
9265	1	a	Worth every single penny, Great time waster, Awesome multiplayer fun, and the most amazing level and weapons system ive seen in a game so cheap!
9267	1	a	Dinosaurs. Lightsabers. Cheap. Fun. What more could you ask for?
9269	1	a	Fun game with lots of vehicles like mechs tanks hovercrafts and helicopters ,also lots of different weapons addjustable difficulty levels, a solid server system and summarized a little fun game defenetly worth 74cent.
9271	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs. They didn't even try to pretend it wasn't.
9273	1	a	Do you like flying around in a futuristic robot suit? Do you like sneaking behind dinosaurs and killing them off with a knife? Do you like playing as a T-Rex and eating your friends while you're at it?  Then this game is for you!  - Although repetitive, the game does not fail to bring surprises in every session (wait for that huge pumpkin man). - I like the big dinosaurs that spawn every now and then (TRex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, etc). - The vehicles are a great way of traveling around the map especially when objectives are far from the base. - The AI is actually quite smart when you play solo. They know how to ride vehicles (given you're the one who's driving), and they know what to do and when to do it. - There are only three classes to choose from, and this might discourage some from purchasing the game. - The game is actually quite cheap for what it is. - There is no single-player campaign, but there are single-player game modes. - It's like Dino D-Day future style, but with lots of game modes.
2812	0	a	It feels like its missing a reason to play/continue playing other than to see how broken it feels.
9275	1	a	It's sort of like the dinosaur child of Borderlands and Killing Floor. That said, it feels like it was made by a small team. This is not a problem, since the price is so dang low.
9277	1	a	This game is great and it's only for $1.
9279	1	a	♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pterodactyls. 11/10
9281	1	a	I should by all means, not be enjoying myself.  The textures are quite subpar, GUI is of sketchy quality, animations when viewing another player is non existent, it still runs on DX9, and the list goes on and on and on.  But I can't bring myself to hate this game, it is just so much fun.   The idea of killing dinosaurs in a survival setting with teammates is absolutely great, and the gameplay is something I can't really describe with words other than fun incarnate. This is way more fun than it should be. Dare I say that this is more fun than most recent Call of Duty game, and when you consider that all of that is done at a very low price, this is a game that is worthy of being added to the Library.  Seriously, just buy it. It's cheap and it's a great game, what more do you want?
9283	1	a	For its price, it's absolutely a crime not to purcahse it
2813	0	a	this game suckss i want my money backk
2814	0	a	When the T-Rex roars your ears will bleed, no matter your sound settings.  12/10
9285	1	a	Grinding on a T-Rex back while shootaring other mighty dinos in da face with my epic 'kill-all-these-mighty-dinos-gun', awesome stuff!  would recommend, 2/1!
9287	1	a	This is a fun time killer! No plot, no mystery, and for shooter fans, no learning curve.  Loads fast and play is fun.  I call this a win.
9289	1	a	become invisible and stab dinosaurs in the back 10/10
9291	1	a	I rarely understand what is happening in this game.  But ♥♥♥♥ it: Dinosaurs.
9293	1	a	This game is one of the best fps I've ever played, I've seen games worth way, way less then this and they cost about $30.00 to $60.00 and this is only $1.00
9295	1	a	Honestly, at first I thought this game might be total crap since I played the alpha and that blew. As I've spent the last few nights playing this game I've come to love it. Survival mode is where its at.
9297	1	a	It's okay, but I got bored after a while :c One of those games where I wish I can give it a neutral recommendation.
9299	1	a	Fun with friends
9301	1	a	Great online fps game, highly recommend, fun as hell played it all night!
9303	1	a	ORION: Prelude is one of the best games I have ever played thats under 15 dollars. This game should be $10.00, definitly would recomend. Buy it.
2818	0	a	This game should not have the single player tag. Game is not intuitive. I see a lot of weapons sitting there, but there is no key to pick them up. I will investigate the forums if I ever decide to try this game again.  There was a response to a question about playing solo in the forums:  'The short answer is: Yes.  You'll not be able to level up and unlock equipment, you won't get achievements, the game is much more fun to play with other people and more difficult to play alone.'
9305	1	a	Actually enjoyable and the for the price you get alot.
9307	1	a	Honestly, this game is really good. The gameplay isn't too bad, albeit a bit buggy. However, one thing to keep in mind. Yes, this game is buggy, but so was Dead Island. The difference is, Dead Island is $20.00, and this is $0.99. It has decent multiplayer, and replayability. So, I have to say, for being under a dollar, this game is incredible.
9309	1	a	Find some friends, buy the four pack, you won't regret it!
9311	1	a	Very fast pace, comes with bots (THANK GOD), would be extremely fun to play with a group of people, and it's on sale right now. Get this if you have an extra dollar. It's well worth it.
9313	1	a	Basically Halo maps copied and pasted with a ton of dinosaurs added in. The fact that it's 59p makes that okay. 
9315	1	a	I played a game with bots, I had fun, killing dinosaurs is surprisingly satisfying. The bots are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though. And the textures look like they were made in Paint. Then again, I payed 70 cents for this, I don't know what I expected.
9317	1	a	Awesome game.... its an incomplete game but a lot of fun with friends and good time pass for a $1 you can't more than that...Recommended if you are bored playing FPS games and want to try out some jurrasic park kinda game  8/10
9319	1	a	1-Make sure you buy weapons xD   2-Let others hit the flying birds. lel  3-fun to play.
9321	1	a	Picked up 4 copies for 2 bucks, got hours of fun with my friends.
9323	1	a	I don't understand why most people hate this game.  -Dinosaurs -Jetpacks -Guns, vehicles, perks -&lt;£1 -Oh and did I mention dinosaurs and jetpacks?  WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
9325	1	a	This game got renamed a couple of times:  ORION: Protoype  ORION: Open Source  Orion: Dino Beatdown Orion: Dino Horde Orion: Prelude &lt;-- currently  But you know what they keep updating the game which is good to see from a developer. It doesnt feel like a complete game but then again what game does? It's almost like one of those games it's bad but it's so good. For one dollar its lots of fun. One these games that you have to try for a bit and play it once a week with friends. Its one of those coop games that you can just sit back relax and have fun. It's not a game where you can play hours and hours and scream at people for being bad. Not a competivie game. The game has aspects of Killing Floor and L4D with waves of dinosaurs. If you like those type games you will like this. People are friendly and its even better with friends.  Gave 4 copies to my friends so we can have a break from CSGO from now and then. And did I mention its only $1... like sheeeet.  Graphics: Its from the Unreal Engine 3. So it could be better.  Game Modes : Survial - Defend against wave of dinosaurs Conquest - Muliple Bases to Defend Vital - 5v5 PvP protect your base while destory the enemy base Capture the Flag - Capture the Flag Ramage - PvP Dinos Vs Carriers  Team Elimination - 5v5 PvP Team Duel - 5v5 Swords and Bows Free for All - Deathmatch King of the Hill - Machine Guns and Flamethrowers Gun Game Slaughter - Every 25 kills you are offered new weapon  1v1 Duel  FFA Duel Instagib
9327	1	a	very pretty, very flashy, very fun with freinds. it's as if halo classic was remade with dinosars. the animations are meh, and the previous versions were a mess, but i think this one is juuust right
9329	1	a	orion is the greatest game I've played this year
9331	1	a	Ridiculously low price, has a lot of potential.  seriously why wouldn't you play a game that costs only a dollar but is over 2gb of dinosaurs?!!?
9333	1	a	I remember buying this for like $3.00. Now it's not even a buck. I feel ripped off. 10/10
2820	0	a	fun, but could be alot better
9335	1	a	this game is great for the price.
9337	1	a	This game. It is just simply amazing.   I came into it with the most low hopes I've ever had. It was cheap as hell and everyone was making fun of the people who voted for it to be on the community sale. I decided to see what all the uproar was about and made the 5 dime plunge. Plugged in my 360 controller (supported) and to my delight, the game handled brilliantly. The controls are nice and tight. With sprinting, crouching, sliding, jumping, jetpacking... the works. It feels like many a AAA shooter I've played in the past.  Nothing is really explained. You have to dive in head first and just experience it. It plays like a mix of Dungeon Defenders + Sanctum + Turok = WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY COMPLAIN ABOUT.  Seriously though, buy the 4 pack and give the copies to some like minded buddies for a weekend (or much, much more) of zany bliss.
9339	1	a	TEAMATE DOWN AREHREWBHRBWEKRHNJF
9341	1	a	It's a good game for how cheap it is and if you have a bunch of friends playing it can be a laugh. However it would be nice if the devs implemented some gun sounds xD
9343	1	a	This game is bad. BUT it is also  fun . There are many horribly bad games that you can enjoy, especially with a friend. And this is one of those games. Just grab a friend or two and play without thinking about it and you will find yourself having a good time even though you know that you shouldn't enjoy it.
2823	0	a	Can't say I really enjoyed my time with it.
9345	1	a	Hey doode? Want to go on a dino safari? Then jump in my jeep and go!   Seriously - it's the best Road Kill adventure that you mayhave in any game.  I pretty frakking gurantee you will lauch you pants off.  Also for this price, everyone who hates this game - I will run you over personally and take your hands!
9347	1	a	Good for 50 cents.
9349	1	a	this game is not bad at all its got some lag to it but it is fun!!
9351	1	a	A little like Killing Floor from when I played before Prelude came out. It's pretty teamwork based with the dinos being creatively made and separately challenging. Smooth graphics and large marketplace for in-game upgrades and perks.
9353	1	a	Interesting Type Of Game
9355	1	a	WOW. Just wow! I bought it for a friend and myself when it was only 50 cents. Honestly I just had waaaaaay more fun than many expensive games could ever give me. I [absolutely] recommend this game. Its easy to learn, its hard to master. Its managing your money for skills, weapons or vehicles, and when you die, you lose your bought skills and weapons, but the weapons are still at the place where you died. It's absolutely 100% impossible if you try this game alone. Luckily, there are many servers and different game mode. It also is very easy to setup a server yourself, that friends can join. I have never...EVER given a game higher than an 7. 9/10 for general 10/10 in my experience
9357	1	a	9/10 Is not that fps friendly but is plenty of fun
9359	1	a	This game is like Killing Floor,but for autistic halo spartans with the aim control of a stormtrooper.   Its like bad,but not the good type of bad  Its like Halo,but not Halo  Its like Dota 2,but without the Dota and the 2  Its like Call of Duty,but more teamwork  Its like watching cartoons,but all of it is Hebrew dubbed  Imagine a world,where anything you do makes u go into The Matrix  Think of a really good cupcake,then later during the digestive process it gives u AIDS  Think of a newborn,cute baby girl,and it dies when it sees your face  Imagine if a Holocaust documentary,was funny as all hell  And last,think about moshing at a Wiggles Concert  Its that hardcore...... 9 chopped of Dino-♥♥♥♥♥ outa/10
9361	1	a	Best game ever, the Birdemic of video games
2825	0	a	While there is nothing actually wrong with this game, there is just no reason why I would want to play it over left 4 dead, killing floor, or TF2's MVM. It's OK but if you're in the mood for horde killing there are better games out there.
9363	1	a	+This game exceeded all expectations for 39p this game was well worth it's weight in gold and i would even go as far as to say this game is better than most full priced crap out there.   -Microtransactions.
9365	1	a	The game has a broken rocket launcher and super glitchy cars with rocket boosters, nothing more needs to be said.  10/10 would play again for hilariousness
9367	1	a	nice game for couple hours of gaming or when you bored and very cheap 8/10
9369	1	a	cant get my money back 10/666
9371	1	a	gotta pewpew those dinos
9373	1	a	I like the game, though don't expect a whole lot of depth. It's fun for $1, so I would recommend it for that price.
9375	1	a	Buy it! You can even byu it for friends! It seems weird at the beginning, but you will start to like it!
9377	1	a	if you have any comment to add / correct me, please post it   I played on 'normal' to start, and it was a bad idea. i died fast, even if i had money, but i had no idea what to do with them. i STRONGLY suggest you play the first ~ 4-8 levels on newb. that way you have a decent chance to learn and still get a feel of the game.  most of the waves are 'survive'. with 60 seconds pause in wich to check the store to see what you could buy. unfortunately, the 'store' is 2 stores, sometimes so far apart, you HAVE to choose wich one to visit, because you will have NO chance of visiting both. after those 60 seconds, the store literally teleports you out and closes the doors  there are dinos that don't belong to waves, so don't be surprised to see one, and don't waste your time.  once you buy a weapon, you discard the weapon you previously had. except if you buy the augment that allows you to have 2 of that weapon, in wich case you discard the oldest of the 2 weapons that you have  each game you start with a pistol (unless you get something better from lvl up), and you have to buy everything  i strongly suggest you buy the following (your choice in wich order): weapon store: -better pistol. the only gun with unlimitted ammo, so even if it's low rate of fire, don't underestimate it. with higher levels you will get a better starting pistol -main weapon. i saw only 2 tipes: auto and sniper. get one, has much higher rate of fire than a pistol -secondary weapon: shotguns. i am not a fan of up close and personal, so i have no suggestion here, if this is a usefull item -double damage, higher ROF, faster reload, double capacity clip. each costs 5k -adrenaline weapon. see bugs -the longbow adrenaline weapon has many types of tips that can be changed with the reload button: armor piercing (infinite ammo), explosive (sticks to the enemy if is direct hit) explodes after ~ 2 seconds, smoke (the enemy can't see through it), and EMP (weird enough, works backwards: REPAIRS machines and generator and stuns enemies). all arrows that are not AP have 2 max capacity but replenish ~ 1 each 5-10 seconds -turret. the bloody thing lasts 60 seconds, but it shoots most of the little dinos right away. has cooldown until you can set up the next of 120 seconds. so.... don't set one up at the end of a wave, because the pause is 60 seconds. costs 20k. see bugs note: you can have just one of the following: machinegun / flamethrower / rocket turret, cryo knife, repair gun (works on vehicles and generator), instant revival gun -extra life and ammo. used automaticly. cost 500 each. basicly you can't restock the ammo otherwise, so the ammo one might be a choice you have to make most waves  augmentation store: -volverine: HP regen. 'nuff said -double armor. i don't know if that is 'armor' (as the game states) or 'shield' (because it regenerates if you leave it a while) -25% more accuracy -more energy. VERY usefull for use of the special each class has -ability to have 2 pistols / secondary weapon / primary weapon / adrenaline weapon. i think each one costs 5k. see bugs -50% more ca$$$h drop. 'nuff said  there are other choices, it's up to you if you want to bother to get more  bugs (or as microsoft would call them, 'features'): -when you buy a weapon (by mistake, for example) the previous weapon is LOST. you have to pay AGAIN for it.  -when you buy an adrenaline weapon, you lose the primary weapon. i found that it does not happen if you already bought the augmentations to have 2 primary and 2 adrenaline. edit: it still happends, even if i buy all augments. no idea why. the weapons are not lost, just dropped INSIDE the weapon shop = useless edit 2: apparently i buy augmentation for a second primary weapon and a second adrenaline weapon and i can use just 1 primary and 3 adrenaline.  -when you set up the turret, for those 60 seconds the adrenaline weapons and the sniper rifle is no longer available with the scroll of the mouse. maybe it is available with the keyboard, did not have time to check. -don't touch the generator with a vehicle. instant loss of the vehicle :( -grenades and teleporter NOT available with the scroll of the mouse -some augmentations can be bought twice. or at least payed for twice. so look carefully what is bought and what is not. -visor does not freeze augmentation does NOT work. worst 7500 i ever spent  the 'hover' augmentation is... very limitted in use. buy it if you are bored to death and have money to throw away  when a player is 'dead' (1 HP) a team player can revive him or he can revive himself if he kills an enemy (so the smaller ones are very usefull because they die fast). unfortunately in that condition the player can move very slowly and use only the pistol (or heal gun, if the class is medic)
9379	1	a	Basically Jurassic Park. Those huge dinosaurs are super freaky.
9381	1	a	- Fun for a buck.   -The opposite of how it feels to buy a slice of gas station pizza in the middle of nowhere because you're hungry, and as you eat it, begin thinking clearer about what just happened; you went and paid 3.50 for a slice of pizza (which was the only slice left in the warming display) that you would normally not eat unless one of your buddies gave you 5 or 10 bucks on a dare, because the thing is so dried up and stiff you could more feasibly use it as a shield for being attacked by an aggressive cat with KHAJI'IT-sharp claws rather than consider it a source of nutrition.   Don't let my play time fool you, I really had fun after the whole Prelude update, I could see more life being breathed into the game. It seems the devs are very active, the community has a pulse, for my brief experience the rounds played at a fun pace. Likely, I'll play much more one day but I can only focus on a limited amount of games at any given time, and I'm more of a single-player, grind to get achievements, story mode gamer.   It's a freickieng dollar when it's full price. Just get it because, you can pay 10-20 times that amount for a game you will NOT EVER enjoy as much as this game!   Or, don't get it yet- It's going to be a dollar (or less), forever!   
9383	1	a	really fun would reccomend to others thrilling game modes and detail.
9385	1	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ seal, that's all.
9387	1	a	its a great game 
9389	1	a	It alright for a dollar i guess.
9391	1	a	game of the year every year
9393	1	a	the game is a fast fun shotting game where you run around and shoot dinosaurs its really fun if you got a group to play with ii was the best 1 dollar i ever spent on a game that was so good i have spent more money on games that are worse belive me i injoyed this one
9395	1	a	This could be a great game, just needs some more maps, and a little refinement.  Right now though, with some friends, you could have a blast in the co-op. reminds me a lot of Unreal Tourny but with big dinosaurs to take down..   And cant beat this price.. your 'Dollar to Enjoyment' ratio is definitely higher than most of the games in your library right now.  
9397	1	a	It has dinosaurs Otherwise, really laggy, no story, repetitive. 12/10-dinos
9399	1	a	If you've ever wanted a cheap, fun, multiplayer wave survival game to play with friends, this is it. It has some quirks to learn, and it's no AAA title, but my friends and I have gotten about 25 hours out of it so far, and we consider it well worth what we paid for it.
9401	1	a	The game is bland, and not too interesting, though it has nice graphics. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it's cheap! Especially if you get it on sale. At the time of this writing, it was only 49 cents. That's less that the cost of a candy bar...Yea, it's worth that! Regular price? I wouldn't bother with it.
9403	1	a	its not that great for a game. but it is what its being advertised. 5/5 stars
2828	0	a	I played this game on a free weekend and still thought it was a waste of time. The game was just terribly set out, I have to run for 15 minutes to get to some random checkpoint and I wasn't sure why, the guns all feel similar, the dinosaurs don't even feel particularily fun to fight. You can get the game for less than 50p right now, and I'd say it still isn't worth it.
9405	1	a	The game is fun and it pays itself with trading cards. 10/10 would sell cards again.
2829	0	a	More bugs than Goat Simulator
2830	0	a	I thought 'What the hell its 50 cents I can probably get an hour of fun out of it.' Boy was I wrong. I think that I'd get more enjoyment out of a 50 cent piece of bubble gum from the grocery store. It's that staggeringly bad. I decided to do a little research and found out that this game changes its name whenever reviews get bad.. Also, the only reason that it is as highly voted as it is is due to the fact that the developers spam the steam reviews with bots. Man this is just a pathetic excuse for a game. I don't even know where to start; so I won't... just trust me, you don't want this piece of sh*t anywhere near your computer. Go buy a piece of freaking bubble gum.
9407	1	a	I honestly thought it would be a bad game, but i have had a lot of fun so far in the few hours i have played this game. It is worth the 1$ and when you play with friends the experience is much much better.  Plus it is litterally ALL Zombie shooters like COD Zombies, Left 4 Dead, etc except with Futuristic weapons, vehicles and WITH FREAKING DINOSAURS!! Sometimes the game is a little glitchy, but it is nothing bad.  8.5/10
9409	1	a	This game is really fun. I've only played it a bit but its really addicting.
9411	1	a	This game is great. it like a cheaper call of duty, it was many of the same features and its easy to set up a server with friends
9413	1	a	Everything I wanted and more
9415	1	a	Dinosaurs, Halo, and Tribes
9417	1	a	Enjoyably Fun 11/10 would Exticnt again
9419	1	a	This game is by no means a sophisticated shooter. It is however a fun spray and play kind of game. Ideal for a LAN and to just shoot and drink a few.  Bang for buck, most definitely!
9421	1	a	this game is soo cheap that i recomended that you should buy it cuz so cod graphics u can even 360 no 4325432 no scope in the game if you added hacks to yea, cheap 99 cents mlg pro sniper gamex. recomended to be a mlg game. included dinos but u can no scope player also
9423	1	a	For what i payed i'm proud to have bought a 4 pack and getting my crew started in this game! This has been one of the most impressive alpha progression i've seen. Also there is a bigger project behind this and from what they offre us here i c'ant wait the see the rest! One of my best alpha investments. Thanks to the dev.crew for such dedicated work! 9/10 !!!!!!!!!
9425	1	a	the soundtrack i9n this game is so awesome!!! the prehistoric mode is awesome too i like to put the dinos health and damage to 25%:p
2832	0	a	Game is buggy, crashed and DCes during games. One crash caused me to lose my progress. Would not recomend.
9427	1	a	How did i manage to review this game? I don't own it.
9429	1	a	♥♥♥♥ game not even worth it graphics animations suck ♥♥♥, the dinosaurs move if they were robotic slow peaces of ♥♥♥♥♥. totally wouldnt even recommend the dumb game waste of time blow this game up &lt;.
9431	1	a	For 50 cents, ♥♥♥♥ it, not a bad game.
9433	1	a	I just sold some cards on the marketplace and bought this game with the profits, lol. So cheap. I have played this game when it was free for a weekend. Awesome fun and well worth the 49 cent price tag.
2836	0	a	The game is broken. 2 out of 3 times I tried opening this game it put me in a black screen, in which I could not alt+tab out of it. When I did get it to work it was impossible to join a friend's game lobby, since either it could not be found, or when I could find it and joined the lobby it put me in a blank screen. Not even worth $.50.
9435	1	a	I was killed by invisible man with egg in his hands... best game evah !!  15/11 -IGN
9437	1	a	Just gives me a black screen biggest waste of 40p 10/10
9439	1	a	11/10 the voice acting is god-like and the game is cheap as ♥♥♥♥ recommended
9441	1	a	got this for me AND my friend for $1.60. very fun, you buy weapons and fight dinosaurs
2837	0	a	If you have 50 cents, buy this game. If you don't give this game a good review the devs will re-release and change the name.
9443	1	a	It's $1 and a very well done, fun game.
9445	1	a	Erm. Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles and a lightsaber? For less than £1? So damn sold!
2838	0	a	If you have a few hours to waste and $1 to spare, its ok. If it wasn't so cheap I'd say its a waste of time, sell some cards and buy this is you absolutely have to, otherwise don't bother.
9447	1	a	This game, with the right group of friends, provides an amazing return on enjoyment for the cost. It brings back memories of playing Halo 2 co-op on XBox with it's graphics and gameplay, but also the enjoyment and replayability of L4D2. I can play the same maps over and over with friends and always have a different game.  One day I'll get trampled by a Triceratops, but kill it with one hit point left with my pistol, ala Saving Private Ryan. The next day I'll take to the skies in a helicopter and save my medic-playing friend from the hoard of raptors she had missed while fixing the generator. The day after that, I'll track a nasty pteranodon carefully with my sniper rifle and line up an expert shot, only to be picked up by a completely different one, dropped in the middle of the fight, and quickly eaten by a Spinosaurus.  The game's difficulty is easy to control. If you're looking to relax, pop it on Easy and add some ambient dinos in a Conquest map, and spend two whole campaigns blasting T-Rex's with a tank. Or if you want a challange, throw it on Expert and dive into a King of the Hill map with equally skilled opponents. The maps are wide, beautiful, and varied, and there's plenty of details to catch every time you play. There's something to be said about mowing down rapters in the middle of an arctic wasteland only to have your visor freeze up with ice. There's something to be said about wondering where the hell you're taking damage from in a huge rain storm until you finally clue in and punch that nasty ankle-biter to death.  The game is glitchy at times. Some days it wouldn't let me join or host multiplayer maps, and that issue resolved itself without me figuring out why. Changing game settings while the game is active will crash it entirely. However, I've yet to have a single issue once I've actually gotten into a game and just kept playing. I would heavily recommend this game to any group of friends who are looking for a way to casually stay up until 4 in the morning, accidentally. That fun. That well made.
9449	1	a	Best FPS I have ever played. Easy to access servers, and sooooo addicting. The only downside, is you have to deal with graphics easily just as good as GTA III. Honestly, I dont care about graphics in a game, so it does'nt bother me, but if you are addicted to COD, then you'll most likly not enjoy this game, but you have to remember, it's only $0.99. Best game I have played in a LOOOOONNG time.
2840	0	a	It's fun for a bit but missing some content.
9451	1	a	This game is the ♥♥♥♥! Buy it and derp with friends!
9453	1	a	There's no reason not to buy it when its not on sale. You shoot dinosaurs.
9455	1	a	79 pence, it's actually a good game!
9457	1	a	This version is just awesome, enough talking, I need to play more...
9459	1	a	I never in a million years thought I would be dino poop in space. 11/10.
9461	1	a	dino glitch twerking sim 20XX
9463	1	a	Orion: Prelude is an FPS dinosaur-based game. It feels like it takes place in the future.  The gameplay is designed well, and there is a large variety of maps to play on. The dinosaurs are spot-on, and the objectives make the game a lot more fun. There is a multiplayer function, but it sometimes won't work. This game has tons of potential. Especially for a game that costs $0.99. It is easily worth the one dollar.  Pros: Great gameplay Well designed guns, maps and enemies Helpful upgrades Challenging objectives Large variety  Cons: Multiplayer may get a bit shaky. For me, atleast.  Overall: 9.4/10
9465	1	a	This is not a good game, by any stretch of the imagination.  There's presentation and UI issues, the art assets are super bland, awful voice work etc.  But holy cow it has space marines shooting dinosaurs.  Get it when its on sale, buy copies for your friends. Load up a server, fly around on jetpacks shooting raptors and stegos with guns and mechs and tanks and VTOL aircraft.   Just have a good old time.
9467	1	a	i played this game some time ago and from what i remember this game is awsome i played for 3-4 hours at a time
9469	1	a	Brilliant. Dinos + unreal. One of the greatest PC games of all time, also the cheapest game I've ever bought (was even discounted for multi-buy). Amazing. 20/10
9471	1	a	might just be the best fun I ever had for 60p and workshop too .. also it plays great on a pad for chilling back on the couch . Never been a big fan of survival fps but this game alone is changing that :)
9473	1	a	dis, dis is a good game, buy it, it cheap,buy it ,it is like aneling youurself with a fineliner 
2841	0	a	worst game ever lol
9475	1	a	Fun and cheap.
9477	1	a	good game dino killing fun with head blasting hilarousnes trex and pterdactyle probobly the harder ones but thats whats good it adds variety and challenge thats whats good but its got its bads like a glitch where i hit a rock flying my jetpack i got downed and i fell into there and for about a minute i was coming back down and i already before i hit the grownd but thats me its really good try it
9479	1	a	Just Like My childhood dreams.....KILLING F****** DINOSAURS
9481	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!    Too much to read?   Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   *this game in a nutshell  Community Created Artwork for ORION: Prelude By: Grayscars (original artwork uploaded by Grayscars!)
9483	1	a	Good game to play with friends.
9485	1	a	I find this game for the price and for gameplay actually amusing and worth the buck. It's silly but fun at the same time and does bring a few good laughs when playing with friends. You're not meant to take this seriously and that is what makes it even better, graphics are not an issue and slaying millions of dinosaurs by punching them in the face or just blowing their brains out or piercing them with arrows is pretty damn entertaining. I'd say buy it fot you can't really go wrong with a buck you probably gained from selling steam cards anyways and if you just want something to pass the time and/or to relieve stress by killing prehistoric beasts then go right ahead.
9487	1	a	Survive waves of dinos. Different game modes with 3 different classes and a nice variety of enemies. Plenty of guns to choose from. A lil buggy but a solid game for a very cheap price. Such and underrated game.
9489	1	a	I like this game. Especially when i play it with my friends. Maybe they can add weapon attachment customization system.
9491	1	a	A T-Rex crushed me while I tried to punch it to death. 8/8 would lag again
2844	0	a	It's so glitchy and unoptimized. I wouldn't bother purchasing it.
9493	1	a	played one game, got picked up by a birdosaur 10/10
9495	1	a	this game was fun! i paid 50 cents for it and i love it!  its perfect for a simple shooter with your friends, theres several different game modes, differnt classes of waepons, bunch of maps. its perfect for getting into shooters its not to complicated and its not too bad looking either~  definatly worth a the dollar it costs~
9497	1	a	Perfect game for $.99, Lots of fun with friends.
2846	0	a	Whats the objective? what are the controls? lets find out *mashes all the buttons one by one*
9499	1	a	Best $1 I've ever spent! Good graphics, good co op, a lot of game modes and maps... and a fantastic price
9501	1	a	fun game to mess around in and its so cheep
9503	1	a	')
9505	1	a	10/10 would punch a T-Rex in the mouth again.
9507	1	a	A stegosaurus was coming right for me, but I was okay because I cloaked at the last second. 150000/10
2848	0	a	The game is on the verge of being likable which is what makes it worse.
9509	1	a	It is awesome you can play multi-player single player co-op. i have played it for 23 hours in total. that is good for 79p      
2849	0	a	Wow this game is bad..... 
9511	1	a	Not bad for its price, a good spread of weaponary and boosts. I decent escape from the average FPS.
9513	1	a	Think about this, this game is cheaper than a bar of chocolate. A bar of chocolate is satisfying but only for a short while as after you eat it, it's gone. Orion: Prelude on the other hand is a game meaning that it has a practically infinite amount of usage, and if shooting dinosaurs in the face is not satisfying to you then I don't know what is.
9515	1	a	I bought this game for my friends and I as a joke yet it turned into most of our favorites. Great graphics, controls, and gameplay made this an amazing buy for a dollar. It's sad that there aren't that many players because this game deservers a lot more players than it haves.
9517	1	a	It is really fun. I don't see why everybody is rating it badly, it never crashes and is really fun to play. totally buy it.
9519	1	a	You won't get a better game for this price. Its not a bad FPS, Now with the workshop it'll have an entire community of people working to create maps, textures, weapons, missions. for £2 or $3 for a four pack, you really should buy this and get your buddies in on the insanity. You won't regret it for this price. Its almost criminal not to buy it.
9521	1	a	Orion: prelude is very cheap game , but don't fool yourself saying if the game is cheap the gameplay is also cheap, no , it just doesn't happen to meet up in Orion: prelude, the game is very fun and I can see people are already addicted to it and it is just a great game.  For 1 dollar , you get minimum 140-160 hours of gameplay out of it , that's why I want to recommend this game , cheap price , long game. You won't find this aspect in most games in our days. I can ensure someone will play 200-300 hours... is it you ,reader? XD
9523	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun game, with friends or with the bots. Sure there are more problems with the game than I would wish, but for $0.99 there isn't anything to complain about.
9525	1	a	$1 to get rekt so hard by a dino you break the map 10/10
9527	1	a	Fun Shooters. I was hoping I could become the Dinosaurs lol. But anyway, fun games to be played with friends or family.
9529	1	a	This game is a beacon of peace and love. Here you see carnivores and herbivores working together, to kill you. Creatures that are natural enemies put their diferences aside to achieve a common goal, and it's beautiful.
9531	1	a	Cmon man what are you even looking at the reviews ? You can shoot waves of dino's !!! This game is simply a good game and it's .99 just buy this XD
9533	1	a	Dino's are ♥♥♥♥ing cool!
9535	1	a	Excellent game would definetly recommend. Vehicles, Purchase system, Jetpack, Dinosaurs, Co-operative play, and a great price of £0.79.
2851	0	a	by far the worst halo simulator ive ever seen. i mean my god! it violated me. it lured me inside with the promise of eye candy, why, just why!  (only took a few minutes to realise it was just awful)
9537	1	a	It's a very good game. Fast paced action similiar to old school shooters, really fun to play.
2853	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME EVEN FOR 99 CENTS IT IS BAD IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE FAT CHODE
9539	1	a	I would recomend this masterpiece :)
2854	0	a	A terrible shooter that not even dinosaurs could save.

2856	0	a	Worst game ever. Like, NOTHING in this game works, except for the singleplayer. But that ♥♥♥♥ ain't balanced AT ALL. 'Look at me! I've got a jetpack to fly places you can't hit me!' Assault-class all the way - eat ♥♥♥♥ Orion.
9543	1	a	Cheap, fun, tones of guns and you get to to kill Santa Claus 10/10
9545	1	a	I had so much fun with this game that I played 2 hours straight without knowing the f*cking objectives.  other than that the third person view is awkward as balls.  either way 8/10
9547	1	a	awwrrrsome LAN Party Game!    Check it out!
9549	1	a	My first play on orion prelude: &gt;enter the game &gt;take a weapon &gt;be taken by a pterodactyl &gt;dies 10/10 would fly with pterodactyl express again.
9551	1	a	A cool combination of star wars and dinasours. you can play survival mode, team deathmatch and lots of other modes, but i mostly recomend the survival mode. It is a fun game to play with friends. I thimk it can get pretty boring after a while, but for the ridiculous price, it's totaly worth it! The game runs pretty very well onmostly computers, and has good framerate. You don't need a very powerful computer to run the game in high quality. It has a few bugs with the motion of dinosours, but it is not so much that it makes the game worse. I rate this game 8/10
9553	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible 11/10
9555	1	a	This game can be a bit hectic if you thrust into it right away but it's fun, very fun!
9557	1	a	This is the best cheapest halo clone i've ever played. They even ported in the warthog, tank, and magnum, along with mechwarrior mechs. I've gotten better value playing this rediculous game than many others in my library that cost 10-50x more.
9559	1	a	The game is a whole dollar! Buy it! But seriously, great cooperative survival/hordes game. If you like killing floor or team fortress, you're going to love this game; especially when you consider the paltry price tag. Think Halo, meets Turok, meets Killing Floor and voila you have Orion Prelude! Highly recommend purchasing it!
9561	1	a	it's a fun game with cool weapons and etc
2859	0	a	this game's ♥♥♥♥
9563	1	a	Well, I got to play this game for free on a weekend deal before the update... it was less than mediocre. But now after the patching and stuff i'd say it is fairly decent.     7/10
9565	1	a	This game is like an Arcade Machine game except that you don't have to put a coin in everytime you want to play it.  When i bought this game, i wasn't really expecting much seeing its price tag, don't expect it to have BioShock Infinite graphics or something but it's still a really good game for $0.99!  Don't be fooled by the ''Hours played'' on my profile, i played alot offline.  PROS:  * Good buy menu, diversity of equipment, items and weapons * Multiplayer, duh * Objectives and missions, not only waves like in CoD zombies   CONS:  * Driving of the vehicles, it's not that good and you have to steer with your mouse. I don't really see any other cons.  So yeah, you should definetely buy this. 
9567	1	a	A good game if you like Halo and dino games.
9569	1	a	I saw this game when it was brand new, Orion: Dino Beatdown. It was cheap and the videos and pictures I saw made the game look like one of those b-rate jewels that was so bad, it was good. By bad, I do not mean that it's a horrible game, broken and unplayable. Rather, 'bad' in a way that one would eat nutritionally void foods because they are 'good'. If you want arcade type fun and mindlessly wasting hoards of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you. It's best played with a group of friends on voice chat so you can losely communicate tactics as what to do and laugh your ♥♥♥ off at how awesomely 'bad' this game is. Lots of connection issues, my ping is always through the roof (400+) Changing maps kicks you. Best to host a game yourself.  Breakdown: Graphics 7/10 Story 6/10 Gameplay 6/10 Reliability 5/10 Fun 9/10  Overview: Fun dinosaur shootem-up that is best played with friends and a couple drinks!
9571	1	a	Fan-fu**ing tastic game!
9573	1	a	Halo meets Dinosaurs, the warthogg and the scorpian tank are pretty good.
9575	1	a	During the 2014 Winter Sale, I bought a 4-pack for me and my friends, and we had some of the most fun and hilarious moments we've had in a while. It's not too high quality of a game, but worth $1.00 (let alone $1.50 for a 4-pack during the sale)? Hell yeah.
9577	1	a	  This game is not important for the gaming world ^^    The graphic is ok...   The fun that you have in the game is 65% :D   
9579	1	a	not recomender for low spec pc but for pc that can survive this sure realy recomended =D 
9581	1	a	Orion is a neat little game, that tries it hardest to be something that's it not. It's a strange mix of cyber and military machinery competing against prehistoric dinosaurs for control over large geological locations. Whether or not the dinosaurs or humans know they're fighting for it, you still are.  There are enough weapons and gadgets to keep you occupied for a while as you figure out which ones you like the most, but I wouldn't invest too much time into it. If you're not playing on hard difficulty, it doesn't really matter, and most strategies are taken on rambo style. Body modidications increase health, increase firing rates, jump heights and more. I've seen the deathmatch in the game, but the lack of players leaves it hard to fight for any top player space.  It's not really good, but not really bad either. I like it, but not that much. There are lots of qualities that come up and can be taken advantage of to make your game even more fun, but there's nothing entirely worth mentioning. For the price, you should get it for sure. If you played it for a day, you'd be getting your money's worth ten fold.. but again, not much more than a day.  Definetly buy it and add it to your collection of games. At the time of writing this, it's one dollar. Can't complain.
9583	1	a	But ♥♥♥♥, it was ninety-nine cents! 0,99/0,99
9585	1	a	By far one of the best co-op shooting games ive played if not THE best. its just so riculously fun and the gameplay is fantastic. Also achievements. all kinds of achivements. u play as futuristic soldiers with jetpacks and guns slaying waves of dinosaurs. i shuldnt need to say anything more, 9/10
9587	1	a	Nice graphics good team playing game like tf2 but instead of player enemys its dinosaurs!!!
2868	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥ ITS A ♥♥♥♥♥ YA ♥♥♥♥♥ 3/3467890 POP A MOLLY UNLEASH SUPER-SAIYAN
9589	1	a	Probably one of the best games for that price, tonnes of fun and lots of achievements to be won
9591	1	a	Great game :) Don't expected an indie multiplayer/coop shooter to be that good :)
9593	1	a	I really like this one. Although the graphics aren't that great, I had lots of fun killing dinosaurs both alone and with my teammates. One of my favorite parts of the game is the wide variety of weapons you can use in-game between rounds. At first, it was a little frustrating trying to figure out some of the options the game gives us but after a while, you'll WANT to learn some of these extra features.  It's a great buy for just $1. It's definitely worth it!
2869	0	a	A nice concept, but fails on execution. So-so graphics, unbalanced gameplay, nothing to help you learn the game, empty servers and super repetitive music. Feels more like an alpha or beta rather than a finished game.
9595	1	a	you got my respect game
9597	1	a	Awesome Game. Just buy and enjoy it.
9599	1	a	Absolutely AMAZING!!!! So worth your money!! JUST GET IT IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI FPS/DINO GAMES!!!!!!! This is a great addition to your first-person shooter collection!
2871	0	a	Cheap game, so can't complain. It does feel like it was developed by some people who got bored midway and still decided to release it.
9601	1	a	It's definitely worth 99 cents. Not many people play this game. I think every game I joined we had at least 2 bots on a five man team. It's fun for 99 cents, but after playing for a bit, I can definitely see why it is 99 cents. I don't know, give it a chance I guess. You might like it and you would add to the player base because it is lacking. I guess I will recommend this because it's not terrible, and you can't beat it for 99 cents.
9603	1	a	your probaly asking is this game good? well if it was a regular 5$ or more game no its horrible but for 1 dolalr you get quite a lot you get decent graphics nice weather effects and the guns look pretty cool it has some vehicles and of course dinos which are good but sometimes are a pain to hit so if you have 1 dollar and looking to waste it look no further
9605	1	a	It seems that I can NOT buy the 4-pack for my friends, now that I have purchsed a copy for myself, just so I could check out the game before sending it on to them.   This may just be a Steam Store problem, which I think I have run into before this purchase attempt.    Merry Christmas or Happy Thanksgiving, depending on which is being advertised first in your locality.
9607	1	a	Its a fun game to play when you need them dino kills :D
9609	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pUa-Ot_jaI 
9611	1	a	awesome game for 1 dollar. Why is this game 1 dollar? not because its crap but because the devs are crazy. be warned though if your using a basic work PC this games not for you.  8.5/10
2876	0	a	Seems like if turok and halo had a baby (the first or second halo of course, because the graphics, i think that i could even run it on my celeron). The blood is bad as s**t, but... it was 0.99€ and is the type of game you'll give for your girlfriend play when she on her period, she'll love it!
9613	1	a	great raarrrr action some of graphcs dump than priminal carnage some of better.
9615	1	a	This game catches alot of flak, I'm not honestly sure why it has such a low metascore, because personally I find the game to be a really solid co-op survival game. There's nothing outstanding about the game, but the jetpacks, vehicles, guns and grenades all work fine.   Load up the game with a few friends and this is a pretty good choice for come mindless shooting fun.
9617	1	a	Its has dinosaurs and Nice VEHICLES what else can you ask for a game!!
2878	0	a	Also just 3 € in the summer sale were too much for this game....
9619	1	a	Orion is personally a great game except it can get really easy.  Pros : Well it has Dinosaurs Lots of Weapons Cool Vehichles  Cons : Too easy Assault is OP       If you are assault you can fly on a rock and win without dieing once 
9621	1	a	More fun than a stripper with no inhibitions at a bachelor party!
9623	1	a	I liked it Great buy for 1$
9625	1	a	Killing Floor with dinos...DINOOOOOOOS :D It hink its cool, worth a try. Nothing extra just to spend time if you are bored :D
9627	1	a	Killed a huge ♥♥♥♥ing spinosaurus with a ghetto lightsaber. 11/10
9629	1	a	This game is awesome i wish more people played. Id like to see more upgrades and modes develope.
9631	1	a	i love this game and the tank is so awesome
9633	1	a	It's a fun game to play during some down time inbetween activities.
2881	0	a	I tried this when it was free to play. It is just an awful game.
9635	1	a	5 Gabens/10  This game still looks a little rusty but it wont avoid making you a freaking addict to it.  Chased a T-Rex got surrounded by a swarm and died, would chase again.
9637	1	a	i wish i hade this game but my mom wont buy me ♥♥♥♥  
9639	1	a	this game is one of the best games i have ever purchased on steam i compleatly love this game and any one who loves servival should get this, this game puts cod zombies servival in the same league no joke :D
9641	1	a	Wow this game is actually really fun. Who knew killing dinosuars is actually really fun xD
9643	1	a	It's being improved on, but as of now it's absolute fun with friends!
9645	1	a	This game is like a halo style shooter with a nazi zombie feel as you have waves of dino's both land and air attacking you. cool and very fun to play with friends, i also like the addition of the tanks, at-at things and the jeeps they make getting around the huge map a lot easier ( as its dino sized and you are tiny ) 7/10
9647	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a cheap and fun indie game. If you like horde mode games, then you'll love this one. Stand off with up to 4 team mates against ever increasing hordes of dinosaurs and boss dinosaurs. Upgrade your weapons/abilities as the rounds progress. It's a fun little time waster and great with friends!
9649	1	a	This game is very fun when playing with a friend or more than one. Not that graphics matter, but when I turned all my graphics to low, everything still looked magnifique. REALLY FUN GAME TO PLAYYYYYYYYYYYY~
9651	1	a	a very fun dino game to play with friends :D
9653	1	a	fun multiplayer and great with friends
2884	0	a	terrible, not even worth 1.99 or whatever it is
9655	1	a	its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that steals counter strike's guns, and halo's vehicles. but I had fun with it.
9657	1	a	Minecraft 2: Jurassic park edition is an absoulety faithful remake of the origianal Just Cause. This is one of my absoulute favourite game and it is defininately worth 10$
9659	1	a	pretty fun coop game, great value. could be better graphics (reminds me of Tribes) but the coop gameplay is fun. would not recommend playing offline solo.
9661	1	a	Watched my friend run around a mountain being chased by a t-rex while I was invisible. 8/10
2887	0	a	This game is pretty boring and has bad graphics, If it hadnt have been free to test, I wouldnt have played it... Im glad i didnt buy it.
9663	1	a	Another good PVE Co-Op shooter. Easier than the others I've played due to the implimentation of vehicles, but effectively this is Halo with dinosaurs.  Mech suits, lightsabers, and t-rexes. Lots of fun co-op.  The shooting is alright as well.
9665	1	a	This is really a pretty terrible game. But, if you grab the right friends and you can get it dirt cheap, it can be a ton of fun.
9667	1	a	Ok, so: Automatic weapons? Check. Jetpacks? Check. Dinosaurs? .....DOUBLE CHECK!  This game is WAY fun! I'm not sure how anyone is finding this boring. YOU FLY AROUND ON JETPACKS AND SHOOT DINOSAURS WITH SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.  'Nuff said. If you don't own this, you're wrong.
9669	1	a	Picked it up for $1.49, super great deal! The more I play the game, the more enjoyable it has gotten. There isn't a very large learning curve, and within the first hour or so you have a decent idea of what's going on. After that, exploring the levels some and seeing the different weapons and vehicles this game has to offer makes for an ejoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this game, there's a good chance it might suprise you!
2889	0	a	Let me just say there is a good reason that they only show off community reviews on the store page: every slightly educated video gamer knows this is a functionally bad game. The metacritic score is correct and should not be tampered, and no this isn't a different game than the Orion before it. While this game has many features, none of them work together in the slightest. It seems as though this is just a marketing scam for a garbage game that tries to attract every single 10-year-old shooter player. I played during a free weekend, and I can confidently say that I will never look at this title again. I wouldn't pay 5 cents for it.
9671	1	a	:)
9673	1	a	IDFC why it have just 36/100 but its fun as hell...
2890	0	a	Graphics are ♥♥♥♥. The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥. The sound makes me want to cry. The recoil on some of the weapons are trash. Even if it's only one dollar, I would rather have the 4 gumballs that could buy me.
9675	1	a	Beats playing Dino D-Day Worth getting :D DX11 Support, Unreal Engine, You can ride on a T-REX and destory humans together, you can drive bikes/cars etc, totally epic game well worth checking out.
9677	1	a	Excellent idea and design but balence is terrible. If you do not pick the support class you are bad as not only are you the tankiest character but you also have a healing gun. The other two charcters only get a jetpack or a really lame invisiblity power, and anything else that seperates them has a go around.
9679	1	a	Amazing Game! Is very replayable meaning you wont regret buying this game a week later. Plus you can kill a stegosaurus with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank! In my opinion this game is right up there with killing floor, probably better. A must have!
2891	0	a	For some reason this game gets put on sale multiple times. If you're looking for a hilariously bad game to play with your friends, this is for you.
9681	1	a	It is what it says it is; You, Bullets, Robots, Dinos
2892	0	a	Only good part of this game is buying a vehicle and racing your friends. The dinosaurs are ♥♥♥♥.
9683	1	a	bought for 99 cents, had fun with friends for a view hours. not enough content for more then 4 hours.
2894	0	a	I've only been able to play 2 games. Almost every time I try to join a game it crashes.
9685	1	a	+This game got dinosaurs like you won't believe  +♥♥♥♥ tha dinos in a mech suit  +♥♥♥♥ tha dinos in a tank +♥♥♥♥ tha dinos with a knife -deinosuchus will ♥♥♥♥ ur ♥♥♥ up  +deinosuchus will ♥♥♥♥ ur ♥♥♥ up
9687	1	a	Go this when it was on sale for $0.99 and I like it. Not aa game I'll spend a long time playing but it's fun for a quick fix.
2895	0	a	I saw this game on sale for a buck and thought 'Why not?' I had fun with it, but that fun gets outshone by several problems with the game which I am surprised are still there for a game that was released over 2 years ago.  First off, the game. It's a game where you are set against hordes of dinosaurs, ranging from quick raptors that try to hunt in in groups, to triceratops that will charge at you, to T-Rexs which will just gobble you up. You have a variety of weapons to choose from: pistols, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and even a bow and sword. You can also hop in vehicles, such as trucks, tanks, and VTOLs. With three classes (a flying type, a medic type, and a cloaking type) you have ample options to wreck those dinos. Of course, there is the PvP modes as well, where you can play as the dinosaurs as well.  Before I start getting into the problems I had with it, let me say this: I did have fun. You can have a lot of fun with the game when it is working. My favorite loadout is jetpack, grenade launcher, and shotgun, with a little extra armor for good measure. I can tear through hordes of dinos while flying around like a fairy. It is also entertaining to have a jeep plow through the enemy while your buddy is shooting from the turret on the back. So yes, I had fun with the game.  However, I really can't recommend this game because of some glaring issues with it. 1. Connection issues. Connecting to server is iffy at best. Some times it will connect you to a game, and then instantly disconnect you. This happens quite a bit. Other times, you'll be midmatch, then be disconnected even though there was no indication of a bad connection. Sometimes lag will be horrendous. Players teleporting around your screen, and bullets seeming to vanish a foot in front of you. About 30% of my time had no issues. The other 70%, I was having trouble connecting, or getting dropped from a server. I've had several really good runs ruined by a random disconnect. It is extremely frustrating.  2. No tutorial. None whatsoever. It took me over an hour before I realized I had grenades(press g to throw). Also, you would think space would control the jetpack, but it's set to ctrl for some reason. You can melee, but again, you don't know that unless you hit it on accident, ask someone, or run accross it in the keybindings. It was even longer before I figured out how the augments system works(just an fyi, you can have an infinite number of augments equipped. You buy them by double-clicking. You can also buy an augment more than once for some reason. It doesn't boost you though, it just takes your credits). Altogether, there may be some fun stuff I am missing, but I don't know what those are because it isn't made obvious.  3. The graphics are all over the place. The dinosaurs look really good. The enviroments look all right. The player models just look horrible. Even when playing on high settings, they look blocky, or the texture messes up really badly. As for the weapons, some of them look really cool, such as the burst-fire rifle(I don't remember what it's called). Other weapons look extremely uninspired. The shotgun I like to use looks like a tube with some lights and wires. Also, a number of icons look extremely low resolution. They should really be polished up. The vehicles are all over the place in terms of style. Most have s silvery shine and lights, some are dark and grey, and the hoverbike looks like it is from a different game entirely with its turqoise paint.  4. Balance. The balance is odd at times. For example, a knife is pretty powerful, but the sword is pretty weak. That's a really weird decision, especially since it costs more credits to get the sword than the knife. Also, the grenade launcher is probably too powerful. I love to use it, and I am saying it is too much. I just wreck dinos with it, until I'm overflowing with credits I can't use. At times, my teammates are running low on funds because they can't really compete with a GL. Another weird decision is the turrets. I have only seen someone use one once because they only last 60 seconds, even though you most likely will not be able to afford one until wave 8/10. I don't know why you would pay 20,000 credits for one (the same price as some of the most powerful weapons in came), and people I have played with can't justify buying them either. Another issue I had was with the augments, one case in particular. There are two augments that affect jumping, one which increases your jump height(by a lot) and one which gives you double jump(which is unaffected by the previous augment). The jump height upgrade is flatout better than the double jump. There is a very noticable difference in heights you can reach between the two.  5. The shooting. For the most part, the guns feel pretty weak. They don't do a whole lot of damage, they don't sound powerful, and they can be extremely innacurate. Especially when you buy some of the more expensive guns, they don't do much damage to justify their cost. Sometimes, guns are innacurate for the weirdest of reasons. For example, the turret on the back of the car. If you look to the left or right with it and fire, the bullets will hit several feet to the left or right of where you aimed. I felt something was off when driving around with it, then tested it while stationary. Even while sitting still, if you aren't looking straight forward or backwards, it won't hit where you aim. I really don't understand why that is.   6. Bugs. Some of the bugs I have run into: -not spawning in a match. You are supposed to spawn when a new wave starts, but I've had several times where this had not worked. -in the player customizations screen, my character would not be centered on the screen. About half the time, my character model would be off to the side under the menus where I coulndn't seem him. -as mentioned before, you can buy augments more than once. I accidently bought an augment twice while playing, losing valuable credits. -in the keybindings, you can set vehicle steering to be either controlled by A and D, or by mouse. This doesn't work, it will always be controlled by mouse. I never got it to work. -sometimes, when reviving a teammate, the meter will disappear. You are still reviving them, you just can't see it, so don't stop holding E.  7. Just weird little quirks: -the tank has a second, smaller turret on top, similar to what is in the car, but it is still controlled by the driver. They could really make the tank a two-seater and give control of the secondary turret to him. -dinosaur spawning. We lost several vehicles because dinosaurs spawned on top of us while driving by. That really ruined the mood. -the flying dinosaurs(called Rhams according to the wikia) can turn on a dime. They'll fly at a player from above to try and hit him, but will stop and turn really quick, making them difficult to dodge, as well as being difficult to predict and shoot. -there is an indicator on your HUD showing you how many magazines you have left. However, the games doesn't use a magazine system. Ammo is just taken from your ammo pool and dumped into your gun.  So while it is fun at times, a lot of stuff can and does go wrong. If you can get it on sale, great, you'll find some entertainment with it. I got it for a dollar. But I cannot recommend paying 15 dollars on it, as well as spending real money for cosmetic items in the in-game shop.
9689	1	a	great game to play with friends :D
2896	0	a	I was told by a friend that this game isn't that good and I didn't believe him. Till I played it on my own and it isn't that good at all. The gameplay just doesn't seem right, the first thing the enemies do is jusr charge at you no matter what. Even though they're dinosaurs. It doesn't seem to have a good plot to except to protect certain stuff and kill dinosaurs. The graphics are fine, but it doesn't make up for how I think of the game. I don't recommend this game. 5/10
9691	1	a	Very entertaining to play with friends a must buy for under 5$.
9693	1	a	Get to shoot dinos with futuristic weapons with ur friends. best few bucks i spent
2897	0	a	What a horrible and junk game
9695	1	a	Great fun. The concept of shooting dinosaurs is kinda ridiculous but the game is really fun. I like the different classes and the wide range of weapons and skills. The vehciles like the mech are awesome too :)
9697	1	a	The game is actually really fun despite its lackluster graphics and off physics. Theres a decent enough array of dinosaurs and the game does get challenging, the vehicles are fun to drive, theres a good assortment of them and overall its a fun experience. Its definetley worth the $15 price tag, and i was lucky nough to have gotten it for only $1.50.
9699	1	a	A better game than it may at first appear, with a group of friends it can be a lot of fun fighting off the dinosaur hordes. On your own the game can be a bore but with the right people it shines.
9701	1	a	I totally just beat a triceratops to death. I have wanted to do that ever since I was a kid. Also revamped my hate for pterodactyls.
9703	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Video Game (more or less)
9705	1	a	Got eaten by dinosaurs  10/10
9707	1	a	best game ever...meta score was a lie! Better then most 60$ games!
9709	1	a	A simple FPS with dinosaurs, what more could you want?
2901	0	a	Awful game. Just terrible...
9711	1	a	Honestly, this is great fun. Get a few friends, yell, shoot dinosaurs and probably get straight chomped by a T-Rex. Also, there are tanks and mechs and such. The game is pretty janky, granted, but it's fun as hell.
9713	1	a	For what this game lacks in graphics and dept, it makes up for it in fun and playability. It plays alot like Halo 2
9715	1	a	This game needs better video settings for low-end pcs aswell as better guns to start of with instead of pistols...
9717	1	a	Amazing game. Would recommend to anyone. Dinos and guns, the childhood dreams.
9719	1	a	this game is a great game and you should totally buy it
9721	1	a	It's a cute game. Who doesn't like to kill dinosaurs?
9723	1	a	This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing don't let the reviews deter you.
9725	1	a	this game is just starting out and has great potential. Being able to kill players and dinosaurs what more can you ask for.
2904	0	a	This game may look fun however it is not. My friends and I played it and it was very boring and the graphics were really bad. Please don't even spend one dollar on this game its not worth it.
9727	1	a	Stabbed a T-Rex in the face with a Lightsaber  10/10
9729	1	a	its exactly what it looks like
9731	1	a	Very addicting
9733	1	a	Punching Dinosaurs. That is all.
9735	1	a	Pretty fun for cheap
9737	1	a	Shoot ♥♥♥♥ers in the face and they die, the filty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s had it coming anyways. They aren't suppose to still be alive and they killed my mechwarrior.
2907	0	a	Garbage not worth the $1.49 I payed for it.
9739	1	a	Super fun game! The co-op gameplay is freaking awesome, i brought this game for $1.50 and it's worth more than that for sure. I also host an Aus server when i play so feel free to join me.   7/10 for gameplay 1/10 story (there is no story) 4/10 Animations(they are pretty bad on raptors) 8/10 FPS  Overall 6/10(For steam summer sale 10/10)   If you are thinking of buying this for steam summer sale you will not regret it
2908	0	a	this game is crap to play by yourself...maybe it would be fun with other people...
9741	1	a	This game is a fun FirstPerson shooter with a destructive force of dinosaurs. Will you join me in the endless waves of killer monsters?
2909	0	a	Not worth the $1.50 i paid for it. Although it presents a decent concept, it feels unfinished with LOW 2d graphics on small dinosaurs and a lack of both game mode variety and gun textures.
2910	0	a	Although it was a decent effort, this game's mechanic are not the best. The game feels rather clunky and has a large time gap in between survival rounds. In addition, there is a lack of game mode variety available in this game. Due to this, my attention deviated from this game in less than an hour. In conclusion, I would not reccomend buying this game even though I got it for $1.49.
2911	0	a	i played it a little bit didnt really like it. i think it needs some more work
9743	1	a	Don't let the Metascore fool you. This game is the ♥♥♥♥. Have you ever played a zombies base-defense type game but wanted dinosaurs instead of zombies? Look no further. The graphics are good-looking and easy to run, and you get to shoot dinos. And play as them. Just get it already.
9745	1	a	When I saw the graphics in the game, it took me back to the year 2002. Ah yes the early days of the PS2. The summer of 2002 was a great summer. I was a young lad of 13 years old. I wore Hawaiian shirts every day and drank Sprite Ice as I rode my mountain bike my parents got me for my 12th birthday. I would visit my friends who skateboarded. I would try and jump the skateboard ramp on my mountainbike and crashed horribly. I ripped one of my Hawaiian shirts doing this. Boy, was my mom sore with me. Those were the last days of my innocence. After these precious moments, I grew up more and more each year. My mountain bike eventually passed down to my brother, as did my Hawaiian shirts. Summer became autumn. Autumn became winter. And so on. The ps2 got better graphically. Then the ps3 came out. Then the ps4. Most of my skateboarder friends are dead now. Sprite doesn't make Sprite Ice anymore. Thank you, ORION: Dino Horde. 10/10.
9747	1	a	Really dumb fun akin to Killing Floor with a dinosaur flavor. Actually a very rewarding experience with friends.
9749	1	a	This game is downright off the wall silly. you want a wave based survival game, you got it, you want a futuristic shooter, you got it, you want vehicles, you get 6 or 7 different types, you want multiplayer, bring 4 friends with you into survival. you want pvp, do it up. this game has it all, including shenanigans. honestly i really enjoyed it and will play more. 2.6 hours in the past 40 hours of owning it, and thats just cause ive had business to attend to off of steam
9751	1	a	The T-rex's roar is earsplitting.
2912	0	a	If you ever wondered how virtual garbage may look like.. Just buy this game and your desire for knowledge will be satisfied.
9753	1	a	Surprisingly fun, like Halo with dinosaurs
2913	0	a	I bought this game when it was $0.99 and I want every cent back. It's borderline unplayable. I don't understand why this game has any positive reviews. I'm pretty sure my review will be deleted shortly. If you can see this, don't buy this unholy mess of a game.
2914	0	a	♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.DO NOT BUY,WASTE OF MONEY,NEVER BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME,IT SUCKS,TETRIS IS BETTER THAN THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.
9755	1	a	Defenitly a good game, much like Killing Floor. Need a lot of teamwork to succed against late wave, or else its a bloodbath.
9757	1	a	Great game, love the multiplayer mode. You can enjoy it for hours at once.
9759	1	a	this game is halo and jurrassic park. there are perks to buy with credits just like in CoD zombies which can be used different ways to fit whatever play style you want. got a 36 on meta score but is way more fun than that rating...
9761	1	a	Great game to play with friends, survival game against dinosaurs? what more could you want
2915	0	a	Absolutely horrible, I first had to trek 1 kilometer JUST TO GET TO THE FIGHT, and then the generator you were supposed to defend was out in the middle of a field IN FRONT OF THE FORT, as opposed to in the fort, where any sensible architect would have put it, and then when the dinos finally did begin appearing out of nowhere, I simply ran into them until they died on a tiny gravcycle, even the 'boss' was killed by a few hits with the completely undamaged gravcycle.
2916	0	a	it looks like it could be a fun game but the dino controls are kinda really bad
9763	1	a	Actually a lot better than the reviews would say, it is great fun in local co-op!
2918	0	a	Microtransactions and a pricetag, it's fun, but not my cup of tea.
9765	1	a	This ga,e is alright. If it is still on sale for under 4 dollars than I would say it is worth it. Otherwise DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH A TEN FOOT POLE, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
9767	1	a	Pay no attention to the 'metascore' as it does not reflect this game at all. At the moment I have just finished my first game and it was awesome. It reminds me of Halo mixed with Turok. I figured out most of the controls within five minutes and was soon blasting away dinos. If you want a fun game that can also present a challenge then I recommend this for you.
9769	1	a	Wow, I bought the game while it was free to play then when I go to play it it says it expired or something like that. So I go to this and I bought it for a friend I wasted 2 dollars but my friend can play the game I dont get it!
9771	1	a	I only recommend this game if you get it for less than $1. I'd be very unhappy if I paid full price for this game. Quite repetitive, you'll pretty much play through every map a few times in a few hours and get bored.
9773	1	a	Good for the first 3 hours, gets old though, repetitive gameplay. Just my opinion
9775	1	a	Just started playing it, but I can already tell it's going to be a favorite. Cross all the best aspects of dinosaur-hunting games with the multiplayer of Halo, add weapon upgrades based on XP you collect from each wave, and many awesome vehicles that are fun to operate and totally devastating. The bosses (large dinosaurs) are challenging, but it's the small ones you'll forget about that will end you. Planning on losing a lot of hours making dinosaurs bleed. Can play alone, but multiplayer is the most fun.
9777	1	a	A lot more fun than I was expecting. Being able to fight dinos in a mech suit is amazing.
9779	1	a	Decent cheap game for those on a serious budget.
9781	1	a	So bad that it is amazing
9783	1	a	Aside from the basic graphics, pretty bad characters, dialouge and design... I had fun. I love 'horde' type games, and slaughtering Dinosaurs is a rare treat... In the end, it's not a very good game, but it's fun, and usually $1 on sale. Pick it up on one of those 90% off, or cheaper, but other than that, paaaass.
2921	0	a	The Source Engine would have been a better choice, doesnt make sense, poor aiming ability, promised big dinosaurs and big guns, world design :(
9785	1	a	A fun game. The only thing I really dislike about it is the absurd recoil
2922	0	a	A bad Halo knockoff with dinosaurs. Would've been nice to play humans vs dinosaurs with more than four people. 4 suicide bomber pterodactyls /10
2923	0	a	I got this game for .99 cents.. Its worth that much to be honest. Don't buy this game unless its dirt cheap.
2924	0	a	crappy game, boring bad graphix
9787	1	a	I get so wrapped up when I play this game. I do wish there were more dinosaurs though, but I'm sure they will come along eventually. Also I wish there were more gun choices for primary. I love the SMG, it's my favorite. It's difficult even with a group of friends, lol. Those pesky little dinos &amp; the flying ones, ugh! But all in all, I REALLY like this game. Doesn't help that I got it for .99 cent ;)
9789	1	a	This is an awesome game. Need to fix some of the small glitches though from where dinosaurs can move to / can move from. But apart from that, its all good!
9791	1	a	Like Jeff Goldblum this game had me avoiding the toilet for many days after playing. Simple concept lots of fun.
9793	1	a	this game is good for the price buy it...dont listen to the meta score....i enjoyed it and i only bought it for 1 $...
2926	0	a	It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off.   The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage.  The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective.  On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do.  Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
9795	1	a	Pretty good
9797	1	a	It's a little confusing at first i spawned and was immediately getting chased by a t-rex and about4 raptors and was eaten immediately but this game is still awesome nd makes for some epic moments.
9799	1	a	Difficult to begin, but fun once you get going. More fun with more people playing with you at the same time.
9801	1	a	by far the best $1.00 I've EVER spent... 8.5/10
9803	1	a	The best dino-killing-game ever. Its a fun shooting game, were you don't need to always shoot at player, but in stead have a great co-op. But hey! they got jet pack and medic gun, what can possibly go wrong :D
2928	0	a	Don't believe the hype! This game is still as crappy as ever. Even free, I regret that I even wasted the hard drive space on it. I normally don't write such scathing reviews, especially about indie titles because I loves me some indie development, but honestly, nothing good to say about this title.   Models = crap level design = uninspired crap skins = crap dinosaurs = unplayable crap Sound desgin = stock crap  This title is best relegated to the dustbin of Steamdom.
9805	1	a	Think Tribes with dinosaurs. I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but it has the potential to become one of those games that get popular for being bad, a sort of cult following. Other than that, the game was poorly executed, IMO, but a nice idea
9807	1	a	I keep getting picked up by flying dinosaurs and then dropped 1 mile down. 10/10 would be swept up by a Rhamphorynchus again.
9809	1	a	No point reviewing this game because it is the best game ever created
9811	1	a	As ♥♥♥♥ing silly as this game is I love it! The multiplayer action is fun and combo kills are rewarding and hilarious.   If you like L4D/L4D2 than pick this game up.   If you like killing tons of Dinosaurs from Tiny to Small get it!   If you don't want to disappoint Jeff Goldblum BUY ♥♥♥♥ING DINO HORDE!
9813	1	a	Pretty cool game, un polished in a lot of areas. But for the type of game it is, it handles pretty well.
9815	1	a	11/10 would crash again.
9817	1	a	Game is awesome. Highly recommend it especially since the price is so cheap.
9819	1	a	It's a pretty broken game but it's fun to play with with friends
9821	1	a	good game if you are interested in just having a bit of fun with friends
9823	1	a	First wave I played my head got chewed off by a T-Rex.  1O/10
9825	1	a	I more or less bought this game basically because the name has 'Dino Horde' in it. I expected it to be completely ridiculous. It is completely ridiculous, but it can be addicting. I mean, what really makes this game worth it is that there is a mode where you can play as the dinosaurs and kill other playable people. I like that. It is hard to get used to at first and they overwhelm you quickly (regular horde mode), but if you play with a group, it is enjoyable.
9827	1	a	I shot a T-rex in the face, and then t-bag it. Buy this game.
9829	1	a	Great game for the very low price (depending when you buy it) Dont trust the metacritic score
9831	1	a	It is so fun to kill all the dinos!
9833	1	a	I like this game in general good graphics and great gameplay are fun but the only problem is finding a match which is sometimes hard 
9835	1	a	Buy this game it has everything every man needs like guns .....and dinosaurs....and cars with mounted guns..and well everything just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already...
2933	0	a	One of the worst games on steam. Unplayable. If I could remove it from my game library permanently I would.
9837	1	a	Pretty pointless, but fun nonetheless.
9839	1	a	just look at it... how does that not look fun?
9841	1	a	Worth the money when I bought it (1€)
9843	1	a	only words.....................awesome!
9845	1	a	Short and simply put, ORION is a game developed by people clearly concerned with their consumers having fun. If you can get the game on sale, convince some friends to pick it up, or snag a bundle. At a good price, the game is worth the one night of fun you would get at minimum. The weapons are interesting, the combat is hectic and the maps large. The only real complaint that I have is that it is too hard to earn credits to buy better guns, abilities, and in some maps and game types, vehicles.
9847	1	a	earrape dinos and halo 10/10
9849	1	a	really good gameplay the dinausors bug and fly in the sky from time to time but apart from that i really recomend it and its almost free
2935	0	a	This game can be, 'fun' but it really isnt that great. The graphics arent what they were portrayed to be and most everything else is just terrible quailty, do not reccomend.
9851	1	a	a game you can't stop playing hrs upon hrs of fun :D
9853	1	a	Its a fun game.
9855	1	a	Bought It a long LONG time ago, Its still looks amazing and trust me, It Is amazing!
2936	0	a	why the f does it not run right f***** douches i s[ent 15$ on it
9857	1	a	This is a great game, dinos, weapons, pve and pvp, loadouts, levels, unlockables, classes. If you like these things, get it! For only 99 cents right now, it can't hurt, right?
9859	1	a	This is a game that I recomend greatly due to its great gameplay. it may have some glitches here and there but its nice to get a game that anyone can get for just a dollar.
9861	1	a	Orion prelude is a scifi egoshooter, situated in a time, where dinosaurs exist.  there are 3 main roles, and each role feature unique abilitys. Dinosaurs attack wave after wave, and they get stronger each wave!  the animation of the landscape is one of the best, if not the best I have seen in games. The ammount of different weapons is not that big, but there is something for everyone's taste! ever wanted to drive with a verry fast vehicle under a huge dinosaur?? I was able to :) It is not a game like cs:go which you can play many hours a day, day after day, but it is definitively a realy good game to play while waiting for a teammember cooking his dinner.  I personaly like to play the character,that is able to get invisible, and shoot with the large machine gun.  The game would be worth 7 bucks, so it is way to cheap im my eyes. enjoy
9863	1	a	Great game, don't trust Metacritic's broken system
9865	1	a	Truely, with a dollar, you can't buy many things. A candy bar at most, but this game is truly worth a dollar if you got one, especially if you have some friends to play it with you.
9867	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a knife. Never bring a T-Rex to a knifefight 9/10 would knife again.
2938	0	a	This game... is broken and laughable.. want a laugh? sprint and look down at your legs flailing around... it's only a buck so... if you've got money to spend... go ahead
9869	1	a	Ask yourself this, can you really go wrong with a 99 cent game?
9871	1	a	Game is a lot of fun, but the only problem I had seem to have was that there was lag when having a second player join. It wasn't impossible to play, but it was a mild annoyance.
9873	1	a	Fun game to play with friends :)
2939	0	a	Game play was glitchy at best
9875	1	a	A great gift for friend you want to torture  this game is like bad rats    not even worth 99C
9877	1	a	Purchased while on sale for $0.99, watching the game play videos I assumed this game would be a lag nightmare or somehow not live up to any decent expectations. It proved to be the best gaming purchase I have made in years. Even for 20x what I paid this game would be worth it, as the key to any good game it is very fun!
9879	1	a	why have u not brought this already?!  Trust me, it's amazingly, fantastically, utterly, brilliant, over the top, fps, giggles a second fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.  Oh and you can eat people as a dino &lt;burp&gt;
9881	1	a	There is no reason why you should not own this game. It's $0.99! Buy the 4 pack and gift it to your friends!
2941	0	a	I changed my mind about this game, the soldiers are perfect but the dinosaurs on the other hand get stuck on any bush it hits and it is impossible to kill any soldiers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
2942	0	a	I am just dissapointed with Overkill. This is game is just bad. I loved the days of Dino Horde, but prelude is virtual trash. You downgraded us! Orion: Dino Horde was worth $15! Prelude isn't even worth $1. Also, I had 2 copies of Orion: Dino Horde in my inventory, and when it updated us to Prelude, they dissapeared. A sad, sad dissapointment.
2943	0	a	THIS STUPID GAME DOSENT WORK I HAVE ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IT DOSENT WORK
2944	0	a	The graphics are out dated, most of the servers don't work. Lack of support for new players make the game unbalanced. Don't waste your money
9883	1	a	AW MAN. this game is HOT. It has everything but a story, so I just pretend we are settlers, clearing the way for more settlers! its Halo-esque and Borderlandsy feel aids in you feeling great about the sensless re- extinction of the ancient species. I love it.
9885	1	a	Wait? I thought I bought 'ORION: Dino Horde' - maybe I was dreaming ...
2945	0	a	This game is glitchy and buggy and the gameplay lacks any kind of fun You are only trying to find the small dinos in the grass (they are hard to find) to kill em and the you shoot the big uns  nah
9887	1	a	Though the old version of this game was not a well-liked game, this one is quite the oppposite. It's not fantastic, but it certainly is for paying $0.99! I'm not saying it isn't fun, because it certainly is, but it simply does not have as much content as more expensive games. But thta's why those games are more expensive. Overall, I like the GUI, except the buttons could be labeled for PC gamers as well (in the menu, it shows A and B button indicators for console), and the HUD could use more concise labeling. I had trouble telling which bar was which. It is a fun game, and I plan on playing it for a while.
2946	0	a	Very laggy, wasn't able to do anything. I had just the game open and it glitched and lagged so bad. I felt like I was on DSL again. The graphics are nice, but it isn't worth the lag. I give it a one out of 5 stars, graphics are nice. Only good thing about tha game to be honest.
9889	1	a	I cant believe this game is only for $1. If you are too stingy to pay $1 for quality, then go sit in the corner.  (personally i got one of the free copies)  First of all, you are paying for bare minimum quality you would expect from a $1 game. However, the quality you get is much better then that of most $20-30 games. Not to mention all the different game modes, equipment, enemies and customization.  Sound/picture quality: 7/10 (few graphical/camera issues that need to be addressed. Luckily they do not affect the core game)  Gameplay: 8/10 (its just generally all around fun. What more could you want from shooting dinosaurs)  Multiplayer: 10/10 (Had no issues with multiplayer. Its just one of those games thats 10x as fun with friends)  Highly recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it. Its only gonna continue to get larger with steam workshop content flooding in. (PS: some game modes allow playing as dinosaurs)
9891	1	a	Yolo
9893	1	a	♥♥♥♥ the reviews, this game is awesome
9895	1	a	Jetpack onto a rock and shoot dinos for the first 3 waves. Get a tank on wave 4. Win. 10/10 
9897	1	a	A surprisingly fun title with more than what you bargained for.
9899	1	a	Got torn up by some velociraptors 10/10
9901	1	a	Played as a dinosaur. Ate a guy. 10/10 would eat someone again.
9903	1	a	Great value for a great game, sure it has its problems but they are being fixed by the devs and the game only gets better as time goes on and for 79p you won’t find a game like it. Great graphics and a great selection of modes to play from Survival (Objective)  Slaughter (Duration), Rampage (Playable Dinosaurs), Prehistoric (Custom Variable).  As of this month the ORION: Prelude Developer SDK Beta is going to be released so the possibilities of what you can do is endless thanks to the steam workshop support.  Overall a good game and a great value, though don't let the low price put you of from buying this game as it is well worth it, there are plenty of reviews out about this game so I have kept my very brief but I give this game an 8.5 out of 10.
9905	1	a	Stupid fun. I mean that literally. A weekend dollar well spent. Get your friends, kill some dinos, use a jetpack, laugh.
9907	1	a	One of the few examples of Early Access done right I'm still confused as to how such a total piece of garbage became so great 
9909	1	a	This game might not be game of the year material, but it sure is a fun game. You get to shoot, stab and burn dinos, what more do you want? Play as dinos? Good thing you can. It is the game I never knew I wanted, and I love it.
9911	1	a	Shooting dinos with big guns - almost the best way to let off some steam. Second to having sexual intercourse.
9913	1	a	7/10 i'm no FPS player, but the coop vs dinosaur is pretty cool! Give it a try :P
9915	1	a	I don't own this game so I am giving it a thumbs up for letting me review it without having bought it.
9917	1	a	Great game and very fun to play with friends and for 99cents cant beat it!
2950	0	a	Game costs a dollar for a reason. Crashed as soon as I joined a server.
9919	1	a	THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME
9921	1	a	It's like skyrim with Dinosaurs
9923	1	a	You look at this game, and you think...Ehhhh, is it worth it? It looks kinda (dumb, simple, noobish, glitchy, whatever), so you seriously don't consider getting it. Get it. Its probably worth at least 5 dollars, and future updates can only make it better xD  Gun system very similar to CSGO, with weapons that are based on the same type (heavy deagle like pistol, AUG like gun), but that doesn't make it a knockoff. Its very unique, with a very fun, adventureous feel. The community is nothing but friendly, and learning to play is easy. Its a fun way to meet some new online friends, or play with some old ones. If it is its worth you're worried about, don't.   Now, it is not a top notch game. The mouse is super sensitive, so you have to adjust it every now and then. Sometimes settings dont stay saved, so you have to reset them. Servers are kinda glitchy, so sometimes it takes a minute to join. It is a .99 cent game, so bugs are there. If you want a top of the line, everything must be aboslutely perfect and run smoothly kinda game, this probably isn't up your alley. It takes a little patience, but only a little.   Overall? Get it, unless you're really, reaaaally picky. You'll love it. Kill some dinos for me!
9925	1	a	best game ever have you been a flying dinosour and pick someone up 
9927	1	a	Perfect game to play with friends. Shoot at Dinosours, grenade them. Play with the settings for crazy games. You get a lot of game and fun for the price.
9929	1	a	Most enjoyable game I've ever played! Killing dinos have never felt this epic :D
2952	0	a	If you got the 99c to spend on something you might play two or three times, go ahead and purchase. I wasn't really into it personally. There are very few servers to play on and they're very laggy. The fact that you have to pay 99c for a game that could easily go on the free to play list (considering there's an in game shop) just seems like a bad business tactic. Maybe I just joined the wrong servers, maybe my internet was bugging out, maybe it's just not my type of game but I wouldn't recommend this one when there's sales on much better games out there.
9931	1	a	This game is extreemely fun. At the time of its writing it is 99 cents which I have no idea why. It is worth way more than that. Just buy it.
9933	1	a	was 99cents very fun, very addicting, everyone should snatch this game up
9935	1	a	Really fun. IF you have friends to play it with.
9937	1	a	for 99 cents you really can't beat this game. Yes it might not have singleplayer or any sembelance of a storyline, but it does not detract from what the game is about. A 4 player shoot dinosaurs in the face simulator. Add that to the fact to multuiple game modes (one of wich you play the dinos on a quest to eat some supersoldiers) and you got a recipe for a very fun multiplayer experience. Updates are frequent and always seem to add to this game. A must buy in my book.
9939	1	a	A lot of fun for a $1 game. Basically feels like halo ce mixed with jurassic park.
9941	1	a	Great game to play when you love to fight dinos!
9943	1	a	This is the worst game on earth but it's still the most fun you can probably have in a multiplayer game. This is not a AAA title, you get what you pay for. A 99 cent game, what's not to like?
9945	1	a	I really love this game :) good game to play with your friends or people online :) little hard to do by yourself but still fun nontheless :) Can't wait to level up more on my Assault character!!
9947	1	a	Best game a dollar can buy. :) Would like to play again.
9949	1	a	this game is hard to get .-.
2954	0	a	For me it crashed when tried to start a match Lowered graphics still crashed, I have a Geforx 9800 + Games like the Witcher 2 &amp; Batman Arkham Asylum work for me - Witcher 2 on low Batman on max  So maybe it just dosen't work on older cards even if they are capable
9951	1	a	Hours of fun if you have awsome buddys to play with. i give it a 10/10 if there was a rating system!
9953	1	a	this game costs less than a candy bar. buy it and shoot a triceratops right in the face
9955	1	a	I bought this game when it was a dollar because I was poor. I would buy it again now even though I am still poor. I enjoy Rampage mode, because you can run around as a spinosaurus and chomp players and/or raptors. Plus in survival mode you can get the Cryoknife a weapon that alows you to slice your way through the hordes and hordes of dinos. I enjoy jumping onto the backs of large dinos and slicing the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. I only see one con, alot of the mapps appear to be the same map, just decorated differently with elevation changes. Overall it is very fun!
9957	1	a	Well what can I say? For 0.79p this is the most fun I had for awhile. It works and it is fun. Go get it!!!
9959	1	a	This is it to much FUN. I haven't played a game like this for awhile, i mean a Fantastic Joy. Before I wasn't too interested in the beginning with the concept of Dinosours. But in the End I gave it a try and it is a great price. It does feel like that they say it is Halo, and other FPS. Im hooked with this game Simple yet satisfying.
9961	1	a	Fun and alot of bang for the buck, not saying that it is good compared to the price, but good in general!
9963	1	a	i really like this game but i have tons of lag as of right now.once when i get a new/better pc/laptop it will be one of my fav/top 10 games i would play all the time
9965	1	a	Cheep and a quick game to play. Fun with friends.
9967	1	a	its a nice game , but why is it so cheap :o i was expecting it to be 20$ or something its really good for a 0.99$ game
9969	1	a	99cent for killing Dinos? Totaly worth it even if it was 4.99 it would still be worth it
9971	1	a	Such a great game and yet so simple. Not to mention the low price of 99 cents. This game brought me a few hours of fun and I highly recommend this game to anyone. Playing with friends is great and so is playing by yourself. Buy this game and you will not regret it.
9973	1	a	The mechanics of this game are so broken, it's beautiful.
9975	1	a	They misspelled 'Died' 10/10
9977	1	a	Orion may have started off as a bad game, but through time and effort, it's finally become a fun game.
2957	0	a	Possibly worse than 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' 10/10 would play games worse than WarZ again
9979	1	a	oh this one is fun!! DIE DINO SKUM!!!!!
9981	1	a	This game is one of a kind. I loved the game play and how hard the bosses were(sorry for the bad spelling).
9983	1	a	Really solid game. For what its worth, it's absolutely awesome. Sure it isnt grade a, but what more would you want for a buck? High potential for fun, and just overall badassery.
9985	1	a	Quite good needs upgrades for all weapons not just all the weapons upgrade at the same time
9987	1	a	Don't let the mediocre graphics and dated Unreal Engine put you off of this game; with a few beers and some friends, this game is actually pretty fun! A cross between Turok and Halo, giggle your way through multiplayer survival mode as you lay waste to hordes of Raptors, Triceratops, T-Rexes and other baddies with an arsenal of machine gunes, pistols, flamethrowers, and tanks! Replayability may be lacking, so try and pick this one up for sub $2.00 prices.
2958	0	a	played this with a few friends for about 50 minutes, and we all got a lot of frame drops, easy to learn and understand if you have played things like killing floor with a few good extras. but over all its just annoying getting damaged costantly especially by the flying dinos and you either can't hit them because your frames have dropped so much you have to stop playing for a second or that they are already too far away to hit. Didn't enjoy
2959	0	a	lol trust its not even worth the 0.79p. basicly a complete rip off of killing floor but sooo bad.
9989	1	a	cant go wrong with this. cheap jurassic park, but even better than the movie: the game.
9991	1	a	An amazingly open combat game, reccomended to those into amazing dinosaurs like the Raptor, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops. I had a great time playing it, even though I died a lot. Also, is it just me, or do the soldier guys look like they're in Dead Space 3 armor?
9993	1	a	Definitely worth .99 cents, really fun and action packed, they are STILL working out the bugs, but that aside it is really fun online game. The dinosaurs vary in size and difficulty, along with bonus beasts to slay.
9995	1	a	....
9997	1	a	Im Happy I Got The Four Pack.
9999	1	a	Jetpack class runs out of fuel. I plummet to my death. 10/10 Would Die Again.
