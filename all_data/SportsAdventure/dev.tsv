255	1	a	Recently snagged this in a Bundle and AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For The Awesome is stellar. Wow this game got a makeover and a kick in the pants on the speed and intensity factor since the original demo. I don't have an Oculus to fully enjoy this game but on the highest settings on the old monitor it still looks amazing. The random news bits that play during stage select, the silly videos that you can unlock and the soundtrack just keep the feel of this game going even when your not falling at the ground at terminal velocity.  Do yourself a favour and JOIN THE AWESOME.

4619	1	a	There are some truly god aful reviews here. Not liking the game because you have to buy content is not a legitimate reason to leave a negative review. You have to buy everything these days and why is that different here? It's cost is comparative to any other title when yuo add a few content packs into play. Yes if you add them all you will spend more money then an entire game, you also end up with Laser Scanned tracks, some of the best driving physics a simulation has   Graphically the game is a little behind but it IMO actually does a great job at looking the most realistic and providing most realistic feel when racing. RF2 does an ok job here but being DX9 only is a hold back. AC is gorgeous but not real, Project Cars looks like a video game. PC looks the best, but also has the worst driving model and is not realistic in look at all.   If you enjoyed Race 07, GTR2, and GTR Evolution you will like RRE. To me this is the spiritual success of these titles and I will continue to support both Simbing/Sector3 and ISI and their Gmotor efforts. Ian and Project Cars well lets just say I have PCars but ill never buy it.
4326	1	a	It's literally just a game about going â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.  Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.

1884	1	a	Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you. In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game. But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally. Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements. Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

437	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome in my opinion was a fun game. The basics of the game is to jump off buildings and score as much points as you can by falling as close to objects as you can and going near as many different objects as you can. They slowly add more mechanics throughout the game like tagging government buildings, giving thumbs up and fans and the middle finger to protestors, and activating a coffee mode where things slow down for a brief moment.  The original levels are enjoyable for a bit but I found myself starting to be burned out by them once they were almost all done. The game was just starting to feel stale and repetitve. Finally i grinded through the last of the original levels and started with the 'Awesome' levels. The awesome levels restored my faith and enjoyment in the game. The game was a lot faster and certain levels added a checkpoint system. The 'Awesome' levels also have a hard to follow storyline. After completing a level you will hear a broadcast message if you listen to them all the final one will be about you 'Player one' help support an uprising for supporting base jumping.  All and all I had a fun time with this game for the most part and I would reccomend it people who are on the fense about buying it.
124	1	a	Fun game. Plays well on a laptop with intel graphics.
4654	0	a	Awful physics and expensive content. Shame, as I loved 07 but Simbin have nosedived with this. If you can spend the money go with iRacing, if not, try Assetto Corsa (sp?). Actually, get both and save yourself the download on this 'high end' sim. Physics... well, they may seem good if you have never driven a car. Only positives I can find is the sound is pretty good, gfx passable as long as you don't use triple screens and it is free to try so I didn't waste any money on it.

It can be a bit fiddly to start with as the controls are nothing like any cricket game ever made, so persevere and you'll be rewarded.  For every wicket you take there is a sense of pride, just like when you score some runs.  For me I've found the batting to be the hardest part, whereas bowling is tough but like I said rewarding.  This game is well worth your time and effort.

455	1	a	I know some people are going to think I'm crazy, but this is a pretty good game. Normally, Dejobaan games aren't really all that good (to put it nicely), but AAAAA manages to not suck. Its gameplay is very simple; fall down a floating city, collecting points and buzzing towers for bonuses, and trying to land without breaking all your bones. More complexities are added, like bystanders and tagging certain buildings, but it never becomes too complicated to enjoy. It's dumb, it's simple, and it's good for just zoning out and playing something. I'd recommend getting this on sale, but you should definitely check it out.

Instead you can only play offline with premade teams. Kinda missed the mark, by a mile or two...

But that's how Game's Workshop games are. To properly enjoy the game you have to accept that you might lose or that a play won't go favorably. It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.  Personally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team. Every injury is like an extra point in my book.

4659	1	a	This game is a good start to driving sims. If you picked up your brand new 900-1080 degree FFB wheel and you got no money left over, look no further than this gem. The physics are on par with the lazer scaned iracing, and super car fun fest Asseto Corrsa. The begining cars and tracks are fun to learn, and really give you a sense of joy when shaving off 1/4 a second of a hotlap all while realizing how this is meaningless. There are 3 main modes of difficulty: Novice- Babies first racing sim, Amateur- X360 gamepad user, and Get Real- Why am I backwards and why is my front end smashed in? The only complaint is that the DLC is not only hard on the conusmer, it makes finding servers a living hell. The full experiece will cost you upwards of $100 and it is hard to justify that when other games cost around $50 and have the same content.

1378	1	a	No game is playable if the mechanics are â¥â¥â¥â¥. Thankfully, SpeedRunners game mechanics are pretty great, some glitches in maps under special circumstances (SuperSpeed is huge for breaking maps) but overall definitely a game I'd recommend picking up, however, only if on sale. I don't think this game is worth near $20 given there's DLC that can definitely push your wallet overboard. Pick it up on sale or through a friend.  Another fix needed would have to be ping problems while on competitive. Place a max ping so those rubberbanding don't get a free shot at winning because the others hooked a rubber banding player. Just not fair.  9/10, overpriced and a tad bugged but totally a great play.

4709	1	a	I think this game is one to watch. It really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. A little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. The main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. In most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. But here you unlock new stuff by buying it. Also the races them self are just against the clock. There is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards.

4963	0	a	Can't say much about the base free-to-play game since I really haven't played it (just a single race) but the DTM Experience 2013 DLC is a must buy! Got on sale at the Humble Store for $6.24! This is one of the most realistic racing sims I have played...the sounds are incredible!  UPDATE: I really can't recommend this game based soley on the cash grab that it is. Even during Sector 3's summer sale the addon packs are quite over-priced. Sector 3 really nickel and dimes you for every little tiny aspect of this game. During the summer sale if you were to buy everything on sale it would have cost over $100. I bought Assetto Corsa with DLC included for less than $30. I bought Project Cars for $35 and the DLC is dirt cheap! If you have a wallet that is fat full of cash then go ahead and buy everything Sector 3 wants you to buy. Afterall, it's a great sim to race in but if you value your dollar look to a cheaper alternative.

5456	1	a	Excellent game. Must buy for sports fan. Not just normal cricket game where you blind smash button, you have to time your shots properly. It takes time to getting used to the controls and master the game.

4470	1	a	I have played a number of racing sims, in fact most of them, this is one of the best. The sound is the best is any sim out there the Force Feedback on my Fanatec wheel is amazing and the graphics are great. In fact this game isnt even that graphics hungry on my GTX 1080 yet it looks fantastic. The AI is brutal when running in hardest setting and no assists, which is the only way to play this game. I think it is one of the best sims on the market. If I had one complaint it is that the Brands Hatch track is the short cart track not the full track. I am sure that Sector 3 can fix that. I woulds also love if they would put the Aussie V8 supercars in.
559	1	a	Simple control... gas, brake, forward tilt, backward tilt, nitro... but really have to judge speed and landing aim well to get the best times and the gold. Good graphics. Engine sound is okay for this type of game, but could have been better. Challenging levels. Reasonalbe menus. Cute design.  But considering the game is already 7 years old, I don't think it's worth $19.99... more like $4.99, or no more than $6.99.  I recommend this game, but not at a highway robbery price.
5109	0	a	Total rip off. you must pay for every single car and track, an still there is not much content, and you only can race alone on the track. the graphics are not up to date.. and the feeling of the cars is not so much realistic, rFactor 1 is still better than this. or BETTER look at ASSETTO CORSA !!! 
1091	1	a	Careful, don't play with someone you like. Especially your family. You'll hate them.  Better than pewdiepies youtube sim

4472	1	a	great sim game. best played with a wheel. ok with a controller. graphics and sounds are very good. don't expect much from the free content. you can try any car on their fantasy track for free. and you can try different tracks in their free competitions(there's usually 6-8). you do have to pay to get the most out of this game. if you buy one car and one track at a time, it can be very expensive, but if you buy vrp from their  store(https://www.raceroomstore.com/shop_en/list_page?cat=24)  and then buy some car packs and track packs, that will save you a lot of money. look for multiplayer games on evenings and weekends UK time, otherwise it's pretty dead.

36	0	a	A strange little game I picked up years ago to tick an objective off one of the Steam events. I haven't touched it since... and from what I hear, neither have the developers.
4965	1	a	The controls suck but its a free game so you can't get mad because that is the only downside. You move and steer with the arrow keys. The graphics, if you have a monster pc like me, are AMAZING!!!!! besides the jerky movement of the steering wheel, it feels like you are in the driver's seat!
4638	1	a	good game and it's in multiplayer :3
5389	1	a	One of the most complete cricket games of all time. I have played all the cricket games which have been released before, but this game has all the qualities that a cricket game should have, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, the umpire decisions are accurate and the new DRS feature in the game which is known as BARS is the most innovative thing added in a cricket game, this feature was never added before in any other cricket game and was also meant to be impossible to add it, but hats off to the developers Big Ant Studios, they have done a wonderful job, the only cons for this game is that you get occassional lag spikes and stutters and it is also hard to find internet games, other than that it is a beautiful game and if you're a fan of cricket and wanna buy a cricket game, I would definitely recommend this game hands down.
1240	1	a	GET IT. NOW. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME GET IT NOW. This game is extremely addicting and fun and will probably ruin your social life, especially if you play it with people you know. Definitely worth every penny and more. And even if you are an alien from space and dont like it, you can still refund it.
113	1	a	Some of the most fun you will have with your computer until they develop a force feedback codpiece.
672	1	a	SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.

233	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRUwiwA51r0  Above is my video impressions of the game  AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is an interesting game with some pretty simple mechanics. It's all about jumping off of buildings and accumulating as much points as possible. The game features a ton of levels and features to unlock, with some pretty eye catching aesthetics.  The game is simple and that is both it's strength and weakness. It's easy to jump into and will grab player's attention very quickly, but because of it's extremely simple design, it could possibly lose the player's interest just as fast. It's really upto you to decide whether or not the game is worth your money.  Pros: - Good looking - Easy to understand mechanics - Can be thrilling at times  Cons: - Overly simple - Might not hold the attention of some players

5353	1	a	It really is the best cricket game ever. I am loving almost everything about this game right now. AI seems good, they put fielders where they sense is my weakness and try to remove my strong shots. Graphics are pretty good too and the game runs smoothly. But the best thing about this game is the new controls Big Ant have introduced. They make batting and bowling really fun and challenging.
5320	1	a	Live the life of an up-and-coming superstar in this unique football career game. Start out as a 16 year old lad and work your way to the top to become a footballing legend! You need to train hard, play matches, make transfers, do interviews, stay in touch with friends, sign sponsorship deals, go to the casino, buy cars, and more! With so many distractions in a footballer's life is it any wonder that so many don't make it? But what about you? Can you become a new star?

5462	1	a	Big Ant Studios have crafted a very solid cricket gaming experience. Naturally it doesn't compare to the juggernaughts of FIFA and NBA 2K, but it shouldn't. It has its own distincitve visual appeal. The gameplay is the best to offer from most cricket games and the career mode is an added welcome. The only drawback is the lack of stadiums but that is a minor issue.  Great game.

292	1	a	This game is all about speed. If you've played the prequel, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! a Reckless Disregard for Gravity, then you'll know what to expect. However, be warned, now you fall two times faster!  The original 83 levels are redone with brand new graphics and even more insane speeds. You will shout, you will scream, and you will curse as you die countless times, trying to get through the freaking level. Along with the original game's levels, there are more than 40 additional levels with brand new environments, making the world seem more realistic. The graphics are beautiful, the replayablility is insane, the gameplay is awesome, and the sound is fitting. However, there are a few low-res textures and hickups, so points must be taken for that.  Catagory Scores...  Graphics: A- Gameplay: A Sound: B+ Value: A+  Verdict: 'A' This is a must play...

Just when you think you've hit the best possible strategy and timing, someone else comes along and rips that dream from you and you're forced to take it back. In 18 hours I never reached the most optimized run. I was great but there was always someone who was better and that is a very good thing. I haven't played the game for a year but in the time I spent with it there were no negatives.

607	1	a	This game is absolutely stellar.  The game's strong point is the online multiplayer where you battle it out in what can best be described as a amalgymation of MarioKart, Sonic, and Smash Bros. This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.  The mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self. You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of. There is virtually no limit to how good you can get. The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.   Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience. Very entertaining, very addictive. I foresee this game being a part of my cycle for decades to come. 13/10
4672	1	a	READ THIS. Before you download this 15gb game consider this: Do you like Quantity, or Quality? Quality? RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E). Newer, better native support. If you play it though, expect having to dish out the dough for getting a amazing experience. $40 dollars can get you (if stuff is on sale, which is regularly is) 10-15 tracks, and 5-10 cars, some in 'packs.' The physics is great, the controls are amazing (I'm on a XBOX 360 controller), and the game just feels perfect. Personally I love the competitions of where its just you and the track and you try to get the best time out of EVERYONE. But you have to pay for everything. -vs- Quantity? Race07. Older game, but still holds up to date, if you want this game, get the SimBin Mega Bundle (same $40 dollars!) and get all the DLC and its 15$ less then buying all of them alone. The game has it's quirks and could have been better but is still an amazing racing game none-the-less. But it has loads and I mean LOADS of tracks and a nice array of cars.  You choose, and don't go hating on this game. It's certainly a different approach to paying into a game, but it is OK SimBin, OK.
4496	1	a	New update makes this sim outstanding. Excellent physics, excellent graphics, fantastic AI = you really NEED this game.. I LOVE SIMBIN (Sector3). Dont think about it, get it!

5573	1	a	A fun game but at the same time one of the most infuriating games i've played in years...  You can have games where the rolls just don't go your way and you are spitting feathers but then you can have a run of good luck (Like injuring your opponents best player with a cheeky stamp while they are down).  The community from what i've seen seems friendly enough and willing to help and i'm yet to encounter a bad winner.  Rolls can and will go against you, teams will make plays that are so lucky you want to claw your eyes out, but the same can happen for you...  All in All a fun but such a deep game, not something you can get good at quickly, read up on guides how to build your team...
1346	1	a	Congrats to tinyBuild for managing to create an item more annoying than the Blue Shell!
4657	1	a	This game looks awesome and its free. Free is never truly free, but that is the marketing model.  This game will continue to develope for years to come. This game has come a long way since 2009. Thats right, 2009. its been reworked alot of times, and its always getting better.   This is one of the most fair free to play models in the market. Each track takes hundreds of hours of work. Some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it.   Nearly every game out today sells dlc. This base game is free. You $40 to $60 ahead just for trying it. If you like it, then get what you like. If not, at least you did not blow $40 to $60 for a game you only play once in a while.     The cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game, but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want. There are packs available to save you some money. You will probably spend $60 to $80 for the content you want if you like the game. All the content is about $250 or so.  I used this on my Fanatec Wheel, and my x360 controller, both play well.  At this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim I have played including A/C. When A/C first came out, it had this beat. Now with a few updates later, it is better both graphically and in terms of physics.  I only wish the game had Daytona Road Course.  I have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam. About 2009 or so. This game really does continue to get developed.

18	0	a	halfway decent game, worthy of about two to ten hours of playtime, possibly more for those with ocd.  however, this was dejobann's last finished product and they have been selling only incomplete games for the last six years.  this game isn't so bad but it is not worth more than a dollar.  i wouldn't support dejobann games if i were you because they stopped completing projects about six years ago but they sell them all for full price.  this game may be a finished product but everything they have done since is nothing but one rip off after another.  beware: the developers/publishers of this product are robbers. no other product that they are selling is worth buying. and this one is over priced even at 80% discount.  you have been warned.

I wrote a review a while back and voted it down as it just felt wrong. Thought I better come back and put that right.  If you are thinking about spending some money there is quite often sales on and buying VRP from Raceroom works out better value.

296	1	a	So apparently this consists of the first AAAAA game plus a batch of 41 incredibly terrifying levels. And those 41... man, who depressed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the developers lately? At any rate it's an indication of the mood as it is in 2011. There's plenty to be moody about, honestly (or there was, depending on whether you're reading this from your manufactured Pleasure Dome.) Either way, cheer AAAAA up, why don't you?

5476	1	a	I don't have too many hours played on the PC version but don't be fooled because I originally bought the game on Xbox 360 the day before official release day when the street date got broken and I've played this game a lot.  This is without a doubt the best cricket game since Shane Warne Cricket 99 and it looks so much BETTER on PC and to be honest it's probably deserving of the best cricket game ever.  I will say that bowling on higher difficulty levels can be more of a chore than a fun time and there, for me anyway, hasn't been that breakthrough from difficulty to enjoyment like there was when batting finally clicked, but I rectify this by batting as both teams and I have an amazing time.  Batting is amazing once it finally clicks, and there is a bit of a learning curve especially if you jump straight in to pro, but it will come eventually after some frustrating times. Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.  There is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.  My Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.  9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover.

Pros: -Lots of playable characters and skins -Secret characters -Easy to pick up really hard to master -Great for casual parties, and competitive playing as well -Fun items to help you and ruin your friendships -Every offical map is tagged, so you can see how hard it is -Level editor, workshop support -Theres a random workshop map option in ranked so you can play some curated workshop levels in that mode as well -You can enable fun effects in custom play -Online rank system -A rather short story mode with four difficulty options and unlockable comics -XP system wich unlocks stuff with progress -Twitch integration in the menu -Community events -Custom trail editor  Neutral: -Trail shop, where you can buy trails  Cons: -The game still has some issues and bugs, however the devs are really active and fix bugs with every patch -Even tough theres a 'tutorial' in the game it hardly explains anything about the basic mechanics of the game.Its not a problem for casual players but if you want to play ranked beyond expert league you will have to look up some videos. Fortunetly the menu shows some great tutorial videos for these purposes.  Overall this is a great game if you are looking for an online competitive oriented game. I wouldnt recommend it for the story mode because its really short and theres no real story to the game to be honest. Its definitely worth it for the countless hours you can play in online.

1846	1	a	SpeedRunners is a competitive indie racing game with a 2-D artstyle and a fun soundtrack. It has both single player and multiplayer modes and a variety of fun characters with different personalities. The goal of the game is to knock out your enemies by making them hit the edges of the screen, and you can race through a variety of unique levels with an arsenal of items to do so. This game is pure addictive multiplayer chaos. It's fast paced, it's competitive, and it even has a story! I see this game as a must-have if you're into indie games and is a joy to play with your friends.
286	1	a	There's a specific scene in Interstellar that made me think about this game, 10/10
644	1	a	This game is fun but there is a catch....  It all started when my group of friends started playing this together. We thought it would be fun but it has brought us farther apart than we have ever been. I am currently down 3 monitors and 2 headsets. My friend is down a DX racer and a monitor and my olther friend is down nothing because he wins every single match and ruins everything for us. Good game if you visiting your friends with a bat after each session, but if not, do not buy it.

4448	1	a	This game has its drawbacks, but it is the most rewarding and immersive of all the modern racing titles currently on the market. It has clearly been tainted by early reviewers, because it was launched in such an incomplete state that itÂ´s difficult to comprehend why they did it. As a result of this, combined with a terrible pricing model, the game has received a bad stigma, but one which is entirely undeserved at this point in time.  So, if you have heard bad things about FFB, lack of content, poor framerates or anything else, rest assured that these issues have been fixed, often to the point of excelling in each area. The development team are one of the most forthcoming, open and honest in the business, admitting mistakes where they have been made and explaining any decisions they make.  But we live in a world where racing sims are on the up. So how does it compare?  Where Project CARS lacks complete series, immersive sounds and consistent AI, Raceroom excels in each of these areas.   Where rFactor2 lacks in updated graphic shaders, performance and complete series, Raceroom is more than adequate in each.  Where Assetto Corsa lacks good enough AI for an offline experience, Raceroom blows all competition out of the water.   In summary, this game has fantastic content (albeit with the modular pricing structure - but see below), competitive AI, great netcode, superb physics and THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDS EVER HEARD IN A RACING SIM.   Don`t buy content on Steam - go to their shop where you can bulk-buy VRP, spend an average game`s value and build your own game to your liking.

4494	0	a	RaceRoom Experience could've been a top tier Racing Simulator, but decided to be a 'server only' renting platform.  I can not stay supportive when I'm constantly having connectivity issues and gameplay breaking bugs. Not to mention, it cost me $300 for all the content, which makes it the most expensive, unreliable game I own (rent)  In short, you need to be connected to their servers at all times or you simply cannot play the game, and when you are connected you are constantly experiencing lag, '503' server errors, etc......  So when other great titles can be enjoyed in offline mode without issues, I cannot recommend investing in RaceRoom Experience at the moment, or at least until an 'offline mode' is offered. Which is disappointing as R3E has ADAC, WTCC and DTM racing with great sound which initially attracted me to this game.
307	1	a	I bought the game expecting nothing more than a few minutes of entertainment after which it would become unlikely that I'd ever play it again. I just wanted Steam prizes. I must say, I'm very happy I did buy it. This is one of the games I've had the most fun with in my life, and Dejobaan's unique flavor of humour just makes the game that much better. The levels are cleverly designed, as are the mechanics. It's a must-play!

4495	1	a	Im not usually drawn to do reviews, but i'll take the time out to persuade you that this is a quality product. Of the two offererings about of late, Project Cars &amp; RRRE, I would hands down take RRRE. What it lacks (only slightly though) in looks it more than makes up for in AI, SOUNDS (!!!!!!) and game mechanics and handling.   The devs also listen to the community and are patching and or updating/adding all the time with changes to UI, changes to daytime/evening time racing, dedicated servers, create-a-championship (for offline players). New cars and tracks being added all the time, and to a VERY high level. A few of my friends have tried both PCARS and RRRE and have also concluded of the two its the stronger product.   I will say, whether its an issue with AMD or not the game does seem to run slower than PCARS. But with a few changes in the graphics menu you can get the game running smooth and fast.   I would def recommend this to ANY budding racers out there. The G5 cars are the shiz.  POWERFUL RRRE!!!

5286	0	a	This game had incredible potential due to its extremely detailed and deep simulation mechanics. For example, drinkng too much energy drink before a game will cause your player to have stomach cramps during the match.  Sadly, the only part of the game that is solid is the life-simulation/managment portion of this game. The actual soccer-playing gameplay falls flat because of the extremely clunky controls and poor on-field presentation. Problems include that there is only one speed your player can go at (no sprinting vs walking), aiming is near impossible while running, and heading just dosen't work. Also, the game makes your eyes hurt like hell after an hour, as the players are tiny and so is the ball. Staring at a bright green field that fills the entire screen dosen't help, my eyes felt dead after around an hour of playing. TL;DR: The on-field portion of this game being bad prevents the enjoyment of the surrounding complex life-sim mechanics. Stick to the mobile version, if you don't mind the grind.

To top it off this game though free to play only has a couple of singleplayer modes without ai, or other people. To get access to anything in the game you better have deep pockets because almost everything is considered dlc and you cant use it unless you pay real $. Also the ui's and menus feel very clunky and somewhat overly complex. Hopefully the dev's will fix some of these issues,but for right now i wouldnt waste the time. 3/10

4588	1	a	This is by far the best game Simbin have produced. The physics are spot-on, and, aside from a few licensing issues with the RUF brand and a few iconic tracks which are currently lacking (though I'm assured they're coming soon), this is a very complete game. I bought into this during the alpha stage when I was taken aback by the graphics and attention to detail in their fictional Raceroom track, and I haven't once regretted it. I think the likes of Assetto Corsa and Project Cars can only be substantially better by having a better selection of road-going cars and the Nordschleife, available as standard.

271	1	a	Really awesome and fun game where the player freefalls through an obstacle course and attempts to rack up as high a score as possible. Gain points by getting close to buildings, gesturing at spectators, and various other stunts. The highest scoring paths are usually the most risky, so be careful not to crash and die :) This is one of those concepts that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There are endless hours of fun, trying to get high scores on over 100 maps. Graphics are simple but effective, and the music adds to the intensity. The low purchase price is great value for money.

659	1	a	Speedrunners is a fast-paced (obviously), two-dimensional, 4-player racing game with a surprisingly high skill cap and a good amount of progression. Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.  While it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues... The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed. The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow. Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.  Besides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title. They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though. This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.

4639	1	a	there's a great game here plays just like the old gtr games, unfortunately it cost's just that bit too much to actually buy it. Especially as alot of the packs overlap content which means you either virtually pay for some stuff twice or buy it all seperately for a bigger price overall. such a shame.

550	0	a	While the game itself is fun, it's a horrible port. It's definatly gamepad focused so there's no excuse why the menues can't be controlled with a gamepad. It's also very poorly optimized.  Don't buy this, buy the excellent Trials Evolution instead, which is a far better game and has all the things this game is missing.

Especially since Spin and fast bowling uses different controls. I do wish they had the option for field radar. It does get annoying to keep looking through first person before every delivery since there really isn't any indication if there was a change in field placement. Also I really wish they would come out with a newer version of this game since it is now over two years old.

Was afraid to waste money again but found it on sale and took a try. Felt exactly the same Trails Hd on the 360. How same you might ask, well Evolution Gold includes Original Trial HD levels. My times are for the most part exactly the same. I most likely will never reinstall this game. Get Evo Gold instaed of this, just my 2 cents..

5398	1	a	The best Cricket game out there! Made by fans, for the fans. Big Ant has really put a lot of effort to bring this game out.  There were days when I was hoping and praying that EA would put out a new game. After 2007, EA abandoned the franchise, Codemasters tried their hands on it once in a while. But, Cricket was a dead game, almost the entire community resorted to 'mods', Cricket 07 was modded to great extent to make it playable (enjoyable),   Patches to fix AI, toughen bowling, make strokes close to realistic and stuff, but nothing gave the satisfaction of a complete game.  DBC14 arrived at the scene and took it by storm, the price was high (considering I live in India, where this was close to 4k of our currency). I had second thoughts, but then I looked up the trailers, put faith in the developers and bought it.  Despite the high price of the game, which is really needed for the developers to set up a base for future titles, the game is complete. Complete in every way, except for commentary.   Pros- * CAREER MODE! * Great bowling controls * Great batting controls * Great fielding controls * Great everything * BIG head mode   Cons- * Commentary is kinda dull * Not many players to meet in Multiplayer mode.  Go ahead and buy it, you will not regret the decision.

4403	0	a	After 70 plus hours in this game, I can confidently admit the game is broken. I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game.   There is nothing more frustrating to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for 'illegal blocking.' Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed.

4549	1	a	This game is rated criminally low on Steam, I guess because people want everything for free. Kinda ridiculous. I agree some of the content is too pricey, but for a reasonable price you can grab two or three packs of cars/tracks and have a ton of fun.  The opponent AI and the sound are the best currently available. Handling/physics is great, maybe just a notch behind AC, and the polish of the UI and menus is simple but well done and doesn't feel like a beta like so many sims do these days. No better game out right now if you want to simulate a touring car race season.  If you're a sim racing fan, you should absolutely give this a try and see if you want to buy some additional content. It's one of the top few sims available!

4290	1	a	This game has been an amazingly pleasant surprise. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and forgot about it. I had some friends over for the weekend a few weeks later and randomly remembered it. We fired it up, and proceeded to play from 8pm until 6 am. Since then, they've all picked it up and we play several times a week. The game is full of laughs and subleties you would never expect! I still find ways to go a little faster and boy does it feel good when you hit that super speed and keep it going for several screens' lengths! Play with friends and don't start without them! Learning Speedrunners alongside a group of friends and laughing it up is some of the most fun I've had in months!

Simple but effective gameplay and humourous style that doesn't take itself seriously at all.

4843	0	a	The game itself is OK, but the program is so hard to get running properly.  
169	1	a	AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is an average game built on a fairly unique concept of doing tricks while falling off fantasy suspended structures. While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws. First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must. Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor. I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session. I would recommend this game only to action fans who want a novel concept but caution others to stay away.

5015	0	a	I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old. What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard. . Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up ' i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button', and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess. . i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers. . I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell. . And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing. . IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content. . I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ??? . I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.

4536	1	a	So here I am writing a review for RaceRoom Racing Experience. So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.  Pros:  -Great Sounds -Great Force Feedback -Car models look good -Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car -Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers) -You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live -If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision -Physics and handling are very realistic -Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic -Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers -Good default overlay -So many things that can be changed in settings  Cons:  -The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks -No pit crew/garage interior -No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement -Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defend  I realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.  Therefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.

4562	1	a	Very good game. There is still a lot to improve but the foundation is solid.  I don't understand all the negativity around R3E. Yes you have to buy stuff and yes the free to play doesn't offer 20 cars or tracks for free. The F2P content isn't all that bad you can join competitions and race cars and tracks you don't have. The content isn't that expensive also.  Good physics and real cars and liveries, superb sound, good AI. Can't wait to see whats next.  Better then ProjectCars as a total package.

4152	1	a	Not gonna be able to actually enjoy it until they fix the issue where the game crashes upon loading into a level.  EDIT I found out today that the game crashes only because when I use the controller on the homescreen and pick, say, first level, when it loads it crashes cuz the difficulty option would never show up unless used with mouse. Game runs perfect now!

4796	1	a	Note that this really is not a free to play simulation. The free content is no good. To see what this is all about you have to spend cash to get the good packs.   Basically it is like this:   If you follow real life racing and have a 250 usd+ steering wheel setup and knowledge of and love for real life racing dynamics... and 100 usd+ to spend on content. Then this is your sim.   It is hands down the best simulation of actual RACING ever made and with the recent updates it is very close to life like racing. Now that adaptive ai is working it is also the best simulation for single player.   The fact that physics are developed in unison with the real DTM/TT drivers (whom you also see sometimes online) as well as the general engine being awesome makes this the best package right now if you have all prerequisites. If not you will not like it.   You need:   Expensive steering wheel set (without this, do not get it) 100 USD cash for different content (without this, do not get it)  Real life racing knowledge (without this, do not get it)  Following of real life racing and a love for actual track racing (without this, do not get it)    So, disregard the free to play thing. This is a hardcore platform for simulation racing, with a good single player structure as well.    If you like some more casual 'game' style get Project Cars If you like hot-lapping with road cars get Assetto Corsa If you like to devote 16 hours a day towards virtual league racing and disregard the rest of your life, get rFactor2   If you want a good simulation of actual racing, that is also a good single player, offline experience and need a full simulation model, get this

482	0	a	not my cup of tea. too precise of controls, and not much more than jumping and landing.
133	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22DgMLjEM0g  If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, youâd surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a recklessâ¦ you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress youâll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.

4877	1	a	good game!! its the free version of GT6/GT5  
4942	0	a	I will cut to the chase; it is so, so difficult to reccomend this game, even to a proper petrolhead.  When you first download the game for free, you will be bewildered with a very awkward UI menu layout. It took me a few minutes to get to the track at first, when really this could of been achieved in under 20 seconds. On the track, you will be star-stuck with amazing graphics, I will not lie about that. The graphics are up there with any top race sim. Start driving, and hooray, a good car noise, and the developers have programmed the game well to work with a force feedback racing wheel.  But that's it. Now for the negatives. The cars (even the slick racers) understeer so inaccurately. I'm no mega physics guy, but I know something's wrong when a leading class race car won't get round a bend at 40mph. Obviously there is no tyre shreak to warn you; you're on slicks. I tested to make sure it wasn't just a simulation of cold tyres = no grip, but after countless laps the car continued to behave like it had tyres 1mm wide.  Surely the elephant in the room is the DLC. You start with about 4 cars and two tracks. That is fine, it is free after all I suppose. But add the DLC costs up for all the tracks and cars, and you are looking at triple figure sums. Honestly, I'd rather just pay Â£35 for the game outright and get everything, without a free version.  You can take this with a pinch of salt as it's just a minor person's opinion. But playing for 2 and a half hours (which doesn't sound like much) has made me stand by those opinions. Since it's free, just go ahead and download to see for yourself. It's like a lot of modern games these days; very pretty, but no actual gameplay.

Worth the cost, may look dumb, gameplay a bit repetitive, but very fun when you are able to match other players skills.  9/10 not IGN try it out, refund if you disliked it

4490	1	a	8/10 Great race sim plagued by a terrible payment and content structure. I'm giving this a thumbs up only because it's actually a great racing sim experience with excellent single player AI and vehicle physics. Unfortunately you need to always be online to play.   Multiplayer is still hit or miss and sometimes you will get randomly disconnected.   I sincerely hope SInBin/Sector3 change this game to a flat pricing fee if they truely want to entice more players to the game. The game content is always on sale at least 50% on their website (cheaper than steam prices) so I wouldn't worry about missing out on sales. I've never seen any of the packs at full price. For example the regular price for the DTM 2014 pack is 8318 vRP or about $85 US without a discount on their site! Who would pay that much!? The permanent discount price is there to get you to buy stuff and is a classic marketing trick!  If you're looking to get into Raceroom Experience with minimal cost I recommend the DTM 2013 pack and the American track pack. It only costs about $20 USD and gets you a great race series along with 13 tracks...  Circuit Park Zandvoort Red Bull Ring Spielberg EuroSpeedway Lausitz Moscow Raceway Hockenheimring NÃ¼rburgring Norisring Motorsport Arena Oschersleben Brands Hatch Mazda Laguna Seca Mid Ohio Indianapolis Sonoma Raceway  After that things ramp up in price very quickly! It'll cost you $102 USD for all tracks, three different race series and a big variety of vehicles (but not all of them). Detailed below. Keep in mind this still isn't all of the content available, probably around 75% of it!  WTCC 2013 DTM Experience 2013 ADAC GT Masters Experience 2014 DTM 1992 GTR2 Pack Group 5 Pack American Track Pack Track: Circuit Zolder Track: Bathurst Circuit Track: Salzburgring * All remaining tracks included in above packs  $102.59 USD Order Total (after discounts)  If you want every vehicle in the game expect to pay well over $150 USD for all content.   My advice is to just buy the $20 package I listed above and be happy with that. It's the 'best deal/bang for the buck' and still gets you a lot of racing action and tracks for that price.

W,A,S,D for movement and space to deploy your parachute. Try to get as close to the buildings as possible without actually crashing into them, and try to collect as many points as you can on the way down. What's not to like?

Excellent game play, looks beautiful, great soundtrack, and it doesn't hold your hand one bit. Just shows you how the game works and thrusts you in!  The only gripe I have with it, is the parachute controls, since I have died many times trying to land by steering with the mouse, and then going off site and breaking every bone in my body.  Despite the parachute controls, this game controls flawlessly. I would highly recommend for any indie-game enthusiast, and even people who have wanted to base-jump.  10/10!

5392	1	a	One of the best cricket games ever made!
5485	1	a	It's a great game that allows you to follow the progress of your player from a club amateur to international captain. Despite its simplicity dbc14 makes me want to keep playing. It has a perfect balance of competition where anyone can succeed but it is still hard to master. This level of complexity is aided by the many levels of difficulty which allow the game to be played by all. The only problem I have with the game is the Ai such as your fielders missing catches or letting balls slide past through their feet for boundaries. Furthermore the umpire has left me screaming at my screen where I have hit someone for lbw plumb and the umpire still says not out even after review. Despite these minor flaws db provides hours of fun at the perfect level of competition. The perfect game for all armchair cricketers.

4547	1	a	  Brief Review    R3E (RaceRoom Racing Experience) is a free-to-play racing simulator, which means you can download it for free, and drive a small selection of cars and tracks. The rest of the content is purchased using 'vRP': R3E's own currency. vRP can be bought for a reasonable price, or can be won in competitions. This makes R3E somewhat of a budget friendly sim    Pros and Cons     Pros   Audio Audio Audio FFB Satisfying FFB kick on gear changes Overal good physics   Cons   Cars have over exaggerate grip levels Pricey for some but not as bad as iRacing    An Ending    Did i mention the Audio is spot on

But in short bursts. I enjoy booting this game for 15 minutes or so at a time, that way it doesn't start to bore me. It's still quite unique. :)  I recommend it when it's pretty cheap, or if you're able to get it from an indie bundle somewhere for nearly no money at all.

I will admit I am glad they got rid of the outrageous dlc and added some ai, but the has changed very little. The single player is shallow with only allowing the player to choose pre-selected teams with no team custimization of any kind. The multiplayer online for all intensive purposes is still dead, and the online ai teams kinda break the whole purpose of online multiplayer. Glad it changed but still not worth it.
4887	1	a	This is a great free racing sim. Very realistic graphics and physics.

At this point, I need to replay some levels to get more points to unlock more stages, so I doubt Iâll play it again and beat it, but it was fun for the low price of whatever I got it for. Overall, I would recommend this if itâs cheap enough.

681	1	a	Fast-paced racing game unlike any of you have seen before. Instead of cars, the game is a symbolic representation of how some gamers blast through a game without fully enjoying it. However, you actually enjoy it in this game! You play as one of numerous speed-bent characters with Steam-exclusive editions such as TF2's Scout and Payday 2's Wolf in a thriving array of maps as you race against other players and/or bots to eliminate your competitiors by getting them off of the screen while staying in the lead. There are numerous items and gameplay mechanics that can help you achieve that, such as a grappling hook, C4s, homing missles, freeze rays, wall-jumping, fireballs and more! The story is told through unlockable comics and each character has its own purpose in the game as well as multiple skins to stand out in the crowd. The game has a multiplayer mode, ranked mode, and allows you to easily play with your friends. The game is purely skill-based and while you can spend real-money, you can only acquire cosmetic speed trails that have no effect on your character's performance. If you are looking for a way to pass-time in a thrilling yet entertaining way, this is the game for you!

5342	1	a	The best cricket game out there. I know that sounds like it's not hard seeing as there are so few out there but it really is well done. Easy controls to get to grips with, there is perfect balance between it not being too hard too easy to peform bowling, batting or fielding. So many other games made catches or bowling nearly impossible due to there being such a fine line between perfection or oblivion. Also this game does not give you wickets left, right and centre. You might Five-fors, you might get hat-tricks. But they will be as often as the professionals get, you will get that stubborn batsman whom you try everything to get out and then boom a simple shot sends the bails flying and your arm raising in triumph.   One thing I hope for in the future is perhaps the addition of more stadiums, better commentary (it does get a little repetitive) and better designed character models (Jimmy Anderson looks like a caveman).

4545	1	a	I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews. Nevertheless, the reviews were so bad about a year ago that I didn't touch it. So I did wait until Dec 2015 to try it out after all the patches and changes that seemed to make it worth buying. I race in iRacing, PCars, Assetto Corsa, FM, FH, and now RaceRoom. The graphics inside the cockpit and looking out to the opponents is probably the best among these sims providing you have a decent PC and can max out the graphics. I give it a 9.5/10 for graphics. The physics are also very good since you can adjust many settings in the FFB. So if you make a few adjustments, then I would easily say 9/10 on phyiscs. And with all the adjustments you get for the feel, then nearly a perfect. The gameplay is focused on DTM and GT3 in my opinion and that is pretty much why I bought it. No other sims have anything really in the DTM class although I am hoping PCars gets into DTM more. So if you like DTM, I can tell you this is the best sim for DTM. I haven't had any issues at all and have to say the negative onslaught this game gets is just not accurate. But there seems to be a few issues. Like with the fuel and tire wear set to real, they don't seem to ever go down. It's 100% all the time so I think that is a bug. And the AI is annoying until you learn how to avoid them. But this is one of the best sims out there in my opinion, especially DTM and GT3. I just don't understand how people can spend 15 min on a game and slam the heck out of it. Their connectivity issues and setup is more than likely their own setup problem. Yes, it needs a little help with car setups too like adding tire pressure...lol But the game feels and looks excellent, It's worth the money for DTM for sure.  Update: 4/30/2016 - RaceRoom is Awesome! I've waited a month after the 3/31/2016 update that massively improved the GT3 and Prototype physics. The new physics and new FFB settings, new car setup, especially for GT3, ADAC GT Masters, DTM, and the new Audi P1 along with Nordschleife puts this sim to the stellar level in my opinion. In addition, the fuel and tire wear now works finally. Neverthelesss, the new FFB meter to check for clipping is very nice. I am very critical of physics and so you know where I am coming from, Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the top slot with PCars a close second. Race Room was just behind PCars. Unfortunately, Forza just doesn't have the physics at these levels, e.g. you cannot feel the rubber on the road and utilze braking to control the cornering accurately in Forza Motorsport at least yet. So Forza is last in the physics ranking among all these. But I am now putting RaceRoom up there at the Assetto Corsa and iRacing level. I am at the point of saying the physics in Race Room, at least for the DTM, ADAC, GT3 and Prototype classes, is possibly even better than Assetto Corsa and iRacing. The sound in Race Room is also stellar if not the best among the aformentioned sims and I am not even using 7.1 yet just stereo. Race Room does not get the recognition it deserves....another point is I am astonished it's onlyh using DX9c where all the others I've mentioned are on DX11 or even DX12. So it blows me away they are getting this level of crisp graphics viewing the opponents cars and interior that they do....congrats Race Room for pulling that off.

4958	0	a	Multiplayer contains alot of trolls with no admins to get arid of them and im a big fan of multiplayer when It comes to online games. But for this game, you get at least a couple trolls here and there in a server. They often like to ram you off the track or use their car to block part of the track. Drivers like me would rather roleplay and play the game the professional way. It only takes one troll to ruin the server gameplay and there is no body to take care of the issue. If trolls were not such a big problem, I would recommend this game, but I don't. Just about ready to uninstall this game if multiplayer doesn't get any better.

Recommended for: People who have enough money to spend on virtual cars in a 'free to play' game, instead of an actual game that's worth how much you payed for it.

4309	1	a	  This game was cool in the oldest beta versions but now isn't the beta was more fun btw in my opinion but it's cool when you play only with friends to me avcourse !!!
1662	1	a	Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you. In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game. But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally. Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements. Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

4995	0	a	When I first saw the gameplay video and screenshots of the game, I thought it would be a realistic and exciting racing game with tons of features. Oh boy, I was wrong. When I clicked the play button, I've suffered enough already and quickly uninstalled it. RaceRoom Racing Experience is a crap game with a load of bullcrap in it and shouldn't be bought by all people for eternity.  Yes, the game's graphics and details are pretty good until your 'racing experience' being annoyed by the terrible car handling and Playstation 1 car sounds. Believe me, handling in here is screwed up and probably the most annoying thing you will encounter in the game. Cars will spin out like crazy with no control at all. This is no racing simulator, it's just a game with glitchy cars spinning around and hit each other.  So my final verdict is that, while the game has realistic graphics, the terrible handling just hindered you for maintaining the real racing experience. The game does have a lot of potential, but SimBin, the developers, executed this in a wrong way and that chance is gone forever, and it wouldn't able to compete with current racing games like Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and Grid.  Although patches has been released, still, they're too late to fix RaceRoom's glitchy and broken gameplay.  And although I played RaceRoom for a short time, 15 minutes is enough for you to suffer from it's crappy gameplay.  Sorry, SimBin, but I have to give this game a 3/10 :(
5349	1	a	I don`t usually write reviews, but this deserves an exception!! The cost of the game is a bit high but if you enjoy cricket you will love this. It takes some getting used to at first as the controls really are unlike any other cricket game - after a whie it is really rewarding tho. I spent ages just on the character creation screen. With the imported names option and the cool support from Big Ant Studios i think it will be years till this game is bettered. Oh.....and I`ve no game crashing bugs so far.

4477	1	a	Dont listen to people who only play an hour or 2 then post a negative comment because they have to pay for additional cars! those reviews are based on cost, but this game like the other sims on the market has a cost, yes its free to play but to get the best out of the game you need to purchase additional cars and tracks and pay just like you do for assetto corsa, project cars etc! This review is about the game and not the price, also dont listen to those who moan cos it crashed as its probably their pc full of spyware or viruses, never had a problem with this game at all !   I own automobilista, iracing, assetto corsa, project cars, rfactor 2, stock car extreme and race07. Each has their good points and bad points but fort me the best 2 are automobilista and raceroom. Why? because they have plenty of options, championship mode, multiplayer, leaderboard challenges and lots of cars and circuits. I also feel that these 2 are most realistic to driving a real car , sometimes in the other games theres always a lot of oversteer and sliding around. However for me automobilista and raceroom are the best at time of writing this review! it's realisitic, has championship modes, multiplayer modes, loads of circuits loads of cars! Its free to play, yes, but to get the best out of it best to purchase the other cars and tracks.
2029	1	a	I liked how the game is fast paced and that we can verse other friends on here.

5318	0	a	There was a version of this game for free on the internet that was a lot more interactive when it comes to league games. This version is more like an old SEGA game.
5251	0	a	A couple cars, couple variations of the same track and a large amount of mini-transactions.  Kudos to SimBin to allow you to drive more than one car instead of buying them, although the rest are for real money. It has some potential to be a fun racing simulator, but I can already see that SimBin only wants your money.  I must say, it is pretty fun for the first couple minutes, until you look at the store, ALL cars are for real money, nothing you can earn by playing; A career would of kept me playing.  If you are intrested in these types of games, spend your money on Assetto Corsa - A amazing game, definitely recommend it - Instead of this milking factory.   Not worth 10gb of storage space.  3.5/10
241	1	a	This game is awesome. If you enjoy the concept, you're going to have a blast. If you don't, well, there's not a ton of variety in this game. It's a skydiving simulator set in a Tron world on acid by way of an infant subversive through and through. The controls are just tight enough to make it work and it gets pretty intense down the road.  The Oculus Rift support doesn't hurt, either. This'll be the first game I load up when mine finally arrives. Because I love puking, apparently.

4610	1	a	After reading some bad comments, sure it can get expensive. But i've yet to spend a dime and the quality of physics detail seem good. The F F B is great compared to assetto corsa. no drifting at raceroom obviously, but a good race sim. Not sure what understeer I've hear someone say on youtube. Been fine for me. Haven't raced with and assists so can't comment about that. Wish full multiplayer without buying into a race season was an option. but eh the devs did a polished job. The ui isn't perfect but has really come a long way. UI was buggy but much better now

Unlockable levels go from easy to difficult. It would be nice to have an option to have all levels unlocked from get-go. They are not hard to unlock but I am one of those people who like going straight to the crazy difficulty levels.  Summary: Fun, skill oriented game. Recommended to those who like fast paced games.

But that isnt real at all.  Also you try to learn the game? It teaches you by throwing you head first into a super over unrealistic race where braking and cornering at the same time isnt bad... its IMPOSSIBLE. Yes when you race you don't want to do that, thats a given. But if you brake and turn you dont slow down at 1kilometre per second........ (just so you know it would take 300seconds to stop if you turn and break on the first corner of single race default) Which is completely unrealistic......  If you like realism in driving games Play Need for speed ITS BETTER THAN THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥!

4206	1	a	Well considering the ammount of hours I have on this account and the other one I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to write a review.  This game is pretty much Mariokart on foot and is both casual and competitive PROS  -Matches usually last around a good 5-10 minutes depending on skill level -Very live community and devs (as of writing) -Very little toxicity in public games -A lot of help from the community and devs -A LOT of fun  Now for the cons -In a public match if you get matched up with someone with bad connection can ruin your fun -Some hitreg issues on the golden hook (I.E you slide and the golden hook passes you, and you still get hooked) -Can get stale after 50-60 hours for some people  TL;DR Its a good game but some bad flaws 7/10 overall
5220	0	a	Just get Race 07, this game is riddled with microtransactions and it uses the same engine anyway.
397	1	a	A good game to have on in the background of a Skype call or for a Twitch chill stream: perfect mix of chill and focus. It's essentially CS surfing plus TF rocketjumping minus your keyboard. Nice deal.

440	1	a	Awesome game with an interesting concept. The levels progress in complexity nicely and have varying looks and styles despite using almost always the same building blocks from one to another. The audio feedback system is probably my favorite aspect of the game though since it allows you to focus on trying to get the best run possible without looking at a crowded HUD. I just wish I had an occulus rift to try this game out in VR.

69	0	a	I bought this game a long time ago but never reviewed it. My problem with this game was that you couldnt look where you were supposed to go without speeding up. And controlling your speed was critical.  .....So the game is simple; jump off of a building, avoid obstacles, direct yourself though bonus areas for points, or just follow the fastest route.  .....Unfortunately, looking in a given direction moves you in that direction. So you have no control over your body, just your head. So if you look straight down, so you can see where you're going, you accelerate down. Faster and faster until you can't change direction fast enough to survive. Looking up or to the side slows you down, but then you can't see where you're going. .....On the other hand; while you can't control your body, it can kill you. For example, you are directed to skirt certain objects for bonus points, but if you got too close, your body would hit them and you died. The margin for error was tiny, and extremely frustrating.  .....I have this game listed under those games that should have been fun, but weren't.

I was rude to random people I didn't even know. Worst yet, I think I killed a bird. That feeling of dread when your body is plunging towards the earth, that rush of pulling the rip cord and letting your feet touch the ground. I hate it. It is too loud, too disjointed, just too much. Why where there people there watching me fall like it was some kind of spectator sport? If there is a merciful God out there, he will end these nightmares of sky and wind. He will stop torturing me with the pain of the bright lights and sounds. He will end the pointing and laughing of these perverse strangers and not make me the death of that poor bird.

4787	1	a	Before i start i need to ell you that this should neither have thumbs up or down.  (Expand the page for the more positive stuff)  At first i posted a negative review because of its STUPID FREE TO PLAY mecanic and how they charge crasy amounts of money to play more than the bad cars (that i have not tuched since i bought DTM Experience) on Raceroom Raceway and Portimao to be able to really enjoy the game. just take a track for example, a less known and popular track costs 3â¬ and a legendary track like SPA and Monza costs 5â¬. And the cars, just to buy 1 car (with all paintjobs for it) it costs 3â¬. To not pay as much i recomend buying one of the EXPERIENCE packs like DTM and ADAC to get some good cars and tracks.  Apart from that stupid pay system the game is good. they update the game regulary and are adding new things now and then. The physics are good but not perfict. The sound is great. The visuals are amazing. The adaptive AI should mark a milestone in racing sims and are the greatest feature. If you pay for the stuff in game you will get an amazing game.

HOWEVER, The killer to this game, which I paid for, is that 98% of the game is 'Pay to play.'  The servers are slow, the microtransactions are ridiculous, and you can't even play without an account. I'm sorry I wasted my time. I hear the studio is shutting down, and if this is how they choose to conduct their business, then I'm happy to hear that. Shame everyone there is out of a job, but at the same time, we can't stand for this model on Steam.  It's prevolent on Mobile platforms, and it shoud NOT weasel its way on here. Good riddance. I'll not be playing any more.  Not with SO MANY better racing games out there.

There isn't much AI at the moment, but you can do a track test with 6 AI-drivers and supposedly they already use the 'Adaptive AI' mode which does what it says, it adapts the AIs performance to yours.

There is a lot of fun to be had while flying down at amazing speeds narrowly missing things and fitting into tight holes (yes, that's what she said, I know you were thinking it). It has that exhilirating feeling when you go so fast you can barely keep up, you sometimes get the actual feeling with a little feeling in your stomach that sometimes goes into your â¥â¥â¥â¥/balls (guys you know what I'm talking about).   So why am I giving the game a down vote, for a few reasons. First off, although the idea is fun at first, it can be very repetitive because you literally just base jump for the entirety of the game, which isn't that short. It can start to become mundane because you're doing the same thing for the 100th time. Also, most levels are the exact same, with the same buildings and obstacles. More variety of where you are jumping would be nice. There are a few with rocks and a mountain, as well as a giant pipe, but for the most part the levels were interchangeable, which doesn't help with the repetition. More thought could have been put into level design. Also the few things that can add something to do (tagging buildings and giving thumb signals) stay the same throughout, so even after they are introduced in the first few levels, you never gain anything else to do, which once again adds to the monotony. Some other things to do would be nice. Also the tagging and thumb signals aren't very accurate and you can look at things and press the button and it won't count, and the game doesn't give you a good enough indication whether or not you actually got it. They are a little too finnicky sometimes, and could have been polished more.  Now for the worst problem. Although I am fine with having high scores and points, it should be for people that want to get leaderboards and want to replay a game. In this game, your star rating gets you stuff you have to use to unlock levels. This is fine for a while but then newer levels cost more than if you get a 5 star on a single level, which makes no sense. I got mostly 4-5 stars on all the levels, with some 3s, and only a very few 1-2s, and I couldnt afford to play about 10 levels. It seems so stupid that a developer would make something and make it soo inaccessible. You should not be decided to play more of the game based on a random score or time the developer chooses for you. That is what the leaderboards and other things are for the idiots that wanna keep replaying a level to get as high of a score as possible. I don't want to have to keep repeating every level till I get 5 stars just to be able to play more, because if thats the case then why include 1-4 stars, it's just stupid. FORCED did it too with challenges and SMB did it with secret hidding bandages and level speed run times. It is such a dumb and lazy concept used to force replay value on those that don't want it. They fix it with the added hard levels (what does it say that hard levels it the value you get and cost of new levels is MORE fair and balanced than regular levels). There are a ton of levels though, so good for them. But since I cannot finish the game because of stupid game design I cannot fully endorse the game. 5.5/10.

265	1	a	This game is a gravity simulation. You jump off buildings and try to avoid getting killed by other buildings. You need to work your way through the maze of buildings (while getting as close to them as you can for points). Then you must land. Pretty fun. Has lots of obsticles but it gets boring after a while. You need great reaction time for this game. I would give it a 68/100.

4450	1	a	DEFINITELY A NEW GAME UNDER MANY ASPECTS After the big patch FFB is now solid, Multiplayer Alpha is lagless with 20+ cars on track, netcode is stunning (no cars take off to the moon if they've been hit by another car), the AI is 'ok' (but still needs improvements), tracks updated with the Road Feel are now so much better to drive onto (because of the way new FFB and updated tracks interact), and the sound... well... WHAT A SOUND!!! TOTAL IMMERSION There are so many good things under the hood about this game that I seriously hope it'll become more appealing and known to all the simracers out there. Despite the unclear, sometime shady and mind-boggling business model S3 has adopted, this game deserve and deserve a lot! Don't be intimidated by the cost of contents in the store. You don't have to buy EVERYTHING (even if the temptation is high!). Set for yourself a budget, buy what you're really interested into and possibly wait for big discounts... they'll surely come. Race on!
4555	0	a	I tried almost every simulation outh there including iRacing , and i was excited for a new simbin title , cuz im a fan of simbim from way back with GT legends and GTR/GTR2 , so i was expecting a good sim, insted i got some Acrila cars that u can not get used to , just like iRacing , u cant feel the road , u can master a track but u cant master the grip, its just unconected... no way neer GTR ad GTlegends and Race07...i dont care about graphics so thats my opinion on phisics and engine, a big fail from me , but i understand they wanna make it more fun and driver frendly but in there aprouch the have missed me .  Now a little bit of a content rewiev Its not a free game , its a demo, if u want a game with content u have to buy it and its not cheep, i hate it , its like Star citizen , selling u a model of something and pricing it not as much as star citizen but still, its a 3D model, and when 10 000 ppl buy it u end u with 50 000euros in cash, does it cost that much to designe a 3D model of a car, NO, so what is it , a rip off is what it is , they dont want to make a game, thats why u cant play it standalone with no internet conection, they wann sell stuff like Star citizen cuz they have seen the amoun of money SC earned robing off kids with money, Im OK with that , rip off all kids with money i couldnt care less, but u wont get it from me , i want a racing simulation , that will work even if my internet connection is down, i want to pay for a game not a car or a track. I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternatives  Alternatives GSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSC Also Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished  So thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel. If u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games . Thank u simbin for not existing any more and making room for real racing gamers over at Asetto corsa and GSC. over and out

5545	1	a	Fun, but immensely hard. Only worth it in multiplayer, though, because the single player matches are really weird and I'm not even sure what the devs were thinking with them. You start out with an incredibly basic team against what essentially amounts to supermen in the single player. Really annoying. Multiplayer is great fun with friends, though.

374	1	a	Too much fun. I didn't like this game at first but have recently given it another chance, and it's seriously fun to jump off buildings trying to smash into money, kiss the side of buildings, hug them for more points, or just flip off the crowds against you. And get points for doing all of that.   Good game, I recommend it.
4594	1	a	Game title 'RaceRoom Racing Experience' speaks for itself - good for who wants to get some race experience. I like this simulator. But, ... on my opinion, there are two big issues with simulator. First of all, it pricey. Second, you do not get a change to test a car or a track before buy it. This is ridiculous. Give us a chance to test it before buy it or at least possibility to return it back.

5481	1	a	The only viable cricket game that exists. Game physics is really good, but after a time it becomes so realistic that the fun element just goes out. For instance rubbing the ball for swing. Agreed, it brings the game closer to reality, but it becomes too monotonous after a while. The graphics aren't great, but I am sure they will be improved in the next iteration. The camera angles also need a little reworking in my opinion. But, overall finally a game worth the wait.

5047	0	a	I have no idea why i downloaded this, first of all it did not even open, had to verify the cache and to redownload more 600MB, well at least it worked, first glance was meh, i mean the UI is outdated, and looks like few years old. What it is funny is it detected my xBox controller, and told me its xBox controller, name it, so i did, and i clicked on race with the mouse, and the practice begins, and i am like vrom vrom, and well, nothing happened :|, i clicked the settings to find my controller profile empty, even though the game knew it was xBox controller and asked me if it was a wheel or a gamepad or keyboard. . Forget it about the control, how on earth 17GB game does NOT have a tutorial, i mean mobile games have it :|, had to push the standard buttons to change the view or anything and i had to just open the control menu to look it up ' i changed to keyboard to save the time assigning everysingle button', and i was like oh yeah its working now, thats a good sign, i guess. . i started with the first car, the control is decent, but i have to say you have to accept the fact that NO ONE without wheel and KNOW how to play will even make a few turns, no assists what so ever, i dont mind because its simulator not NFS, but Project Cars sim too, and got assists too for new drivers. . I hated the first car, so i started to looking up for another car, and i found only 1 more car is avilable the rest is locked for real money, well at least let us try a BMW for a start then let us play with Fiat :D, i mean for real, if EVEN i want to buy those cars, with the horrible cars avilable for me to test, i will NOT EVER buy another car, no way in hell. . And about the graphics, its like old flat cars with some AA and the track and the surronding is old, VERY old with only motion blur and post proccessing to make it look better, the thing is the AA and the post made the cars not realistic at all, no details what so ever, GRID 2, Dirt 3, Project cars even NFS Rivals or freaking NFS hot pursiut looks better than these cars, its just sad, the oversized game makes me think of GTA, the horrible optimaization and compressing. . IF and only IF you are smart, you could EASILY say this is either demo and remove 15 GB or something and let everyone try it and make the full game with all the cars avilable, or freaking DLCs, not forcing me to download 14GB ish to try only 2 or 3 cars, with 3 tracks, i mean what have you been drinking, i think most of the negative reviews because we had to download 14GB just to TRY the game, and with a little to nothing of content. . I have no idea why some people saying this game is good, its decent for free game yes, but the financing is s**t, you act like you force us to give this game bad review, couldnt you use your brains and make test and see if ANYONE will like the concept of downloading 14GB of NOTHING ??? . I dont know if whoever download the game and liked did NOT saw or tried any other racing games, or have plazing download speed, cause it took like 2 days to download and i am really angry because i really for the first time WASTED my time even playing it.
4929	0	a	Not recommended at all, reasons? well, requires registration out of steam, non responsive web page, finaly got the registraton and activated my account, turned on the game, loged in using my registration details and i got server error, server error, server error.  After a long time i finaly made it to main menu, choose a race type, hmm all options are grey but one, fine, Singleplayer/Hotlapping, hmm choose car, buy, buy, buy, ok only 1 car here? choose track, buy, buy, buy, only one track here? a lot to buy but nothing included. Seriously this is NOT a free to play game its DAMN upgradable DEMO!!!!!!!  A question, why the hell they want a real name, date of birth, country of origin and country of residence details???? You do have to fill that in on the registraton page, without it you cannot complete the registration  Should be removed from steam, too many bad reviews about how expensie actually this F2P game can get, stinks like some kind of rip off, plus not even Steam cares about my date of birth, so why should i give it to a 3rd party? What is this, some kind of a phishing scam? A paradox, the most expensive free to play game i ever got my hands on

Then it told me to register for free content and ten minutes later when I signed in I got 1 car. Then you have to adjust every setting in the UI because all the normal stuff just isnt there. On top of that it is super over complicated just to get a car and drive it. The single player mode has confusing menus too, that was nice. So much potential for a game this big, over 10gb, but it falls short in all the worst ways.

4416	0	a	0/10 DO NOT BUY! IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A COPY, IT STILL ISN'T WORTH IT! The main problem with this game is that it is a multi-player only game with dead servers. Which means that people paid money to sit in a lobby waiting for somebody to show up. They never do. Save your money and buy Blood Bowl instead, a game with a solid single-player mode AND a healthy multiplayer community. Add into the mix how many teams have been cut out just so they can be sold back to you at a stupid rate, and you have the worst purchase ever on Steam EDIT: This review was written before the 'Knockout' edition came out 'too little, too late' I haven't seen the new version because the DRM only allows limited downloads, and since I replaced my PC I've not been able to activate it. Take from that what you will.
585	1	a	I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention: 1.) There's rarely any servers. 2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag. 3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.  Some upsides: 1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag. 2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.  It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.

It has tons of levels (not really) and you can have endless hours of fun doing them (not really). Levels are more or less score based, which is mostly gained by basically flying (well, falling) near those floating platforms. Well, what can I say, if it sounds fun, get it!

184	0	a	Game aims to recapture extreme skydiving. It fails. Game gets the silly idea that skydiving would be more interesting with floating buildings... it just makes the game seem less immersive. The graphics heavily distract from the game, and don't add to it at all. They tried too hard to look hip, anot not enough time trying to be good. Game would have been significantly better if instead of going through the tricky level design, if they had just grabbed some 3d data of the world and made base jumping in famous locations.   I can see their reason for their 'floating cities' (to make their base jumping take longer) but if they're going to try that, they should at least make their floating cities look like floating cities above distant ground and not shipping containers being thrown at you by a wall of neon lava.  I'm not normally one to complain about graphics (look at my other reviews if you don't believe me) but the graphics and level layout in this make the game horrible.

5228	0	a	Very few tracks to start, steep learning curve with very little instruction. Graphics aren't that impressive, and it's an interesting model... HOWEVER, The killer to this game, which I paid for, is that 98% of the game is 'Pay to play.'  The servers are slow, the microtransactions are ridiculous, and you can't even play without an account. I'm sorry I wasted my time. I hear the studio is shutting down, and if this is how they choose to conduct their business, then I'm happy to hear that. Shame everyone there is out of a job, but at the same time, we can't stand for this model on Steam.  It's prevolent on Mobile platforms, and it shoud NOT weasel its way on here. Good riddance. I'll not be playing any more.  Not with SO MANY better racing games out there.

5284	0	a	I'll give NSS5 that, it's a relatively enjoyable game. The match gameplay is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer and other early 90's, and definitely works in a retro kind of way. The resource managing outside of matches helps build the game into a slightly larger, funner experience. All in all, NSS5 is a charming game that promises a few hours of fun.  The drawback, however, is that the game is kind of a poorly designed, buggy mess. Save files get corrupted left and right, the game freezes with alarming regularity, and the puzzling online requirement tends to make starting new games a chore (hot tip: If you happen to buy it and struggle starting a game because of connectivity issues, edit the Settings\Settings.txt file. Change the line nettimeout=5 to nettimeout=100).  All in all, I can't recommend it. There's not enough here to defend the crippling issues the game has, and definitely not enough to defend their pricing point. Steer clear.
4769	1	a	I won't give it a bad review, but you pretty much need a wheel and pedals to enjoy this game. Xbox controller is no bueno.  Tried it out on a weekend where everything is unlocked, but normally it appears that you would have to pay for most of the stuff (which is fine, if you like the game, then buy the content). It does appear to be pretty pricey if you buy everything though, even multiple or all the packs.

4546	1	a	I don't often review games (or anything else), but with all the thumbs down this has gotten I decided it needed my input. First let me say that I raced real cars for 9 years on both ovals and road courses. I've also sim raced on and off since about 1992. I'm not an expert on sim racing, but I've tried most of the major players and R3E is among the very best -- I find the physics to be superb, at least when used with a good wheel and pedals. I can't comment on how it plays on kb, controller or anything else and frankly I don't care.   One of the problems with sim racing is how to represent the loss of traction that one *feels* in the real world through balance, touch and seat of the pants. A common perception in the sim world is that a game is realistic when it is very difficult, but the real world isn't like that -- vehicles only get very difficult close to the limit. I think R3E does an admirable job of balancing difficulty without crossing the line into 'arcade'. Is it better than iRacing or Assetto Corsa? I don't know....that's really on a car-by-car basis for me, but some of them are better and none that I've driven are really bad (and even iRacing has had some stinkers).  I also don't think the 'free to play' system is that bad. You can have some great fun without ever buying anything! Certain track and car combinations are always available (for free!) in the 'competitions'. These are really just hot-lap contests, but they are fun and you get to try out the content.....and it is still free. Raceroom is expensive if you buy all the DLC, but I just don't see a need for that -- just buy whatever series you want to race in, and if you are really cheap just by one car in each class. Either way it is still a lot cheaper than iRacing.   The downsides of Raceroom:  -the severs are usually empty, but then I don't use this for online racing.  - the AI can be a bit aggressive, but are otherwise pretty good.  -can't save setups (really????). I've heard this is coming in the next update

4686	1	a	Not going to write a lenghty review, but to the people who are saying the business model is 'bad' are wrong. It is what I would call flexible. Sure, there isn't much base content, and I think Sector3 Studios should offer another car and track combo to really get a feel for what this game has to offer.  The cars are relatively cheap (can be even cheaper if bought in packs) and are all quality-made. Same goes for the tracks, minus a few inaccuracies here and there. Most notably is track elevation, this game does not seem to create the feeling of elevation too well when compared with other sims such as rFactor, Assetto Corsa and of course iRacing.  You are not forced to pay hundreds of dollars, you can simply do as I have done and buy 6-8 cars and a few tracks. That's it. I will be entertained for a few weeks with just this little bit of content as I practice to get the most out of each car and track I drive.  Thank you for taking the time to read the short review!

297	1	a	Absolutely bursting with character. I wasn't sure whether I would enjoy this or not, but then I jumped off a building, and unlike in real life, where the end result is an unfortunate mess and a prime spot in the local obituary (or if you made a loud noise, the local paper front page), I found the whole experience to be absolutely thrilling.  It's a lovely example of a unique concept polished well, and given its own crazy personality to compliment the whole thing. Perfect little time waster, with some quite complex manouvres required for perfection, lending itself both to beginner building jumpers, and expert exo-base jumpers alike.  Really, there isn't quite a game like it, it's good.

Cons:  - Needs multiplayer - Very complicated interface/menu (I still don't know how to win cups)  Conclusion:  RaceRoom's graphics are excellent (one of the best ones I've seen), but these incredible graphics are wasted on a pointless game! I have no idea how to REALLY play it! When I click 'Drive', it takes me to a track, but there are no opponents, and when I finish a lap it lets me do it again! (there's no end to it! It's an infine loop!) After a lap all it says is 'New record time' or nothing...  Score: 2/10

5450	1	a	No finer a control scheme was ever concocted for cricket. Holding the left trigger, timing your shot and then spanking the ball in a straight-6 is weirdly exhilirating.   Commentary is a little half-arsed but it does try to emulate more successful titles (NBA 2K) and the visual presentation is lacklustre. However, the graphics and overlays at the end of the over simulate a TV style broadcast enough that they're worth watching.  Interestingly, the only licensed player is Don Bradman but the game encourages you to download 'The Community's Best' which ends up being all the official players and leagues.  Either add this one to your wishlist or just buy it outright but be warned, you MUST have a controller in order to play (no keyboard commands).

4383	1	a	This is absolutely my favourite game of all time. It's extremely fun to play with your friends and it has so much unlockable content that it just makes you want to continue playing, which is a good thing, of course! There's a storymode now aswell, and that adds alot of replay-value. However, the characters don't have any specific characteristics that ultimately changes the gameplay. They're just there for cosmetic utilities. It's arguably one of the best competetive game out there.  I highly recommend it to everybody out there!

5182	0	a	8 GB for 1 race track is more than a little too much,. i'm guessing all the DLC is included from the start off. It's a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent - and it has external wheel and pedal support at least.   It's not bad. But hardly great either. I just have it installed because I don't have any other games that support the wheel. In order for this to really be worth recommending, it'd need a few more tracks, and MUCH cheaper car/extra track unlocks.  There's some bugs where you drive through obstacles, and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap - you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets,.. it's a bit frustrating.
13	0	a	Can't recommend it for the sole reason that the semi-sequel AAAAA for the awesome is the exact same game but has more levels.
5127	0	a	Well I thought Origin asked too much (aka EA) when it comes to their microstransactions for all their games. While the client for the game might be free for Raceroom. The rest of the cars and tracks (you get a handful for free) cost approx $3/$5 respecitvely. Mind you it is just 1 Model of Car, not variations, like all BMW's M Class. Now the tracks probably are reasonable, but I have not bought 1 to see just how close to the real thing they are. If they are like the included tracks that you get for free, I might be able to see buying a track. Right now you can probably with the Easter Sale pick up 4-5 cars for around $6, tracks maybe 2 for the same $6.   Note, if you have money in your Steam Wallet, you can convert them to the currency used to buy the tracks and cars.  So I would wait and see if they do any really special promotion with multiple cars for a low price. The DTM package, has 3 cars, with multiple paint schemes/team versions, but I don't know if that is really worthwhile. They do include several tracks in the package. So for right now, with the game still, sort, in a beta to release candidate status, depends on who you talk to and what you consider aa final release. But you can clearly see they state 'Open Beta' as of April 10, 2014.

31	0	a	Pretty crappy. It doesn't let me change the resolution (Which would have been fine if it didn't fail to run properly at my normal nvidia surround resolutions), and it doesn't let you change the keyboard layouts (which would have been fine if it didn't introduce the grafitti action on a â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up hand-contorting key).  So way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason. Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it â¥â¥â¥â¥ed me up.  As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it. Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.  Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Am I the only one who is annoyed as â¥â¥â¥â¥ by that?

4442	0	a	Richard Walter Zisk (born February 6, 1949) is a retired Major League Baseball player currently in charge of pro scouting in Florida for the Chicago Cubs.[1]Zisk was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of Seton Hall University in the third round of the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft, and made his major league debut on September 8, 1971 replacing Roberto Clemente in right field in the eighth inning of Pittsburgh's 10-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, and got a single in his first major league at-bat.[2] Zisk also made seventeen appearances with the 1972 Pirates, however, he was not on either team's post-season roster.  In Zisk's rookie season, 1973, he batted .324 with ten home runs. On June 9, 1974, he hit for the cycle in a 14-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park.[3] For the season, he led the Pirates with 100 runs batted in while also clubbing seventeen home runs. He made his only post-season appearances with the 1974 and 1975 Pirates. While batting an impressive .400 in the post-season, Zisk only scored one run and had no RBIs as the Pirates were swept in the 1974 and 1975 National League Championship Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, respectively. Following the 1976 season, the Pirates traded Zisk along with Silvio Martinez to the Chicago White Sox for Terry Forster and Rich Gossage.
244	1	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! ....For the Awesome, the Anti-Platformer!! In this game you will do all in your power to AVOID landing on them, as you leave every platform far behind!  I nearly made a mistake with this game (beyond thinking the dreadful title actually said something about the game, that is): I read the reviews. Then I read the awards it's won. Then I considered the type of games I enjoy most: pinball, Puddle, FOTONICA. Flowing, limited control type games. Actually, the decision was easier with more information. And I made the correct one.  WHAT a game! While some call it 'boring and repetitive' how can the possibilites of every building, tower, mountain in the UNIVERSE possibly be boring! People accustomed to absolute control, who have paid large sums to get games to perform in very precise ways, might not understand how gravity, and a body falling at very high speeds, are forces beyond simple control. They should play The Collider, a fine game with a similar basis. In THIS game you are being pulled by the force of an entire PLANET! Control must be earned, and learned....  Basically, after completing some ridulously simple tutorials you are given a building to leap from. On the way down you gain points by coming close to objects, coming VERY close to objects, hitting score-coded, colored glass plates, and not smashing to boney, bloody bits. By succeeding, and obtaining enough points, you will reach awards of 1 to 5 stars. Each star pays off in 'teeth', the currency used to unlock new levels, of which there are more than 80. Teeth can also be used to buy things like the 'flip-it' glove, to either give a thumbs-up to fans, or the opposite to haters. Yes, of course, granting additional points.   Once you have fallen as far as you feel is safe, a player opens their 'fins' in order to glide safely to a smooth landing, possibly on a high-scoring smaller target. All movement is performed by mouse and the ubiquitous WASD keys (or controller.) But one must keep in mind that despite the availability of directional keys, a falling/floating body will ultimately move forward, to the exclusion of most other directions or intentions. One quickly learns the power of 'spiraling'.  You may also unlock tongue-in-cheek 'relaxing meditations' (for significantly lower prices,) or (so far) a cookie recipe from the strangest old, pseudo-cannibal lady ever. The purpose of spending teeth is not just new levels and objects, but access to yet more, since you must unlock an adjacent level before opening a new one on a tall, turning 'level drum'. Prices increase with progression, and only hints are given as to what will be found once a choice is made.  There are also many bits of BASE jumping trivia, at no cost, basically to fill out he wall. A!FtA (for lack of better) does have achievements, but mostly for putting in the time, and only ten of them. Not a lot can be done to actively pursue them, other than sitting in a dark room, slowly wasting away. You know, the usual.  IF this is your game, it is VERY much your game. A marvelous, funny AND fun game. So much fun as to not provoke the rage tendancies that will cause me to 'delete local content' almost immediately. No two jumps are likely to be even remotely similar, since the distances fallen can be great. For me, it's almost as much fun to die as to win. Almost...  (Like many Steam games, offline game time is ignored.) 4tdc
424	1	a	It's rare for a game to be so thrilling and so easy to pick up. It's fast pace means you quickly re-enter the game to give it another shot, and it's scoring system means you can approach each level at your own pace. During really well however is both challanging and super rewarding, somehow translating the serious thrill of base jumping without the petty concern of safety.

I only see from 200 to 500-600 players a day and that makes me sad cause on sale this game made up to 8000 players and it was just amazing.

5574	1	a	Fun! Fun! FUN!  It's quite close to the board game and I am enjoying it more then I expected I would. The RNG is erratic, true, but if you remember the board games you play then I am quite sure double one or two skulls were no rarity (especially if you roll a lot.) Besides, the opponent suffers from terrible luck occasionally as well. I remember a necromantic team needing four turns to pick up the ball *snickers* and an ogre team with three of six ogres being boneheaded.  If you liked the board game I highly recommand this game as well.
4767	1	a	This has got to be the most underrated racing game or simulation. It may not have the best visuals among racing games right now but it still looks really good. It's FFB even though not revolutionary is something that you can tweak to suit your preferences and it's fantastic when you do.  Its problem is its annoying 'race2play' (a play on 'free 2 play') UI and it also only has a very few free cars and even fewer free tracks. I bought its GT Masters and DTM 2014 experiences and, man, those are fantastic. They should make separate games for those (but give it free to us who bought them here in RRE). Or at least let us configure the game to select a default 'experience' during startup.  AI in this game seems good. They don't display the 'blind AI' or 'AI without the I for intelligence' of other racing games and simulations.  Currently this game is still missing some polish on the HUD elements. Like the sector split times really huge and distracting when we only need to know if we're going faster or slower for the current lap. The position bar's fonts look horrible. Those things are really well done on their older games (Race series) so I hope they could really improve this area of the game. Currently those look ugly in comparison to the rest of the game that I turn them off at the expense of feedback since the game does not have a race engineer to tell you what's going on.

4459	1	a	This really is a top racing sim and its a shame it doesnt get the publicity it deserves. I think its problem is it gets lost in a sea of racing titles but this really is up there with the best. As of January 2015 it sets a benchmark in sim racing for sounds and probably AI as well, the physics are also superb.   You can download the base content for free which again is fantastic and there are add-ons which are sometimes on sale. Another great feature is leaderboard challenges where they give away prizes for the fastest times. A great addition to this is a lot of the time you dont need to have purchased the content to take part so you can try these before you buy.  Where this game is let down is by a few minor bugs but mainly its so unpopulated online its really a shame and can be tough to get decent races but i think that comes down to the lack of publicity it has had.   I cant recommend this strongly enough and as the base content is free its well worth trying it out

4417	0	a	 043/100   The game comes with no in-game manual.  I hope you already know how to play Dungeonbowl! Oh you don't?  Well you are out of luck then.  2 Years after release a 1 player mode was  finally  added. Hey, better late than never right? And all the DLC is now included for free. What more could you ask for? Deserves a thumbs up right?  WRONG!  Dungeonbowl is a game about managing  your  team, customing  your  team and playing matches with  your  team.  So what we thought what we would do is, in 1 player mode you can't use  your  team and instead have to choose a pre-made team thus removing the WHOLE POINT OF MAKING YOUR OWN TEAM! Oh and no progress is saved for that pre-selected team either!  I just...  NO!  Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews

5567	1	a	You have a few bugs that'll never get tended to and this game is definitely not going to get anything else but if you've played the tabletop board game then this is a pretty true renactment. The singleplayer's AI is no good for practice against multiplayer and truely only shines when you do multiplayer.  Overall, a good game with active leagues besides the Cyanide sanctioned ones -- Try out Naggoroth open first before you do Auld league!
491	1	a	This is a fun game, but only worth it if its on sale... :P
4973	0	a	I have played a lot of racing games in my time mostly on the various playstation sytems. Looking at the screenshots of the game and the trailers it looks quite something, when you download the game however things change. Firstly the 'Free to play' element is a 5 cars on a 5 tracks quite disappointing but it cost nothing. First thing that annoyed is the braking signs that suggest that target audience is 3 year olds, colour coding? aren't the distance signs good enough for a simulator.  Anyway, after starting an event in a stick shift I was quite pleased to see one hand went to change gear when required, my illusions were shattered when I came to a corner though. I pressed the right arrow key the steering wheel imediately went to full lock and I understeered into the wall so I thought fair enough I was a bit fast but I expected for the car to at least attempt the corner, (for example gran turismo you can enter a hairpin flat and you will take a curved path into the wall). I tried the next corner at a snail's pace (light sweeper probably a 3rd usually, I took it in 1st )giving an impovement, enough that I made it round. Something that bothers me is the fact it just says speed on the display is it km/h or mph? considering I was doing 190 in first in a DTM car I doubt it's either.  Next I took a paddle shift prototype, the paddles did not move at the correct which also bothered me. Furthermore, the camera is positioned so close to the steering wheel that it seems the driver is trying to rub his chin on it. Next the sounds, it's free to play I know but I expected it least to sound like an actual race car as this was. tunnels make exhaust notes but the tunnel I entered was extremely underwhelming.  All I can say is at least it wont cost you any money just time

5526	1	a	This game is a ton of fun, though it's vast ruleset can be intimidating at first. It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form. Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well. But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.   While it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense. Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision. These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult! The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced. I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.  I had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved. This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more. The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop. And it doesn't look bad. The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.   I know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls. I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard. It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing. You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly. I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.   Pro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos. They helped my game immensely.

4503	1	a	 This is a sim racing title. Which means you need a wheel to play this game, preferably a Driving Force GT or better. A gamepad will simply not do. If you are looking for something along the lines of DiRT or Need for Speed, this game is definitely not for you.   Now that's out of the way, R3E, in it's current state, is a solid contender in the sim racing genre. Physics feel great and the force feedback is pretty much what you would expect from a racing sim. The game has fantastic sounds and AI that pretty much blows every other modern sims out there out of the water. However, the game does have major flaws which I will talk about further down.   Pros

4408	1	a	 An evolution of F1 2011, with more features and less yellow filters.   F1 2012 is a game about Formula One cars and driving them.  Although with a slightly controversial change of not making the player feel like a part of the paddock anymore but rather presenting everything in a simplified main menu, it continues to innovate on the set formula (pun definitely intended) and throws more features into the mix, like the 'Young Driver Test' taking place before the start of your career, or the 'Champions Mode' putting you up against six World Champions in multiple challenges to test your skills.  The cars do feel great to drive, and the number of modes to play makes the game even more interesting for sure. It is a brilliant game altogether, and I definitely have had huge amounts of fun with it.

4620	1	a	For new players getting on steam and getting into racing games this is a good start. SO far ive had no problems with it and with my Intel core i7 and Nvidia GTX 560 it runs on Ultra graphics and is steady at 50 to 60 fps. The good thing about this game is that its free and when you get it and cant afford all the addons with new maps cars etc.. it has a good variety of starting cars and maps.  On a scale of 1 to 10.... id give it a 9.   I would totally recommend it to new racing players!! :)
3535	1	a	This game takes all the fun of Mario Kart 64 and puts it into a 2D platform engine. It's very addictive, fun as a party game and equally fun as a 'Story Mode' playthrough. Tinybuild is a sponsor of Games Done Quick and I purchased this after it was advertised on the twitch live stream. They have a very good original game in almost every genre you can imagine so this studio has something for everyone. If you're into compeditive games or even just 2D platformers you'll love this game.

5471	1	a	Awesome game with regular update support from one of the best developers. Please do add an option of choosing between easy stroke play mode OR realistic stroke play. I am getting irritated on how each and every update, either makes the stroke play easy at the rookie level or realistic on the other patch. Many a times I play this game just to relax and would love to get an option of easier stroke play on rookie level forever untill I myself change to option to either a higher difficulty level or the realistic stroke play option.  Was playing a match, and was hitting all over the park, saved the game, shut off the pc,  next day woke up, only to see a new update downloading to play the game, and this time, the same strokes leads not even out of the inner circle with even a little bit of misstiming. I would happy accept the realistic gameplay on certain occassions and do appreciate the efforts that you put in, But no in a mood when I want to relax playing the game. Since the career of dbc14 is my one stop relaxation game since its release.

261	0	a	Welcome to the first ever falling simulator that ive ever seen. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a real good time but others may have a different opinion. For what you pay this game is very basic allowing you simply to fall while avoiding obsticles with the more risk you take earning you more points. You start with only a handful of maps to choose from but you have to earn points to spend unlocking other maps. This leads to alot of repetition just to allow yourself access to more repetition. The cost is made up for by the number of maps you can unlock as the game progresses but I dont find that to be all that worth it.
117	1	a	It has an awesome name. What more do you need?  This is a game for people who are obsessed with maximizing their score and topping the leaderboards, or at least topping yourself. The game is entirely about navigating an artistic representation of an impossible city as you jump from the tallest building and weave your way through the concrete maze to land safely at the bottom. On your way down, you'll collect bonuses for staying close to buildings as they whizz by and smashing through targets. That's about it. As you unlock more levels, the challenges get tougher, but this is a pretty fun distraction if you've got a few minutes to spare.

5172	0	a	I am having too many game issues to give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation. For the moment I must vote 'thumbs down.' If the game and business model improves I will revisit my recommendation. imho,ymmv : )  edit updated 10/15/2015 after ~7 additional months... This game is still in beta after 30 months from release date of February 2013!!   I am currently run the ADC pack, DTM 2014 pack and WTCC 2014 pack in RaceRoom beta.  Many improvements have been made in the past few months. However, I still cannot give it a 'thumbs up' recommendation at this time.  On the positive side the FWD cars in the WTCC 2014 pack are simply lovely to drive. Good handling and excellent FFB make for a plenty of enjoyment taking these cars around any track. The awful GUI is gone!    Items that need to be addressed by Sector3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - AI is decent and quite clean by having good player detection coding.  AI aggressiveness needs to be added to game.  AI are 'on the rails' when it comes to collisions - your car is not on the rails so if there is a collision between you and AI then you will likely spin out and the AI will continue running. AI needs more options and settings to make them more realistic and less automated.  Business model - Having items and picks split between S3 store and STEAM is simply awful. S3 needs to have all of the items available for sale grouped together. S3 needs to dump the VRP and only list currency.  S3 servers - Having two sets of authentication (steam and S3 servers) is redundant and causes more issues for end user. S3, dump your servers so players can still play RRRE if your servers are down, steam is down, or if players internet is down.  There appears to be no option to calibrate wheels and pedals in game. My gear was recognized and works well. However, I want to calibrate my pedals (set a small deadzone at start and set the travel of when I hit 100% of throttle or brake) and the game will not allow the user to do it. S3 needs to add in a calibration function like the one used in iracing or rf2.   Overall, it appears to me as if S3 has been working on building out the available cars and tracks and only recently are starting to focus on adding in features and updating features already in the game.  Ouch! As of today the game only has a 53% approval rating! : (

Definitely one of the best sims out there atm,  Graphics are good, 3 screens looks good, a little optimization would help so fps are more stable, that said its not an issue, i am running it on ultra where possible and it only drops to 58 occasionally with vsync on. The 980's are coping nicely. Sounds are very realistic and clear, surround is good. The AI are the best in any racing sim right now. The cars feel good, the feedback to the Fanatec Clubsport is excellent, FWD WTCC cars are spot on, that said the BMW is awesome, driven correctly it will stay with and often beat the FWD cars which can be tough on certain circuits. Had a lot of online races and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them, just need to be able to host servers ourselves but the multiplayer clearly states alpha so i'm happy to be able to even race online right now. There are a nice selection of tracks, would like to see some more from the UK but that's my preference. I purchased the majority of my content while on sale, not sure i could justify the full price to be honest as it seems too expensive as it marketed as a 'FTP' game, which kind of leaves you feeling mislead and maybe a little cheated.  My suggestion, try it, get some content on next sale, you will be pleasantly surprised. The free stuff didn't appeal to me at all, the paid content obviously is a lot better (for me). Never know the dev's may realise all they need to do is sell it as a normal game none of this 'FTP' marketing, then people should buy it. Simples

5508	0	a	This game has so much potential but is seriously let down by the most comedy of errors.  The game advertises a '2v2' concept giving the implications that you'll be able to have a 4 player match mode, however upon discovery it turns out that its 2v2 on the same computer. So instead of 4 machines playing its 2 controllers off 2 machines.  Sub-par graphics  Awful commentary Mediocre gameplay mechanics  Honestly it's typical budget cutting from an australian developer.  Wouldn't reccommend.

4774	1	a	RaceRoom is a very good game. I've really enjoyed the hours I have spent on it so far.  This is the short version of the review: Pros  +The sounds are superb +The graphics are nice +The car handling is very good  +The tracklist is seems very cool +The carlist is very good (Only racecars, mind you) +The menus are easy to use +The in-game interface is easy to understand +Extremely detailed tuning +The AI is good  Cons -Very limited in cars and tracks if you do not pay for them -You need a gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game -Tyres seem to last unrealisticly long (Might just be me, I am not experienced in real racing) -Damage can only be enabled on the hardest difficulty (For explanation, see below) -The pit menu is a bit fiddly  This is the longer version of the review: RaceRoom is a very good simulator racing game. This is how it works: There are three difficulty settings. Novice, Amateur and GetReal. Novice is the easiest. It has Traction Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and Auto Braking. Amateur is the middle ground. It only has TC and ABS. GetReal surely does what is says. It gets real. No assists enabled. GetReal is only usable for those with a gamepad or a steering wheel. On a keyboard is utterly useless. There is a damage model, but it can only be used in the 'GetReal' mode, which seems odd to me. In the 'GetReal' mode, you can choose if you want mechanical damage, only cosmetic or none at all. The game also includes a penalty system for corner cutting. You can set it to different kinds of penalties. A slow down penalty, a drive-through penalty or a stop-and-go penalty (Be aware, you'll have to select to serve it manually. Just driving through the pits to serve a drive-through won't work). When you don't pay any money you get acces to three tracks and seven or eight (could be wrong, might be less) cars. Two circuits and one hillclimb course. You can test drive any car you like as many times as you like, but only on a specific track. For the test drive, you can select the difficulty mode. You cannot test drive the tracks, which I think is odd. The game sounds fantastic and looks very good as well.  The tuning in the game is unbelievably detailed and quite frankly scarily detailed. I daren't touch it.   Overall, I think it is a great simulator which everyone interested in racing should give a try.   (This line of text contains some extra love for the people who read the review this far. I've put more time than I should have into this review)

4531	1	a	I'll be quick about it. It's a racing sim. Get it. Play the free competition challenges to see if you like it (no reason not to imo). Then and only then consider buying some vrp's from their store when on offer (-30% sth) and buy ONLY packs on offer (avoid getting single tracks/cars since they are included in packs which at some point will be on offer). Stick to my advice above and check it out. They have leaderboard challenges almost every week so you can try new cars/tracks even though you don't own them for free!

220	0	a	There isn't anything in this game to hold your attention for an acceptable amount of time. It's fun for a brief few moments, but you'll just be doing the same thing over and over again. It's one of those games which doesn't really grasp the concept that fun isn't enough to support an entire game. Its entire draw is that the core gameplay is fun, but everything else is utterly lacking. There's no story and nothing to hope for as you progress through the game. You won't find yourself wondering if new game mechanics will be added. You won't find yourself wondering if a new upgrade will change how you play the game. You start the game, and then you have the option to keep playing forever. If you're a REALLY big fan of the engine and place no value in your time, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than me. But it's 10 dollars! Don't spend that much money on a game like this! I can personally recommend a dozen flash games that will give you a more rewarding experience. Especially considering that they released a better version of this game which COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT!!  They're trying to fleece you. That's the best way to describe this. You're given a little bit of fun at ten times the price it should be. The product that you're given isn't meant to stand the test of time at all. It's only meant to be good enough to keep you from complaining.

Also this is not the only problem, I am also not getting steam achievements. Contacted the devs and they told me that it isn't their problem that the game isn't working for me. I can play every other game online except for this crap. Big Ant fix your shiit.

4491	1	a	  My specs:    Medion Notebook with GTX 670MX and i7 3630QM (Win7 Pro) + 28' Monitor (playing in fullHD) Logitech G920 + shifter    Why I recommend the game:    For anyone, who is into simracing, with r3e you probably get one of the best, if not THE best racing simulator on the market. I can compare to Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 (Demo), Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, Grid Autosport, NFS Shift and NFS Shift 2.  Different to f.ex. Assetto Corsa, in r3e you can only drive real racing cars, no stock versions of them. There are not only features like tyre rubbing or fuel consumption, enthusiasts have many options to mechanically set up the car the way they want.  Physics and force feedback feel great on the G920. It doesn't take long to get a feeling for the car you drive. Never the less it can be preety hard to get controll back after oversteering with some cars. Also you can set up the ffb settings by yourself, if the default ones doesen't suit you.  In singleplayer the AI difficulty can be set up in small steps, just like in Asseto Corsa. There also is an adaptive mode.  As far as my experiences go with multiplayer, I have a pretty good impression of the community. Didn't met a 'NFS crash kiddy' yet (EDIT: you actually meet some, especially in races with free content). There are not only extremely quick hardcore racers on the way, r3e is also played by some real life racers, even from DTM.  Graphics are state of the art and performance is very good. Only things I miss, are 'bad' weather effects like rain and wet tracks for more slippery action sometimes.    Things you should know/some people may not like:    R3e may be called 'freetoplay'. I would describe it more like a bigger demo version of a game, which allows to configure its content the way the customer wants it. So f.ex. if you don't want to drive formula cars, you don't need to buy them. There is the option to do as many test drives as you like of every car, which is very fair in my opinion. You also can drive in hotlap competitions with cars and tracks you don't own.  You can purchase every car or track seperately or buy packs (what can be cheaper). I recommend to buy VRP on the r3e store website. As far as I know, this should be the cheapest way to buy content.  One thing that is pretty annoying, is the fact, that if you bought a car in the f.ex. GT Masters 2014 Version, you still need to buy the same car again (at least cheaper) in the GT3 or GT Masters 2015 Version.  To sum it up: if you really want to play the game with as much content as similiar games offer, r3e is a bit expensive but the price is still OK if you buy packs or take offerings on sale.    Conclusion:    If you are looking for a racing simulation game and you have a ffb wheel, at least test the game in freetoplay-mode. If you are an 'arcade racer' and don't want to put much effort into playing and paying, this probably isn't the game for you. Never the less you still have the option to give it a try for free :)

4476	1	a	At the moment, racesim fans like me seems to live in a golden Age of Racing-Sims as there are a a few promising Sims are out on the market. To put a name to these Sims we've got Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and this game here - RaceRoom Racing Experience (short name R3E). As I was a member of the WMD-Kickstarter-Project for Project CARS I have played it a lot and followed the development-Progress from nearly beginning since its release. I was always impressed by its visual presentation and the dynamic Wether and time-progress...  Then there was Assetto Corsa... they started to release an early access-Version and I can't hold to get into it... In the beginning i was a bit disappointed because of the strange behavior of the Force-Feedback. After I tweaked it a bit I had some Fun with it but I don't become the feeling that I always want to play it. And now coming to RaceRoom Racing Experience... I started playing R3E in the beginning of the open beta-Phase. It was fun in the beginning but only good for hotlapping as other features were in development. After a while Sector 3 opens more and more features and deliver more and more content. So we've got Famous racing Series like ADAC GT-Masters, WTCC, the modern DTM and even the most famous classic DTM from the Year 1992. And that's the point where I got hooked in the Game. Despite the other Games, in R3E i've got the feeling to compete in a Racing-Series known in real live. In the other games the Races feel like a loose mixture of cars out of the game... Together with that R3E offers me the best Force-Feedback and the best Roadfeel of all... Not to forget - the Sound of the Racecars. There isn't any other Racesim out on the market the comes even close to the Sound in R3E. Multiplayer-Races are very great fun with close door to door fights. In the visual aspect - yes it is not that high polished like Project CARS and it has no dynamic weather at the moment, but it is very detailed. Especially the Tracks are very close to the real thing and modeled with a high affinity. There are no unnecessary Trackside-Objects that aren't there at the real track what gave me a more realistic feeling. One of the most important parts of a racesim is the Physics-Model... At that Point R3E at the same level as Assetto Corsa. Together with the better Roadfeel in R3E this game is the winner for me. Project CARS falls back in that point - fun to drive in Project CARS but not more... One negative aspect of R3E is the Business-Model of it. It is called Free-to-Play, what it really is, but only with reduced Content. In F2P you have 5 Free cars and 3 Tracks with 11 Layouts. With this content you can do what ever you want - Multiplayer-Races. Single-Player-Championships, Hotlapping and so on. Together with that, there are always a few Competitions online, in which you are able to drive with Cars and on Tracks you haven't bought before.  If you want to buy something, it can get expensive. But there are a few Tricks to get it in an acceptable range. So you can buy a Redeem-Code for the ingame-currency 'vRP' directly from Raceroom which offer a discount from 10% to 35%. Than you can buy Packs in the store which contains content-objects for a discounted price. The Track-Packs are perfect for that. But you don't have to buy a Car-Pack if you just like one car out of it. Than you can buy that single car and that allows you to drive in Competition or Multiplayer-Races in that Class and other things like that. If you are not sure what to buy, you can always ask at the Sector3-Forum. You will definitely get an answer out of the community - or even from one of the developers. That's another great plus for me, that the Developers are in close contact to the Community and take part in discussions in the Forum.  In Conclusion I just can say, that R3E maybe isn't the best in every aspect (graphics, busness-model), but overall for me it is the best RacingSim out on the market which hooked me and entertained me a long time now. As it is still in development it will even get better. 
4861	1	a	I do not like free-to-play or micro-transactions in any game. But this is SimBin. So you know you get one of the top (maybe the top) racing sim experience you can get. Personally I will support SimBin as much as I can.

It just has a charm that keeps you coming back for more. While falling you can give gestures to onlooking fans or give the bird to onlooking protesters. You can spray paint buildings on your way down. It's a very enjoyable game to relax to. The levels are very unique in style. There is much humor in this game and if you enjoy these type games then you won't regret buying it. A must-have for any wannabe skydiver!

Too bad, because the game is actually pretty good but ruined with bad pricing model.  I would be more than happy if I could actually buy the game instead of being milked with microtransactions. Don't waste your bandwidth.  You are better of waiting for something like Project cars or Assetto corsa.

4423	0	a	I am of the rare breed that prefers Dungeonbowl to Blood Bowl; after extensively playing and enjoying the tabletop game, I waited for this game to be on sale. Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent. I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case. I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface. I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport. The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times. All other 'big guys' have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast. I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won &gt;65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.   Why not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou? My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?  I am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.   Jepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game.

4473	1	a	If you jump into the game just play a race and quit it u'll hate it. This game free version is limited to few tracks, few cars and has really difficult gameplay since It's really realistic. Pros: Car sounds are just absolutely amazing, physix are so real, the game is really hard if you remove all helpers but once you get used to the driving you'll love it.  Graphics are really good for a free game and you don't have to max them out to see good result. There is the challenges, you get to try cars on a selected track and you can win prizes if you set a good time which is really competitive. The game is not made for controller or keyboard, it is pure for a wheel if you want to get 100% accuracy while driving Didn't try the dtm experience yet but looking forward to. One amazing thing, is that the game is constanty updating and there is now the multiplayer which is alpha but looking good.

It just it isn't an open-world experience that I thought. I love the Forza series, iRacing and Project Cars, but this game is more of a non-casual racing game. In my opinion I give it a 7.1/10 for Low-End Performence and Game wise.

5337	1	a	simply fantastic, Big Ant did a brilliant job with this game! and I remember watching a friend of mine, Twistie3, playing this on a livestream, with Ross, the CEO or something like that of Big Ant, and it just blew me away, it was like something I had never seen before! So, of course I bought it the day it came out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic. Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too! FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)

4925	0	a	This seems like a good take on a racing simulator. But it lacks a lot.  First, the free content of the game is limited and will bore you fast (1 track, 2 cars), I feel like we could have had a bit more, even if we get free testdrives of other cars on weekends. Also there is no multiplayer apart for laptimes and that makes it just you on the same track trying to get better times.  Graphicwise and simulation was it is great, nice graphics and it gives a realistic handling.   The ingame purchases are a bit expensive for what I'd aim for, but they are good and if you can afford it really take the game further.  It's free to play, so It's a goodie to have but overal it isn't quite finished yet.

4818	1	a	Having spent some time around the various racing sims, I can say this is not the most realistic, not the best looking and not the best feeling (Force Feedback) sim out there. But currently it's my favourite,  The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.  Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down.   Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.  Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,  The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.  All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.  
4524	1	a	Since I got the game I have enjoyed every minute of it. Totally reccomend it to anyone into sim racers

Gameplay can be difficult at first, considering so much going on. But overtime it becomes easy (as I expect most games do).  P.S. If you haven't noticed already. This game needs a controller. Unlike some previous iterations.

4466	1	a	Purchased the game after just a few laps into the Free-to-play as I was hooked. The SOUND in this game is inspiring and almost as destructuve as being near a true performance vehicle. I play on an SLI EVGA 780 system and get wonderful SLI performance of 95% per GPU usage and the FPS never dips below an enjoyable level on surround (3 monitors). The tracks are layed out similar to other racing games but in comparason to GT5 or GT6, Grid Autosport and the like you get a feel of taking a corner and fluffing the apex, braking too late or just destroying your engine with a lap in 1st gear if you enjoy playing realistic. Did I mention the SOUND! Graphical quality is top notice so learn the keyboard setting to adjust your seat height, distance from the wheel etc to suit your driving style. The AI is hard when you start and since I am still only 10 p[us hours into practicing, they just zoom passed me like I am stuck with the handbrake on. Did I mention the SOUND! If you can use a stereo sound system with a subwoofer you will be in Race Room heaven. Keep up the great work on devloping this game further and keep the large playing base glued to this game. BEST game I had never heard about.

205	1	a	This game is brilliant. Jump from the top of a floating city and score big points for scraping your nose on the sides of the buildings. Tag government buildings and flip off protesters; it's as bizzare as it sounds.

If you go off-course, 'invalid lap' shows and you have to restart. The controls that you start off with are not like the normal WSAD. Instead, its the arrow keys.

But ater a while now i've discovered it is best to wait before commenting, people are'nt always up-to-date with the reported bugs! When so, an update is in the making!  As for the gameplay Depending on your in-game graphic settings, the experience can be altered by adding more or less options.Play Single Player (multiple modes available) to practice when your friends are offline!  When online? Just battle each other :)  My gamegear (min recommanded for medium to high experience): - Intel core i5 - Nvidia GTX 760 - Memory: 16 gb - Logitech G29 DF racewheel and pedals - Crew ChiefV4 - Some additional packs from RaceRoom Store

5439	1	a	Truly a brilliant game of cricket. Sure it's not a million pounds ea sports development but it's made with care and imagination ,you might get bored quickly with the commentary Which sounds a bit like that boring bloke on the IPL if you've seen that. But there's a fantastic muted pa system in the background.... So many great features. The realistic approach towards batting, bowling and fielding is one of the biggest assets of this game which no other cricketing game was able to provide till now. Tackling license problem with smart and creative idea is just exceptional and gives a buyer an idea that how much Bigant studios are determined to give the best of this game to the users. In spite of having lack of sponsors and not having a million pounds like EA sports development have they have managed to pull off things in a great manner. However few areas where it needs advancement are Commentary it can put you off, definitely graphics can get better and better, crowd need to be alive and small glitches here and there should be sorted (Like when you get a batsman out it should come out realistic more than often its batman who leaves the ball and it hits the stump which is very rare and is not that realistic in a way.

4983	0	a	I tried this and it failed to impress me. I love racing games and have been playing them for 15 years on PC. I couldn't get my wheel which admittedly is pretty ancient) to work properly, found the cars seemed to have no weight. Looks pretty enough but if actual gameplay sucks then its not worth the price of admission. In my humble opinion this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant but old Papyrus Grand Prix Legends, which is still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten years on. I can't recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time giving it a try but the free content is pretty limited and should really be described as a Demo not Free To Play. Disappointed as so many race games seem to be aimed at the console market, Codemasters used to produce some fun driving games but now fill their arcade racers with fantasy city tracks and boring drift courses, Isn't that what NFS was for? Perhaps I'll have better luck with AC. Meanwhile back to Grand Prix Legends ha ha. I also found the menu system here really clunky and poorly thought out, I quickly got bored with the free content and wasn't charmed enough to risk good money on this yet . I know it is still in development but it still needs a lot of work to get it sweet.

4264	1	a	Let me just say right out of the gate, this game is awful. First, the bad...  The starting controls are awful, the game begins by dumping you in a random match where changing said controls is.. impossible, the menus are meh and a few other basic gamey 'things' aren't up to par. However, once you get past these little hiccups, you're going to have a rocking good time. I love this game because it's a simple, easy game to play with friends. The characters are great, I love the designs, and the levels have a good curve of easy to challenging. Getting this game was a great investment, but you'll want to find someone else on your friends list to play it with you. While there are public matches out there, beware, you will get stomped.

243	1	a	While this game is a blast overall, it's even a greater experience in VR with its excellent Oculus Rift support since the days of the DK1, later adapted for the DK2 in full and updated regularly. I've actually gone as far as launching this game in VR during my work breaks. It's one of the best games to have a VR beginner try, as the feeling of falling is not only comfortable, but oddly relaxing and somewhat addicting over time.  A great, challenging concept overall. Excellent sense of humor. Driving sound tracks. Prime time VR support. Much safer than actually jumping off buildings in a wingsuit.
4569	1	a	Bang tidy if you have the hardware to run it and the wallet to fund it (free to play) mmmm? free to try more like. if you want the good stuff, you'll have to pay extra although it is worth it. If you have not got a wheel setup then go elsewhere as this came is hard to use with a pad and you will not be competitive.

It's pretty great if you're under the influence of anything. Also good at over stimulating yourself. The achievements aren't really tough, but take real long to get.  Good for a distraction, I liked the soundtrack, as well as the bogus jokes.  For it's price it's got a lot of replay time.  It's a stellar cliff-jumping experience, if you're not into the real thing.

4278	1	a	Speed Runners is anamazing game that grasps so many concepts.When you look at the game and watch some videos about it you think that it will get boring, YOUR WRONG. This game is amazing because of how many characters there are and how competitive it is when you do ranked matches. If you don't like competitive matches then you can always just do quickplay which is casual and is fun. I love in the game how it has so many characters and all of them are so unique. I also like how there are so many different power ups this allowing you to be almost blown up but then to grab somebody and replace them in your spot. As you get better in the game you master the ways of shortcuts allowing you to be dead last and then end up being first. Trust me get this game. Even though this game is worth the 16 dollars this type of game should be 10 dollars. If you are unsure about buying then wait and get it on the next sale it is worth it. 9.99/10 because of price
4915	0	a	By far the worst racing game ever the controls are terrible and there is no AI racing only time attack modes for what i can see in the game. All i have to say is go play the forza, grid and grand turismo series they are way better then this steaming pile of crap.

4775	1	a	Not a bad game considering it is free to play. A few sound effects aren't easy on the ears but runs smooth so far. Forza is still better but this is free. It is still in an early state so there is still room for improvement.
4581	1	a	Brought this with some hesitation , going by some of the old reveiws i thought this might not be that good,but took a chance , Well i am glad i did , the handling is great , the force feedback works really well, (brought dtm 2105 and wtcc 2014), The sound is amazing best car sound in a game yet, Graffics on par with asseto corsa not as good as project cars, i have both those games so at this satge only about a hours game play i feel its control and grit of racing could make this one of the best race simms yet, Raceroom have come along way and is listening to the people who buy their games. The only negative is their price structure.  I will come back in a week or two to give a better review , but for now ill say well worth buying especially the packs i brought.  ps dont go by the free demo , no where near as good as the new stuff in my view,

The fast paced and easy to pick up gameplay provides decent fun for a while, but horrendous UI make selecting levels a chore and there's no real incentive to go back and replay levels. A difficult recommendation, especially at it's regular price.

Definately the best version so far, but thats only because of the tiny bit of extra content. Each of these games costs around $30, so if you have previous versions it's not worth getting this one. If you don't then I'd say wait for a sale; this game is NOT worth $30.

330	0	a	First of all I want to say as for an INDI Game thank GOD that this game came in a HumbleBundle and I didnât have to pay for it. When I first looked at this game I though, oooo a free fall game might be cool but is like SLOW MOTION FALLING. To be honest I played it for about 5 minutes you might think, obviously not enough time to judge a game.   Well â¥â¥â¥â¥ it the game is bad I give it 13/100.
536	0	a	Christ this game has not aged well. Dodgy physics and little-to-no controller support really kills it for me, stick to newer Trials games I'd suggest
4286	1	a	Gave me a virus, Called tech support, Got scammed.  Would do it again 10/10  
5527	1	a	This is the best version of Bloodbowl. Bloodbowl 2 may have the graphics, however this has many more teams, and less issues. i would recommend this over the newer version, and a bargain at the price for any bloodbowl fan, despite the bugs, and issues with matchmaking. However this does still feel like an incomplete release
1094	1	a	Careful, don't play with someone you like. Especially your family. You'll hate them.  Better than pewdiepies youtube sim
5327	0	a	Fun game when working, but really messy and is often not able to connect to the server, meaning you can't play it. Plus my player was lost on the server so i had to restart after 7 hours of playing. Not worth it.

370	1	a	So this isn't really a huge leap from the previous one as far as I can tell. Take it with a grain of salt, I only played just a few minutes and didn't feel like I needed to delve too far into it. The biggest improvement I could see was the hit box was shrunk and VR support was added. How many of you actually have a VR device yet? Exactly, neither does anyone else. But the hitbox improvement means you can really thread the needle that much better.  Much of the look is the same though: menus, geometry, effects, pretty much everything. The only difference here is what appears to be newer and more interesting shaders. All-in-all, it's the same as before, and that's a little disappointing. I still recommend it because at it's core, it's fun. However, if you already bought the first one, you might want to wait for this one on sale, or just skip it altogether (unless you really want that VR support). If you didn't get the first one, then this is an easy buy.

5293	1	a	A nice rpg/soccer game for people who grew up with soccer games of 80s and early 90s  Pros: + Gameplay (Matches): Similar to Sensible Soccer serie of Amiga era. Sensible Soccer gameplay was great compared to Kick Off 2 since KO2 was too fast for my taste. (Hint: Teenagers and Fifa era players stay away, you wont get the fun of it.) + Gameplay (Rpg/Sim): Transferring yourself, training stuff, buying things and managing personal life adds a great flavour to the game. + Art: Actual matches looks too similar to Sensible World of Soccer with great animation, crowd and weather effect add-on.  Cons: - Sound: Music is bad. Sfx does its part on matches but could have been far better. - DRM system: Signing on to a server (which fails to connect most of the time) is not a good idea (PS: You dont have to be signed in to play). - Needs more improvement and rpg flavour (maybe NSS6?)  Final verdict: I've spent many fun hours with the game. It was nice remembering my teenage years which wasted on soccer games :) NSS needs its next installment. So far 7/10

574	1	a	The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.
5525	1	a	Incredibly steep learning curve. Oh yes indeedy. If, like me, you have never played blood bowl on the tabletop then be warned, you will be smashed down harder than you have ever been smashed down by a video game.   Despite that, once you get the hang of it, it does become very fun. You might even win and those wins, oh boy those glorious wins. Campaign mode is the best underdog story you'll ever see (with your team as the underdog) and story mode will test you to the point you rage quit over and over and over.  Killed a bloodthirster with a skink 10/10.

5038	0	a	I downloaded this game with the hope that it would be a decent play. After dicking about registering with far too much information, I managed to navigate the horrific menu and get into game. I was then greeted with a lovely CTD, no problem, I'll check my drivers and try again. After several attempts and a bit of research I tried running in windowed mode, which worked! I finally get in game and then the real disappointment set in, the handling is terrible, the physics (what physics) are broken and it just doesn't feel right; you shouldn't have to pretty much switch the enging off to negotiate a slight bend in the road. Even using a controller, it appears that the controls are pretty much off or flat out, which brings me to my next point. This game just isn't optimised for controller use, seriously, controlling a cursor with a stick just shouldnt' even be considered by any devs any more.   Other people seem to be complaining about the content. I haven't had the patience to fully explore it yet, although I will keep it installed and give it another chance on another day.

5493	0	a	I've been looking for a good cricket game on the PC for a long, long time and with Don Bradman Cricket 14 I initially thought I'd found it.    The Good    Bowling feels more natural than any other game I've played. Gone are target recticules that you place where you want the ball to land. In their place is a method that requires timing and finesse, and feels an awful lot more like you are actually bowling.  Batting strokes are well implemented, with the full range available to you including fancy tricks such as reverse sweeps and ramp shots. Footwork is as important to batting as it is in real life too, and if you get this really wrong then it doesn't matter what stroke you choose, you'll still be in trouble.  There are a wide variety of ways of playing the game, with all formats included. They've also got around the issue of not having any licenses by allowing you to automatically download the highest rated user mods, which quickly adds in the most important national and international teams and players. I was particularly pleased that they've included a Career mode, allowing you to take a single player all the way from local obscurity to international success.  This all sounds great right? However, after a little while a few significant issues came to light that mean I just can't make a general recommendation, as much as I want to.    The Bad    There is a massive leap in difficulty between the Amateur and Professional skill levels when you're batting. To me, this is the biggie. At Amateur level I can easily score centuries with my wet behind the ears rookie without even trying. It's so forgiving, I don't really need to concentrate much on what I'm doing at all. Switch to the next difficulty up though, and there is an enormous difficulty spike, which try as I might I just can't get over.  Don't get me wrong, I like that the game can be made that tough. Hell, I'd love to be in a position where I can work towards playing at Professional difficulty. Unfortunately, the grind and the way the game punishes you for even the slightest mistakes at that difficulty just saps any enjoyment I have, leaving me with no desire to continue banging my head against a brick wall.   There has to be some way of easing you in, some kind of halfway house that helps you grow into it. I've spent hours in the nets and in practice matches, and the feedback it gives you is helpful, but you don't get that help once you step into an actual match that matters, and the small margin for error has often left me wondering what I did wrong that got my batsman out.  Another gripe I have is the reliance on red, green and yellow to show whether a delivered ball is short, on a length or full. I know I'm in the minority here, but being partially colourblind makes this even harder. It's not bad enough that it is a deal breaker for me, but some other way of showing the difference, or even just being able to customise the colours would be really helpful.  Then there's fielding. There are a few issues here. The first is that the game doesn't provide a fielding 'radar' when you're batting, and the only way of seeing how the opposition have set the field is by going to first person view and looking around. In general I love it when a dev is this committed to realism. The problem here is I think they've gone too far. Having to do this every single time you think they might have made a fielding change is a massive drag, and becomes a real pain.  Another problem with this is the way they've implemented the camera for tracking the ball and helping you judge whether a run is on or not. A lot of the time it works, but I've lost count of when the camera angle chosen doesn't show me quickly enough for me to make a decision. In real life you'd be able to glance quickly and make a judgement, but this obviously isn't possible here.     Conclusions    This game is so frustratingly close to being amazing its ridiculous. If I wrote a checklist of all the things I want in a cricket game, this game meets almost all of them. Unfortunately, the few areas it falls short are so important, I just can't make a general recommendation.  However, I can absolutely see there is a section of the market out there that would love this, If you have faster reactions than me and/or a greater tolerance for the grind it takes to make the leap in difficulty the game presents, then go ahead and have a blast.

5054	1	a	Going to change my review to positive. I love the graphics, they are simply the best in the industry. This game take SKILL. I mean that! Not that I have that much, but I'm practicing and getting better a little more and more everyday. Also I think I like the 'BUY AS YOU NEED', model. This way you don't get a bunch of stuff you don't need or want. This applies to cars, tracks and liveries. Seting up a controller takes time and patience. This is definately a game for mature individuals. Not that I am very mature, this game is a good teacher also, what can I say....lol A big thank you for the devolopers!!! I GET IT!!  Peter
5075	0	a	Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game. Let me also say I am not opposed to paying for good quality games. That being said I am a HUGE Iracing fan, which is hands down the best race sim ever made. Iracing is also expensive as each car and each track costs money and it's a subscription service. The differenece here is they are up frnot about what you will need to pay, this game is microtransaction hell. It's very confusing and when you do figure it out your looking at hundreds of dollars. So right there I lost interest, and I didn't even get to the bad joke they call realistic physics. Anyone that thinks this game is realistic has never actually driven a car on a track. If you can play the game with a mouse and keyboard it is not realistic. There is no way you could control a car with a mouse at freeway speeds let alone in a race.

5535	1	a	This game is so much fun. It takes some time and energy to understand what's going on, but there's a deep and engaging system to learn here. Great for anyone who likes sports and wargames. I love all of the variation between the different teams and all of the options available to customize your players as they advance. The fact that they can get permanent injuries and die adds to the suspense.  The company who makes it is shady to have put out so many similar releases just to add extra teams and looks to be even shadier in the future to make people pay for individual teams with the sequel. You might be better off to just buy this complete game rather than get bled over time as they hold back content.
4532	1	a	Don't let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race. It is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored.  Now thats not to say that this game doesn't have flaws. After all what games these days don't have a flaw here and there? The only big flaw for me is that the AI has vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the Devs are working on fixing that issue right now. Online races in this game are a real blast in Get Real mode but first I beg you to log practice time in this mode. Based on the multiplayer races I have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life.  Now the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so Get Real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definately the best mode. Another thing the devs might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want.  In short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try. I mean its free so you've got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you don't like the game but wouldn't you have burned that time gaming anyway?
1511	1	a	This game is the boss. If you are a fan of competive and fun local multiplayer games then very few games match the finess of this title. Its fast, its hectic,there is a fair amount of skill involved and you have a wealth of opportunities to screw your friends over. Its awesome.  The game mechanic and the goal is very simple. You have run , jump and grapple a head of the pack and then extend your lead until all the others are out of the screen. Only thing is, you cant see too much ahead and your friends have got nasty abilities to screw you over with. So good luck and good speed :P  As always with local mp games, 4 is the perfect number of players. Exellent entertainment.  9/10  PS: do yourself a favor and dont play it alone, you will only find it a lesser game than it really is. This game is designed to ruin your relationships and loose frinds over.

5354	1	a	Definately the best cricket game ever (not counting the International Cricket Captain management games, but this probably beats them too). Great career mode where you create player and take control exclusively of him, rather than the whole team. Really nice player and team editor too, and the community creations means it's not a big deal that the game lacks licenses. You can just download pretty good representations from any team you can think of from the cricket academy.

175	1	a	I dislike Dejobaan games, very much. They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality.  On the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!  The objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied.  Surviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash. Lastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.  In summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.
377	1	a	This game features some of the greatest level design I've personally seen. It's also incredibly fast paced and fun. The redesigned levels are excellent, but what really shines are the new levels, all of which are specifically made to be faster than a bullet. 10/10.
4432	0	a	This game has no AI, and no single-player gameplay. I do *NOT* recommend this game! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

362	0	a	It's fun but not funny, although it tries to be. The gameplay is as repetitive as gameplay can get, but somewhat satisfying for a round or two at a time. Keep in mind, this is one of those games where you keep doing exactly the same thing over and over again in hopes of getting a better highscore. This is attractive to many, but a no-go for others. I would not buy it at full price, but if you find it heavily discounted or as part of a bundle, play it.

4168	1	a	My favorite game of the year!  This game seems simplistic at first but after a while, I discovered that the controls are soooo deep! You can literally spend hundred of hours perfecting your skills and you could still improve.  My favorite aspect is the weapons available. It feel a bit like Mario Kart and I love it!  The only thing I dislike is that workshop maps are part of the official ranked mode. The game should offer 2 different ranked mode: 1-Officials 2-Workshops  BUY THIS GAME

3134	1	a	Holy crap have I enjoyed this game. Many people are right. It's like mario kart and Smash bros. mixed into a single game. This is perfect when you gather with friends and just play for a while. Although when you try to go competitive it just takes you to the moon. The only things I don't like are the community and the fact that it is not very well known. The community doesn't focus much on the fun of it and will scold you for using items in online play. It's not perfect but it is too much fun.
1105	1	a	You know, this game turned out to be a lot more fun than I excpected. It may not look great on first sight, 'What is this, a 2D runner game?'. Bad mistake. I had A LOT of fun with this game when playing with friends. Maps are well made and the game will make you shout at your friends. If you have friends to play this with you, totally recommended.  If you don't its still great ( you can search for people to play this online ), maybe wait for a sale to get it.

When I consider the possibility of me playing this game, I consider one of the possible possibilities not determined by a foreign cause, but by my own being instead. As someone who avoids death would avoid a precipice, I avoid anguish by nihiliating the possibility of me deciding to play this game anymore.   AaAaAAvoid this game!!!

48	0	a	If your the type of person who would jump off a cliff if someone asked you to, this might be the game for you.  The game is all about base jumping on a acid city replica of Boston, Massachusetts, some natural mountain landscapes and even places which look like they have been ripped out of the movie '5th element'.  The object is simple 'don't become a flattened pancake'. The other objective is to get a 5 star high score so you can earn 'teeth' the in-game currency (that's what we going to use when we run out of paper?) which you can spend to unlock more levels. Each level you complete you get treated to some funny news announcements or instructional videos. One video teaches you the do's and don'ts of accidental time travel, another video teaches you grandma's secret ingredient in her choc chip cookies being human remains and the list goes on. Most of these are either novel or groan out loud weakly executed attempts of humor.  There are a number of ways to build up your score. The main one is to kiss a building (get so close you can plant your smackers on it) and to hug them (free fall down at a constant close distance), but you can also do other things such as give a two fingered salute to red spectators (Mr Bean is Professional at that) and a thumbs up to blue ones, you can also graffiti tag certain buildings on your way down, smash into a bird, hit various glass colored plates for money, or perform the very tricky thread a needle move.  Most of the time you will struggle to do any of this as you will be too busy in a g spin of certain death since the controls are ridiculously hard to master. Hit a building and you become a human pinball against concrete flippers. I dare you to smoke a joint and try this with rift. You will be vomiting up your lungs as your characters nasal passage begins to smell the back of his brain thanks to the constant concrete jungle your treated to.  With all these things going on and it's unique game style you would think that this would be thumbs up material. It ISN'T. The game gets tedious and laborious fast. It gets too difficult too quickly, you might get 5 stars on two of the levels if your lucky. While it is possible to get 5 stars on the other levels, still you will soon discover that you will need to spend this life time, and your next reincarnated life time, or your next eternal life on a paradise earth, or your next life time being burnt alive forever and ever, but look on the bright side least you don't have to get five stars on this anymore.  The other reason it's thumbs down is because there is another version on Steam which is exactly the same, but contains more content with more 'polished' controls since it uses a different game engine. The other game is called 'AaAaAAAA!!! - for the awesome'. So if your interested 'Go! .... Go Jump off a cliff!.... What are you waiting for??? .... JUMP!!!!'
3089	1	a	Very Good Game!

Bought it awhile ago on a sale and finally had enough free time that I thought I could learn this game and boy am I glad I did. My 24hr time at the writing of this is from 2 days of playing thats how instantly addicted I got to this.   Just finished a game in campaign Goblins vs Orks(me) First turn I am kicking off Get blitz KO their pogoer in the free blitz turn get 2 TDs by turn 6 by halftime all their secret weapon players have been removed by ref and they have 2 injured players so 5 man out for game they only have 11 players left by turn 14 I get 3rd TD and one more is injured and one more KO score is 3-0 Uru-Krush wins again  23 races how can you go wrong?! way better than any real sport game I have ever played. Just takes about 8 hours to get the hang of playing and then fun times ahead.

568	0	a	At the time of this review the price is currently Â£16.99 ...... whoever ramped up the price that high should be ashamed of themselves. This game is worth no more than Â£0.99 in sale.  Shame ...  Could have been up there with the Trials games.  It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.  When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.  I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!  Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.  See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:         Monster Trucks Nitro&nbsp;

Playable even with just a gamepad (though you really need at least this, not mouse and keyboard), with the correct settings - visit the Sector 3 forum for help wth controller profiles. Also realtively cheap, if you just focus on a particular class - the ADAC GT Masters pack is good value, comes with all the cars and tracks you need for a championship.

510	1	a	Redlynx Trials is one of those games which is easy to pick up but very hard to stop playing. You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity. You're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun. For added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.

So I'm familiar with the overall brutality of these simulators.). Then again, it's been ages since I last played a simulation racing game (At least 5 years worth of rust on me); and now with more accurate simulation settings as such, ugh. Made a decent personal time on Get Real (without shattering my car or breaking the engine), but I needed Novice to get a better handle of when to brake overall for next time (I can survive, at least, but I'm nowhere near leaderboard-ready yet at time of post). You botch the braking anywhere (especially blind corners and chicanes), and you can mess up your entire lap, or go off course, or 180-1080 your car, and invalidate your lap (no shortcutting like I used to in GT and NFS; also no more using other cars as guardrails on certain turns either :( ).  Not stopping me from playing this more, and maybe getting an expansion pack or two to have more cars to drive with and more tracks to drive on. However, as precise I can get with a keyboard, I lack pressure sensitivity in order to draw a bead more precisely; so my skills are a tad biased (better with a gamepad for these kinds of games). +20.5 seconds (1:43.334 on a track) from 1st place (Leaderboards, that is) is not good enough for me. I gotta shave off more time... If I can clear +10 seconds from 1st, then I'll be a happier driver. +5, and I'll be impressed with myself. This game is not easy, because it's less game, and more simulator. The physics are quite familiar and rather unforgiving (like reality would be), especially in Get Real (and that mode also permits fine-tuning your car's aerodynamics, gear-shift ratios, and just about everything else under the hood; and tire wear is also quite unforgiving too, so keep those in check along with your fuel). If you seek a casual racing experience, I suggest a different game, lest you want to lose some keyboards or controllers in frustration. It can become casual, however, if you're a pro at this kind of stuff.  Been awhile since I've had such a detailed racing experience, so thumbs up on bringing back my memories of Gran Turismo (In due time, I'll see you guys on the NÃ¼rburgring Course (up to 10 minutes per-lap, and that's with skill and a good car; BIIIG Course (28.265 km long). An ultimate test for drivers, both skill and endurance. Look it up. In GT4, my best time was about 9 minutes, or slightly less than that, and even so, I had difficulties there.)). However, only other (personal) setback is that your real name is visible (security and such, I guess). Just a friendly heads-up for anyone else that feels like crashing into walls and cars non-stop (eg- signing up to play). The heads-up is also for those that would end up broadcasting, and still want to remain anonymous; I suggest going somewhere else for privacy while broadcasting publicly.  I can imagine how this will play with Oculus support. Speaking of which, the graphics are 10/10; runs smoothly with high settings, even for older machines like mine, and the graphics are a beauty overall; the sound is also rather pretty too, for you gearheads. If you want an immersive driving experience, or want to relive an A-Spec GT experience, I recommend this. Plus, it's free to play. Despite the 10GB download (mostly locked content), what's not to love? I suggest building some experience and skill before investing in any new cars/tracks/DLC packs. At least, know you can handle it first, before burning your money on this, and then giving it a negative review from poor judgement user-side.  See you on the leaderboards, and by chance, on the tracks.
5430	1	a	Game doesn't even run.  As soon as you push the start button the game just exits. What's worse is that I had to stay on the title screen for 5 minutes to be able to write this review.  Update:  The game runs in Steam offline mode, thanks for the update.  Second update:  Please don't look at the time played as I have to play the game in offline mode for now.  Awesome game, really enjoying it. Nice to have a decent cricket game again. Thanks to the developers for their quick and accurate response.  Game has a good tutorial system to teach you how to play, so far would give it a 8.5\10.  Last update:  Game now works in Steam online mode, thanks BigAnt!

Gotten one or two '5' star levels and are swearing that JUST ONE MORE TRY and you'll BEAT THIS ONE LEVEL.  ....the music is to die for by the way, I WISH I could buy the OST.

5513	1	a	This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it.   For starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.  If you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.  So what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.  There are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick.   I also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together.   So, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll.

4681	1	a	***EDIT-2015*** If you had told me at the time I first wrote this review that things were just about to turn around and that this would become one of my favorite games of 2015 (and hopefully later) I would have had you committed.  But that's exctly what happened. Big shake ups went on at Simbin and the company is now called 'Sector 3'. But more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.  I have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. I will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.  -------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW-------------------------------    It pains me not to reccomend this game. I own every single Simbin game ever published and I still race in a GTR2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. Every week, year around.  Naturally, GTR2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.  We waited for GTR3 for a long time and we were very excited by Simbin early previews of their new sound engine. It was truly something to behold. Then GTR3 fizzled and Raceroom Racing Experience came out as a 'free to play' game. Initially I was quite impressed. The sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. The graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the Race07 series). The car handling was OK. Nothing too advanced, but passable.  Even as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for GTR2.  After the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an 'Apex hunt' game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. However, since it was a new game I even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of AI cars and multiplayer.   While we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, R3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.  Then time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless 'liveries'. The promised AI is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.  The choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.  Frankly, if I could go back in time I would buy only the Zacspeed Ford and the additional hillclimb track. The free cars are OK, with the BMW hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. Considering that the BMW and the hillclimb are free, I would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. Maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. All the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.  There is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly.   To me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. It could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what I ever paid for GTR2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. But no more. They released a DTM game that suffers from the same limitations (it has AI, but it is very weak) and for the first time since I ahve been simracing I did not buy it.  Maybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as GTR2 offered almost 10 years ago. Maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised 'Adaptive' AI will really be what they promised. Maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. Maybe.  When that happens, buy this game. Until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.

4566	1	a	This is honestly a really solid racing sim.  If all you want to do is burn around a track trying to beat your previous time and you get immense satisfaction from the realism of the graphics and sound, then this is an amazing game.  If you came here looking for a polished product; leave now. You will not find anyhting like GT or Assetto Corsa for free. I can assure you. It has no multiplayer yet or even a race mode but I just enjoy driving around the circuit in the various default cars admiring the engine sounds and brake squeaks.  TL;DR - This is about the EXPERIENCE, not the progression

5396	1	a	If you're going to tie the great Sir Donald Bradman to your game, you better not mess it up. Thankfully, Big Ant studios have done anything but and have possibly made the best cricket game ever. The detail that has gone into this game is quite remarkable. From the sheer number of teams, camera angles, real-life aspects of the game (such as reviewing decisions), to the career mode, batting, bowling and fielding mechanics, etc. The whole game feels polished, despite a few minor glitches here and there.  By far my most favourite aspect of this game is the career mode. You play through twenty seasons as you take a 16 year old cricketer through the ranks from domestic cricket to the career defining call from the international selectors. Whether you get selected by your international team depends entirely on your performances on the field (it's tougher than you'd think, trust me). In fact the whole game is tougher than I expected, long gone are the days of the mannequin-style modelled cricketers belting the ball out of the park every delivery. If you try that in this game, you're guaranteed to fail fairly quickly.   Pros:  * Career mode * Online mode * Great selection of teams from the past and present * Varied amount of camera angles * Great graphics * Good commentary * Polished mechanics * More challenging than previous cricket titles. (There is, at the time of this review, no radar to indicate where the fielders are when batting or bowling. However, when batting you can briefly look around in first-person mode, which is a nice touch.  Cons:  * Licencing: No real names or brands, except Bradman, although you can get the real names of players easily by updating the teams from the community. * Can be glitchy, especially with the fielding, and strange animations at times.  * Clunky menu  Conclusion: I did not purchase this game without consideration - Â£35.99, or your regional equivalent, is a lot of money, but this game has been well worth the purchase in my opinion. A must for cricket fans.
3901	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master, fast-paced platforming bliss. Oh, there's also Bionic Commando-style grappling hooks, Mario Kart-style item pickups, and Meat Boy-style 'any mistakes are your own' controls. If you've ever enjoyed a platformer before, there's no reason for you to not buy this game.

5299	1	a	NSS5 is a football life 'simulator' where you create a player and play football in any one of a ridiculous number of nations and your national team too.  The teams are based on real teams, so anyone with basic footballing knowledge should be able to tell that Stamford FC are Chelsea and that Gunners are Arsenal. Your starting team determines your starting skill and wage, your skill can be improved by doing training sessions that range from boring to infuriatingly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥zzle. When not training or playing you are either improving relationships with people you don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about so that you don't become depressed, drinking when you do become depressed, or failing to get girlfriends because they dont like your lifestyle. This part of the game hits close to home and makes me cry.  When you do get big money you can use it to buy stuff to impress women and buy PEDs which make you a better player, you can also abuse sponsorship deals for stat increasing boots and other gear. When you level up and start scoring for fun you can then demand funny money to spend on more pointless stuff that no-one would ever buy. Oh a gold chain for Â£2000? I forgot it was 1988 and I was Slick Rick.  The game has some always online feature that allows you to play with other players' avatars in matches which despite the fact that I play for a 4th division Scottish team always seems to be 6'8' black guys named Devarious Le'shintrella. The servers are also complete â¥â¥â¥ and break all the time meaning that you just play against AI characters instead.  Game is fairly fun but the fact that I always wanted to be a footballer and have a girlfriend mean that playing this game makes me self-harm and drink a lot of alcohol in real life whilst I force my player to be an alcoholic too because I never got to be a footballer and don't have a girlfriend.  Don't play if you're depressed.  P.s. if you're reading this and a girl pls add me on steam I promise to send gifts &lt;3

5472	1	a	I can say this thousand times but it will be less to appreciate this game. After a long time a true cricketing experience coming our way. Over all gaming expreince is new and refreshing and it makes you think about everything. There were always issues with bowling in cricket games and most of them were really bad. But in this one is a excellent approach  applied by Big Ant Games. Not only bowling looks and feeling interesting and fun, but batting is not that easy to do.  You need to play as a cricketer to enjoy the whole experience. But there are still some things which can be made better in terms of over all gaming expereice. I am sure they will be patching the bugs and make some more adjustment to enhance the game. A must buy if you have been playing crickets games all over your life. This is what you are waiting for.   Also please show your support to the team at Big Ants they have done a great job.

197	1	a	One of a couple of base jumping games available on Steam. It's nothing special, fall while scoring points by staying close to objects without hitting them and trying to pickup extras where you can. More points equals more stars, more stars equals more teeth and teeth can be used to unlock extra levels.  No surprises or plot, just straight forward action. Not a bad game to switch your brain off to.

I just had no clue on how to do it and would be doing pretty bad. Then I slowly got better and boy is it satisfying to start to win things.    This game makes the racing and winning so enjoyable! Normally in the Dirt series the winning just doesn't feel great but in this game it feels like I accomplished something. This is pretty much the biggest reason why I am reccomending this game.

1510	1	a	This game is the boss. If you are a fan of competive and fun local multiplayer games then very few games match the finess of this title. Its fast, its hectic,there is a fair amount of skill involved and you have a wealth of opportunities to screw your friends over. Its awesome.  The game mechanic and the goal is very simple. You have run , jump and grapple a head of the pack and then extend your lead until all the others are out of the screen. Only thing is, you cant see too much ahead and your friends have got nasty abilities to screw you over with. So good luck and good speed :P  As always with local mp games, 4 is the perfect number of players. Exellent entertainment.  9/10  PS: do yourself a favor and dont play it alone, you will only find it a lesser game than it really is. This game is designed to ruin your relationships and loose frinds over.

4479	1	a	BETA Review.    UPDATE6/17/15------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well, the game keeps getting better, and better. It certainly has taken some time to get here, but the game and its content very, very good. The recent patch has made a number of much needed updates and optimizations. The dedicated servers has seen the online community grow, Tracks like Shanghai and Macau and cars like WTCC 2014 have really set this sim apart.  I have no idea how this game has such a low comunity score....well I do, its the F2P model...which really isn't F2P....I would really give it a go, the cars and tracks are some of the best done of all the big sims out there, iRacing, Pcars, AC, imo.  UPDATE 11/01/14---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So I bought a wheel G27, and am really enjoying the game. Much better with a wheel, although a controller was decent and has some advantages, but it is really not the way to go with a sim.  The updates that have been done have massively improved the game: Time of day, updated Force Feedback, track and car physics improved(check to see if which cars and tracks are updated). It still has a way to go, but is so much better.   The WTCC cars are a blast. The ADAC GT cars are big heavy beasts. DTM is somewhere in the middle. Once the game gets a championship(pit stops and tires) and MP gets out of Alpha there will be a very, very solid game here.  I would definitely check it out...it is starting to take up a chunk of my life! ------------------------------ I am new to 'sim' racing games. Always loved a good race game in my youth (a while ago now), Super Monaco GP, Daytona, Ridge Racer etc... I bought Ridge Racer Unbounded for a couple of bucks and forgot how much I enjoyed racing games. The drifting was so absurd, but it was fun. I started looking at other types of racing games and saw this one and it was Free to play. UGHH. No harm no foul trying a F2P game. It doesn't cost anything. I figured I would download the game, play it for a week and then be done with itâ¦   Well fast forward a couple of weeks; I am having a great time. Using an Xbox controller, this took a long time to calibrate correctly. It was quite a challenge at first, I like difficult games. I really want to upgrade to a wheel... but patience! I don't really understand most peopleâs complaints with the game, it seems most people/reviews say the game would be really good if this or that was fixed. A majority were very minor complaints but together resulted in poor reviews. The core of the game is strong, but there are issues with the game. I can forgive them at this point since it is still in Beta and I haven't spent a penny on it. The game has potential to be a LOT of fun as areas are improved and features added, but it will be interesting to see if the studio can get this title to that point - With the restructuring of the studio, hopefully they continue to improve the game at an acceptable pace! :)  Oddly this was one time where the F2P model worked in my favor. I can see someone who wants all the goods to be annoyed with this model, but with common sense and waiting for sales you can probably pay for the tracks and cars you want and get out of it with little spent. If you want it all or a lot, the model fails. You would think they would offer tracks and cars in packages for a reasonable savings. Maybe they will change the F2P model a bit to allow for both ways to owning the complete game? I am just waiting for the DTM Experience to go on sale and I will definitely buy it!!!

4426	0	a	this is not a game, is a bad DLC for bloodbowl sold pretending it to be a full game. Which it is not.  this is a complete crap for many reasons.  1) It's an online-only game, no single player or AI of any sort, there's not even a tutorial, nothing. you sit in the lobby waiting for a player to show up for hours, and when it does, the connection is bugged and the challenge system doesn't work.  2) the game itself is just bloodbowl with walls. good? nope. because the nice and functional free camera that worked as a charm in bloodbowl, here is cramped and unfunctional. you will not understand a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of what is going on in the match, because there will always be a wall in your way.  3) the game comes with a super-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ third-party DRM which gives you a total of 3 activations. this means that if you uninstall this game 3 times, the 4th time you can just throw it in the toilet, because it won't work.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥. GO PLAY BLOODBOWL INSTEAD.

5167	0	a	Good game, not bad that you can initially get it for free, but it has a classic part that you really need to buy the pack to make the game worth it, far too much is not available in the free part. Gameplay is not quite as I expected and I feel that GT Legends by simbin and even GTR Evolution played much better, this has a real arcade feel not simulation.   All in all, not bad for a bash but certainly wont buy the pack to unlock everything.

322	0	a	AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome played for 2 hours first impressions.  AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is actually 2 games in one. The original game which is all the 'A's and the sequal which is called Awesome. It's a shame really as I was hoping to do a really crappy pun about the noise you will make when playing it. Actually it turns out that pun is pretty accurate as you will be saying both playing it :)  Before I start talking about this game I just want to let you guys know that I am not really the best person to talk about sports games. I don't really like sports and I tend to find the games equally as tedious. However there have been a couple of exceptions over the years and this is thankfully one of them. I think I've realised what it is now. The last sports game I really enjoyed was Mario Golf. I find Golf a bit of a mind blowing game, the only enjoyable thing I can think of is that its a nice walk on a pleasant day, but to watch it on tv is something I've never been able to understand, but like this game mario golf adds a lot of fun nice extras and it provides enough of a distraction. A for the A is similar. While you are jumping to possibly your death there are many things you can do. Your character will thumbs up any fans watching and make naughty gestures to those who protest, you get additional points for being a wreckless moron with a death wish by scraping your chin against buildings as you fall and you can spray graffiti too. Wait how does that even work? Never mind. You can also slam through glass plates for extra points. At the end you deploy your parachute and try to land in a small circle for bonus points which is a lot harder than it sounds as the parachute controlls terribly. Then you are graded, usually very poorly.  Holy crap is it hard though! You will find many hours of gameplay in this if its the kind of thing that you enjoy. I'm sure if you search youtube you will see people raging about it. You need to gain a high grade in order to gain teeth which is the in game currency to unlock the next level. However you only get teeth for gaining a better rank so there is a lot of grind. I have heard people complain that it is repetitive but it's a sporty game, of course its repetitive.   This game has a great sense of humour too, it is full of comedic parts and although a lot of it didn't work for me it's nice to see them there.  So after this positive review why am I not recommending it? Well...I feel bad for not doing so but the trouble is when I think about my friend circle, I can't think of anyone who would like it. It's something that I feel you should take a look at but it would require a lot of dedication to keep playing through it. The difficulty is incredibly high, and just because its hard doesn't make it negative is a rule I live by, but this is almost trapformer hard, I can see people getting really angry at it. It is kinda funny but it's a bit samey and the parachute controls will really wind you up. I understand why they made that part difficult but if you are falling for 4 5 maybe 6 minutes and you miss the circle by a pixel then you will be tearing your hair out.  I think this might be the sort of thing that works better on the tablet and indeed there is a tablet version, this seems to be the sort of thing you try and master slowly over several months while you are multitasking in the bathroom. This game feels a little bit in the wrong era. If we were still in the 'xtreme' 90s it may have fit in a little better. Of course if you enjoy base jumping in real life (you crazy madman!) then feel free to ignore all of this and play your heart out!  I see this game being absolutely perfect for its niche, like I say, the completionist extreme sports fan will gleefully be able to spend hours and hours maxing out everything this game has to offer, and good luck to him!  I bet its freaking awesome with the occulus though! If I ever get one I will promise to rewrite this review!

572	1	a	I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c itâs worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....

5520	1	a	Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.  Much of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.  My favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result.   Blood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an 'RNG game with a mix of strategic elements'. Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win.   Which brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it.   But that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.  One last thing to note is the 'Chaos' edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience.

4498	1	a	I've never written a review on steam before. I have 2 kids and I hardly have time to wipe my â¥â¥â¥ because I have to wipe theirs. I also have a stressful full time job. Because of that, and because my favorite games are racing games, I went on the hunt for a great racing game to use as therapy.  Assetto Corsa: I tried to like it. I really did. But it just wasn't for me. It's not a complete game, the environments feel dead, it felt slow, there weren't as many tracks as there are in other games, and it just bored me. I returned it before I took my morning dump.  PCars: This game is sexy af but the the ffb is an afterthought. I also hated that there is no championship mode available. In all honestly, it felt like a rushed simcade game. I did appreciate the graphics and variety of tracks, but the actual driving did not grab my attention. I didnt feel like I was a race car driver. The half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one player mode, and nearly optionless career mode was very Star Wars Battlefront-esque by Electronic Sharts. I blame this microwave, insant gratification generation of subhumans for that game and this one for letting developers ravage them in this manner, although battlefront is much worse than PCars.  This game: Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. The driving in this game is ridiculous. The driving alone is so intense because of the physics engine and amazing ffb, that within one minute I was sold. You can feel it when you mess up, and when you're about to. That makes its so rewarding to run a good race or to recover/prevent a fishtail (which these cars do readily). The graphics are nice, not PCars level, but definitely pretty. The game also runs smoothly on my computer. I love the presentation and the tracks feel alive, but maybe its because you have to focus so hard to place! Last but most brilliant is the sound. My God the sound. The sound is the icing on the cake of the immersion this game provides. This game is the truth, and I'll go as far as to say it's my favorite racing game ever. Also, people talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ about f2p, but this is a reasonable f2p model because they have discounts for bulk purchases and you can save money by buying what you like. In sum, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the other games. This game is the real deal. The only cons for me is you can't set the length of the race by laps, only time (â¥â¥â¥â¥ you for that Sector), and the cars do an automatic 1080 if someone bumps you or you lose traction. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid the way these cars spin but I guess you cant be perfect. But literally, a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing spectator could fart in the stands and you'll go â¥â¥â¥â¥ing carouseling into a hotdog stand and last place.

4453	1	a	I play Racing Sims now for over 25 years and I can say, I had pretty much all of them including the more recent Titles like Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Automobilista etc. When RaceRoom 'R3E' was released 3 years ago it was terrible. I think this was when most of the Sim Racer tried the game and never touched it again. BUT over the last 12 Month the Game became a very solid, very pretty, INCREDIBLY GOOD sounding and very immersive Racing Experience with a nice selection of Tracks and an AMAZING variety of Cars. Sure if you want to own every track and every single car it can be kind of expensive, but look out for Deals (Easter Special 50% off, Black Friday All-in-One 49â¬ etc) and/or buy the vRP directly on the RaceRoom Store and its a lot cheaper. Also you only need 1 car (~â¬2,99,-) of a class (GT3 for example) in order to race against the whole field of ATM 13 different GT3 cars. Not like Assetto Corsa where you need every single car pack ! The Online Eperience is still a bit ruff around the edges, but the very small Developer Team works hard, fixes regulary and keeps adding new features. They also keep updating older cars to lift them to the latest physics models which I really appreciate. Every time I play R3E it puts a big smile on my face in a most positive way !

4098	1	a	A return to what games are supposed to be, addictive and just fun.  Speedrunners is a wonderful return to the fun platforming days of the NES. This is a quick to learn, yet difficult to master game that is simply just fun to play, and can be enjoyed in just a few minutes.   Essentially, the crux of the game is to just run and beat your competitors by being the last one still running. However, there is much the game and other players can throw at you to insure that is not always as simple as it sounds.  Gameplay is a wonderful mash-up of old-school NES platformers. Gameplay can best be described as a mix of Super Metroid, Bionic Commando and Mario Kart all rolled into one. You and three other racers (bots, online or even local games) charge through dozens of different levels jumping, ducking, sliding, avoiding boxes, swinging on grappling hooks, and shooting different weapons at other racers. In addition, the screen itself starts to slowly get smaller and you must maximize your speed and minimize mistakes. Game winners are determined by whoever wins three rounds first, and rounds themselves are over quickly, this is a great game to play if you can only dedicate a little time to gaming.   This is a fantastic game that I recommend to all.

However it has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you and your friends can return to the game every so often and still have fun. Speedrunners may seem simple at face value but there can be a bit of complexity to it.

4460	1	a	This title was off to a rocky start but with consistant updates and ehancements has gone from mediocre to most probably the best Sim out there.   Though this sim is listed as a Free 2 Play title and comes with several cars and a few track for nothing - you will need to spend a little cash in order to get the cars and tracks you want. The pricing on these addons is quite minimal and you only need to buy what you actually want and when you want it. Oh and you can test drive every car as many times as you like before deciding if you want to buy it.  Here's the rundown:  Graphics 8/10 - they are by no means bad - in fact the sim looks very natural and life like  Sound 10/10 - You can't get any more real than this without getting in the actual cars. Every detail from transmission whine and chassis squeaks to wind, transmission flex, gravel and reverb etc.. have been taken into account. The sound alone give this sim more immersion than the competition.   Physics 9/10 This score was a few points lower a couple months back, but with recent and ongoing enhancements to several group cars and more being fixed currently, R3e is more than deserving of this rating. If they get all the cars to the level they are achieving with the ones they already edited - I see a glorious 10 out of 10 coming in the near future.  FFB 10/10 - for me it was GSCE that held the title for FFB with AC and RF2 following slighly behind, but R3e has taken that title by leaps and bounds. I know this sounds exagerated, but you have to feel it to believe it - and I've never felt this good behind the wheel in my 15+ years of racecraft.  Car Content Variety 8/10 There are tons of cars available - though the list is still a bit on the short side. This is not to say that I don't have enough cars. The fact is I own more than I've had time to drive, but still wish there were a few Group C cars in the mix as those are my absolute favorites. Did I mention that you can test drive every car without buying.  Car Quality 10/10 - This title is on par with AC when it comes to detail. The exterior/interior along with suspension and tires are all done with upmost attention to even the small details.  Track Content Variety 8/10 Again the amount of tracks are quite limited compared to other titles, but not lacking. Several of my favorite tracks are included (Bathurst, Spa, Nurburgring, RedBull Ring, Suzuka, Nords, etc..) They have also included a lazer scanned Nordschleife into the mix with more lazer scanned tracks to come.  Track Quality 10/10 Right up there with AC and iRacing when it comes to track surface and detail. The sky boxes are absolutely believable and the environmental details are more than real enough to enjoy.   Multiplayer 8/10 Much better racing experience than most sims I've played, but it still has it's issues. The netcode has been updated recently and seems to be working great, but I have not had enough time with it to give it a better score.  Singleplayer 10/10 The AI have been improved greatly and their difficulty can be set to adaptive which takes some patience for them to settle in, but when they do they are a joy to race with. Also the 'Experiences' make this title a dream when it comes to playing championships.  Community 10/10 This is probably the least toxic sim community out there. Most everyone is friendly and helpful. The devs are also very active within the forums and listen to the players.  I'm not sure what all I left out, but I'll be sure to update this in the future.  Also: I know this review appears to be written by a fanboy due to the high scores given. I assure you this is not the case. I play many Sims more than I have this. Infact there was a long time which I felt this title was a waste of drive space, but as stated above - it has come a long way.  Whether you're a veteran to racecraft or are a complete newbie, give RaceRoom a try. You have nothing to lose since it can be played for free.

5370	1	a	This is definitely the best cricket game in a very, very long time. The community is friendly and are exceedingly active with providing new bats, full updated teams, kit, team badges, etc. Extremely immersive with a very well put together career mode that will keep you busy for hours while you play through the 20 year (from age 16 to 36) career, you can of course start later in the career if you want a shorter one.  Online play is fun and challenging with tourneys being run by some people. The batting will take a lot of getting used to, but with the practice nets, practice match functions and a bunch of patience you can quickly get into it and start scoring runs.  Xbox controllers are definitely recommended as some others that I've tried do not give you the full range of control with the right thumb stick and cuts down what you can and can't do in the game.  Overall I love this game and play it as much as I can, and I definitely recommend it to any friend/family member/acquantance that's looking for a solid cricket game.  8/10 (only because there's a couple issues, but the devs are active on the forums at Planet Cricket and are working on it)
337	1	a	This is one of the most challenging, and fun indie-games I have ever played. Seriously makes me envious of people with an Occulus Rift, since this game runs Occulus Rift. Excellent game play, looks beautiful, great soundtrack, and it doesn't hold your hand one bit. Just shows you how the game works and thrusts you in!  The only gripe I have with it, is the parachute controls, since I have died many times trying to land by steering with the mouse, and then going off site and breaking every bone in my body.  Despite the parachute controls, this game controls flawlessly. I would highly recommend for any indie-game enthusiast, and even people who have wanted to base-jump.  10/10!
5043	0	a	welcome to warm butter on melting ice simulator! where, unless you have a million â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pounds to spend on racing simulator full experience controls, you 'drift' into every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing in the game. the controls for mouse and keyboard are so bad that i couldn't evenmove untill i changed the controls. even the control settings are â¥â¥â¥â¥, you have to double click what you want to change and then click one of the buttons it actually recognises: all mouse buttons excluded. good thing this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is free, because if i had to spend Â£15 on this then i might have to accidentally slip and fall on to a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall of chainsaws multiple times. (dont question that) the graphics might be ok; i wouldn't know. because it takes a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing supercomputer to run decent graphics. if you have a super computer and/or full experience racing controls, then this game may be for you! if not, i advise you not to waste your time. TLDR: if you have a computer layout alike to normal humans, DONT. if you are a millionare with everything, on your own head be it.

4618	1	a	The graphics are pretty good. I tried to set my controller up to the game and it decided to not let me drive. I ended up having to set all of the controls back up again but other then that Its a great game if you enjoy racing.

5547	1	a	If you've never played Blood Bowl before, there is a strong learning curve. VERY stong. Once you get the hang of it, this game is fantastic, although there is the odd bug now and then, but nothing serious.  What ever way you decide to play, bashy, running, throwing, or defensive, there is a team for you. The fact that you get to level up your players makes the strategy all the more intense!  All bow to Chaos!

44	1	a	BASE Jumping: The Game. 80 levels, mostly involving you jumping off a building and falling near them for points. Has a peculiar sense of humour.
30	1	a	I must say this game isn't bad at all. Think of it as a bungee jumping game where it focuses on you falling down and touching surface for extra points. You earn currency to unlock different stages as well. Although, I do wish there were more achievements, because there isn't much...

4807	1	a	+ graphics are ok, runs in 4k, 60 fps on a GTX980TI + physics are nice and feel realistic + Ai is good, not perfect + free, buy what you want, dodge what you don't want + GT3 cars + updates + nice community + lots of tracks and cars (+) free spotter app, found in the games forum   - multiplayer is kinda dead - no full control during pitting and rolling starts, not like iRacing - no weather change, no rain, no night races - no real flag system  overall a better sim/race game than Assetto and PCARS

472	1	a	This game is a real blast. I mean it really gives you that edge of your seat feeling to it. Trying to hug walls and get points while trying to still make the objectives is really entertaining. I find myself leaning in to corners behind my computer which is something I don't think I have done with most games for years and years. This game deserves credit for that really if nothing else.  It however isn't without its flaws. Graphics are so-so and it doesn't really give a spectacular range of maps or anything but it is what it is. A fun game to play when you have a few minutes to kill.

4719	1	a	I've reconsidered my previous, extremely negative review.  The last update for this sim has helped things quite dramatically.  After playing for a couple of hours I experienced no crashes to desktop at all and the steering feels considerably better, almost perfect now on my Fanatec CSR Elite wheel.    Swapping from my single 2560 x 1440 monitor my old tripple screen 5760 x 1200 NVida Surround setup helps make the sim more addictive.  I've always liked the quality of the SimBin tracks as they're full of detail which further adds to the sense of immersion.  Despite the relatively high cost if you puchase all the tracks and get a good collection of cars, I think you'd find that this will give you hundreds of hours of entertainment.
