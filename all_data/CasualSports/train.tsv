1013	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â¥â¥â¥, 5 stars!
4199	1	a	4/5. 'Match 3' with RPG elements and a good story. 
3024	1	a	I like this game, the levels are good, the music is great, but it's much better with friends!
488	1	a	Sometimes I just can't take the death stares of my wife and children as I utterly crush them for the 5000th time at this game. Now I don't have to hear that I'm way to serious about tiny plastic trains for a grown man.
738	1	a	This is the best board-game-to-video-game translation I've seen. If you like casual board games, get it. The in-game text chat is nice for chatter and smack talk during the game (although voice chat would have been nice, but you can of course set that up via Steam or Skype or whatever if you want). The different maps keep it interesting. And Ticket to Ride is a proven, fun game that's not so trivial that gamers won't enjoy it but not so hardcore that those new to or very casual about gaming can't get into it.
885	1	a	This game sucks 
1649	1	a	Before you get this game, do you have at least 2 friends who would play this with you? If you do, then go ahead and buy it.  A cooperative stealth/collection game, Monaco offers a variety of ways to play with its ecclectic cast of characters. With skills unique to each character, such as Disguise, Spot and Breaking Down Walls, playing with a different set of team members will create a whole new approach to each carefully designed level.  
2256	1	a	This game is perfect to sit down to and play with mates, you can spend hours running through levels with a shotgun, smashing and grabbing, or you can play stealthily and the game mechanic somehow almost completely changes. Its a must play if your a fan of games like Payday. The art style is incredibly simple yet unique and it really characterises the game into something I have never played before.  Definitly a 10/10 as long as you play with friends, playing singleplayer is okay but no way near as fun personally.
4665	0	a	So I got this as part of an indie bundle of 8 other games for $1.50, and upon looking at the store page, I became worried.  Barely touched on steam for two and a half years and already had mixed reviews, I approached this game today with caution. The opening was cute. I liked the pop-art style intro. It reminded me of something like Little Big Planet.  Then I saw those things up close. Those...creepy, soulless eyes...begging to die.  Space Ark is basically an Arkanoid game (hooray for puns), where you bounce your Little Big Planet knockoffs around and about hitting objects this game calls 'DNA' and helping these creatures restore there planets to its (un)rightful glory.  I was very skeptical about how this game would be, especially with how the screenshots were kind of a turnoff. But honestly, this game wasn't too bad. In fact it got a little challenging, because not only are you controlling your yoga ball around the stage, but you also have control in navigating your sock puppets that you call 'animals.'  Granted, it's not as challenging as other arkanoid games that you can find here on steam, such as Ionball, but if you like to have color in your environment and like bouncing up and down cute...soulless...evil...creatures, then you'll enjoy this game.  Though at a price tag of $5, I say wait, look for a sale, or look somewhere else. This game is worth no more than your typical dollar app, and shouldn't be priced any higher than that.  Other than that, I (personally) can't recommend this game to anyone I know that is into arkanoid but likes this type of theme.  p.s. This game cannot be played at full screen, so that's another thing to note about.
1158	1	a	This game learn me how to jump like a professional :D
4129	0	a	At first it's really great. If you like Bejeweled you will like this for the addictive gameplay. But every match you play is exactly the same as the last and it gets real boring real fast. I should have spent my money on something better, like a better game or hookers and coke.
3970	1	a	A simple and short game but one that was extremely fun!
2916	1	a	Fun with friends - be sure to buy the 4-pack! This game is definitely more engaging with company.
1133	1	a	So much fun if you have only a few mins to play and just want to goof about
4746	1	a	This game is great but too easy and too much hint from the professor.  Get it at half price for all Portal fan.
163	1	a	Fun little game, with lots of replayability. And for that price tag (especially during a Steam Sale), you can't go wrong.
2265	1	a	Being a thief has never been more 8-bit!!! Truly an unbelievably fun games, with or with out friends!
2844	1	a	Monaco, is one of the most briliant pieces I've ever played. For once, this game actually requires teamwork and strategy, the soundtrack is amazing, the style is stylish, the visuals are stunning, and the gameplay overall is hilarious and provides loads of fun. It's unlike anything you've ever player. Mostly worth for the co-op, while the singleplayer can still provide a very nice experience. The community is amazing, and this game is one of the best I've ever played. Buy it. NOW.
4378	1	a	6/10
754	1	a	Supports cross-platform play between Steam and iPad
4225	1	a	Dude you can meditate in this game. ItÂ´s a little funky sometimes, but itÂ´s an interesting piece for sure.
446	1	a	This game is amazing!  Sold at a very cheap price too. It's a very nice game to just play when your bored. c:
4541	1	a	Loving having this game again after losing my old copy years ago! Hope to see the sequel here someday!
2613	1	a	Its a fun game.I got the week version...So i dident play it enough.But i hate the idiots that dont know what to do 
1916	1	a	I'm a big fan of Heist type games/movies and cooperative gameplay, Monaco is one of a kind and aside from such games as Payday, Monaco delivers a more unique user experience with it's immersive gameplay, style, and it's playable classes of characters. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone!
3833	1	a	Fantastic writing!
253	1	a	Similar to Geometry Wars in a lot of ways but a heck of a lot more modes to play. Combat could be more interesting but overall it's a very fun popcorn game.
1069	1	a	Race across a bumpy landscape without losing your passengers. A fairly simple game that can be a lot of fun. There are different skins for your truck &amp; a few different types of passengers.  You can create, upload &amp; download levels. Supports other Operating Systems too.
2214	1	a	This one's a keeper! Fast-paced multiplayer steal-em-up!
5117	0	a	Hugely disappointing. Having hyped this game as a simplified 3D Dwarf Fortress, the developers either had no time to polish and add game functions, or they simply didn't have the skill to execute a game of this scale. Game mechanics are often hidden or pointless, navigation and moving the camera can be very confusing, AI struggles to accomplish simple tasks often doing it the most inefficient way leading to unnecessary deaths, animations and graphics that make me crave for Dwarf Fortress ASCII art, and a gameplay that does not infuse excitement or challenge with a dash of poor attempt at comedy. Paradox have a lot to learn when it comes to making games!
2849	1	a	Monaco doesn't have great graphics, and if you're Chaide and you suck, the music isn't great either. However, Monaco offers a wonderful multiplayer experience. It's a simple game, the rules for most of the missions being to get in, get something, and get out. The way you handle doing that is entirely up to you, and they provide you a good sized selection of characters to accomplish your goal*  While it is 'entirely up to you', there's really only two things you're doing; you're either sneaking around, or you're running around all crazy because you didn't do the sneaking thing right. Still, a very fun experience that has you trying to plan ahead all your moves.  There's quite a lot of missions, too. Definitely takes a while to get through this game.  I think my biggest complaint may be the difficulty curve. Once you acquire all of the characters, the missions get hard fast. I recommend getting more players to assist, or get ready to have a very slow mission.  But at the end of it, it's a game I recommend because it's unique. It's hard to compare it to anything else, but it doesn't fail in what it was trying to accomplish. If you're into zany heists with friends, give this a shot if you aren't too turned off by the rudimentary sprites.  *I'm going to make an exception here for the pickpocket, who only seems to help with...your Time, I guess? Whatever money you miss picking up on the mission when you get out adds a lot of penalty to your final time, which is only really for bragging rights on leaderboards I guess. Pickpocket's pet monkey can sweep areas for money to assist with that, and ammo for your weapons. Overall though, you'd probably do better with some other character if you're focused on just the objective.
3748	1	a	Costume Quest takes a novel idea that breathes some life and originality into the JRPG format. Top that with a ton of personality and witty dialogue and you have quite a sweet treat of a game.
4379	1	a	Katamari styled bit of fun. Not a lot of content, but enjoyable while it lasts.
616	1	a	Awesome game. The thing that annoys me about the board game is the pace and this satisfies my cravings without the waiting. It plays super fast and I can knock out a 3 person computer vs game in under 10 minutes. The only annoying thing is that theres no tutorial for the expansions so I had to look up the rules and try to figure it out from that.
3447	1	a	Trick or Treat Simulator 2k10
1999	1	a	It's a great Indie game if your into stealth and a great game overall. However, I recommend playing with friends because it's dangerous to go alone! (and because it's more fun)
4929	1	a	If you liked the Portal games, definitely check this one out. Since people are bound to compare to the portal games I'll lay some stuff out.  1. The main mechanic is shifting between 4 different dimensions to solve puzzles. This was almost as fun as thinking with portals. 2. In the game, your uncle talks while you solve puzzles. Big drawback: he's not very entertaining. At all. Seriously, this was just terrible writing. Only slightly better than complete silence. 3. You're required to do some platforming at some parts. I've read about some people getting aneurysms over this, and while I never had too much trouble making jumps, I can see why people would gripe.   Other things: + I really did like the cartoony art style. + The barfing cloning devices and cat that follows you around were always welcome sights.  - Level design was just lazy. When going between rooms, you'll pass clones of the same corridors over and over. - In the last third of the game, there were maybe 2 or 3 areas that I'm sure plenty of people will get annoyed over. Not because they're hard to figure out, but tough to execute.  This game will exercise your brain with puzzles that are not too challenging but definitely fun. It's not the perfection that Portal 2 is, but it'll help scratch that puzzle itch. 8.5/10
3329	1	a	This game is one of my favourite games. It's a cute game that I enjoy playing every year during the Halloween, but not only. I could say the game became a tradition for me :D
2687	1	a	This game was sooo good i think if you and your friends love having a laugh then get it. if not your still missing out
238	1	a	I was a little skeptical at first when i was about to buy this game, but since it was so cheap, why not right? I was so glad to give it try, i really got into it, the gameplay is fantastic and soundtrack as well, you will certainly be hooked up for hours, if you like Super Hexagon this game you will love this one, if you don't, why not give it a try? it's cheap and you may like it, believe me, you won't regret it.
3336	1	a	fun game, nice turn-based combat, interesting story, very fun I must say.  although, no game is 100% perfect, and for me, there`s a little too much combat, and it`s very hard to block. also, the screaming spider and yodling black widow are a bit OP.  the developers aren`t exactly humble or generous (reccomending their own games, putting an add in a secret area) but their game is very fun 8.5\10
1829	1	a	a fun game for you and your friends to play togethor, and the soundtrack is amazing
2439	1	a	Mad fun! Many jokes and great action to play with friends. Recommended.
2508	1	a	Wondrous. Especially if you have at least one friend to play with!
2555	1	a	Awesome, Become a stealer and sneak in and out of ships, houses, bruning boats you name it. 9/10 stars 
2792	1	a	I love playing the lookout. However when the â¥â¥â¥â¥ hits the fan I tend to run around shooting and screaming and jumping into bushes after triggering every alarm. That behavior has caused my husband to yell 'This is why we're never robbing a bank!'
3489	0	a	The combat mechanics are overly simplistic, the plot is as cliche as can be, the general theme is goofy and lighthearted, but mostly in a boring and predictable fashion... All in all, it mostly reminds me of a kids game. In that regard, it fares well - the tone seems kid friendly, the humor is harmless, and the controls are intuitive. But, if you've played even a single RPG and enjoy RPGs with even SOME level of complexity, I'd give this a skip.
572	1	a	This game is extremely fun with friends, absolutley give it a try!
421	1	a	this game is the best. it reminds me of astriod but with some new things in it
1254	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. Gripping story, fast paced action, and it will thrust you into battle constantly. I'd rate 8/8. Truly gr8.
3491	1	a	Just got 100% achievements for the game (and GOI) ;3   +  -Cute and visually appealing graphics. Nicely atmospheric -Adorable and well-written dialogue/ story -Collecting is fun -The battle system is simple, yet enjoyable -Music is fitting -Love the halloween theme; a perfect halloween game   -  -Battles can get a little repetitive  Tl;dr : I played this all in a few days, really enjoyed. Definitely pick it up in a sale.
5308	1	a	My first impression is that this was a very silly and childish game, but this is far from the truth. It's actually a fun game, really well executed. It requires you to think and solve puzzles on a truely unique way. I think it really stands out in originality.
3182	1	a	Interesting and challenging
732	1	a	When it comes to pretty cool quick boardgames, this one is it.
4965	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out. Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.   Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform. If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game. I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception. I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.  This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, 'Daddy, don't you dare!' We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. 
4614	0	a	A newer version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable has been detected on the machine. 
5339	1	a	play this on my laptop in the Bus and Train :P good game if you want to waste some time  7/10
2266	1	a	Steal stuff with friends
1519	1	a	Great coop play, good couch game. Different play styles accommodated with different classes, challenging levels that make you work together.
1451	0	a	no online players xD
3056	1	a	Great game to play with friends
2858	1	a	Incredible game. Stealth, robbery, shotguns, emps, dogs, hacking - this game has it all and more. The multiplayer aspect is great if you have people with you that you know, and the push to talk being an xbox controller button is genius. Fantastic 2d strategy.
751	1	a	Ticket to Ride is an easy game to understand, but impossible to master. You could play this game for centuries and you still would never be able to win every game. It's a game of luck and skill combined in perfect unison. Whether you're a fan of board games, strategy games, or trains, you will enjoy this game. I guarentee that anyone at any age can sit down and enjoy this game.
1515	1	a	Kind of like a stealth-oriented Hotline Miami, the name of the game in Monaco is to get in, steal an objective, get out, while taking all the dosh along the way. Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage. The characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability. Single-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach. Like all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels. The music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action. Haven't heard anything like it in other games. Comes with a level editor, and the hours of additional play that entails. I had a ton of fun with this game and I think you will too.
459	1	a	This is very like Geometric War but with small differences. Because of thoses it makes a totaly different game and the music is awesome. The acheivements are great too. 1$ and I had alot more fun than with the 25$ piece of c*@p Hard west that I cant even finish the game becaue of a bug.... Well have a good time and enjoye the ride
1321	1	a	Fling snowballs, dynamite fish, spiky balls, and overpowered goldfish at coloured penguins (no racism intended) to feed sharks in the next generation of FPS - First Penguin Snowballing, that is to say.
712	1	a	LOVE this game, if you are a fan of Empire Buildier and the other train games, this is the closest game I've found online to those board games. :)
4233	1	a	I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to improve their reflexes whether it's in games or the real world. It was developed for gamers, but it honestly reduces your reaction time to help with things like martial arts as well.
506	0	a	If you liked the Ticket to Ride game for windows,I would not buy this package of all the games.I did and I'm sorry.The game crashes continually,and it does not look the same[and the robots cheat]Very dissatisfied!I would like a refund and my old game back,but they[at steam]don't seem to want to be gotten a hold of.[tried many times,and ways.
4321	1	a	Pick up everything and never let it go, baby.   Also, Minecraft grass sound.  9/10
4834	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES MY BRAIN HURT IN A GOOD WAY
2782	1	a	Even thought I just started this game, I find it quite entertaining even thought I didn't know what to do half of the time. But, once you get the concept of the game down, then it's super easy to play. Plus, if you get the right kind of weapon, then you are invinsible in this game. I'll keep playing this game, it passes the time away.
967	0	a	While Clockwork Man has an interesting premise and pretty visuals, it's far too short to recommend it. My play time is inflated from accidentally leaving the game running and spending some time on the unlimited HOG mode. Maybe if you really love hidden object games and get it on sale with the other Clockwork Man game, I could say 'go for it', but don't expect much out of it. The scrolling/zooming function isn't really as big of a deal as one would hope, and the story is not particularly good (although it's hilarious how everywhere Miranda goes, people ask her to clean up a big mess) and it ends on a cliffhanger that isn't resolved in the sequel!   And why are all the men in this game so fat???
1017	1	a	This is one cute casual game. Easy to learn, hard to master. Levels are short, but they give a blast of fun.
3969	1	a	Costume Quest is hillarious!  + Good story (Halloween themed) + Adorable game design  + Funny dialogues and scenes + Awesome battlemode i(It reminded me of the classic Final Fantasy ganes I-IX)  Truely a hidden gem and can be recommended for any RPG enthuasist or just someone looking for some entertainment for the weekend!
4529	1	a	the game is a very good mix of adventure and thinking as well as having a nice difficulty to it
3433	1	a	Pretty fun game with quirky humor. Sadly it does not have any replay value and I cannot recommend it at more then $5. But if you enjoy fun dialog with unique characters it's worth a shot. The expansion adds.. some? But it's still very linear and pretty repetative after awhile, the main appeal is def unlocking the costumes and the fun dialog/plot.. the combat does get a lil stale
2752	1	a	best 4p co-op availble. plus it's an awesome solo campaign. kind of like a pixel-sized metal gear solid.
4964	1	a	I REALLY like this game! It's charming and witty, with a lot of nice touches along the way.   Granted, I haven't gotten to the end where some folks are saying it's annoyingly hard. But at least so far it's a great game. I wish it had seen more commercial success. It deserves more recognition.
1157	1	a	This changed me
2131	1	a	Pretty interesting game. There isn't anything like this on the market right now. It is fun!
407	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
5197	1	a	This is a really neat game.
5155	1	a	If you like games like Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress your going to love this. A Game of Dwarves is a casual dwarf management game in which you manage a small colony of dwarfs. You have to keep them happy, safe, well fed and well rested at the same time as you train your soldiers and build insidious traps to ward of potential dangers related to digging too greedily and too deep. There's only two things that keep this game from a solid eight out of ten for me. The first ting is how strangely demanding the game is on my system, and the second thing is how it leaves me wanting more, much more. However, considering the price and how much potential the game has, I'll still give it a fairly high score. My rating: 6/10
2665	1	a	Its fun. go buy it. multiplayer is great.
2390	1	a	To state one thing clear: I have owned this game now for about 5 hours and have not seen every aspect of the game in its full depth, but from what I've seen so far I can say, that this game knows how coop functions and is with friends great fun. Its gameplay as well as the artstyle and sound are smooth, funny and simply beautiful.  Especially for the sale price really worth it.
3285	1	a	When this game works it is a Zen like experence.  All of the pieces are layed out in front of you and the hardest part is figuring out the correct order things go in.  Sometimes you have to experement, or find less obvious solutions but it's all right in front of you.  Drop that marble, snip that rope...now...Done! Simple, elegent.   At least that's the way it should be. Ocacionally a puzzle will require too-precise timing or wonky physics will send your marble flying in the wrong direction. It might be that your solution was correct but something was off by just a hair. This leads to confusion and frustration as you vainly search for another way to solve the puzzle; sometimes getting it by sheer luck and determination.   Thankfully though, only a handful of the puzzles are like this. Most of them work beautifuly. Combined with the painted backdrops and soft music Obulis is a soothing puzzler...except when it isn't
679	1	a	I have always been a massive board game fan, and Ticket To Ride is simple but fun to play. Now it is so easy for me to play with friends even if they are on the other side of the world. So much like the board game, you can play agressively or not. The only issue I have is that for some reason it crashes every time I try to load the tutorial. Have fun playing.
2874	1	a	superb little game here - in fact little is the wrong word - it's got hours of endless fun!
3594	1	a	Very entertaining and fun to play.
3742	1	a	Awesome game! Quirky and cute as hell! Made me LOL many times.
1039	1	a	Don't mock Snuggle Truck.
1210	0	a	Honestly, I don't remember how this ended up in my game library. Just don't do it.
3856	1	a	i don't even like RPGs and yet i totally got into the RPG aspect of this game.  i 100 percented this on the ps3, and i don't normally take the time to do that.  highly recommended. another fine game from double fine.
963	0	a	The gameplay is ok, and the art has some nice late-90s CD-ROM puzzle game aesthetics. Unfortunately, there's very little game to play. I'd swear the cut scenes are a full half of the game, and they're horrible. The template is: 'bwahaha, foolish girl, I tricked you into cleaning my [space]!' 'Oh how dare you, you churl!' 'Relent, miss! Out of guilt I will actually do what was requested of me.'  But seriously, almost every scene is your character being tricked into cleaning up after people. And you're the only female character. You play a girl who goes around cleaning up after men. It's actually the whole story.
2905	1	a	Another game that I love
2371	1	a	I cannot believe that I'm the only person among my friends who picked this up. You guys are missing out on some seriously fun coop action. This game is way too much fun.
1001	1	a	Pretty fun, wish I had more time to really delve into it, though.
5389	1	a	Galaga with some zest.
1395	1	a	10/10 MLG Pingo    In all seriousness this is a great game, you can throw fish at other penguins. Plus it requires skillz unlike COD :) 
4364	1	a	So many bugs and glitches but I couldn't stop playing. Don't know if it's worth the $10, but next time it's on sale you should pick it up. Although I now wish I still had my katamari games.
1385	1	a	Bombastic game 9/11 :) -EA
313	1	a	If you like Super Hexagon or games similar you will find this just as fun.
5250	1	a	samus aran got her armor from bird people so here's a metroid starring a bird person, with good puzzles and really clever pacing.
4616	1	a	This was a really fun game. And hard once you got to the upper levels. I enjoyed making my own.
2353	1	a	I wish i had more people to play this with!
4781	1	a	Everything is slowed down, but, oh, now you're upside down. And now everything is soft and squishy - what kind of game is this? Quantum Conundrum is an incredibly bizzare game that feels like it was made by the Portal team. Solve puzzles by inverting gravity, making things soft, slowing time, and making everything heavy. A brilliant game, but very short and with no promise of future updates. I reccomend this to those who love Portal and all things bizarre.
3709	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. I don't even know where I got it. I think I got it from a friend or from a Humble Bundle or something. But when I decided to boot it up the other day, I was really surprised. The overall feel is charming, the graphics are aesthetically pleasing, and the costumes/monsters are interesting.  Am I going to go back and play it? Probably not until Christmas, because of that one achievement that requires you to play it on that day. But am I glad I played it? Absolutely.   I'd give this mysterious game a 7/10
5319	1	a	This game is a beautiful puzzle platformer. This is one of those games that you know the developers really cared to put out the best possible product they could, and it shows when you're playing.
4163	1	a	A very unique blend of match 3 and RPG mechanics makes Puzzle Quest a standout game; The two genres meld together to unexpectadly provide an engaing title thats hard to put down. The story is well written with excelent dialect. the battles are appropriately lengthed, the amount of available spells provides plenty of options suited to different play styles and the variety of 'mine game' activities are enough to keep you occupied for hours.  The only negative feedback is the music doesn't loop very well, it can break your imersion suddenly when the music jumps to the begining of a track halfway through a note.  All in all this feels like playing a grand D&amp;D Adventure while playing competitive Bejeweled. Well worth it.
4944	1	a	An amazing game with clever puzzles, a brilliant voice actor, and the worst ending to a game since Borderlands. Seriously, that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ending made me wish I had never played the game. 7/10
1837	1	a	A great game for it's price!
522	1	a	CONS:  No real trains to handle You can't see the faces of people as you take that one route that all their tickets hinge on No way to change the starting handsize since every few turns is just hoarding train cards anyway No quit button: You can't get off this ride  PROS:  Table is unflippable No downtime compared to the physical game Game does all the maths and calculations for you Highlights the main ticket you're looking at and keeps other tickets in green so you can snake along No quit button: You can't get off this ride  CONCLUSION:  send help i can't get off this ride
216	1	a	Pure meditation. Be sure, u wanna play it.
466	1	a	very nice game, coming from Super Hexagon and Race the Sun this is one of the best sparetime fillgames on Steam
8	0	a	The best thing you can say is that this game is incredibly average. Just another mediocre platformer like hundreds of thousands of others. No special and interesting ideas, no cool/spooky/funny story and nothing that would make you improvise while playing. Gameplay is very forgiving so its good for kids or if you look for easy game.
4361	1	a	I have no idea why I loved this game so much. Okay that is not a very good reccomendation. Let me try again. This game was.. the gameplay was... the storyline... GRRR. I guess I loved it because I had never played anything like it before. I loved it's simplicity. I just HAD to see if I could absorb every little thing there was to absorb. That is the objective by the way; to absorb everything before time runs out. You start out small and can only absorb small things, eventually you walk over a building and it becomes part of your swirling mass. The world is going to end, and you have to take as much â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you can. I played it to death. I was obsessed. Good times.
1644	1	a	Great game, very intense and perfect for co-op!
3119	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. But a bit cheesy
2156	1	a	Monaco is a charming game where you and three friends take all the priceless artifacts out of various buildings while avoiding detection of guards and cameras. There are different classes you can choose from, find the one that suits your style. This game is pretty cool with an interesting story and vary people who talk to you in game. Complete with the workshop to continue the game even after the story is over. Also go back to previous levels and beat the record speed. Fun game, great multiplayer.
3026	1	a	Monaco, with your simple-yet-stunning aesthetics, atmospheric sound effects and music, tight gameplay, brilliant mechanics, and excellent longevity, the only thing you have stolen... is my heart.  Caveat: I've never played this game solo, but boy is this strategic heist game fantastic with friends. Once you've finished the main narrative, and tried out all the gameplay options via multiple characters -- characters whose traits grant them a unique ability -- then play the many missions added by the developers. Or make your own. Or download more from the workshop.  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by the developers. Bravo.
3644	1	a	It's certainly rough around the edges, but a streamlined RPG battle system and really consistent humor make this a fun light, nostalgic romp. Plus, I just love fetch quests. It also occupies a unique niche in being a true Halloween game without horror elements -- it's a game I'd love to share with my kids one day.
1748	1	a	For when your mom doesn't let you play Payday. 10/10
1883	1	a	Outstanding in every regard. 10/10
4917	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
1362	1	a	My favorite sonic game yet.
2276	1	a	A criminal amount of fun with friends.
4622	1	a	For those times when you simply want to build some Golberg machines (or whatever you call them in your region).

2572	1	a	this game is pretty cool i want to play much more though lol
1468	0	a	I've played very little at the time of this review.  Pros +Penguins are awesome. +Graphics look nice. +Controls are responsive. +Funish...  Cons -The game crashes with out fail after every match if in fullscreen. -The game resets video options after every restart of the game. -The OS can start to become unstable if you crash because of being in fullscreen. -When you die you are placed as a ghost penguin in wierd places, unable to move and in terrible view of what is actually happening. What makes this worse is that the maps are just large enough that it can take upwards of 10+ minutes for one of the last two penguins to die, leaving you trapped waiting.   In addition to being trapped and unable to move, you are given the ability to shoot what I can only assume are ghostly eggs but your aim is virtually non-existent.  Now if the glaring issues are ever resolved I would highly recommend this game. It could be the perfect fast paced mini game it wants to be if some changes were to be made. The maps are just too large and that forces matches to last longer than needed and with the other problems just makes it less fun.  I do think I'll continue to play a few matches here and there for a long while but I can't honestly see myself playing for long periods. If you watch some videos and think it looks fun I would get it. I just can't recommend a game with so many glaring problems. Although I do love mechanics of pushing penguins off of an island. It reminds me of some of these mini games that were on the first xbox back when I was a kid. I loved those and I'd still play those today if available for PC. 
1419	0	a	Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.  There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.  Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.  Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.  All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.
5326	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a fun puzzle game, which can be bought for pretty cheap on a sale. If you're on a Mac, though, you'll want to get a virtual machine with Windows on it for it to work. The graphics are nice, the characters are cute, and there are killer bats. I mean, killer bats, come on. I haven't played a lot of the game yet, so this isn't based off of a lot.   Overall, if you like puzzle games, you'll probably like this one. 8/10  (If you want to jump a lot, though, you may be slightly disappointed)
3284	0	a	Marbles and puzzles.  Obulis is a game of both marbles and puzzles. The aim is to get the marbles into the same coloured containers. In order to do so you need to manipulate chains, which drop the marbles, to make sure the marbles bump into each other to allow the coloured marble to get to the right container. There is a bit of physics involved in this game as you need to calculate the correct time to release the marble to win. As you win each level you collect stars (which don't do anything except track your wins)  There is no story in this game, just a series of puzzles to complete. The game should last you a while since there are more than 150 levels, depending on whether you choose to play them all that is. The music is nice and calm which helps you think in these puzzle games.  Tghe main problem I have with the game is that there is no sense of progression in this game. Collecting stars isn't a good enough motivator to keep me interested in this game.  I can only recommend this game hardcore puzzle fans otherwise, it's best to spend your money elsewhere.
3629	1	a	It's a little slow at first but once you're used to the game (when you're in the mall) it's a lot better. It's a well balanced turn based fighter with an rpg adventure side, good visuals and well optimized. Plenty of humour too, shame there's no voice acting as it would be a very brilliant game if it had voices too.
5271	1	a	interesting game...i'm glad to try it first xD
5227	1	a	Beautiful game. Tragically underrated.
2783	1	a	This game is sweet. ridiculous fun. get it!
887	1	a	Oh yeah! Hit me up.. A great translation of a marvelous table top game!!!
3281	1	a	For the $0.49 I got this for, it is an amazing game. The puzzles are challenging but not in the way you have to look them up. I am so glad this game went on sale for so cheap or I would not have given it a chance. Pick it up if you love puzzles.
3690	1	a	Very easy and charming Halloween themed rpg. I really enjoyed this game and played it in one sitting today. I liked the story and aesthetic. My only big issue with the game was how repetitive it was. Towards the end the battles just got super boring. By the time I finished the main game and started the bonus content called Grubbins on Ice, I was bored with the gameplay and just didn't have it in me to play through the dlc. Other than the repetitive battle system and some other minor complaints I have, I enjoyed this game and can't wait to sit down and play Costume Quest 2 next Halloween!
928	1	a	Plays like a much smarter puzzle quest/puzzle league combined with a combat system relying on classic rock-paper-cisor color vulnerability system.  Overall very pleasant. Artistic value is pretty high, interface easy and functional. Not as polished as Valdis, but any further comparison would be unfair I think.  If you like the classic lining up of color orbs by horizontal swap games, this is one of the strongest I've seen.
2645	1	a	it is a good game it is good i like it must download it and the free offer is good thanks steam
2290	1	a	A blast to play co-op. Works best over LAN- or netplay, but okay with local co-op too, especially if you stick closer to each other/have a good monitor. Given time, I will sink many more hours into this, and any fan of a good top-down puzzle shooter I'm sure will do the same!
5269	1	a	Definitely doesn't worth the full price, but since I got this game from bundle, this game is kinda good to kill time.
2117	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Multiple storylines in the campaign to play through. A few different game modes and a map creator make for good replayability. It's fun to try and be stealthy, but it's equally as exciting to try to run and gun through the map. Or do both, just hide really well after running and gunning and you can go back to being stealthy haha.
5165	1	a	When you play a game of dwarves, you win or you die.
1786	1	a	Monaco is a game thatâs as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether youâre after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay thereâs something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment.   Itâs exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I canât imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.  Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.
3110	1	a	Excited! An interesting game with friends.
1963	1	a	FUNNY AND AWESOME GAME! THUMBS UP FOR THE MULTIPLAYER!
3402	1	a	This game is Halloween perfection. Super easy mechanics, love the overall simplicity of this game, and it is so easy to pick up. I can definitely see myself playing this game every october. Cute, funny dialogue at times, and cutscenes/dialogue IS skippable. Such a beautiful feature &lt;3 BUT not needed for this game. The cutscenes were interesting enough to want to watch every time. Some of the costume transformations were hilarious, others just epic. Towards the end of the game, however, the fights started feeling super repetitive, so I kept switching the costumes up to keep some interest. Overall, this is a pretty laid back, easy game and definitely hit the spot for the type of game I want to play around October. I bought the Costume Quest 1 &amp; 2 bundle on sale for about $4. So beyond worth it. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially if you are new to games. Just do yourself a favor and get this game &lt;3
4310	1	a	I hope they make a sequal: The not so wonderful end of the world
3002	1	a	I love the stealth aspects of this game, it is very fun and has lots and lots of replayability due to all the things that you can do in this game. It is also very fun to play this game on co-op and I love the different skills that each character can have. I would reccomend this game to anybody who is lokking for a stealth game.
1403	1	a	A pretty good Call of Duty clone
2252	1	a	Ridiclously fun! 10/10
4577	1	a	Retro-themed tower defense game. Very fun, great cut scenes.
2427	1	a	seemed pretty cool if you have a squad to co-op it up with
571	0	a	I love Ticket to Ride as a board game, and I enjoy the iPhone app, but this is a terrible PC port.  The settings screen is tricky to find, and even after clicking on it, it takes a while to load and the buttons aren't labeled. There are icons with no indication what changes will be made by clicking on the icon. And the changes can't be made in game. For example, I wish I could've found a way to speed up the animations, but I was unable to do so. The game moves at a snail's pace.   As I was trying to get to the settings sceen to look for the options, an annoying voice kept talking to me about the settings. Every time you switch which map you're considering using, a new voice starts up. There must be a way to disable these in the settings, but again, since nothing was labeled, I don't know where it is.   This is a good game, but a terrible PC port.
3456	1	a	This one is truly a GEM, with it's intriging and brilliant storyline and its cartoonish grafics you can't go wrong with buying this game, and honestly it's original price is a steal for this game.  this is one of those games you can intreduce your kids to gaming with, thoiugh you propertly have to play with them and help them a littel do to the game being text based, but all in this game is good for any adult that have but the smallest part of child left in them, and any child that is 5+  The game takes around 7-9 hours to complete and if you buy the DLC you will get additional 2-3 more hours of gameplay.   I highly recommend this game!
701	1	a	I'm a fan of the board game and this is a good port.
3540	1	a	Very nice short JRPG. The biggest minus is that it gets monotonic after sometime (the problem is that its only 5 [!!!] hour long). Buy it on promotion.
2366	1	a	The story and writing for Monaco were both charming and cute, and I was a fan of the art style. Although the bright colors and cluttered maps seemed overwhelmingly distracting, I became more accustomed to navigating through new levels over time. Hilarity always ensued when playing with friends. I exclusively played with friends only, and found it more fun when played at a LAN party.
2046	1	a	shot a guy with a rpg next to his friend. was wearing a suit so he did nothing   10/10
317	1	a	Addicting and quite entertaining, with the little humor and 'all-in-good-fun' insults thrown at you, not regretting the purchase one bit.     For those of you who like arcade style wave-like games, this IS for you.
1008	1	a	Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.  Firstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as 'video games.'  With that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.  This soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking 'hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck.'  That's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.  The audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.  With everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.
5443	1	a	An enjoyable old school style game, It has elements that'll remind you of Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender and Phoenix. That's if your old enough to remember those games, Whether you do or not this is an addictive fun way to whittle away those rainy days.
3100	1	a	It's absolutely perfect game for multiplayer. But unlikely no one play this anymore.  For me I still find Monaco players to complete the story together.

4503	1	a	I played this game as a kid with my dad. It's an old one for sure. It's fun, though! It doesn't have a ton of replay value, but the first time through the game, there are puzzles to solve and achievements to get! It's cute and simple, but can be played with any computer, and it's long-lasting!
3730	1	a	If there's one game series that should be annualized, it should be this one.
4602	1	a	Seems to be working fine. But then, this machine is at least 5 years old. CPU must be 10 yo. OS is w7 32bits. Was really hyped about this game as a kid and really like playing it, because I was a simulated-physics maniac. I still am a bit*. I think maybe I even found out about it in Igromania gaming magazine and then made sure to find where and how to pirate it. *(Now I like the way computer physics grow from mathematics, thus work super similarly - yet completely different from real life. I might never get tired for the idea of simulated physics.)  Right now... I'm not so hyped. Puzzles seem to be interesting, but I'm not going to play more than a few levels, just gonna get the steam cards(though when installing I didn't know if the game has them or not). Maybe it's the fact that I already had enough fun with this, even tho it was a while ago.  None the less, I remember having alot of fun with these physics back then. That means the game was successful. Does it hold up to this day? I dunno, honestly. Probably doesn't worth the price.  The online features still work, tho, so that's a bonus. It wasn't even hard to register, I just gave login and pass and that's it. 
3129	1	a	This is a very fun game if you like team cooperation and pixel art style. I bought the 4 pack for 3 friends and I, and we had a blast.
419	1	a	i cant aim right 
1009	1	a	picked this up for my duaghter who is 6yr's old she loved it, i call it the 'lol wagon' simple fun physics gameplay.
384	1	a	So once upon a time there was this guy who made one of the best games of its genre and then he couldn't afford any advertising so nobody bought it and so he was sad and didn't really make a lot of money even though he should have. If you've purchased either Geometry Wars game then you really owe it to this guy to buy his game since he did a way better job than was done on Geometry Wars. It would be like buying Singularity but never buying Halo or Gears or CoD. It's just silly really. So don't be silly, just buy Waves. If you haven't purchased either Geometry Wars games then that's really good because now you don't have to because now you can just buy Waves instead.
2863	1	a	Genius coop game, very cool role system and gameplay mechanics. Definitely a recommendation!
1900	1	a	wie Payday nur aus der Topdown sicht aber mit weniger ballern just like Payday but with less shooting
4832	1	a	Great puzzle game with unique and fun mechanics. Those who liked the Portal franchise will probably like this game too as they are pretty similar in terms of level/puzzle design.
174	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I get bored of shooters or other games. Very fun and challenging with rewarding online gameplay. There is no reason why you shouldn't pick it up for $1.99
3973	1	a	This is a funny and adorable story, its a must play on Halloween, the game is simple but fun to play.  10/10
1061	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
1327	1	a	This game changed my life. Let me explain. I was playing my call of dutys modem warface 4 and I see in the bottom corner \'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥82 has started playing Penguins Arena: Sedna\'s World\' my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ screamed to me but after that insane game of cal off dooty it was to tight. I find my wallet in the steam sale safe (that\'s so gabeN does not eat it) I take the needed amount of money out and insert it in to my steam machine.i relax. But then my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ becomes unclenched and screams \'NOOO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAY\' sadly it was to late I was already installing it. That was the pizza money oh no what have I done. The game... the game it it it will consume you. 10/10 better than cunter stroke
4836	1	a	From the same designer as Portal: A rather good first person platformer and physics puzzle game, with a good sense of humor and John de Lancie voicing the mad scientist Uncle who has been damseled and is in need of rescue. Puzzles and platforming revolve around the shifting of 'dimensions' between normal, heavy, lighter, slower, and reversed gravity leading to much more thinking through the puzzles than annoying difficult jumps. Graphic fidelity is good, style is bright and slightly cartoony with details being different in each 'dimension' allowing for some amusing easter-eggs. The game was enjoyable, fun, and not overly hard.
3426	1	a	I highly recommend this as a childrens game. It plays like a really simple stripped down JRPG, just set around halloween instead of around the coming of the great big evil that wipes out the world. You pick up party members, extra outfits that change play style, and it's a nice simple story with some half-decent mini-games. If you've already gotten a few RPGs under your belt you'll likely be bored out of your mind, but as I said a great 'my first JPRG' for kids around 8-12 yrs old.
3394	1	a	Like Taking Candy From a ... Weird Green Monster Guy.   10/10
649	1	a	Very fun game with friends.
5071	1	a	(05/10) - At Least Playable  Well, what should i say about this? If you like crossword-puzzles, hang man and co. there is very much to find in here. My absolute favourite was something i didnÂ´t even know before, and the 'find the error' and sudoku puzzles are fun as well. You get a ton of content, and with the master puzzles you can easily rap your head around one puzzle for hours.  A slight warning tho, puzzles where you have to find or insert words (just like crosswords for example) are rather impossible without a native tongue in english. IÂ´d say that i speak it quite well and i didnÂ´t finish any of those puzzles, as the necessary words are just unknown without a perfect knowlage of the english language...
3444	1	a	Cool game. :P Hah.. Halloween. :P
2564	1	a	Good game i would say, especially when playing co-op with friends, it is really fun, enjoyed all the different character with different skill traits, and the game works best with people playing together, it requires teamwork to get through the missions.
1060	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
367	1	a	Not a game about surfing.
1339	1	a	10 out of 10.  It contains penguins. My soul has been bound to this game. No other argumentation is valid.
3985	1	a	Combat mechanics are a bit bland and collecathon nature of parts of the gameplay aren't my favourite BUT I love everything else about the game. Really happy, joyous little thing.
4342	0	a	I swear if I ran into this game out on the street, I would punch it in its freekin mouth.
3135	1	a	Fantastic co-op game. Not the most realistic stealth, much more 'gamey' which actually makes it a lot more fun imo. Such a joy! Even SP it's still pretty good.
3940	1	a	Fantastic game, great to play on Halloween. Love the rpg aspect, comedy and completionist feel. Gtg, gonna go play the sequel!
3537	0	a	Costume Quest is certain a BBB game: Boring (you keep doing the same things over and over again), Basic and Buggy. From a promising prototype to a disappointing game. I suggest this for younger players...
3994	1	a	Fun and beautifull little RPG Worth grabbing if you're an achievementhunter
3979	1	a	This game is brilliantly nostalgic, combining engaging mechanics with the essence of Halloweens of yesteryear - before sugarphobia, when a bit of duct tape and cardboard could fire a kids' imagination, when All Hallows Eve was a time of innocent play and kids above a certain age were temporarily allowed out of the sight of their parents (who, in that ancient time, lacked the built-in helicopter blades which today eviscerate children's marrow). Relive the magic of days gone by with this game - or, if you are too young to remember that glorious era, discover what you missed.
2697	1	a	I really enjoyed the game
3161	1	a	Obulis is a wonderful physics-based puzzle game that will really put your brain to work. Through 150 levels, colored marbles found on platforms and hanging from chains must be knocked into their respective colored pots while the grey marbles, which are only used as tools to move colored ones, must not.  Chains are highlighted and cut with the mouse and you'll have to make use of order, timing of cuts and shots, and momentum from swinging, rolling and bouncing marbles to make it all work. There are also cannons, catapults, crossbows and moving platforms you'll have to work with. Difficulty varies wildly and there can be multiple solutions for a level, with some making you feel like a genius and some feeling like pure dumb luck.  The mobile game Cut the Rope has some similarities if you've ever played it, but Obulis is more serious and challenging.
493	0	a	Over the last month there has been several server issues effecting most players, there doesn't appear to be anywhere to get support and haven't been given a time line to get this fixed.
3004	1	a	Great couch co-op, great music, nothing to complain about.
652	1	a	Faithful translation of the original board game. The menu needs some polish, especially for getting to online games, but the gameplay itself is great. Recommended for fans of the original, especially if you have friends to play against online.  In the event that you experience a JVM error when you run the program you can fix it by doing the following:  1. go to the actual install location .../steam/steamapps/common/ticket to ride 2. right click the ticket to ride application or exe file, select properties 3. under compatibility tab, check ' Run this program as an administrator' , then apply
4612	0	a	the first had more freedom
2086	1	a	Great game in concept, less great in actual use.
5419	1	a	A game in which some really big things start destroying stuff. Nothing more to say about this title.
4756	1	a	I have to say, this game is good for it's little following... I'm surprised at least the idea has not turned into another game. A little glimpse into what f-stop was in portal 2 (maybe). All around a good game. The only thing it is missing is a little bit of a storyline. I mean, I get that I am an 8 year old, who was visiting his grandfather... or something like that, but I think that if it had some engaging plots, it would feel a lot less repetitive (and i guess it also felt a little like you had to grind certain levels, similar to RPG games). Overall probably a 7 out of 10
1959	1	a	Best birds' eye view game out there
992	1	a	Nice game, like the predecessor. Has some more puzzles to it and a nice story again. Dont expect to much from it, the puzzles are quite easy but very much fun to do. Like it...
225	1	a	How-To-Play Section alone makes this game worth it.  This game is hard as hell and also addicting, But there are only few soundtrack in the game and I personally think its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ suck! Theres a music that is too loud and theres some that is almost non existant (humming ambience). Playing third party music in the background is highly recommended.  8/10 Great time killer, When theres nothing better to do. I'm occupied most of the time so I dont get to play it alot.
5074	0	a	Buggy and unfinished.  Good art style, but feels low quality and rushed.  DLC available for a game that should be an alpha: It has clearly been designed as cash crop from day one.  Developers/Publishers simply slapped on a 1.0 sticker and moved onto other projects.  Bugs consisted of terrible pathfinding, graphical issues and many other issues. Clunky.  Not really anything to do after an hour of two of gameplay: Literally no reason to play on.  Dug into dungeon of mobs and got absolutely massacred, had a few warriors as well.  This is not anywhere near a Dwarf Fortress 3D successor like I had hoped, nor will it clearly ever be, which is a shame as it had potential.
5059	1	a	I find this game is better than the previous one; it plays much more smoothly, there are so many more hint coin things, I can click-and-drag the words in fitword, there are ingame achievements (not just steam's ones), there's a further set of more difficult puzzles and there are extra puzzle types. The downsides are that the PUZZLER bonus isn't worth getting until after the fifth time, I miss codebreak and the wheel-of-fortune thing takes too much time. Basically, don't get this if you want to play codebreak.
2938	1	a	Amazing game. Music, plot, art, gameplay, multiplayer, singleplayer, workshop, everything about Monaco is a 10/10.
4797	1	a	Puzzles are challenging, humour is great. Not to mention the main voice in the game is John De Lancie, All around Thumbs Up in the IDS Device
4525	1	a	Such Fish most wet WOW
3027	1	a	trust me...it looks complicated but its super easy. its also fun to play with friends !!
4928	1	a	It's a fun and different puzzle with great graphics and a good story.
1475	1	a	(This game was rated Overwhelmingly positive, I have no idea why it says mixed. Must be bug ;-;)   This game is underrated. Very nice design and awesome game play. Never gets boring and is challenging no matter how good you are at the game, you will be learning new things about every time you play!     WHY DIS GAME IS GOOD:
2334	1	a	This little gem was well worth the price for hours of co-op mayhem. Great stealth action with lots of tactical choices to make when played with others. The solo experience is severely lacking. Do not judge the game if you've only played it alone. The more players involved the more complex the plans you can hatch.
4741	1	a	I actually like it more than Portal(2)...
3543	1	a	I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this game but I'm glad I did. It's Halloween night and your twin gets captured by monsters. It's up to you to saved them by trick or treating, questing, gathering new costumes and stomping monsters. The game itself is very easy to play yet still lots of fun. The only downside is it was too short. As there are very little bug in my whole playthrough.
2263	1	a	Amazing Game I've been Playing it for a While now, Nearly completed it but ITS STILL AMAZING! This game Is the Best game I have EVER Played.
3518	1	a	A very pretty game, I found it a bit slow paced and drifted off after a few hours, but I'll return to it one day.
4547	0	a	No! This is not a Splinter Cell game. It has nothing do with stealth. It's puzzle game about particles and magnetism.   Your task is to make the particles reach their destination. Red have to end up at red collector and green have to end up in a green collector. That's the logic of the game. The game introduces you new mechanics and teaches how to use tools. The mechanics are based on forces of magnetism. In order to finish the map you have to use properly distributors, rotator, plarity inverters just to mention a few. Timing and thinking ahead is important. Sometimes direction you shoot particles has meaning.   The game doens't feature any rewind/quicksave/checkpoint system, so you have to finish a level in one go. Since this game belongs to the group of trial and error games you will often spend long time repeating levels. Some of them require speed, some timing and some require planning. Later levels combine all of those. Additionally you can't speed up certain actions - you just have to wait... zzz. You are waiting and waiting, and you don't want to carry on. I just don't have patience for it. Let me do it.  The presentation is average. There are very few options. Graphics is basic, so is the sound. On the other end music is pleasant. It's strange, but fits the game perfectly.  The repetitive nature of the game as well as lack of mid-level save system made me quit playing it. I found that too tiresome. Repeating things over and over. Meh... This and the fact I was stuck in a few levels with no clue how to solve them made me quit the game. It's not a bad game, but I guess I lost interest and my patience didn't let me finish. Since I can't really recommend it, so I'm giving it thumbs down. 
1616	1	a	A simple yet complex game. It requires getting used too, but wheb you do, its great fun.
5196	1	a	A delightfully cheerful game with a hint of seriousness, which can be quite catchy for those who like to explore and build (underground). It may be monotomous at times, but I found that it did not lower my gameplay experience, even if the tech tree is basically resetted every time you start a new map in the story mode.  It is an enjoyable game for any dwarf enthusiast.
4470	0	a	It's quite buggy. My grandmother is trying to play it but the Gong never appeared and she cannot pick up the padded stick. So she is going to have to start over from scratch. It's old enough now they won't fix it so don't bother.
3576	1	a	Solid, fun game. The combat is very lacking and boring/repetitive (though the costumes are INCREDIBLE), but if you can push through that the rest of the game is very enjoyable, cute, and actually does a decent job of being reminiscent of going on adventures as a kid.
3914	1	a	Another quirky game put together by the Double Fine team. This time they put together a solid turn based rpg with some more of their well known humor. It's relatively short clocking in around the 5-6 hour mark but it was definitely worth a playthrough.   9.0/10.0
4292	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a grab-it-and-grow game similar to Katamari Damacy.  The story isn't really delved into in too much detail besides the song on the title screen. You're attempting to gather stuff up to save the world.  The gameplay provides for a fun challenge, but the game itself can be completed in a very short period of time. Getting all the possible A+ grades may take a little longer.   The controls are extremely basic. Mouse&amp;keyboard or a single analog stick on a gamepad. Note that the menu can't be controlled by the gamepad.  The video is restricted to a 4:3 screen size. I couldn't find any way to remove this restriction.  The music is a really redeeming factor in this game. A wide range of music for each level and gamemode.  There is a bug in that occasionally the 'puppet' will get trapped in the environment's objects forcing you to have to restart.  It's not the best game out there, but it is fun for a while. By all means get this game if it's on a sale. 
4204	1	a	An extremely fun, highly addictive game with elements of both a fantasy role-playing game and a puzzle solving app combined flawlessly. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys either genre. It's well worth the investment!
2129	1	a	Such a great Co-op game! In my opinion a perfect one! But it's a bit boring when you play by yourself! So, if you are going to get it, get somebody else to get it also! Other than that, this game has almost no flaws!
3990	1	a	Fantastic gameplay with amusing dialog and entertaining battle that never get stale. Fun costumes keep you wanting to find and collect them all. I highly recommend buying this game!
3320	1	a	A sweet little seasonal game that, despite infuriatingly repetetive QTE-based fights with unskippable animations, may just be able to keep your attention for long enough to remain enjoyable throughout.   I'm not from a culture where Halloween is celebrated much, but the design and mood of the game made me kind of regret that I never went trick or treating as a kid, which of course speaks all the more in Costume Quest's favour.
5386	1	a	Itâs a game, about invaders, invaders FROM SPACE. You could almost call them space invaders.  Yeah, it is a Space Invaders clone but it is still very good. It starts out slow but as the game progresses and you acquire better and more powerful weapons it gets faster and more intense. By the last world the game becomes a bullet hell shooter with many, many enemies coming down on you and shooting at you.  I fully recommend this Titan Attacks.
708	1	a	It's not a train sim damn it! It's a board game and everyone should buy it.
520	1	a	A great virtual adaption of the board game with a big mess to clean up. Online works well. I almost always play online with my husband. Single player mode works great too. Ticket to Ride is a great strategy game. The player who scores the most wins... lots of ways to score: completing routes, placing trains on the board, making the longest train, and more. Simple to pick up and get started, but with enough depth and complexity to keep you coming back for more. :)
432	1	a	If you're a fan of dual stick shooters already, waves is a very solid one. The gimmick here is that you can slow down time when you've charged up your meter enough, and this simple but satisfying mechanic really is enough to make it stand out. The avatar also has a bit of momentum to it, making it feel a bit different to control than other shooters.  Honestly, there isn't much to say. You probably already know if you like this style of game. It's fast-paced arcade action with replay value for as long as you can entertain yourself beating your own high scores. If you're looking for an exciting, flashy game to keep you entertained for a week or two, Waves is a pretty fantastic deal.
3556	1	a	Fun to play, simple and has a certain charm to it. Totally recommended.
2027	1	a	A great game, you should definitely buy it.
4943	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out. Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.   Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform. If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game. I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception. I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.  This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, 'Daddy, don't you dare!' We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. 
363	1	a	BEWARE TO ANYONE BUYING THIS GAME: This is one of the singlemost additive games of its kind. be prepared to waste alot of your precious time, as this will suck you in like a vacuum cleaner. The only thing I would like to see if a bigger variety in music, as good as the soundtrack is at the moment, it feels way too small (with having only 4-5 tracks). A music update with an extended playlist would be hugely appreciated :3
2800	1	a	Very fun and addictive game, must have this game on your Library P.S. the game will be very hard in late game if you play only one player and use all of your weapon + collect all of your money in game
2187	1	a	Great game to play with friends
2267	1	a	One of the greatest multiplayer experiences i've had. Insanely fun to play with a couple of friends. Pick between several different characters all with different sets of skills. Find one that suits your play style and just watch the hours melt away.
3917	1	a	Way more fun then I expected it to be, solid RPG elements and cool costumes make up for the mediocre story. Another reason to love Double Fine, now I just need them to make a sequel!
1004	1	a	Just bought the game for the Brony Mode XD I like the game ;)
1162	0	a	not what i expected 
718	1	a	More board games should be adapted to online play. When you consider the time and frustration involved with actually getting over to a friends' house to play I think we'll see more online board game nights.
2377	1	a	MGS: Multiplayer Edition
124	1	a	The most fun i had in this was trying to survive... I was never good at Puzzle Games Especially games that have a Rubix Cube, Space design.  9.75/10
1382	1	a	I do like this game but only since i got it for a 95% discount. it's nowhere near worth 14,99â¬. There are a lot of games under the 1â¬ line that are much bigger and complex but for the massive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ n giggles this game has given me i'd say i pay maximum 5â¬ for it.
166	1	a	A fun little puzzle game, quite addictive, and an awesome time waster.
5293	1	a	Cute style. Clever puzzles. Charming gameplay. Climaxing story  Overall a really solid game that doesn't allow you to jump, which can be a little frustrating, but it works.
761	1	a	The manliest game in existence, made for horrible horrible people
4094	1	a	Much like Final Fantasy, they keep trying to remake PuzzleQuest, but they just cant make a better puzzle game. This is the Bejeweled version of D&amp;D (Baldur's Gate) with a Final Fantasy Tactics inspired storyline (FFT was the best FF related game you didnt play other than Ehrgeiz ;). My second time buying this game and sixth time playing it through. (A+) 10/10 Killed Lord Bane in three moves, WOULD CRUSH DEMI-GODS AGAIN.   Ironiocly the fact that PuzzleQuest: Warlords is almost abandoned is a good thing. It isn't greedware spamming, intentionally trying to get you addicted or advertising anything. Its a relaxing casual game that will both challange and fustrate you in all the right ways. You can play this game for six months on one character campaign, and you still will be willing to play through a second time.   There are six Puzzle games by Infinite Interactive. This is still their best one. There is an X-pac (Revenge of the Plague Lord) currently not available on Steam at the time of this post, but there is a PC mod for it out there somewhere. Firemint now owns PQ so don't expect it to go on sale anytime soon and marval made its own version which is considered the best version since this one, but SCREW THAT GREEDY TEEN-POP NOISE.
422	1	a	10/10 Would run from hugz again This game is perhaps one of the most casual games in the casual section. Passive-aggresive narator? hilarious! help screen with an attitude? gut busting! purple rollys aimlessly want hugz orange rollys desperately want hugz and then the green rollys have an existential crisis over the matter!  while the hour count doesn't seem high each game is a fast-paced, short lived run and gun from geometric cuddles
4315	1	a	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-Katamari... I'mean, The wonderful End of the world!  It plays almost like any other Katamari game, is equally sick, and is equally fun to play!
5113	0	a	It's like they tried making Dungeon Keeper meets Dwarf Fortress but it's all just pretty bland and dull, held my interest for a little while before the seams started coming apart. Skip this one.
1838	1	a	Killing is not necessary. 10/10
1114	0	a	Snuggle Truck is like one of those Trials flash games made by some bozo. It seems like it should be fun in a Trials kind of way, but the physics are absolutely not up to it and the truck just kind of clunks around the terrain in the introductory levels before you uninstall it.
5437	1	a	suprisingly fun game... didn't expect to enjoy this game.
3497	1	a	This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters &amp; setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.  As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control &amp; others are defensive. It may sound unique &amp; interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal &amp; damage battle over.  I'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits. This game is fun &amp; charming &amp; I would recommend it, but I would say wishlist it &amp; wait for a sale.
2412	1	a	This game is very good. I originaly played it on xbox 360, and was instantly hooked. It was very well made, good for almost every kind of player.
91	1	a	Very very short and moderately difficult puzzle game. Approximately 30 to 40 minutes of play. Elegant, charming, and with an enjoyable aesthetic. Grab it for under $5 and it'll challenge and entertain.
3510	1	a	I played CQ intitially on XBLA, and when it became part of a Humble Bundle, I had NO hesitiations grabbing it again.  A PERFECT game for Halloween, and worth EVERY PENNY of its full $10 price. That's why it's listed as #1 on my YT channel's list of 'Top 5 Games To Play On Halloween'.   Simultaneously spooky and delightful, and a ton of fun. BUY IT! :-)
1534	1	a	This game is a favorite among my group of friends and I'm so glad they told me about it. It pairs strategic gameplay with the sudden panic of fleeing well. I love testing out each of the characters because my favorite literally depends on my mood. If I want to be sneaky, The Gentleman is perfect. If I'm likely to panic and run, The Mole or the Locksmith are great.
2282	1	a	This game is totally worth the money. The gameplay is unique and refreshing. The graphics/art style stand out and looks very nice. The soundtrack is ear-melting and catchy. The different game modes, time trial/ score run and characters add a lot of reasons to replay every last drop of content this game has to offer. Plus, there's custom user-made content to try if for some reason you get bored with the regular game. This game definitely deserves a lot more recognition than it's getting.
3368	1	a	Costume Quest is a carefully distilled J-RPG with a well written, light hearted story and solid gameplay. It's a good pick-up-and-play game in a genre that usually requires days of investment, with likeable characters and just enough depth. Normally, quick-action sequences ruin the pacing of a game for me, but they are well implemented here in a way that feels almost intuitive, if still a bit repetetive, after a few battles. When the main storyline wraps up, the included Grubbins on Ice add-on storyline lets you start with all your stuff from the main quest, and includes new costumes (character classes) and stamps (bonus abilities). I'd recommend this for kids or adults who don't need dimension-spanning save-all-of-time-and-space plots, ridiculously complex leveling systems, or spiky-haired, ambiguously gendered anti-heroes in their J-RPGs.
479	1	a	One of the best board to PC translations around, and the DLC makes the sometimes... eclectic nature of the game more accessible. Tunnels? Ferries? Dutchmen? What are these random markers? All solved by the included docs. Also, tons of drawings of trains. I do love me some trains.
4812	1	a	Nifty.
274	0	a	I've fell for recomendations but tbh this game is boring as hell. No campaign mode, no upgrades, there are LOTS of better twin stick shooters on PC. This one is pure garbo
4826	1	a	One of the best and most fun single player games I have played. Definitely recommend.
619	1	a	Best online boardgame. Small World is a good option too, they are made from the same developer
1521	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game.  I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.  So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.  This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try.  
1925	1	a	8/10
531	1	a	I have the actual board game and I can honestly say that, if you've figured out the menus, it plays exactly like the physical game. It's cross platform structure makes it so that you always have someone to play with online, if you buy it on sale it's ridiculously cheap and the music is great! I rate it 7/10, menus should be better.
1359	1	a	360Âº no scope headshot all of them, got no bonus points. 10/10 would r8 again
2379	1	a	Fun game to play with your friends. 4 playable characters type. Trying to steal stuff while making it out alive. :)
3980	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game.  
2719	1	a	One of the most enjoyable co-op games I've played. 8 unique classes that all have their own abilites that both work well with each other, and fit almost any playstyle. The campaign is straight up film noir, and the levels are very well designed. I haven't even touched any of the Workshop content yet, but that's coming in the future.
332	1	a	This is a very fun top down shooter! The music is great and the modes are avilable are fun to play as well!  Ifyou like top down shooters this is a good one!
1347	1	a	Game of the year, why would you play anything else? 10/10
4017	1	a	Cute and cuddly
3192	1	a	when you need casual game. play this game. it is a fun game at least for me.
4020	1	a	Short but sweet game coming from the creative mind of Tim Schafer, who is best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts and The Secret of Monkey Island. This game is a perfect play for Halloween (and the grubbins on ice during the holiday seasons). This turn based RPG is good for all ages. During the 6 to 7 hour game you go on a quest to save your brother/sister that has been mistaken for candy by monsters. The only way you can save him/her is to go around town trick or treating, getting candy and build costumes.
2416	1	a	One of the best co-op games I've played. It can get really challenging, so try not to rage on your team too hard!!
3248	1	a	Very fun and challening game. 151 levels to beat. Some are easy, some are not, and some seem impossible to beat. Good price, so give it whirl if you have the patience for games like this.
4185	1	a	How do you make gem matching fun? Turn it into an RPG adventure. I think Puzzle Kingdoms is better overall, but Puzzle Quest is pretty darn good too. Just one more quest...
5122	0	a	This game is dull and monotonous. The gameplay involves a large amount of digging which amounts to highlighting blocks to and waiting for your dwarves to dig them out. The exploration high that one would expect to get from digging is greatly lessened by the fact that there is nothing exciting to find in these underground complexes that you are digging out. The only part of the game that is fun, the design and decoration of a dwarven stronghold, requires grinding for resources by digging. The dwarves in this game are controlled mostly by the AI. When I play this game, I find that there are long periods of highlighting blocks to dig out and longer periods of waiting around for the dwarves' AI to respond. I recommend avoiding this game.
1135	1	a	Bought this came because I needed to make a purchase in order to get me some of those sweet cs:go skins. And let me tell you, I was not dissapointed. This is the cheapest game on steam at the moment, yet it's still fun, I dont know why. I'd recommend for kids, or casual gamers.   The sounds are awesome. Controls are a bit icky, but you get used to them. Gamemodes are fun. AND AWESOME PRICE.
5060	1	a	Eh it's an alright game, pretty simple to get the hang of. There are some cool puzzles I've never seen before, but I wouldn't pass it off as a kids game right away, regardless of all of the bright colouring and blantant simplicity to some puzzles. Drives me crazy because I'm a completionist, but its got some easy achievements.
4483	1	a	not as challenging as previous versions of this stalwart casual puzzler  69/100
1156	1	a	Baby sitting tool !
364	1	a	Recommended litttle game, fun if you are bored or just want something to do.
3283	1	a	Totally Addictive! If you a fan of logical puzzle games, the game will make you experience 'the physics' in puzzle. The graphics could look really basic but it make the game interesting somehow.
4689	1	a	Where Portal and Psychonauts meet.  It's a quite fun first person 3D physics puzzle platformer, where you acquire up to four different ways to affect the physics and thus what you can perform on a given level (e.g. the first one is the 'fluffy dimension', which makes everything on the scene lighter so you can e.g. actually carry all the normally too heavy stuff around; alas, the physics can get wee bit random at times, which may come in your way).  Heed my warning though: the platformer part is just brutal and unforgiving. Probably 3rd person perspective would work better.  If you try to limit the number of dimension shifts, you need smarts and sometimes patience, so it's good, but I sadly don't see myself getting the time constraints achievement.  Also, seems like if you want real closure, you'll have to buy the upcoming DLCs. Looks like there are even achievements for them already in the game!  Despite the mentioned caveats, you are bound to have some fun quality time with this gem.
4609	0	a	The game was really annoying, and the tutorial in this game was terrible. The game reminded me of a bad Incredible Machine
1796	1	a	This game is EPIC! its like PayDay 2. I just wish there were more guns... But still, this is a AWESOME GAME!
4849	1	a	Underrated, fun, clever, and a steal at the current price. I wish the DLC added to the story, but that was only because of my expectations.   Oh, and it features John de Lancie as the nutty uncle. Worth it almost just for that.
4422	1	a	Journey back in time with the 7 Wonders series to when magnificent structures were being built in far away lands. Enjoy challenging match-3 gameplay in a newly enhanced interactive environment where you not only learn about marvelous new wonders such as Stonehenge and Taj Mahal, but also watch them come to life piece by piece before your very eyes.  - Incredibly enhanced animation - New explosive power-ups such as the Single Cell Bomb, Chameleon and Timer Freeze - Seven all new locations to explore and Wonders to learn about - Strategically match, using a limited number, to get critical pieces down the board - Utilize a new shuffle option to refresh the board and keep the game moving - Take part in the construction by choosing what section of the Wonders to build first and visually see the progress on the screen and the game board
1286	1	a	  This game was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sick before. But the AI is terrible as of the most recent update :(  Please fix it you cuties  --------------------------  Edit: It's been long since fixed :) Great game pick it up with friends
2013	1	a	It is good
433	1	a	In this game, you can realise your fantasy of being a giant ball that shoots pellets. I know I did. I reccomend you buy this game on sale; I got it for a little under a quid, which is neato.  PROS: - Simple gameplay - Great music - Varied enemies - Awesome controller support - Witty menu text.  CONS: - Not really any cons, but the shooting can be a little finicky at times.

2770	1	a	Very fun and challenging, but a little on the hard side if played solo!
919	1	a	First impression: If you liked Puzzle Quest, but thought it was too slow, Legend of Fae is for you.  EDIT:  Second impression: First impression still holds. However, unlike Puzzle Quest, Legend of Fae is...well, easy. I seem to be done with the tutorial parts and have entered the actual meat of the game. You're given an option between two difficulties, easy and hard. I picked hard. Thus far, everything has been an absolute pushover. Each level has an 'expert' bonus target for completing it in a certain time and with a certain score, and I've been able to amply reach both goals on every level, often doubling the score and halving the time.  Not to say it hasn't been fun. It has. I'm just also waiting for my HP bar to dip below 90%, so that I actually need to heal myself.  EDIT:  Third impression: First impression still holds.  The game's difficulty has started noticably ramping up. It's still nowhere near 'too hard', though I have begun to miss score and/or time goals by smallish margins. Perhaps I spoke too soon on the too easy part.  There's also a bonus boss I unlocked a while back. I've tried it a few times, but it utterly destroys me every time.
93	1	a	Mrm, short. Way too short to even pay for it.
4888	1	a	Physics-based puzzle platformer in the same vein as the Portal games. Pretty fun.
4506	1	a	A very light-weight game that brings you back to a time where micro-transactions were nonexistant and you could happily farm, plant, whatever without having to hand over your credit card, watch ads or praticipate in a shady promotion...  A little history lesson: Before tablet games saturated the video game market with free titles you could download and turning out to be micro-transaction riddled hooplahs, we had games like this. Games like Plant Tycoon would often be found on gaming websites or the game sections of popular social networking sites where you could play the game on the website as a limited demo version or download a free full version for a limited time before a timer ran out and asked you if you liked the full game and if you wanted to buy it from their service.  Keep this history lesson in mind!  My personal history with this game: I was a lonely shut-in middle schooler... I had stopped going to normal school and spent nearly all of my time inside the house because i wasn't allowed to go outside. So i often played games on the internet on my old Windows XP computer. One of them was Plant Tycoon. I played it on a website called Shockwave . com which as described above - was one of those sites where you could play the game on the site as a demo version or download a full version for free that would ask you if you wanted to purchase the title from their server after a timer ran out. I always played the demo version, but i always found myself loving this game. It was perfect when i needed to get homework done or needed to practice my typing skills because it ran on real time. No needing to worry about pausing the game and coming back to it - it's a game you run in the background while you do your actual work. So when i saw the game on Steam all these years later on a Windows 7 laptop with wifi my nostalgia kicked in and i played the demo again, waiting for a sale on the actual title to happen...  But it never did...  For some reason this game never seems to go one sale, which was upsetting... But ultimately after arguing with myself, i spent a full 10 bucks on the title. But that proved to be 10 bucks well spent as if you're the type to justify a game's price with the hours you get out of it - you may find yourself sinking HOURS into Plant Tycoon... And don't let my current amount of gameplay hours fool you. I played the crap out of this game online in my middle school days.  And that brings us back to the history lesson from before:  Compare Plant Tycoon to any similar tablet game you'll find on your iPad or Kindle today... They may be free to download - yes - but then they'll ask you to either pay for some in-game currency with real money, subcribe to a service or you try to play for 'free', but then you end up paying with time - watching ads, doing fishy promotions, ect.  So when you compare the option of a pay-to-wait game on your tablet and Plant Tycoon on Steam - you're probably better off with Plant Tycoon.  The game has no micro-transactions that cost real money - everything you can buy you can buy with in-game currency. It runs on real time - yes - but there are options to decide how fast or slow that in-game time moves and there's even an option to stop the clock entirely - a good option for if you're going to bed or know you won't be touching your computer for a while. The price may seem high but when compared to similar tablet games you end up with a better deal in the long run... This is really a 'mom' game. This is the kind of game that requires patience, so feel free to run it in the background while you work, cook or do any other time consuming activity you can't normally do while playing games.  10 dollars is still a bit much for such a light-weight and somewhat dated game, but it doesn't ever seem to go on sale... It might be one of those rare titles that only goes on sale very few times a year? If you can snag it on sale - by all means do it. But if you or your kids are sick of tablet games that are constantly begging you for money or bombaring you with ads and you need a pay once - play forever alternative: Plant Tycoon is your game.  Plant Tycoon gets 5 out of 5 from me both with and without nostalgia goggles.
2907	1	a	The game is full of fun and is worth the dollar an hour cost, because of the mods added.
5038	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
2095	1	a	  6.5/10 TJBs
1105	0	a	A simple racing/physics game.  Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.  The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.  Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.
665	1	a	I purchased the Complete Pack for me and my wife. We have Board game with the USA, Swiss &amp; India maps (with the 1910 expansion) and love them. The online version, to me, is a lot faster than the board game and you can play with other and/or AI. The maps are diverse, not only in their geographic location, but also gameplay. We played the Asia map last night, for the first time, and it is very different than the other maps we have played.
5069	0	a	It's like they took everything about the first game and went, how can we make this less user friendly. Typing options for fit-words removed, replaced by the extremely laggy and hard to use drag interface, spot the differences removed in favor of the much more annoying and badly designed find small shapes in large squares, link-a-pix ultra zoomed in (presumably for the master puzzles) but no options to zoom out, and god forbid the arrow keys dont bug out and freeze in the middle forcing you to drag across, which just reacts badly with your already filled in squares. Illogically phrased crossword questions forcing a dragged out internet search which often doesn't help (this was in the first one also but was mildly annoying at best, and just adds to annoyance now), any typing puzzles now skip letters filled in instead of you typing out the whole word (especially annoying if you have a word wrong). Puzzles are actually quite good if you disregard above issues, with a nice gradual difficulty increase as you go, or the master puzzles are a good option for a challenge. Buy it on a good deal, I got it for 85% off which is an ok deal, 90-95% would be the best to aim for though.
1872	1	a	Monaco is a fantastic game with great level designs that can be tackled in numerous ways. Every class has its own methos to get through each challenge and to work together. A note however is the beginning parts start of rather easy, however the challenge lies in getting all the coins(cleaning out). For a great experience make sure you have a friend to play with and enjoy yourself in the heist of the century!
750	1	a	600 hours in and it's still amazing. Great if you love the board game.
4739	1	a	Definitely worth the purchase, this is a must play especially if you enjoy Portal. You solve puzzles just like in Portal but with different dimensions instead of portals. Very fun and awesome game plus two DLCs coming out soon, what more could you want? Play it now!
2969	1	a	This game is too fun to exist. Why doesn't everyone have this?
5481	1	a	Beautiful game to have a good time!
402	1	a	This game is AWESOME. its super fun and its worth the money. it is well made and is just, GOOD!   PROS: well made good graphics (i love it)  NOES: CAN be hard to learn how to play CAN be laggy the menus can be hard to work with  RATE: 8,5 / 10
4396	1	a	If you ever played the katamari games and liked them then this game is a must buy.
4012	1	a	I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after. If you're wanting a mature in-depth game with vast arrays of landscapes, character development and difficulty this is NOT the game for you. This game is more of a kooky sweet family-friendly game to pass time with.  I'm a bit of a completionist and so I found this a fun simple game for completing the cute quests and unlocking the different outfits- it's not particularly difficult/complex but it can keep you engaged for a good 5-15 hours. I'd recommend it for when it's on sale at about $5-$10 as a cute game to whittle some time away with- but it's not something I'd want to pay $15+ for (as there are other more in-depth engaging titles for around that price instead).  People have complained that it involves childish jokes; however, to me it was no more childish than some of the original Dragon Quest games and so if you can put up with some of those jokes you can easily put up with (or even appreciate) these ones.  I found the premises of the game (go door knocking at houses, fight monsters, collect candy, unlock outfits to progress further through), unique enough. It is somewhat repetitive, however I feel that they've balanced this by making the game a short one with three parts taking place in three different areas. To me the game length is perfect - you wouldn't want it to be much longer as you'd get bored of the lack of variety but it has enough different elements to keep you entertained for the length of the game. I'm someone who really likes playing side-quests and mini-games so I appreciated the card collecting, bobbing for apples, finding the hidden children quests, etc they had. And I appreciated playing Grubbins on Ice as whilst you could see it was made off of the same kind of gameplay ideas it was different enough to keep my interest.  I thought the battle graphics were endearingly sweet- although it does involve turn based combat and unskippable animations which may frustrate some players. So- if family friendly games aren't your thing I'd recommend skipping this game. If you're after something short, sweet, unique and like mini-games then this might be the game for you.  But if you're really not sure if it's your kind of game maybe watch a bit of a playthrough or a few cut scenes on the community board. I did like this game, I would recommend it, but I'm also wanting to write this review so that those who wouldn't find it appealing can be more likely to leave it alone and not come here complaining about having 'wasted their money on a kids game'.
1283	1	a	Forget all your skill in every other game, this is the real deal.  Intense action packed snowball throwing, yellow snow free.   Airshotting a penguin will now replace every trick shot you've ever imagined yourself making. This intense action AAA title will blow your socks off
5156	1	a	Super addictive and enjoyable Virtual Villager type city builder. Fun campaign mode and sandbox mode.
2537	1	a	Best coop game since sliced coop games!
351	1	a	Waves is a great example of what's possible with UDK from an indie perspective. It enjoys beautiful visuals and fast paced action.
5458	1	a	Great game, would buy again
3911	1	a	I don't know about other people, but I think Halloween got me more excited than any other holiday, even Christmas. There was something fun about 'being' something else for a night. Also, the pails full of candy. Double Fine does a wonderful job portraying the things I loved about Halloween as a kid while also giving me things to appreciate as an adult.  The art direction is top notch. There is a very consistant design aesthetic that carries through the entire game, one that would look right at home as part of a Halloween cartoon special. The character design eschews realism for expressiveness - not quite to the completely distended extremes of Psychonauts, but still not aiming for 'realism'. The main characters are kind of chibi, which is great because it allows for a remarkable expressiveness. Par for the course in a Double Fine title, the dialogue (all written, no voice acting) is really sharp and loaded with humor both obvious and subtle. The background music tends to be fairly repetitive, but it's atmospheric and compliments the visual design. Shades of Danny Elfman, which is a *perfect* choice for Halloween.  The game itself is a turn-based RPG but with active, timing based offense and defense boosts. It's very similar to Super Mario RPG (which, if it didn't innovate that style definitely codified it) in how it plays out. Actually, of any game to compare the gameplay to, I'd compare it to Hothead's Penny Arcade Adventures. It's funny, Ron Gilbert came over from Hothead just a month before the game was released - he didn't actually have any direct impact on the game, but given Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert's long-term association, I can't but help think he cribbed from his friend's design. Which is fine because it worked then and it worked in this game. Add in a dash of Earthbound, in being able to engage with enemies on screen before the turn-based battle begins, and you've got a tried-and-true formula.  The costume transformations are fun and the special powers associated with the costumes are anywhere from 'useful' to 'hilarious', in the case of the Lady Liberty costume. One thing the game could be dinged on is a lack of variance in combat. There's only one special power per costume, and a handful of optional 'third powers' that can be added. In actual practice, a lot of combat could be completed by just attacking, waiting for the special attack to power up, unleash the attack and if anything is still standing repeat the process. The combat is thankfully fast-paced for a turned-based RPG, but it can get somewhat repetitive.  I could harp on a few other things. The game is short - even if you explore and find everything, expect 5-6 hours at most if you're able to win most battles (and you probably will). Of course, as an adult with a job, short isn't a crime for me, but those who hear RPG and expect 99 hours of playtime will be sorely disappointed. The story is simple, which fits a game about a bunch of kids on Halloween night turning into their costumes and saving their sibling and their candy stashes, but there could have been a little bit more meat on the story's bones. Characterization was strong and it goes a long way, but the world of Costume Quest is charming enough that I felt like I was missing something to not get more. The environmental 'puzzles' are barely a challenge and the solutions are nearly flat out stated by some NPCs who might as well add 'GET IT?' to their obvious, pun-based solutions. Then again, it's a great entry level title for children. For adults, you'll probably find the puzzles and their solutions too, too easy.  But those are quibbles. Costume Quest is one of the most charming games I've played. It's got a great atmosphere and great idea for a game that ends before the shtick gets old. The game also, I might add, is fairly diverse in its characterization and does not limit costumes amongs the PCs by gender. Yes, Double Fine, I noticed, and it's an awesome thing to see game designers implement.  I definitely recommend this game to people tired of gray-and-gritty, guns-and-guts gaming. The game will make you smile. It's no challenge at all, if that's how you want to measure 'worth' in a game, but the wit of the game and the clever concept will make the game worth the price of admission in my opinion. It's a perfect compliment to the season and if you have even the barest interest in RPGs - or have never played one before and want one to try that isn't going to overwhelm you with entirely new gaming concepts - you'll enjoy the game. And just like Halloween candy, don't rush the experience. Savor it instead of gobbling it all down at once. I get the temptation, but you'll just get a tummy ache if you do!
1072	1	a	More entertaining and challenging than you might expect going in.
352	1	a	Easily compared to Geometry Wars. Ive played both and this by far a better game. Music and controls are top knotch. Just wish there were a few more tracks. Easily worth the $10 or so I paid. Graphics looks great, especially when everything gets hectic and 360 controller works perfectly.
2616	1	a	I think some people will like this game but its not for me. I only played about 10 missions and it just didnt grab me in any meaningful way. I dont think its a bad game so it stills gets a thumbs up. Its kind of like Hotline Miami with less challenge and tension.
4117	1	a	i play this sometimes
1384	1	a	Hi Im Steve Love me like I love this game
4080	1	a	Great game, I've spent lots of hours playing it. The RPG mechanics make it my favorite match three game. Helps time go by faster. 10/10
2105	1	a	This game is great for a bunch of messing around with your pals or by yourself, it's even better if you're all bad at it.
2902	1	a	4 player coop makes this game full of robbing, heisting, escape and betrayal all the better. A+ would play again and again
4666	1	a	Shortly: Love a good cartoon? You're welcome :) Love a good puzzle? Close the page :(  Pros: visuals and such: stunning design, not bad graphics, nice atmosphere and jokes, John de Lancie as Professor Quadwrangle, original story, price Cons: actual gameplay: pretty short (there are some DLCs out there though), not many good puzzles, requires more jumping skills than thinking ones, freaking tons of blur  The long way: I love this game. Yeah, that simple, just as simple as the game is. It has nice design, good 3d-cartoon-like graphics and jokes which are really good (well, sometimes they aren't, but nothing is perfect in this world). The main problems are the puzzles and length of the game itself - I've run through it in ~6 hours, but I haven't got 100% completion though. Now about the puzzles. They are simple as well, but that's not good this time. You won't find any really hard-brainsmashing-cool-etc puzzles in this game - all of them are considerably easy. Also, this game has a lot of platforming. I like this, but you may not if you're looking for a brain challenge.  PS: I'm sorry if my English is bad, it's not my native language.
4709	1	a	As you probably already know, Quantum Conundrum is a new game from Kim Swift, the creator of Portal. And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 'dimensions' (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game. One other note - in addition to puzzles, a significant degree of platforming skill is required throughout (just something to be aware of). Great game... highly recommended!
441	1	a	If you have a controller, get this game. It's fun to play with a great art style, no idea how they can keep dropping it so low in sales it's such a great game.
5249	1	a	You may think that this game is for kids only, but if you think so, then you are clearly wrong. I am not really a big fan of puzzle games, however I have once gotten a discount card (or whatever those things are called) and the trailers looked pretty promising, so I grabbed it, and I do not regret it. Every level is thought out very nicely and I love how the game combines a platformer with a 2D map which lets you go in many different directions, while still being a 2D platformer. The graphics are really cute and so is the soundtrack and the puzzles have just the right difficulty. While not being so easy that you don't have to use your brain they are also not so hard that you give up and never play again. I can only recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to solve the puzzles together (in my case a younger sister). Honestly, I have not been as addicted to a game in a very long time, if you are standing on the edge of whether or not you should buy this game; if you have someone else to play together with, then buy it. You will not regret it.
2032	1	a	Reminds me of pacman but if you could stealth around the ghosts. Clever ideas and really awesome multiplayer.
1393	1	a	There is nothing more to life than Penguins Arena: Sedna's World.
698	1	a	If you like Ticket to Ride the board game, then you won't be disappointed with this computer version because it's exactly like the board game. However, there are two issues that I have with this game. First:  Pros Exactly the same as the board game Single player mode Multiplayer mode Fun sounds No annoying narrator telling you the same thing over and over DLC giving you access to more boards  Cons Some of the achievements are impossible to obtain Many of the achievements are hinged on buying the DLC  At the time of this review, this game was selling for $9.99. Well worth it in my opinion. If you want all of the boards, you will get a discount if you buy all of the DLC at the same time.
4350	1	a	Although this game may not seem like much on the cover, it's one of my favorite games in my steam library, and that's saying something since I have over 500 games! There's something oddly therapeutic about running around and sucking everything up that's smaller than you until you're large enough to consume anything. Dejoban Games is quickly becoming one of my favorite indie devs.
3619	1	a	Although it becomes predictable with its trick-or-treat segments that end being repeated multiple times and very straightforward pacing with simplistic combat system, Costume Quest still succeeds at being extremely funny thanks to sharp yet obviously aimed at children writing and nostalgia it may invoke with the player... provided you ever participated in the custom, of course. It's also a bit on the short side when compared to similar games, but the overall package is very likeable.
2893	1	a	best to play with random newbie, yes, blow everything
5095	0	a	Basically the young cousin of both Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.  It was fun for a few hours, that's the best I can say for it. I much prefer the similar game 'Dwarfs?!', which has worse graphics but crisper, balanced play.  You might enjoy this game if you just want to build something cute.
3774	1	a	This game has become a seasonal staple for me around Halloween. It's art and music is perfect, and engenders that nostaglic feeling of being a kid in a costume. You're not wearing a cardboard costume, you ARE a spaceman, or a ninja, or a robot.  Really fun, and memorable.  
2474	1	a	Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.  When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.  The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.  The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.  The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another.   If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.
226	1	a	Probably my new favorite arena shooter. Not a complicated experience, but an enjoyable game to pick up and play, whether you've only got a few minutes to spare, or a few hours. It's a lot like Geometry Wars with more than one mode of play, and with the mechanics tweaked a bit so that the game gets more exciting and rewarding the longer you play and the better you become. The demo is highly representative of the overall experience, so do yourself a favor and check it out. I managed to snag this for $2.50 during a Daily Deal, but if you're into these sorts of games, the asking price of $9.99 isn't shabby considering the insane amount of fun I have with it.
3889	1	a	Very charming RPG, with a heart and sense of humour. It's a must, specially for the price.
4711	1	a	This game looks and feels like Portal 2, but is much longer and has it's own very unique game mechanics. If you really liked Portal, but thought it was too short or was lacking something: try this. It's very fun.
5286	1	a	offers some real nice puzzles
2099	1	a	Good co-op experience.
3200	1	a	Pretty funny but music is way too loud.
4434	1	a	+
3445	1	a	A classic in my opinion. This made me excited for Halloween probably more than decorating or getting my own costume and such. A great little game with RPG elements, but a unique style of its own.
1511	1	a	The gameplay and story is essentially about 8 characters who are all criminals, looking to steal some stuff. The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable.   Though single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.  I would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth a purchase.
1291	1	a	Do you like penguins? Liar. Everybody likes penguins.  P.S. I also once found 2 servers playing this game simultaneously. I think it's a world record.  P.P.S Got it for free, anyway.
2075	1	a	Great game, if you can pick it up during a sale for only $8, its a steal. Even at $15 its a great price for the game. It is fun single player and even better with friends. If you pick it up we could play it together too! Love the graphics and art style, and the gameplay.
1675	1	a	I wasn't sure what to expect from Monaco, whether it would be more arcade or more realistic. And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.  When you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into âCampaignâ mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode.   The gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.  Pros: Menus move very smoothly. The graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent. The objectives are always clear. You can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose. All campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer. The controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller. There's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play. It's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.  Cons: Gun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload. The co-op community is not as large as I had hoped. Guards are almost too easy to get past.  So, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale. 
3801	1	a	RPG elements rolled into a fun little package. Very happy with my purchase
4776	1	a	Cute gameâfor a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
4190	1	a	bejeweled with rpg style battles
951	1	a	This was an interesting hidden object game. As opposed to the usual one-screen puzzles in other HOGs, this has huge side-scrolling, vertical scrolling, and zoom-able puzzles that contain hundreds of potential objects, of which you need to find 15-20, many of them tiny or partially-obscured. It is especially difficult considering there is no delineation between the foreground and the background, so clickable items can potentially be on any pixel of the screen.  Being a Victorian-set, European-produced game, I also found the items weren't always labelled with word choices I recognized. I ended up having to use the in-game hints for a handful of French, Italian, and archaic historical terms. However, there is no penalty for using the hint system, and the game features several levels of hints, with the 'I need a slight nudge' level recharging faster than the 'just find this thing for me because I give up' level.  The plot feels almost like a maguffin to get you to solve puzzles, and I don't know if it quite resolves itself satisfactorily. Also, even though the protagonist is supposed to be a 'strong female character,' it doesn't really feel like she's a hero because she spends the majority of the game being bossed around, patronized, and tricked by other characters, and having to clean up after their messes. On a related note, there is a recurring plot-point of 'hidden object puzzles only exist because all of our characters are either slobs or victims of disaster.' All of the hidden object scenes look like they just dumped a random assortment of junk all over the landscape, with no real rhyme or reason to the layout, and no location-specific theme (except for one gimmick level that was hilarious).  All that being said, the art was beautiful, the few mini-games and point-and-click sections were intuitive enough, the voice acting was hilariously over-the-top, and the music was cinematic-quality. It also does a pretty good job of maintaining a steampunk atmosphere throughout the game. Additionally, unlike other HOGs, this has almost no backtracking. You simply either automatically advance to the next area, or you click on the map to jump to a puzzle of your choice from the available options.  For a casual time-waster game with no achievements to worry about, it is worth a chance if you pick it up on sale. While the hidden object scenes are definitely challenging compared to other HOGs I've played, I appreciate the scope of what they tried to accomplish with the scrolling views.  Overall, I would give this game a 5.5/10
4468	0	a	Very, very short and buggy hidden objects game. Really disappointing even when sold as part of cheap bundle.   This scrapes through with 30/100
5421	1	a	Nostalgia city with this game. A retro arcade 2-D shooter that's super fun and addicting to play. The pixelated aesthetic of the game brings back memories and is a refreshing trip down memory lane you didn't know you wanted until you play it. It's simplistic in every way, but a blast to play none the less. Give it a go! It's a new age space invaders you know you want to try!
5347	1	a	Fun, classic game with upgrade ability.
1147	1	a	great game for having fun with friends
3792	1	a	Very cute and addicting game. Story is very nice.
2471	1	a	yes this game so good  in the game your like little heisiters that are funny :D to play with friends its more FUN! try that game you dont have something to lose i RECOMMEND THIS!
1492	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine captures the thrill of pulling off the perfect heist. When Monaco is working â when two or more people are picking through its stages, evading traps, conking out guards, and breaking into dangerous territory, it clicks like an expensive safe. It nails the white-knuckled, Hollywood heist motif with style. But you're going to need like-minded friends â and a whole lot of patience â to get there.
3861	1	a	This is just a cute game to play. If it is on sale, check it out.
2292	1	a	Fun multiplayer stealth.
1367	1	a	A war fuelled solely from racism alone pits up to 4 different colours of penguins against eachother in a fight for dominance over an iceberg that varies from map to map. Not a bad game.
11	1	a	A fun 2D platformer that provides sufficient challenges to frustrate yet reward the player at the same time.  The game is easy to play bar from one or two of the later levels that see a difficulty spike.  Trying to achieve a perfect score on every level kept me coming back for more, yet it never felt like a chore; more like a fun way to further enjoy the game.
3670	1	a	A fun, casual game. Lots of make you smile moments packed into an adorable presentation that screams PLAY ME. The combat very rarely feels dull or drawn-out. If you're an adventure game or RPG fan at all, you really should treat yourself to this lovely experience.
4025	1	a	This is a great game for newcomers and veterans alike. I think it is a great twist on a concept that we all know as kids, both trick-or-treating and the wild imagination of children.
3737	1	a	Good game, lots of fun. I could only wish for more levels.
5282	1	a	An utterly ingenious metroidvania puzzle game - made even better with enhancements! One of my absolute favourite games with gorgeous graphics, incredible music and fantastic gameplay that doesn't hold your hand. Brilliant!
1065	1	a	Funny jump and run, with all the little twists one would expect. :)
3180	1	a	Having played Obulis on mobile and now on PC, my best reccomendation for potential players is this: Stick to mobile. The PC version is bug-free, well made and graphiclly beautiful, making it stand out against many other indie games avalibe; however, it is cumbersome to play on a PC as you drag your mouse in complicated routes to guide balls into their holes. I will give it a reccomendation, but for the mobile version not the PC edition.
2662	1	a	Fun multi or single player stratagy escape game with smooth gameplay and cool 8-bit graphics. A must buy.
1169	1	a	Fun gane, I love the pace it has, too bad there ain't not any players online!!! try it !!!!!!!
2879	1	a	Its good fun with friends for the price you pay
2970	1	a	Its everything I could want in a heist game. You have to plan out and be smart about your moves or just run out and leeroy jenkins it like a real desperate thief. You also have to decide which character is the right one for the job or for the team.  It gets harder and harder ever level that you'll spend hours on it.  Their accents are also hilarious!  -Le Guard
1728	1	a	Monaco is the game that I started to play with my wife. It has been only 3 month that we married and she got her first steps on gaming culture, so I was a bit suspicious about how she will gonna interact with this game. I can't find true words maybe in shortest way, but It Was Amazing, Full of Fun! We were shouting each others about what we doing for each other whle playing game feeling whole adrenaline rush while running in corridors and hiding from swat guys etc. It was enormous feeling and fun to spend together with keyboard - gamepad while looking on same screen. I just wish to thank dev's team who gave us this beautiful time and opportunity to spend together.  My only con note about Monaco is, there is no way to play 2 people on same-screen whle online... We cannot setup 2 different gaming pc at home which I dont believe as 'standard' around, and we wish to play 2 more people in our team, so we couldnt understand technically why this is not possible... But generally, awesome game.... Awesome!
1575	1	a	Monaco is a very unique heist game with great stealth elements. Every class has a different way of outsmarting the cops. Also, the game has pixel graphics, meaning you can bring your friends that don't have high end PC's along for a unique crime spree!
2922	1	a	A cheap game that's not too hard to pick up, but it's still plenty of fun to play with friends.
2381	1	a	Aight
847	0	a	'Pay to play' requires constant purchase of in-game currency in order to continue playing on any but the free maps.
1739	1	a	It's like Payday in 2D.  Much friends = Many fun
4590	1	a	At first glance, Unstoppable Gorg may not appear to deviate far from other tower defense games, and in certain ways, it doesn't, but the rotating tower mechanic as well as a challenging difficulty make it nevertheless a great game. Then, there are the trappings. The 50's sci-fi theme is a joy to behold, and the sheer polish is just icing on an already tasty cake.
4982	1	a	Awesome logic game i really liked it.
3848	1	a	Fun game in the style of a classic rpg.
2600	1	a	This game is as good as the movie The Italian Job
3718	1	a	Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.  And the long one: Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.  9.8/10
4863	1	a	imagine portal if it was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2358	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
2857	1	a	Awesome Game. Nuff Said.
4954	1	a	Lets face itâ¦ this is a portal clone of sortsâ¦ the thing is, itâs a GOOD portal cloneâ¦ you fiddle about with the environment and, to some extent, the physics to solve puzzles room to roomâ¦. Not a bad way to kill a few hours!   But itâs really hard not to see Q talking to Captain Pickard :)  
988	1	a	Even better (and longer) than the first one. The plot gets a little silly in the latter half, but the puzzles are unique and fresh.
287	1	a	I really like the game but it kinda gets boring doing the same stuff over and over again. Nice soundtrack though.
1585	1	a	You can break through walls. 10/10
2542	1	a	This game is an awesome fun to play alone or with friends, if only it was for free...
381	1	a	Alot like Geometry wars, but in a good way. if your in too high scores and easy/challenging fun, this game is for you.
5356	1	a	I'll start by saying this. 'I didn't like space invaders'. You can all call it what you will, but I thought it was fun for a quick bas, but nothing more than 30mins before the frustration sets in. Titan attacks is the re-imagined space invaders for the younger generation. After booting it up for the first time, the neon graphics took hold and determination set in to see just how much these developers wanted me to like there game. It has persistent upgrades to aim for, boss fights, different enemy types with differing attacks. It is essentially, it is still space invaders, just with a bit of makeup and sheeps fur. I have now played 10hrs and have fully enjoyed the experience. This coming from somebody who doesn't like space invaders! 8/10
5153	1	a	It's not as far as good as Dwarf Fortress, but hey... At least it has an interface. It's okay game.
638	1	a	As good as the actual board game!
2763	1	a	This game is great provided your team isn't poopy at it
5459	1	a	This game is a passtime game that can be more fun than most games for some reason, dont know why but its made perfectly and I would recomend this to anyone but even more so to retro minigame fans
3218	0	a	Just awful.
4113	1	a	The match three game that started a revolution. RPG and Match 3 what is not to love. Well worth your time.
937	1	a	Charming visuals, surprisingly fast paced battle, all under the guise of a match-three puzzle game. Making it through each stage gives points to level up the special things that happen when you destroy gems, and there is actually a story to follow along with as well. Considering the dearth of reviews this has is sad, because there is a sweet and interesting game to be played here, and anyone who enjoys a good story and some fast thinking puzzle game action should grab this up.
4792	1	a	Brilliant! Almost as good as Portal 2 :3
4392	1	a	I kinda wanna say 'no' on the recommendation, but I also kinda wanna say yes.  Katamari Damacy is a great concept. It's hecka colourful and fun and wonderful and brilliant and catchy and charming... and kinda dark too maybe just a bit...  This is not Katamari Damacy. I mean... in all respects gameplay wise it's basically a poor man's Katamari Damacy... on PC. because KD is only on playstation consoles. Which makes me somewhat sad. because I never got a chance to get them or play them. Any time I saw them for sale in a shop, preowned or otherwise, I didn't have the cash on me. Now my PS2 is all hidden away somewhere, unused. Loved, but unused.  And you know, this is a great game for a little while, the music's catchy, the gameplay's pretty fun, there's neat modes, there's a couple of secrets in theg ame to discover...  Supposedly the end of the world very literally is coming. Everything's gonna ...uh.... go... somewhere? I mean it's never really explained but apparently the world is ending. So as a benevolent goddess I guess, you send an avatar of your will to collect up as much of the world as you can to save it from destruction, using a cut down katamary damacy-like gameplay. Instead of having to worry about what direction you push a ball or what things are attached where so you can still move the damn thing, you can just run everywhere. Controls are okay, but a little bound by older game making decisions, but it's not really too complex to play regardless...  The weird thing is at first everything feels reasonable, you start super small, as the worlds continue you start bigger than before, and as you collect things you grow in size and can pick up other bigger things. Her's the odd thing though... You sometimes find yourself growing, and seeing BIGGER worlds outside the one you were in... and you end up wondering how far does this go? at one point you find out a city you were in is just a diorama in a shopping centre with a model train running around it, which you then start gathreing up... only to find that this TOO might have been a display on a table... but then time runs out and you are left with SO MANY QUESTIONS.  Actually yeah just on that I'mma recommend it. It's quirky, it's silly, it's short, it's still fun as hell.
4896	1	a	This game is like Portal, but without the portals!
32	1	a	Super Meat Boy, as imagined by Disney. Don't be deceived by the looks, this game is ruthless.
4395	1	a	Really fun indie game. It's essentially a knock off katamari, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun and a great buy.
563	1	a	It's a pretty functional port of the board game. Definitely get it if you see it on sale and enjoy the board game or want to try it.
5475	1	a	Ahhhhhhhh... the late 70's/early 80's... anyone here remember these names: Boot Hill, Asteroids, Berserk, Centipede, Defender, Galaga... and of course... SPACE INVADERS. Seriously... how can ANY old gamer that remembers what a real arcade is NOT love this game? It is Space Invaders on 'roids. And if you can't hear the balls being racked behind you, the air hockey puck slamming into the goal slot over in the far corner, or the relentless march music of the Space Invaders descending on you... you graduated after '87 and I don't wanna talk to you. :D
4453	1	a	Just as a heads up, this and a lot of the old Luxor games have issues running on modern Operative Systems.  You should try the demo and check if you can run it first.  In any case, if you happen to have bought it anyway and can't launch it (like me) you can workaround this issue.  Try making a Windows XP virtual machine and install Steam in it, then install the game. It's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, but it worked for me.  The game is great if you can actually play it.
831	1	a	As good as the actual board game.
2946	1	a	Killing people and robbing places all in a smal 2D game
2184	1	a	This is like payday mixed with hotline miami. 15/10
851	0	a	Love the game. Own a copy myself. But I aint gonna pay money in order to get maps that I gotta pay for again. It's why I don't play that many free to play games in the first place. Money eaters.
4911	1	a	Some great puzzles in this game. Yes, it's got similarities to Portal, but that's not a bad thing at all.
186	1	a	Rating 9/10 Overview: Twin Stick Arena Shooter  The Good:  +The game has an interesting premise. Killing enemies levels you up. Upon leveling, a score multiplier is randomly placed in the arena. Collecting this increases your multiplier by 1 permanently. Killing lots and lots of enemies in a short period of time also increases your combo meter. When your meter reaches 10 you get to drop a bomb that kills enemies in the surrounding area. You can also slow down time for a brief period if this get a bit too crazy. You add all of this together and you get a fun fast shooter .  + The game has plenty of interesting modes to keep you engaged. Each mode is vastly different from the last and offers plenty of different ways to play the game.   +Great music  + This game is the definition of pick up and play if you are looking to kill some time. Lots of replayability  The Bad:  - Some achievements are very hard to get   - Can be frustrating at times  Conclusion  Considering I got this game for one dollar, it probably is one of the better purchases I've made. If you love the genre then this is a fantastic game to add to your library. If your just a casual fan like myself then you will also find it enjoyable.      
1559	1	a	Really addictive game!
2678	1	a	This game is pretty fun. The early levels are too easy but one the difficulty ramps up lots of fun is had. Best played with friends
2624	1	a	GET IT. BEST 1.49 EVER SPENT!
1136	1	a	Great horror game.NSFW. Is very scary. Up there with Gubble. For more reviews, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you
2233	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Lockpicker is the best! Dem bones though...
2966	1	a	This game allows me to steal money and murder people, both legally.   If you've ever had terrible urges to do these things but don't fancy serving multiple sentences in prison, go ahead and buy Monaco.   Your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ will thank you later.
1171	1	a	THIS GUM (CHUCKLE) IS GREAT BUY IT NOW BUY IT FOR YOUR FRIENDS GIVE IT THEM AS A JOKE AND TURNS OUT ITS GREAT I WAS SCREAMING OUTLOUD AT MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY TRIED TO STEAL MY BLOODY STAR ITS GREAT BOUNCING ALL AROUND LIKE A MAD MAN BUY IT NOW WHILE ITS CHEAP ITS THE BESTEST GUM (CHUCKLE X2) IN THE WORLD
4636	1	a	Fantastic game 8/10
1770	1	a	Is a really fun game once you get the idea of the game, I would recommend it more in local with some friends, multiplayer you end up being tied and you'll end up repeating a lot of missions
3167	1	a	It's like Cut the Rope, but taken in a completely different direction. Whereas Cut the Rope had dozens of different ways to interact with the puzzles, in Obulis all you can do is drop marbles by cutting chains. But you need to cut them in the right order and with a strict sense of timing.   The physics of Obulis have no friction whatsoever. When looking at a level, you need to gain a sense of where momentum can come from and how to transfer that momentum from moving marbles to stationary ones. Sometimes it's easy to screw up the timing of a marble drop and need to repeatedly restart, which can get frustrating, but it's a skill you get better at if you play for long enough. There are also multiple solutions to most puzzles, so if you find yourself retrying a level for the 75th time, it means you're probably going for one of the harder solutions and you're missing an easier one.  If you're a puzzle enthusiast or an achievement hunter searching for a reasonably straightforward game to add to your 100% list, I recommend it. Just be warned that, also unlike Cut the Rope, this game is not afraid to pull out some difficult puzzles. There are a good 20 levels, especially near the end of the game, that will really give your mind a workout and make you earn that completion.
1897	1	a	Best Strategy/Co-op Game!
2085	1	a	GAWD! (Guard!) GAWD! (Guard!) GAWD! (Guard!)  10/10   stupid sounding french accents sell this game.
3664	1	a	A ~6 hour adventure/RPG that's fueled by a Halloween setting and the cutest of art direction. Enter combat by trick or treating or just by approaching enemies in the world as they stroll. Combat takes place on a battleground where your costume 'comes to life'. Due to how hackneyed and simple the combat is it does get repetitive quite quickly. In saying that, some of the abilities are hilarious. The costumes are fun and interesting but shout-out to the American costume for having one of the best abilities i've ever seen which gets a giggle out of me every time. All in all it isn't a revolutionary game. It's repetitive but it's one of the most endearing, charm oozing games out there.
195	1	a	WOW! This game was EPIC as it should! I got this game when I saw it was on sale, so I quickly buy it to see what's inside. I loved the graphics, but should be increasing the mouse sensitivity as the mouse sensitivity was a little low. The gameplay? Simple, but beautiful! In the game you should shoot AS much as you could because the virus (Usually the enemy, I used to call them 'Virus') always seeking to you, and that's the best part of the game. Eventually, the virus will grow up, spreading throughout the arena, then eventually, you could be killed by the virus. This game had so many game modes in it, but the only game mode I've played is Survival.  Oh! The music was awesome! I've been wondering where in the world I could get the music :v Anyway, keep it up! Beautiful Game, Beautiful Graphics at such a reasonable price!  Note : I've made a review of this game, check it out in  https://youtu.be/Z-GC1S8wf34   Thank You!
1508	1	a	Monaco - 'It's pretty good'
3752	1	a	So much fun! Great idea and fun twist to RPGs! Plus they are freaking CUTE!
2860	1	a	This game shines in co-op (local and online). Stealthy, thoughtful approaches usually devolve in to absolute messes and tons of laughs. Already had a few memorable moments and I've only played a short time.
484	0	a	A new Version is out. Sadly, now it's very buggy and feels unpolished.  Furthermore, the DLC prices are very expensive. The new board India costs currently just as much all the other boards together. I can't really understand it, because I bought the complete pack and now it's not complete anymore and I will never pay so much for a single board.  I change this review, when the bugs are fixed. This game needs a Patch for all these little problems. Because, I like this game and the loading times are now extremly improved.  If this game is on sale you can already buy it. :)  But not for the regular price for the actual status! :( There are sound bugs, cursor bugs (invisible mouse), (high score bugs?), crashes and more and still not patched.
3278	1	a	This game is proof that physics can be fun after all. The premise is simple, you are given colored marbles to get into the same colored pot. How you get them there is a perplexing, sometimes maddening but always a rewarding expierence. Using the available chained black balls and other elements of the level at your disposal, you try to obtain the needed momemtum to achieve this goal. Gameplay is easy enough to master. Select a chain by left clicking and cut it by right clicking. There are a number of scenarios and bonus levels to unlock. Picked this game up because it was a steal for under 50 cents but it's well worth about $5. An underdog that is a pleasant suprirse. If you like good old fashioned brain teasers, this is a game not to be missed.
4513	1	a	kinda cool, bread plants, crush bugs, pretty basic, nothing major
763	1	a	It could have been much better but it really is fun and addictive.
2556	1	a	Its a very good game 
1075	1	a	gameplay is fun, good casual game if u need a break from a more difficult game.
2821	1	a	Top-Notch!
1211	0	a	It's fun if you're a simpleton.
2569	1	a	Not a great buy if you are only going to play single player, but I suspect it is a lot of fun with others.
3146	1	a	Excellent Bro-Op Game. Great for it's simplistic and easy to pick up playstyle. Doesn't mean it's an easy game. Bring reckless friends to draw the bullets, while you clean up shop.
3436	1	a	Costume Quest is a classic RPG with turn-based combat mixed with Double Fine style. You play a child out on halloween teaming up with other kids and fighting monsters, all while trick-or-treating. Instead of the usual RPG equipment, the halloween costumes you wear transform into full size versions during combat, providing their associated powers to your characters. It all meshes together perfectly, as you would expect from a Double Fine game.  I'm not sure what else there is to say. It's cute, charming, and a solid RPG experience that doesn't feel dull and repetitive like many of these types of RPGs do. My only complaints are that the controls are a bit sluggish and the game is locked at 30 fps which will hopefully be addressed in a patch now that Double Fine has the rights to the game back.
4930	1	a	All in all, a decent game. It's obviously heavily inspired by Portal. Unfortunately, it can't quite reach Portal's ingenuity, even though several levels were really greatly designed. I didn't care for the rather flat humour. The story was nothing special. All in all, pick it up for a few Euros if you like puzzlers.
1483	1	a	Awesome 2D overhead stealth action thievin' game!  The only real issue I had with it is that it can be hard to get MP games going for the higher levels, as apparently a majority of the people never finish the first storyline.
4467	1	a	THey did a lot of RIGHT things in the is game. I like that i can use the hints to find the object i am looking for instead of a random object. I really like the little extra you get when leveling through game play. The game just makes sense, which is rare in some games in this genre.
5299	1	a	It's a fun and different little platformer with charming visuals and cute main character. Although not really worth 11 euro if you plan to just fly through the story as is it quite short, I can recommend it if you enjoy trying to solve every puzzle and finding all the hidden items.
1787	1	a	Me and my homies like to play this kind of game. We played it todai and we like the game. Have fun playing the game
3451	1	a	Really enjoyed this game.  Nothing amazing on the mechanics front, combat is essentially quick time events (not so bad as a core mechanic), so the skills is choosing a decent load out with your parties costumes. However, one will already be chosen for most fights due to it's main screen ability. This doesn't become much of a problem though, as nearly all the fights (bar the final) are rather easy.  This joy of this game is that it's cute and funny, and enjoyable to play. Not the longest game, but I wouldn't have finished it if it had been, so is a welcome length.  And that came off REALLY negative considering how muched I loved this. Let me stress, the style of this game is fantastic, and well worth a look. Will be more enjoyable if you enjoying hunting in corners for candy and costumes :)
1019	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â¥â¥â¥, 5 stars!
2926	1	a	Quite hard in the later levels but i like a challenge and this is a good stealthy game so i reccomend this game :P Also it's a fun game to play with friends
5068	1	a	I like the word search. There are a lot.
502	0	a	Buy the board game version instead. This game is built in Java and I don't have to tell you why thats a bad idea. Steam page doesn't mention this either...
3548	1	a	This is a really well-done game with a unique game mechanic, as you'd expect from Tim Schafer and Double Fine. They've clearly gone over the gameplay with a fine-toothed comb, and it's largely free of any serious annoyances (unlike, say, Psychonauts). I can't recommend this game enough.  After you finish the main game, make sure to play the included sequel, Grubbins on Ice, as well.
5323	1	a	Not for 12+. Yes. Not for 12+. But Interesting.
4949	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.  It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
783	1	a	THE BEST GAME! Play it with your mom! Play it with your friends! Play it with your mom's friends!  Really, you should probably play this. The interface is, well, not the best, but it's a pretty good take on the board game. The Ai doesn't work very well -- they have these weird behaviors that cause them to not finish tickets, or to just keep taking trains without stopping -- but the game is functional, the sound effects and music are entertaining. I consider this a good port.
366	1	a	This game is fantastic. I bought this hoping it was similar to geometry wars and it completely blew me away. I love the different game modes that you are able to play. Slowing down time is also a pretty cool feature and allows you to escape without using a bomb. If youre a fan of geometry this is a must!
2850	1	a	The perfect combination of stealth, asymmetrical character design and wackiness.
2716	1	a	Great game to play with friends.  Can rapidly switch from a sneaky hiest to a Benny Hill-esque sprint down a hallway dodging guards and bullets. Plenty of action, thrills, and laughs.
2460	1	a	A high octane, visually pleasing, pixel crime adventure. A game that is most enjoyed with groups of friends.
4263	1	a	Colorful, quirky, and very fun. It's an indie title very similar to the Katamari games.
5111	0	a	Dwarf Fortress Lite, for those of you who can't stand tiles/text based graphics. It's dumbed down to an incredible degree, to the point that it's almost insulting to play. It's intresting for a little bit, but Dwarf Fortress has a /lot more/ replayability, I doubt you'll get through the 'Story' before it becomes too boring.  At least Dwarf Fortress is Free.
1375	1	a	Best Game of the pack! Worth!
3704	1	a	Cute little game that is fun to play through. Plus, Halloween!
2362	1	a	Cooles Coop Game
735	1	a	This is a fun little game. Easy to learn. Quick to play. If you like good board game simulations, Ticket to Ride is one of the most faithful to it's origins. Be careful with the tutorial videos. They seem to lock up a lot, but other than that, I have had no problems with the game whatsoever. I love having it available when I only have 20-30 minutes to kill. I can play this and enjoy it.
5222	1	a	A masterpiece.  Toki Tori 2+ is like Metroid, except the enemies are replaced by puzzles and you never learn any new abilities. The entire map is available to you from the minute you start, and the only thing standing in your way is your brain.  I want to shake the hands of whoever designed this game. I've read that the developer went out of business due to poor sales, which is absolutely criminal.  10/10. Play it, especially if you enjoy exploring.
3170	1	a	Obulis is a fun, challenging game. I really like the design of the levels, it can make the levels simply hard. At first I skipped ahead of the controls you get when starting the first level, so I got confused on how to play. After that, I couldn't find a way to see the controls. So, check the controls... The art style looks just right for this game, and this game could be in my top 100 favorite games, right above 'Guitar Hero' and right below, 'Call of Duty 4'
1120	0	a	Nothing to look here...
1776	1	a	it's so much fun when you play it with your friends :D
5030	1	a	Just like puzzler world one, this game has an extremely large amount of puzzles to do. However, most all of the puzzles are pretty easy and none of them will really stump you. I'd recommend this game to just tease your brain a little and help you kill some time, or if you really like puzzles like I do. I could also see this as great for some younger kids or to entertain some nephews/neices or someone young.  puzzles: 6/10 (at it's hardest)  game: 9/10
362	1	a	This is a great game whit som fun put in the mix
3509	1	a	Charming RPG
4186	1	a	I can understand that most people would never give this game a chance because of it's name, but honestly this game is pretty much amazing.  The combat is a mixture of the match-3-jewel gameplay of Bejewled and typical RPG gameplay. The twist is the jewels you match translate into the mana you use for skills, and many skills inflect statuses on the field itself. It comes down to a surprising mix of casual and strategy, as you wonder if you should clear all the blue tiles to make other mana easier to collect, or if you should remove all red to keep your opponent from unleashing his best attacks? Where's the best place to remove a 3x3 area? If I remove this one, will it start a 4x chain? Will doing this avalanch?  The battle system is better refined in the sequel, Puzzle Quest 2, but future itterations of Puzzle Quest (of which there are a surprising amount) all fail in one major thing Puzzle Quest nailed: The sheer variety of things to do. Puzzle Quest has mechanics for taking over cities, capturing monsters, learning their spells, acquiring allies, and several other features that future games simply don't have. It is for these varities that make Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords the best in the series.   The last point to mention is that Puzzle Quest works with mods. It is extremely important to mention, however, that Steam's support for these mods is limited. While mods for the game work fine (and are easy enough for me to make, say, a new class in a day or two) and are generally pretty neat (the new items mod adds several items, each of which can completely change the strategy you use throughout the game), Steam Cloud undoes most of this effort as any backed up modded files will be automatically downloaded sans mods to any future computer- causing frequent crashes and problems for future itterations.
161	1	a	:)
3808	1	a	Perfect example of quality over quantity. Nice fun little RPG that has you battling monsters as super versions of your costumes. Simple but entertaining and made by Double Fine Studios. What more could you ask for? Unicorns, Yetis, and Flying Space Warriors you say? They have those too.
5097	0	a	I reallly wanted to like this game, but its just not that good.  The Digging is fun for all 5 seconds but then becomes tedious, The Levels take hours, im not kidding it took me 4 hours to do the first mission, Its VERRYYY slow paced to the point of me afk'ing whilst they digged, theres a Skirmish type game mode, but that's more a bug fest than anything.   I got this for Â£2 so i wont complain any more but i even felt that was steep.
1314	1	a	It you want a perfect mix between the best sellers of Call of Duty and Club Penguin, this is perfect for you.
4833	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a family friendly, less narratively interesting first person puzzler with unique and fun puzzle devices. My biggest complaint would be a couple puzzles toward the end of the game that are just miserable and lazy. The rest of it is fun and engaging if only for short bursts. This isn't a bad thing for a typical puzzle game but feels odd for a game which feels like it will grip you like Portal did, and never does.  The game is often compared to Portal, a better game, to Conundrum's detriment, but it has earned the comparison. It attempts a snarky, dark humored irreverent and unkind narrator. It has both seemingly deliberate 'puzzle rooms' and behind the scenes type puzzle sections, very similar to what Portal offered. The lead designer was one of the original Portal creators and I'm assuming she figured the formula was flawless. Well... It's not flawless but it is pretty darn good. If you're a game designer, consider playing it just to see how cleverly the dimensional swap mechanics can be used for physics gameplay.
5375	1	a	Simple fun... I did not expect much but at 50+ hours of gameplay it was worth the money (try to catch on sale).
4573	1	a	Just another campy-retro-sci-fi-space-orbit-tower-defense game.   I'm kidding. This game is fun, breaks the tower defense mold, and is occasionally hilarious. It's also very challenging.
1742	1	a	Mole stop doing this!!!
1792	1	a	The game i will bring on an island... (an island with a good bandwith^^)
4400	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is hard,but FUN! I like how it's similar to Katamari Damacy. The graphics are good. The gameplay is good. Although the Word Forge music is just 'noise'. This is a great game. Like AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! good.
123	1	a	A frenetic match 3 puzzler painted with vibrant color and absorbing gameplay. The object is to simply eliminate the cubes in the playing field before the field reaches Critical Mass. It's cheap, it's great and it's worthy so why isn't it in your library?
1052	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents.
235	1	a	This game really helped me get through alot of homework. The soundtrack is amazing as well.
3205	1	a	If you are in melancholic status, this game is getting interesting, so i recommend it.
2805	1	a	One of the best coop ever played, simply addictive like it's awesome music
1611	1	a	This game is like the movie Oceans 11 but in a top down comedic flavor and with a better story.  It's refreshing, has a ton of content and a lot of re-play value, because of the easy to use level editor.  Steal this game.
3347	1	a	This game is cute, fun and appropriate for all ages. The writing is witty and full of puns. 10/10 would recommend :)
3395	1	a	A game I enjoy replaying every October. Filled with heart and wit, this game reminds you of what it was like to be a kid on Halloween night, which, if you were like me, was a magical, mysterious night full of wonder. The battles can get a bit tedious, but otherwise, it's nearly flawless fun.
4026	1	a	I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after. If you're wanting a mature in-depth game with vast arrays of landscapes, character development and difficulty this is NOT the game for you. This game is more of a kooky sweet family-friendly game to pass time with.  I'm a bit of a completionist and so I found this a fun simple game for completing the cute quests and unlocking the different outfits- it's not particularly difficult/complex but it can keep you engaged for a good 5-15 hours. I'd recommend it for when it's on sale at about $5-$10 as a cute game to whittle some time away with- but it's not something I'd want to pay $15+ for (as there are other more in-depth engaging titles for around that price instead).  People have complained that it involves childish jokes; however, to me it was no more childish than some of the original Dragon Quest games and so if you can put up with some of those jokes you can easily put up with (or even appreciate) these ones.  I found the premises of the game (go door knocking at houses, fight monsters, collect candy, unlock outfits to progress further through), unique enough. It is somewhat repetitive, however I feel that they've balanced this by making the game a short one with three parts taking place in three different areas. To me the game length is perfect - you wouldn't want it to be much longer as you'd get bored of the lack of variety but it has enough different elements to keep you entertained for the length of the game. I'm someone who really likes playing side-quests and mini-games so I appreciated the card collecting, bobbing for apples, finding the hidden children quests, etc they had. And I appreciated playing Grubbins on Ice as whilst you could see it was made off of the same kind of gameplay ideas it was different enough to keep my interest.  I thought the battle graphics were endearingly sweet- although it does involve turn based combat and unskippable animations which may frustrate some players. So- if family friendly games aren't your thing I'd recommend skipping this game. If you're after something short, sweet, unique and like mini-games then this might be the game for you.  But if you're really not sure if it's your kind of game maybe watch a bit of a playthrough or a few cut scenes on the community board. I did like this game, I would recommend it, but I'm also wanting to write this review so that those who wouldn't find it appealing can be more likely to leave it alone and not come here complaining about having 'wasted their money on a kids game'.
3449	1	a	If Pixar could ever make a good game, it would be like this; nothing awe-inspiring, but a cute, fun little game that'll probably make you smile.
2627	1	a	This game is awesome !
4256	1	a	I would recommend this game if you enjoyed the Katamari series and really like abortions and cancer, as The Wonderful End of the World plays like an aborted early tech demo of Katamari that clawed its way out of the dumpster in order to take up chain smoking and drinking until its little body is so cancer ridden the only humane choice is to put a bullet in its malformed head. The game sure is colorful, at least.

1734	1	a	One of the best dugeon crawlers that i have seen. The goal is to steal every bit of money aka gold from the map while avoiding getting caught or by killing the guards. you can hack, break through walls, pick locks, etc only one character can break walls though.  4.9 out of 5
5024	1	a	I'm too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this game   10/10
2855	1	a	Great multiplayer, you have to work as a team, if you dont everything gets screwed up and it all becomes crazy, running and freaking out. so much fun, deffently wotrth buying.
764	1	a	It's a board game: the videogame.  If you don't know the board game, then it's a nice casual game. Very much the kind of game you'd play once now and again as a break, because it doesn't require much thinking but still stays fun.  If you do, then it's that. Exactly that, no extra features or whatever, but slightly faster.
1130	0	a	It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)
5383	1	a	Its like Space Invaders and Tanks had babies and gave them Power Ups like a StarSoldier style. I reccomend ANYONE this game. Its Addicting funny when you kill certain aliens But also difficulty is just right for this kind of game. Plus it uses controller as well if you wanna use Controllers.
316	1	a	It's beautiful with a retro type theme and an overall amazing depth with elegent lighting that'll make you stick on it like glue!
2302	1	a	Fun game; can get tricky with more than 3 people
1664	1	a	its awsome 
1278	1	a	A fun little game most recomended with friends. Also the next best source for MLG videos.
3388	1	a	Man, this is such a great game! Costume Quest is a really fun playthrough! It brings back the excitement of a mission on Halloween knight (Eh, eh, get it?) with a turn-based fighting style of gameplay! I really loved this game and all it's additions such as battle stamps and different costumes and the DLC! During your adventure you'll acquire different costumes and stamps that aply different advantages for your team in combat! Costume Quest might seem childish, but it's really hilarious and a must have for anyone who loves the turn-based fighting combat style.
2093	1	a	I've always been a fan of 8-bit games and this one is by far one of my favorites. Gameplay is very intuitive and addicting. There are endless opportunities in playing this game and the story is pretty interesting.  I'd reccomend this game to any gamer who owns a computer and mouse.
3092	1	a	Very fun, great with friends, downsides are the workshop and how dead it is.
2992	1	a	Fun game playing four friends co-op.
3351	1	a	well written and cute, casual RPG. COME ON
4089	1	a	Ah yes, the classic match 3 puzzle game. There's a lot i liked about this, but... holy hell, I didn't expect such a massive amount of grinding in a puzzle game!  Just about anything you want to do involves the puzzle grid. Want to make an item? Battle. Want to research a spell? Battle. Wander around the world map? Battle. Talk to a person who only says 'who are you?' Battle.   My first game completion showed 300 games won. Considering some matches can last 10 minutes, this gets old painfully quickly. Whereas Might and Magic Clash of Heroes felt short on battles, this game is the exact opposite. It really is obnoxous, especially when some quests will perpetually throw battles at you until you decide a different option. It almost sickens me to think that there's a bunch of other character classes I have yet to complete.  As the game goes on, you'll swear that the computer cheats. It almost always does an optimal move, and it finds ways to crank up its mana in few turns. Fortunately you can also become pretty godly, but it takes a long while to reach that point.  Annoyingly, most of the enemies scale to your own level. This basically means you aren't getting stronger, if your enemies are keeping up with you.  Note that there is an expansion available on the Steam forums for the game. Since the original company basically no longer supports the game, you can grab it for free.  Overall, fun at times, frustrating in many others. I'll give it a 8/10. It certainly kept me busy, and one day if I'm bored I'll probably revisit it for the hell of it.
5127	1	a	many fun hours of silly city building :) if you like to grind resources to make yourself a pritty throneroom, and all other fun parts of an underground fortress this is the game for you. combat is a little dull.  nice story mission count but would love more maps!
2431	1	a	9/10 Perhaps the best co-op multiplayer, where every member relies on each other yet is integral to how smooth the heist goes. Loads of player-created maps, as well as enhanced and zombie mode for every flavor of the game It's simple. Simpe and effective, with how you get and use items, yet each little nuance refines your skills. Loads of fun to speed run or be super stealthy  Negatives? A few times playing online the whole floor map appears and locks me in, so I had to make or find a new room to play. When everyone spreads out things can get reaally small, while already detailed--but to each their own, this is little problem to me. I'd recommend this game to anyone
3953	1	a	Very quirky, but it plays really cool. Pretty casual, but the fights need to be done with good timing on button pressings.
1725	1	a	This game will be amazing when you play with friends. So much fun will be had.  Problem is, none of my friends have it... and I finished everything solo -soooooooooo hard.
1705	1	a	With a colorful artstyle and a chaotic nature, this is a game where you seem not to know what is going on at any moment in time. Yes, I am here reviewing yet another four-person co-opertative. This is a very strange type of game through concept, but achieves enjoyment through being very chaotic, escpcially when all four players are present for the experience. There are multiple characters to play as, with each one having a special ability that assist the team in one way or another. You can play through the game either through the stealth means or running through it, getting spotted by the security will peforming said action. This video game was specifcally taliored for co-opertative, as having multiple individuals in the game at once is benefital to the success of the operation. If you are trying to play this without being spotted, it is very difficult, with their being a mass amount of security officer and civilans present on each level. There are ways to avoid said obstacles, such as vents and other means of traveling around. The gameplay is enjoyable, with teamwork infused into multiple actions, such as if a teammate was killed you will need to go to revive them and can not proceed without doing so. So, would I recommend Monaco, yes, as it is an enjoyable co-operative experience.
4241	1	a	I've never played any of the Katamari Damacy games, but having seen and heard much about them I knew I really wanted to try them out for myself. Sadly, there's no new games being released in the franchise and no way for PC players to get their hands on the originals. The good news is, someone else has stepped up to fill the void.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, if that's true then this game is seriously flattering the sh*t out of the Katamari Damacy games. But it at least doesn't feel like it's doing it in a gross or cynical way, more like paying tribute or homage to something well-loved and inspirational, making a game that they themselves would want to play and trying to maybe put their own mark on it in some small way. There seems to be a lot of controversy among the community over this fact, over how much is a true display of appreciation and how much is pure shameless rip-off. But strange as it may sound, ultimately, I don't think it really matters all that much here. It's fun and it's not stepping on anyone else's toes, so what's the problem?  Anyway, as for the game itself, there's a story about the world coming to an end and a girl deciding she's going to collect as much stuff as she can before that happens, seemingly with some weird marionette creation that she's controlling, but even the developers don't take this seriously and are just as dismissive of it as everyone else will be. It's pretty much forgotten about just as quickly as it's introduced and used only as a vague excuse to justify the gameplay, which is what this is really all about.  You'll start off as a small, nebulous cloud of tiny, white spheres in vague humanoid arrangement, then gradually absorb small items that you come into contact with, everyday objects like fruit or cans or gummy bears. The more you collect, the bigger you grow, and the bigger you grow, the larger the items you are able to absorb. To begin with you'll only be a few inches high, but by the end of the game you'll be gathering up entire buildings. It's a really satisfying sense of progression you get when an object you were previously bouncing off and being completely dwarfed by, is now a miniscule triviality stuck on the side of your leg.  In each stage you'll have a few minutes to gather up as much as you can and earn a rating at the end, getting a high enough rating in select stages will then unlock further ones for 12 in total (plus 2 additional hidden stages). The short time limit and small stage number makes this game pretty easy to get into for quick blasts of fun, but the downside is it makes the full asking price a little hard to swallow, doubly so given how slapdash and primitive everything looks. It really does look like a game from the 64bit era, maybe with one or two exceptions as later stages introduce new art styles that have a little bit more finesse to them... but only just. I feel like that's part of its charm, though, that it's intentionally bad looking and really not taking itself seriously, given that you're a weird cloud man with benches and dogs and people stuck to him. But if you're a graphics nut, this will likely offend your eyes and cause your ocular nerves great distress and you should probably go elsewhere. Although, if you do that you will be missing out on some great music, which is a much greater step-up in quality over anything you'll see in the game.  If you can pick it up on sale for a price that matches the otherwise cheap and cheerful nature of everything else here, then there's a lot of fun to be had for the hour or two it'll take you to finish. But really, having a blimp for a head or a skyscraper for a leg or becoming a walking ball of panicked people never gets old and is reason enough to try it. If this is really what the end of the world will look like, then roll on, Armageddon!
5449	1	a	Space Invaders. 'Nuf said.
2675	1	a	Wow, I didn't expect such an addicting game from the previews. I love stealth games as a whole, but this one takes the cake with the 8 character classes, each with their unique skillset.  **Play the tutorials on character classes and weapons before you start the missions**  It's fun and challenging for single player. But with teammates, it's even better: 1) They're there to pick you up when you fail, 2) They're hilarious when being chased by guards, and most importantly 3) Their abilities complement yours when going through the mission.  Great Multiplayer missions, challenging single player missions. Cool concept and through the roof execution. One of my favorite games, hands down.
378	1	a	One of the best twin stick shooter i've played in a while. If your a score junkee or you just like this type of games then i highly recomend it.
5528	1	a	If you enjoyed Space Invaders back in the day, and would enjoy the added bonus of power-ups in such a game, then this game is for you. Simple, colorful, proper challenge-to-advancement ratio, and most importantly: Fun to play. For the type of game that it is, I would give this a 10/10. -70sG
4769	1	a	This game will not only challenge your brain with elaborate puzzles that feel satisfying to solve, it will also give you quite a few laughs. 10/10 would buy season pass if it was available separately from the game.
602	0	a	The Steam version of Ticket to Ride is different from the Days of Wonder version of it. I cannot pick up extra destination ticket cards. For me the maximum is 4 of them. Elise, the other player, can pick up much more. Sometimes Elise pick up 7 destination ticket cards. I don't know what is happening. Can someone explain me?
2384	1	a	Incredible Fun! Excellent Co-Op action in a fun Retro style.
2452	1	a	Stylish and very atmospheric indie heist game. Very very cool.
3059	1	a	Dis a gud stealh game.
5090	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is an attempt to make a 3D Dwarf Fortress. It is much less complex, of course. This is both good and bad. It is less complicated to play, but it has very few options compared to Dwarf Fortress. Also, I found the game to be unbalanced. Some things are completely useless, like chairs and long distance military units. The AI needs improvement too. But it is fun to play, especially if you use traps.
4348	1	a	Short, but fun arcade-style game inspired by Katamari Damacy.  And a metaphor for consumerism.
3600	1	a	Alright so I just finished this game and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this from start to finish. The combat system feels a lot the Paper Mario series, so timed attacks were pretty simple to figure out on the fly. The costume battles made me think of Ultraman in a way (except that our heroes didn't need a Beta Capsule to grow) and well it wasn't a long game, the trek itself felt like it was though. I mean considering that what I did was a 100% blind run and just kept going with it, well..it brought the kid in me and this game really was an experience. I'd say get this game for those who want a good laugh and something that makes us remember the good ol' days of Halloween and for the sheer reason that all we wanted for that day was CANDY!! So at this point in time, go check out my LP of it over on my channel and enjoy, I'll be taking the rest of the day off! TENKAI MUSOU!!
1005	1	a	The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldnât call this one a âthrill ride,â but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when youâve got three minutes to spare.  Itâs hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that itâs highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you donât do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truckâs trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned.   Thereâs a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the 'zoo': thereâs an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: thereâs a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.  Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.  Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But thereâs a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know whatâs around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.  To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so itâs not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since thereâs so many in each tier.  Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.  While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if youâre in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.
1024	1	a	I like casually playing this game. Not sure why, perhaps just because of the racing and physics combination. It does get a bit boring after a while though. But that's after you've already had your share of the fun of course.

31	1	a	A very short platformer game. It's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. I went through all the levels in approximately 90 minutes. I finished a quarter of them with perfect score, but I don't really see any reason to return to the rest and try to improve. All the same with the bonus levels.   The game itself is pretty decent and the difficulty is quite okay. The physics sometimes behave a little erratically, and/or counterintuitively, but at least the behaviour is consistent, so once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.   Overall, the game is not bad, but I suggest you go and play some Tobe's Vertical Adventure instead.
2483	1	a	Great game for a group to play, had loads of fun playing!
3437	1	a	This game is like, awesome, with like costumes and stuff and you're on a quest and you get to do cool RPG stuff.
1063	1	a	Got this game in a indiegala bundle for 2 dollars with other 9 games. Not regreted it ever since.
1434	0	a	Maps are poorly designed and hitboxes are nearly nonexistant. You can always buy it as a joke, but that's the only fun you'll probably get out of it.
4909	1	a	Tons of fun and a great first person puzzle game! NOT THE SAME AS PORTAL! So don't pick it up if you aren't up for a challange.
5366	1	a	Awesome retro game!!!
4550	1	a	I usually can't stand tower defense games but I LOVED Unstoppable Gorg. A literal twist on the genre with an awesome mid 20th century sci-fi TV theme and great graphics. If you love tower defense games - get it. If you hate tower defense games get it anyway because it's a steal and you'll be supporting Futuremark - makers of programs like PCMark and 3Dmark not to mention Shattered Horizon!
2620	1	a	Its a good game
795	1	a	Recently introduced myself to this in board game form, then on my android, and now on Steam. Thoroughly addictive, easy to play and completely enjoyable.
2218	1	a	Excellent when playing co op, less so when solo, but still a great romp nonetheless.
495	1	a	Excellent version of the board game. Accurate to the rules and play of the board game. Provides a great way to play if you don't have the physical game or want to play with a bunch of people.
413	1	a	Basically Geometry wars retro evolved meets an elite upgrade. This is the most addictive game I have played in a while. The score board keeps you coming back for more. Chill playing this or take it seriously. Either way. Completely worth the price. 100% Legit. Though you might not enjoy it unless you have a controller. It's not really meant to be played with a Keyboard/mouse. You 'can' play with such but.... I strongly recommend a controller.
3552	0	a	I feel like this game would have been much better without the level scaling. I absolutely detest level scaling. That noted, I also â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loathe it when a game comes out with an expansion (in this case, Grubbins on Ice) that literally follows the same plot and storyline (someone gets captured, have to go save them, same costumes, etc) but just in a different location and differently dressed monsters. That's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my honest opinion. Why you would try to make an exact clone of the last game and try to pass it off as dlc/expansion is unforgivable. Come on Double Fine, you're better than this.
1203	1	a	Sanic Ball, Good Job Jacob!
4208	1	a	I cant believe this made it to steam, back when i played it on a tiny little screen, the bejeweled and rpg types together just had me playing for a long time, and even more so now that that this game has come to steam. still i just cant believe it. not for everyone of course, but im sure its enjoyable, at least to me it is.
1440	0	a	Bugged, crashes after every game camera is positioned too far forward no way to tell if/when i can shoot fighting is entirely random for inexperienced players and gives experienced players/bots an edge, leading to unfair gameplay full of spelling and grammar errors 2/10
3367	1	a	A game I enjoy replaying every October. Filled with heart and wit, this game reminds you of what it was like to be a kid on Halloween night, which, if you were like me, was a magical, mysterious night full of wonder. The battles can get a bit tedious, but otherwise, it's nearly flawless fun.
521	1	a	Great digital version of the traditional board game. Being able to play with friends online, having the scores tallied and seeing highlighted routes makes this game easier to play more frequently.
3341	1	a	 Quest to obtain Costumes   I got this game of double fine humble bundle and was the first among the three games that I played. I have to say that the game is quite short and the depth of the RPG mechanism is shallow. It might be one of the easiest RPG game that I have ever played. The total playtime is around 5 hours and the plot is simple, you basically just   save your sister  .  I would recommend this game if you just enter into RPG scene but to those veterans, you might just pick the game up for the cuteness.  Verdict: 3 out 5
1826	1	a	It's fun just running around like a maniac and causing the guards to kill themselves
4919	1	a	A nicely challenging game that will annoy you in a good way. Also, every time I heard your mad uncle speak, I imagine 'Q' from Star Trek.....
4355	1	a	I really don't know why, but I find this game fun. Well it is pretty easy but still worth playing.
4772	1	a	Think Portal, with more puns, and manipulating gravity instead of portals in order to solve puzzles.  Don't be fooled by the cartoonishness, its more challenging than it looks.
4056	0	a	Picked this on up a while ago on the cheap. Havenât had any trouble running it (Win7 64bit) but is pretty underwhelming compared to some other pinball games. You might say they're going for an old school look and feel, but it doesnât quite get there and just feels cheap. 
4407	1	a	A great casual game when you run around absorbing progressively bigger items. People say it's a rip-off of another game; but that game's not here and this one is. Probably only worth it when it's on offer for a couple of Â£s.
4974	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is an excellently made quirky puzzle game that'll have you switching between 4 different dimensions  (light, heavy, slow time and reverse gravity)  in order to complete a series of puzzles. The game introduces new dimensions and concepts at a nice pace and will take roughly 6hrs to complete. The game is very relaxed as the puzzles are not too difficult so you'll always progress at a nice pace, and the game has an excellent art style and direction. The games option menu is very good, different volume sliders, gfx options and fully rebindable keys which is excellent. It certainly feels like a very polished game. If you love games like Portal and Q.U.B.E then you're going to love this game. Thoroughly enjoyable experience and well worth the money.
307	1	a	Frantic and soothing at the same time. I have no idea how that works, but it does work, and so very very well.
2809	1	a	The strong sense of having to rely and work together as a team in Monaco: whats yours is mine is overwhelming. And I mean that in a good way. It can really bring people together and make them think instead of just doing the same function sover and over again you have to be constantly alert. Lots of fun
1956	1	a	The best way to steal something is to flail around in doing so. 10/10
4728	1	a	I completed the main game in 9 hours and then began to suffer.
2204	1	a	A fun game with friends but it gets pretty hard without warning, so you could play it like a muppet for a good 10 levels and then realise - oh no, we're meant to be doing it like this, that's how you do level X.  So it's fun but it can be a bit hard at times. Nice fun game, nothing ground breaking but still fun.
1752	1	a	The game mixes 2d and stealth and does it perfectly! The game has tons of levels and classes to choose from. I would recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of stealth games.
228	1	a	For fans of Geometry Wars and similar twin-stick shooters, there's a lot to enjoy with Waves. The addition of a slow-motion powerup based on kills and a bomb system reliant on kill combos makes for a unique experience. Although the selection of game modes does not differ significantly from Waves' competitors, there is enough variety to offer great replay value for fans of the genre. Highly recommended!
1401	1	a	The game is a rather simple first person shooter, there's no health, you just have to push the other penguins off the small ice island to kill them. It's a fun game, though don't count on any multiplayer. Right now, May 2nd 2016, only 2 servers online (1 USA, 1 France), both empty.
4510	1	a	This is possibly one of my fave little time-wasters I use to chill out when I need it. The graphics aren't necessarily the slickest or most HD these days, but the premise and mechanics of growing various plants while you're away keeps me coming back after all this time. Additionally the options to change how fast in-game time passes, and the ability to pause it when you're away for an extended period is one of my fave features of the game.
140	1	a	This action puzzle game pretty simple. Line up colours on a 3D point to destroy them a gain points. Fun, simple and cheap, but not much variety.  59/100
4384	1	a	Pretty much Katamari Damacy but with an end of the world spin to it. It has some replayablity but not much once you finish the main goals. And the levels are short for the most part and there aren't many to choose from. All in all it's not worth it's current price tag, but if it's on sale pick it up.
3643	1	a	Funny game from Tim Schafer. Behold: quick-time-event haters better stay off.
5510	1	a	Ah, remember the good ol's SNES game Space Invaders? I mean, who doesn't? This game certainly brings to life the very thrill of shooting down aliens who are slowly decending towards you while also blasting lasers down at you but with more flash and bang for the pixelated buck. Upgrades and a progressively tougher set of foes make this game fun all the way to the end. And the boss battles? Oh, they are quite the challenge.  I'd recommend this game if you have some hours of time to kill while saving humanity from impending alien invasions. It's better than zombies, afterall.  9/10
772	1	a	Extremely Addictive! You have been warned!
2590	1	a	An amazing top-down payday like game. I Give it a 9.5/10 because the levels get to big for my tastes.
3243	1	a	A breathtakingly accurate depiction on how painstakingly nerveracking dangling balls in diverse scenarios can be.  Protip: Use a guide.
3204	1	a	This game is strangely addictive, I kept saying to myself 'I'll just do 1 more level' and then ended up doing about another 30!
4442	1	a	You do more than farmin' with dem hoes in this game. Put on yo cowboy hat and get ready to show these redneck heehaws how real farmin' is done...In all serious businessness, this game is a realistic portrayal and simulator of real life farming. Prepare to be wow'd by the real labor of pointing, dragging, and clicking your crops to farm enough to make enough to feed your soon to be fatass lazy waifu and possibly a couple bratty kids. Experience the serious struggles of trying to make ends meet as you spray pests off your food (NO ORGANIC â¥â¥â¥â¥ GROWN HERE BUDDY) and wonder why this toothy old man keeps eyeing your â¥â¥â¥ every time you bend over to pick those tomatoes. Don't worry, he only wants to come pump your oil rig...pump it real good.
4589	1	a	This is a great TD game itself and the orbit mechanics make it really intersting to play. great replayable value also. absolutely recomended
3850	1	a	Buy and play this game. 10/10 would reccomend.
2007	1	a	Really fun, great co-op game!
285	1	a	Pretty cool Geometry Wars. Sadly no spiffy multiplayer.
1409	1	a	The game is a rather simple first person shooter, there's no health, you just have to push the other penguins off the small ice island to kill them. It's a fun game, though don't count on any multiplayer. Right now, May 2nd 2016, only 2 servers online (1 USA, 1 France), both empty.
2437	1	a	I absolutely adore the stealth mechanics in this game, I haven't this much fun being a sneaky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a long time.
1020	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game on Steam that was previously a flash game called 'Smuggle Truck', a game commenting on the trials of immigration to the United States from Mexico. This is a narrative thread with satirization that works quite well.  Snuggle Truck is about transporting stuffed animals to the zoo, which makes for incredibly confusing commentary. First of all, where are the stuffed animals trying to escape from? Are they escaping from the bedrooms of a particularly stultifying suburb? Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?  No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo? What is to be gained from this action, especially when there are real animals to look at and already existing stuffed fascimiles to buy fresh from the gift shop at manufacturer suggested retail prices? THIS GAME MAKES NO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ SENSE AND THE MESSAGE IT OFFERS TO THE PLAYER IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CLOWNSHOES.  It is a solid physics flash game and it'll entertain you for twenty minutes before it starts to get boring. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.
2466	1	a	Very entertaining and not difficult to just pick up and run with.
4942	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
5211	1	a	Fun game if you don't know what to do with your life anymore.
5176	1	a	I loved this game. I wish they'd continue the campaign. So much fun!!!
4789	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
1871	1	a	Simplistic and fun. Enjoyable
1074	1	a	Real fun! Slightly less than its brother Smuggle Truck, but still really fun!
5244	1	a	That chicken (or not chicken) is so awesome!
3842	1	a	Grubbing on Ice expansion has best ending ever Double Fine sure does know how to make the end of the game feel very epic
3934	1	a	For a game designed for younger players in mind, I still found this rather enjoyable to play. The combat is rather simplistic, but still felt challenging in some of the boss fights. For most fights, chain-stunning the foes turned out to be the most effective play to buy time to build up your costume special attacks. The story is rather predictable, and the quests are more or less repeated in each location, but it didn't seem to be that much of a turn-off as it should have been. For the price of the game, I really felt like I got a good deal of value from the game, considering the 'Grubbins On Ice' DLC that comes with the game is effectively another few hours of content that expands the story of the game (or can be a hard-mode if you just start it w/o using a save that had main game data). I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to play a fairly easy RPG to kill a few hours between more serious RPGs.
425	1	a	Shoot shoot shoot shoot  Points points points points Just one more OK ??
3375	1	a	Costume Quest is a really cute, short, turn based RPG set on Halloween. Your sibling has been taken by monsters after they mistook her candy-corn Halloween costume for real candy and you set out on an adventure to get her back.  On the way you unlock various costumes which transform into the âreal thingâ in battle. Each costume has a basic attack and a special attack. There is a surprising amount of costumes, which keeps the game varied and you can also add battle stamps to your characters to give them bonus effects.  The perfect Halloween game if youâre not into spooky stuff.
3048	1	a	High quality fun
3348	1	a	So, I watched the video, looked at the screenshots and figured this might be a good game for the kids but I'll never get around to playing it....boy was I wrong!   Upon giving it a go I was stunned to find an incredibly simple yet thoughtful and FUN (remember when games were more fun than work?...well that is Costume Quest in a nutshell) game that provided a good few hours of entertainment and the closest the kids made it to the controller was watching Dad play as this is a game that I just had to devour all of the content for.  The combat system is ridiculously simple for all bar a couple of big boss fights (which had me thinking about team dynamic and offensive/defensive strategies) but it was only starting to feel too repetitive as I was nearing the end of a full play through for 100% in a day. A great game, well worth the money, love changing costumes - it's fun &amp; I even found myself taking screenshots to look back and enjoy the costume battle transformations :)
3852	1	a	Costume Quest is a short burst of fun, with the typical witty yet earnest writing that Double Fine make seem easy. It's not a very taxing game, but is fun to play and is over before it becomes too repetitive. Definitely worth a go.
3404	1	a	Probably the cutest game Double Fine has ever made, with a fantastic premise and decent execution. It's short but the length is nice for what it is, there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments with the dialogue, the environments are detailed and look quite nice, and the plot, while simple, is pretty enjoyable. That game is very easy in terms of its turn-based battles, so if you're looking for a challenge, look somewhere else. I do think it works very well as an 'introductory RPG', though, and can be used to teach newcomers to the genre about basic RPG tactics like prioritizing enemies, diversifying your party's classes, making strategic decisions about abilities, and choosing when to use special moves so they will be most effective. A solid game that makes for a fun Halloween night.
3103	1	a	Dis a gud stealh game.
675	1	a	I'll update my review to reflect the new version:  A lot of negative reviews have been given because of the new version. This is understandable, since they published the 2.0 version too early and too buggy (basically an 'Early access' version). However, many of the bugs mentioned in the reviews have since been fixed, and the dev team seems quite active in improving the game and even adding new features. It's still not bug free, but I'm confident it will be in the near future. For those who don't want to wait for it, it's easy to downgrade to the old 1.6 version.  Old review: (still accurate for the most part)  Great and accurate translation of the board game to PC. And a great game whether or not you have played the board game. It's easy to learn, but hard to master. A big warning though: this is not a single player game. There is the option to play AI players, but those are mostly there for you to get to ropes. Once you understand what the game is about, you will win them every time. So this game is meant to be played against human players, whether those be your friends or fellow unknown gamers. If you create an open game, it will take 1-2 minutes for other players to join in, and then you can start. A game lasts for 10-30 minutes, depending on the number of players and how fast they play, however, it has to be played back-to-back, no saving and preferably no quitting. Ticket to Ride suits both those who want a little casual play every now and then, and those who like competitive gaming.  Some say it's simple, but I say even just the base game is complex. 2, 3, 4 and 5 player games all require different strategies. And apart from strategy, what is most required is adaptation. If your strategy is rigid, you will lose. You have to adapt it every turn.  In some way, I think this is a game where Chess meets Texas Hold'em. You have to anticipate the other players moves, you have to estimate the odds and you have to bluff and try not to give signs about where you are going. And you get better the more you play, until you reach a plateau. And then you realize something about your playing style, adjust and keep rising in the ranks. The game has a SELO ranking system, much like the one used by competitive Chess players. So you will see how you progress. You will know approximately how good your opponents are, whether or not you actually know them.   There are two distinguished playing styles. Cutthroat or friendly. Usually players accept that whatever you do, in the scope of the rules, and win, is OK. Some players however don't like blocking and screwing/getting screwed. These players will mark their games with words suchs as Fun, Fair or No blocking. Join these games if you want a friendly game. And don't if you're going to do whatever it takes to win.
1003	1	a	You and your group of stuffed homies drive off in the best epic action adventure RPG racing game of the year. This game is an emotional joyride as the superb character development keeps you on your seat begging for more. Travel the world on your certified kappa truck as you go through this ultimate adventure one jump at a time.
643	1	a	Ticket to Ride is significantly more fun to play online than as a physical board game easily ruined by somebody slamming the table. About the only downside to this port, other than the glitchy Achievement pseudo-implementation, is having to play through the tutorial and having moves suggested that I feel are less than optimal, purely for the sake of showing you how to play it. Maybe the interface is a bit bogged down trying to tell how to play which map, but otherwise super fun once you learn where everything is.
530	1	a	Extremely great board game, and even greater digital game. Totally Addictive. Definitley not your grandpa's train game.
4613	1	a	I had a game way back years ago on my Windows 95 comp, it was called 'The incredible Machine' (when it was running the game the computer just called it 'TIM') it was made by a company called Sierra. Crazy Machines has alot of the same mechanics as TIM, which is why I bought it. Crazy Machines is very lively and full of intrigue to me, I can't help but notice that it is a very precocious game, like it is ahead of its time, but still right where it should be. All-n-all it's very fun to play, I must say.
4002	1	a	Very fun.  The combat is overly simplified. It uses a combination turned-based battle system with QTE boosts. The story is really basic, and explanations are few and far between.  The dialogue is where its at though. The character are very funny, and even the NPCs are good for a laugh or two.
1358	1	a	NOW WITH STEAM CARDS!
296	1	a	This game is so zen I actually achived a state of enlightenment
709	1	a	This is a very nice representation of the board game that I love. Great aesthetics, great music and fun gameplay offline and online. I'd highly recommend if you're into board games
2088	1	a	Pretty good overall, although the missions do get a little repetitive. CO-OP is a good change that tends to fix that though, giving a whole new life and style to the missions.
5198	1	a	fun little game a few bugs that will never be fixed but, well worth the cost.
1021	1	a	Greatest.. game.. EVER
4856	1	a	If you like the Portal games, then you'll like this one too.
1539	1	a	I sometimes consider myself a man of fairly high game skills. I've manged to beat Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 100% and yet...I still can't beat a later level here! This game is harsh, and I mean harsh, This game hurts me, more than Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy, Or even Don't Starve! I cannot for the love of me. I bought the game a while back since a friend of mine had it, we played the first couple of levels and all was well. Then, we stopped for a while, after which I cam back multiple diffrent times to try again. Only recently have I mangaged to progress past the 'Quarter Diamant' heist. Seriously, if you like stealth and crying, This game is for you.
913	1	a	this isnt a freeto play game after about 25 games you got to start paying for it and a game last 5 to 15 minuets if you play badly
4838	1	a	If they made Portal with a crazy Uncle instead of an insane A.I. with a manor house instead of an underground lab, and control over gravity/time instead of portals, you'd have Quantum Conundrum. Great game can't wait for DLC.
1700	1	a	Hai, this is a awesome game.
5382	1	a	To tell you the truth i had never heard of this game and i got a discount for it on steam. i was like you know what lets check it out. I go to the game and the video, didn't look too fun, but it was a big discount.  I WAS WRONG.  This space invaders/galaga style game with modern graphics and a beautiful array of alien ships and upgrades. Makes this game so fun to play. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, convince your friends to try and beat your high scores. Laugh as they try and fail because you are a god and they are mere peasants. Do it. Trust me.
2841	1	a	A very good game, to play with friends
1457	0	a	A real stinker of a title. Basically the whole thing is a 'Sumo' style of game, knock all the other Penguins off the ice to win the round. The issue is that gameplay is dull. The whole thing moves too slowly and is riddled with random bugs and issues that wreck the game.  The Computer players themselves are completely dim-witted too, either openly jumping off the ice float with little to no provocation, or looping in a basic pattern. Multiplayer is completely dead too making gameplay all but non-existant.  Basically theres a reason this isnt sold by itself, its just pure trash.
2171	1	a	A very simple and fun game. 10/10
968	0	a	Pixel hunting (to the point or thinking you've cliked on something, that wasn't it apparently, get to the point of using the bot for hints and yes that was it but apparently you didn't click in the right spot..), no intelligent support for widescreen, crashed on me during the final cutscene (and reset my save so I am NOT doing it all again to see if I missed anything)..  The scrolling and the zoom-in are a false good idea.. more annoying than nice, since foreground objects will move over the background stuff and hide it.  Graphics are nice as a whole, story is ok.. but can't recommend this one. Much better stuff and more fun to be had elsewhere on steam, indenpendently of price.
4736	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is an amazing puzzle game that is so good, it might even rival the mighty Portal!  It has tons humor mixed with lots of really good puzzles. Anyone who enjoyed Portal really should play this game.  Unfortunately the game is not quite a polished as Portal, when I played, there was a bug involving the time-based puzzles, that forced me to start a section over again because the platforms were out of sync. This may have been fixed by now, but I don't know.  The only other issue I personally have with this game is that, like Portal, it is too short... It leaves you wanting more.  But, as a bonus: Your uncle (This game's disembodied voice,) is played by John De Lancie! (The guy who played Q in Star Trek!) His voice-over somehow makes this game even more fun!
4360	1	a	This game is a really fun and challenging game for casual players. Its also too easy. I do hope there will be more of these because the game has skill involved. and who doesnt like skill?
105	1	a	You ( Lumi ) are stopping by your grandpa's house to see if hes around. however, with a partial shopping list reinstituted as a note spacifically for you tacked on the door, reveals that he is in town to see if he can be illuminated as to why there  there seems to be a lack of power. it seems that he wants to energize his own house, but has hit a snag, and wishes you to help him regain power with what you're able to find around the house. this sets you off on your sadly short, but quite touching 'adventure' around the property.  This is a point and click adventure, where you'll explore lumi's grampa's house in order to solve puzzles and acquire items to gain the materials needed to help your grandad to become more.. self reliant. power wise anyway. this is a heart warming, fun, and cheap title. it may only keep your attetion for about an hour and 10 minutes, if that, but there is a hint at more content being added later, so why not give it a try?
503	0	a	Say's it's touch friendly but is terrible on the surface pro 3. Have to play in windowed mode as otherwise it displays only a quarterof the screen! Also can't play online due to an unspecified error, shouldn't have bought the complete pack without trying it oit first. The iPad version of the same game works much better
2043	1	a	This game excels at being a frantic multipllayer game where if stealth didn't work, run. Alll the levels have a twist and a new perk to them, which makes the game never boring. The characters are great for that extra help you need in the game (I like thee pickpocket, as he can just be in a room and Hector, his mokey, can take everything).You cant anticipate the next move of anyone in the levels, which adds to the excitement and suspense. The music is great, the graphics suit the design of the game, and the gameplay is fantastic.
5359	1	a	Back to childhood ^_^
2000	1	a	this is a fun game to play with with friends, by yourself its not as fun
2597	1	a	this game is sweet 
4473	1	a	I haven't played many match-3 games so far, so I don't really know what's standard and what's considered exceptional among them, so let's get the basics out of the way first.  A gridded board is filled with stones of various shapes and colours. Switch adjacent stones around to match three or more in a vertical or horizontal line to remove them and make all the stones above drop down. In each square of the grid (underneath every stone) is a tile. For every match that's made over a tile, that tile is then removed. Remove all tiles on the board to complete the stage. As far as I know, that's the bare minimum for every match-3 game? But this has some extra features.  As you clear the tiles, you reveal a maze-like track hiding beneath the board. When all tiles are removed, a '7 block' appears at one end of the track, and a goal at the other where the block has to be moved to. Conveniently, you can rotate the board 90 degrees at any time to orientate the block to drop in the desired direction. At a certain point in the game locks are also introduced - coloured rings that cover the goal preventing the block from resting in it and a match of the same colour must be made within the same space in order to remove it. None of these hurdles are too troublesome at first, but when the size and shape of both the board and tracks start to become more elaborate, then things can get a little messy. Thankfully, though, there are special items to aid you in your task.  There are rewarded for matching more than three stones at a time. If you match four, an item appears on the board that will clear an entire horizontal line of all stones and tiles in one go. Matching five will give you an item that clears everything in both a horizontal and vertical line. And at random points a die appears, which when moved, will clear a handful of random squares scattered across the board. On occasion you'll also be given the optional objective of completing a match of a certain colour within an allotted time. If you succeed the clock will be frozen momentarily. But given how much time they give you for every stage, this is something of a none-issue and I don't think I ever even came close to the halfway mark on the timer, so you shouldn't need to worry about that.  The unique spin the game tries to put on its presentation is that all of these tiles you're collecting goes towards the assembly of a Wonder, with every stage you complete getting you closer to building it. There are nine Wonders to build, with seven stages each, the first six taking place on the outer surfaces of a cube, and the final stage being inside it, which is a nice little touch. But aside from the visuals and theme, there's nothing special or particular about it that actually adds to the gameplay in any way.  This isn't the most challenging game in the world, and truth be known, I did find myself getting a little bored and going through the motions towards the end. But I still never actually had a bad time at any point and found it was just the right length to not entirely wear out its welcome. So if you're looking for a casual little time killer and can pick it up at a decent enough price, then you could really do a hell of a lot worse than this.
830	0	a	This game does not work. No amount of installing/reinstalling both windows files and game files has helped.   DO NOT BUY.
2820	1	a	Good fun, really shines in multiplayer.
3625	1	a	This has become my wife's favorite video game of all time, giving a new meaning to Halloween. Gameplay is simple, with just a few mechanics that are repeated almost to the point of boredom, but the story is what really sells the game. Everything is cartoonishly fun, down to little touches in background characters. Quick reflexes help in combat situations, but aren't strictly essential, so even kids will be able to play. (Those who can't or won't read might need help understanding what to do, though, particularly in the first combat.)  It's short and fairly easy to complete fully, so the replay value is limited to perhaps once a year. Fortunately, there's a fairly obvious time of year to play it.  Oh, and yes, don't try to enter the tent in the camping store. The multitude of waist-high fences can occasionally be annoying, but only there are they truly game-breaking.
561	0	a	Broken on Mac with latest release. Another great Days Of Wonder release.  Exception Type: EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: dyld: launch, loading dependent libraries  Dyld Error Message:  Symbol not found: _kSecAttrAccessible 
192	1	a	This game is like adding nitrous oxide to a high powered classic from the eighties. It is rush hour at the busiest intersection in Mumbai during a lentil sale. And shockingly, this game is sold in finished form for a pittance but inspite of that they just added 'Hold' gameplay which has actually improved the game in ways that I couldn't even imagine. If Skyrim is a ten out of ten, then you'd have to give Waves an honest 16.
3250	1	a	Great, relaxing game. Buy it, you won't regret it.
1126	0	a	IT SUCKS DONKEY â¥â¥â¥â¥ NOT WORTH THE 5.49. MY FRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME AND I REGRET IT. I HATE THIS GAME! 
2076	1	a	Only good with other people. The graphics are awful and the music is OK.
1268	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   I got this from a bundle quite sometimes ago.  Honestly, not bad at all. No sarcasm intended.  Simple premise, no complex mechanics, very cute graphics and rather enjoyable gameplay.  I can see this game enjoyed by kids very much.  Somehow it just need more polish tho.
1213	1	a	Test your reflexes, judgment and tactics while facing up to eight other players in this follow-up to the critically acclaimed and popular arcade game Gumboy: Crazy Adventures, winner of numerous accolades including Gametunnel's GAME OF THE YEAR 2006.

818	1	a	played this with my friends and drew all of the map cards.        prankd
640	1	a	it's good
1084	1	a	It's adorable, it's challenging, and you will feel terrible each and every time you lose a poor little fuzzy to your terrible driving skills.
1418	0	a	A cute game, where you must protect your penguin 'tribe' by pushing all the other tribe members off an iceberg (global warming, people!)  Interesting concept, fast gamplay which involves hurling bombs, fish and snowballs at the opposing penguins.  Since Steam requires you to say yes or no, I'm afraid I'll have to give it a no (even with the pitiful amount of time I've spent on this). The reason being - as can be seen from other reviews - the multiplayer is a barren wasteland. The AI isn't much fun, and doesn't look like anyone is playing this anymore...  I picked it up for free, but wouldn't recommened unless it sees a massive surge in popularity.
4376	0	a	terrible mechanics â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
2823	1	a	The most fun that can be had from this game is with 4 people, and it's even better if you know them and if you are talking to them. It can get complicated it there is no communication. I reccomend this game if you want to play with friends.
1660	1	a	I've been excited about Monaco for some time so it was great to finally be able to sit down and play it. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed.  One of the greatest things about Monaco's design is that messing up is most likely going to happen. In fact, it's almost a guarentee. You can be as stealthy as you like but the moment you linger in a guard's face for too long he's going to come out shooting, the alarms will bare, and the classy piano-only soundtrack is going to kick into high gear. This is where your character's individual talents will come in handy. For example: The Cleaner can subdue any enemy that hasn't already been alerted to your presence (has a exclaimation point over their head, or a red question mark). The Mole can make holes in areas where they shouldn't exist. The Gentleman (my personal favorite) can make semi-effective disguises for himself when he isn't seen.  There are roughly 32 missions that you and your criminal enterprise can run through, each one favoring one character over another but allowing for improv. Half are through one campaign and half on the other. Playing by yourself is possible, but difficult and not as fun to perform. Playing with others is where the game starts to shine. Since messing up is pretty much built into the game's coding (see any mission with dogs in them), it's not a matter of being a perfectionist, it's more of making sure you're going the right way, picking up as much gold as possible on your way to the objective. Gold is optional but necessary to unlock new levels. Once you're finished with the entire campaign, you can go back in for your best time. Every gold piece you miss will add 10 seconds so if you're looking to speed run it's a matter of choosing your battles. The resulting multiplayer mayhem is less like Counter-Strike and more like Payday with a little more leniency and a hell of a lot faster.  So I recommend Monaco, even more so if you have people to play with. If you're going to play alone I highly recommend using The Gentleman as his disguise trick means you're holding down the shift key a lot and planning ahead, but you're not dying as much. Otherwise, practice practice practice.
666	1	a	A fairly faithful recreation of the boardgame. Probably more fun to play with friends than random people online or vs AI, though AI helps get you acclimated to the game if you've either never played it before or haven't played it in a while.
4411	1	a	Planet Busters is an excellent crystal matching puzzle game. The setting, while not entirely unique, does offer the player a wide variety of strategic options. The music in particular is very well done in this title and along with the stage transitions keeps the gameplay moving forward smoothly. The Steam Overlay and widescreen options are supported, so if you are a fan of Bejeweled or Tetris, you will find a lot to like in Planet Busters.
1896	1	a	Good story but only a few hours of fun. 7/10
878	1	a	I give it 5/10. Five solid points for being a good PC implementation of the board game rules. It fails to earn the remaing 5 points because:  1) It isn't much to look at (it needs a serious graphics overhaul in both the interface and in-game), 2) I experienced some serious video bugs in the lobby, and 3) There's no way I'm going to pay to continue playing something aesthetically unappealing and buggy.  The PC implementation would do much better if developed and executed by a game software company, *not* Days of Wonder.
2639	1	a	fun game, i recommend playing online, more fun that way.
5	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a variation of the saying âa tempest in a teacupâ which really means taking a small event and blowing it out of proportion. Since it means making something out of nothing, Iâm really struggling with why youâd name your game that. Good news though, the title is really the only thing about this game thatâs not awesome. And thatâs worth making a bit of a fuss over.  Storm in a Teacupâs controls are pretty straightforward. There are controls to move left and right and then a button to jump, though itâs really more of a take flight kind of motion. You have a charge meter that starts to deplete the second you tap the button and take off. Once the bar runs out you start falling back to the ground and the meter refills. You can double tap to boost higher, and building up speed before launching will definitely send you further.  Youâll use this jump to navigate obstacles and avoid pitfalls, collecting keys and triggering little contraptions to move your way through the various levels. So really, all the standard tropes youâd find in any platformer, except it puts a heavily reliance on its use of physics in the game world. As such, you could safely say the game took some of its inspiration from titles like Little Big Planet. Because both you and the objects you interact with are supposed to convey weight and momentum.   This is one of those cases where the game seems to have been changed in order to accommodate a witty title. Why is the character onscreen named âStormâ and why does he fly around in a teacup? Cause it fits the name of the game. Donât get me wrong, it works gameplay wise, itâs just that it makes zero sense in the game world or reality.  Speaking of âgame worldâ Storm in a Teacup continually dazzles with its style, looking like something a child would dream up. Mean dark clouds have sinister frowns, platforms are tied up by rope, and some enemies look like theyâre made out of cardboard. Itâs adorable and trippy all at the same time.  But donât be fooled by the cute look of the world, this game gets hard with a capital H. Storm in a Teacup will look to test even the most veteran platform gamerâs skill and patience. Luckily the game is never unfair about it, and youâll never find yourself in a place where you canât see because of a bad camera or faulty level design. You can always see what you need to do, itâs just a matter of making it happen.  With the exception of the name, which is cute, but when taken at itâs meaning does a disservice to the game, I have nothing bad to say about Storm in a Teacup. Itâs gorgeous, controls well and offers a good solid challenge. Iâve played a lot of games that Iâd consider a tempest in a teapot, but Storm in a Teacup isnât one of them.
129	1	a	A simple single block take on tetris to a new deminsion. Make this even more like tetris and then we'll talk.
2554	1	a	great game, you need 4 people though coz it gets a little hard at points
4667	1	a	Riding off the coat-tails of Portal, the same dev team is back at it with this first-person-puzzler. The difficulty for the base game stays between beginner to intermediate while the DLC increases it to a ridiculous difficulty that will have you banging your head on your keyboard and you punching a nearby house cat. Despite this increase of difficulty (reliance of speed, timing, and LOTS of patience are needed), the game is hilarious and beautiful with a semi-cell-shaded, cartoon feel. John de Lancie (Q for all you trekkies out there), provides a nice narrative to the environment and story as you progress through the game. If you enjoyed the Portal series, this is a must-buy to add to your gaming collection.
260	1	a	GGUD scrubs,   Come for my title... 13th global bombing run.  Im waiting...
4641	1	a	Crazy Machines 2 is an amplified Physic Puzzle game. Almost every Item introduces it's own weight. Inclouding a connection between Science and Magic. Anything can happen if you fill your rooster with all available DLC. With the current available puzzles, you can have fun for even an entire year.  The negative part of the game is that it requires very big performance computers to work properly, because low performance dosen't show up in lag. It changes how the scenery plays itself. Glitches, and even unsolvable puzzles may show up. And you don't have the ability to set up the game for worse cases. There are only a few settings you can set up.  In my case, when I got the game, it did not work in any of the computers in my reach. It took 5 entire years for me to finally 'play' this game. That 5 year was begin by purchasing the game. But when I finally played this... It was an amazing experience. I recommend this for sure!
2329	1	a	Excited! An interesting game with friends.
2658	1	a	This game has a lot of fun things me and my friend played this game and its fun.
2489	1	a	An absolute blast of a game, especially if your playing with friends. Its quick, fun and can get incredibly intense when there is four of you! Just to see what I mean, check this video out:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Kiwi &amp; Lime | Monaco | Part 1: The Lesbian Embassy&nbsp;
5279	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is the exploration of a metroidvania distilled down into pure joy. Instead of being a pure puzzler like the first game, #2's challenge lies in learning how things interact, and then using that knowledge to keep moving forward.   Nearly all of the normal annoyances of this type of game are averted -  Rewind time to the last checkpoint at any time, don't even need to open a menu. Checkpoints are placed amazingly well. I have yet to have to walk more than a single screen to retry a puzzle. It teaches you one thing at a time, then twists it to make it interesting, then combines it with other things you've learned to make it challenging. It TEACHES, never TELLS. Nothing is worse than having to sit through 3 minutes of the game telling you all about the move or tool you just obtained. Toki Tori 2 hasn't done this to me.  Nothing is better in a metroidvania than coming back to an area and realizing that there's a puzzle you missed, but it was hidden in plain sight. Toki Tori 2 just keeps doing it to me, and it's wonderful.  I expected a simple timewaster and I got a very solid metroidvania.
5434	1	a	I love this game. I've finished it but it's great to play through and try to get the perfection achievements.
2433	1	a	I read loads of peoples comments about this game saying it was class but it plays best with people you know, I was put off paying Â£12 for it because of graphics but when it was in one of the bundles at  www.humblebundle.com  I grabbed it &amp; i can say now after playing that it wort tenner &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't always need fancy graphics and blood to make a great game !
4995	1	a	Pretty much got this game for TF2 items a few years back :P, but anyways it's a pretty good puzzle game.
3805	1	a	Nothing I could say would prepare you to this wonderful game. Those kids have humor &amp; attics so charming you will fall under their spell. The entire package just oozes style &amp; show how much Tim Schafer loves to create games. Simply a must have for any gamer who wants to have pure fun.
947	1	a	Great indie game with a touching story. Gameplay may not be for everyone, but highly recommended.
4460	1	a	Whatever
2068	1	a	If nothing else, the level of content has been astonishing
2862	1	a	Really fun stealth co-op game.
229	1	a	I have little time in this game, but it is great. It's no hardcore professional shooter, but it isn't lacking in intensity. It's very nice for just passing time.
810	1	a	This is a fun little game, based on the fun board game of the same name. In a nutshell, you build train routes. This isn't the kind of game I'll sit with at my desktop and play for hours and hours, but it's great for travel and casual co-op situations. The game supports a tablet mode (which worked on my Windows tablet) and pass-and-play (play a turn, pass device to other player, they play a turn, etc).  I can really see myself getting through a... well... train ride, with this train game.  Overall, I wouldn't pay full price for this game, but rather wait for a 75% off sale. Once it's in and around the $3 mark, I'd say it's well worth it, but obviously you should value it based on how much you plan to play it.  Do be wary of the other reviews warning about shoddy AI though. I wasn't good enough at the game to present too much of a challenge for the bots, but their behaviour did seem to be very similar in every match I played. I'll update this review after I ride a few trains.
5284	1	a	This game is great! It's cute, and hard, and it feels really good when you put the clues together to figure out what to do next.
615	1	a	One of the best boardgames out tehre. Easy for people to pick up. ...Honestly a better experience on a tablet or with the physical board/peices.
373	1	a	A ton of fun with plenty of gamemodes and tasty graphics. If you see this on sale, grab it!
1307	1	a	Its actually an amazing game! The advert and picture does not do it justice, i was sceptical about buying it, but as it was on offer for Â£1.09 i though 'why not'! So i got it, played it, and i can tell you somthing: i am on the edge of my seat when i play it! Its great fun, just need some better multiplayer servers now, but im sue that will kick off when more people play! Definatley get this game!
5018	1	a	This is more or less an reproduction of the first Puzzler World, but with a better mechanism for hint tokens, a nicer in-game trophy system and some slightly better execution of puzzles. I would recommend getting this over the first one, and as before it's geared towards a younger audience but still enjoyable for older players as well.  Only con I can see is that the developers didn't link their in-game trophies to Steam achievements, so it only has the same simple set as the first game, which are fairly straightforward to play through for those of you looking for simple puzzle games or just a few more achievements to rack up.
5139	1	a	The controls can get a bit confusing at times (especially when switching between different layers), but it's a great and fun game nonetheless!   Almost like a more approachable Dwarf Fortress... Exactly what I have been waiting for!
4260	1	a	Really fun addicting game. If you like or have every played Beautiful Katamari then this game is for you. Kind of short though wish it was longer.
1182	0	a	it makes sticky noises when you roll around. stay away from this game.
4282	1	a	This wonderfull end of the world is indeed a good one
3698	1	a	Pretty good game, well...according to the reviews. I never actually played this game. I forgot about it and just let it run for 100+ hours.
608	1	a	Great fun. Never played the board game, so can't say how faithful it is, but can't see many ways it could be unfaithful. The AI isn't completely brain-dead.
3513	1	a	Costume Quest is an amusing, anime style, adventure game with some unique dynamics. Firstly, costumes you pick up become useful in the game world in two ways. One, they each have a unique ability, like the robot costume to boost your speed and let you jump off ramps, and secondly, they become genuine fighting equipment, changing your character into what the costume represents. Be it a knight, or a fancy big robot, the costumes have incredibly power in this fun and quirky game by the creators of Psychonauts. Definelty a fun little game to play, and a get a fresh taste of Double Fine on PC.
263	1	a	this game is awsome alot of trophies and i been missing resogun and this is my fix, and the music is bumping definately worth buying if you love playing twin stick shooters like resogun or geometry wars.
3997	1	a	I absolutly love this game. I really hope they come out with another. I would love to see where the story goes from here. The costumes are super cute and the story is awesome. I love how the costumes transform into epic versions for battle. If you haven't played this game you should because you're really missing out!!!
1277	1	a	This game depicts the Club Penguin Civil War perfectly. No wonder the war went on for years and years; the penguins were using a pretty rubbish weapon: the snowball.  Personally, I thought that the Club Penguin Government would have been clever enough to not use a ball of snow to destroy the penguin rebels, but I'm not a historian. I'm just a guy on Steam writing misleading reviews. Nobody knows why they used a ball of snow for years - the records and details were all cleared when the rebel fighters got access to a nuke.  Serious: This game is actually pretty amazing, but only buy it if you like playing with bots.
1975	1	a	This game is more fun than I thought it would be. Sort of like a mini-Left 4 Dead combined with Alien Swarm.
1103	0	a	Games like this has been done multiple times before this one. Snuggle truck is one of the worst ones though. It doesn't add anything new to the 'genre' and the level design is horrible. It feels like something that was done as a school project in 2 days.
1848	1	a	This game's attention was worth it. In 2010 this game was shown at IGF, and it won a slew of awards, now, three long years later, it has arrived. the enviroments, animations, and enimies are stylish, and the top down look works well, the story is cool, and the multiplayer is great fun (even with strangers). BUT... there are some flaws, the level design is very so-so, and the playable characters' models need some work. the music is great, it sets the tone very well, you would never know that it was composed by the same guy who did Journey's music. all-in-all a solid 8.75
496	1	a	One of the better board games for the whole family!
3966	1	a	Best game in my library tbh
1356	1	a	Amazing, awesome, fabulous dodgeball game. Very addictive and lots of fun! The best thing I have played in a while. I never had my hopes up for anything and went in blind then was delightfully suprised to see what kind of game it was. Shame it's badly translated from French though and that you can't choose a team. But this is a great casual thing to play when you just need cheering up or some quick fun.
5377	1	a	I have been playing games made by this developer for six years now. I hold (at least, of right now) #22 and #44 in the worldwide leaderboard. I LOVE this game. Many developers try to make a retro game, and just ruin it. Puppygames has mastered this. The graphics are beautiful, the game is enveloping, and I love the ability to upgrade your tank. The difficulty is perfectly balanced. Also, some people complain about a teleporting glitch, but that is because they are using the mouse and WASD keys at the same time. Just use the mouse.
1889	1	a	Having put 60 hours into this game solo and co-op with an additional 25 hours in creating my own custom mission, I felt it's finally time to leave a quick review. This is a great game for casual gamers like myself. With my short attention span for games nowadays, it's awesome to come across one that is so simple in concept that it is easy to pick up. Missions range from a few minutes to maybe 45 minutes, and it's just perfect.  Even when you're done with the campaigns, there is a plethora of custom missions created by dedicated players. Of course, not all are winners, but there are definitely some very fun ones to play with friends.  And of course, that brings me to the best aspect of this game: Co-op play. It's hard to find great co-op action these days, and Monaco delivers. I just love that you really have to work together to finish, period. If just one player is dead, you simply cannot progress. It's also fun to have to constantly be saving each other's asses...especially when you have a friend who likes to throw himself into the throes of danger just so he can shout 'WHOOOOOOOOOOO!' And then he gets blasted in the face by shotguns.  As someone who doesn't even play games that much anymore, Monaco was a delightful surprise that will keep me playing as long as the custom missions keep coming out.
986	1	a	Quality hidden objects combined with a handful of interesting puzzles and a decent story. The voice overs are a mixed bag ranging from good to super annoying and the ending felt abrupt. Its a fairly short game, maybe 20 scenes but the hybrid of hidden object with puzzles I haven't solved 500 times before was nice and the scenes were all top quality and visually pleasing. The game offers 'scrolling' and 'zooming' scenes that let you pan around to find the required objects which I thought was a nice change.  Definitely worth a sale purchase if you enjoy the genre. Looking forward to playing the others and I hope there will be more.
4419	1	a	Still i cant run it in 64 bit windows, 7 wonders vol. 4 runs perfect on 64 bit.
1413	1	a	Probably the best game I've ever played. What you do is your a penguin and then you throw â¥â¥â¥â¥ at other penguins to try and knock them off this iceberg but you can get power ups and â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it gets really intense and insane and holy â¥â¥â¥â¥.
99	1	a	A charming little game, keep in mind though it is very short in the meaning of very few puzzles, but some of them are really headscratching mind-boggling, i had to use walkthrough because i was stuck at one point and i wanted to finish it. The game is only part 1 with more parts incoming. BUT from the looks of it, the other parts may or may not come. Definitely not worth the full price, think again. This is NOT like any of classic LucasArts adventure games, more like short mini game puzzles from the likes of mobile games, it is after all, a flash game lol.
1857	1	a	The best part of this game is when you diligently set up a detailed and flawless plan to complete the mission. And upon execution, the plan falls apart and everyone is running around in choas. A co-op blast.
4585	1	a	 At the Time of Writing
2750	1	a	its a very good game its like payday a little bit but there's more characters and each one has a skill or power whatever you call them but its awesome so far because of the new update so yeah you should definitely play it.
2357	1	a	Monaco is a great game that follows a group of thieves breaking out of prison. But it gets more complex. You have to be stealth, strategic, and above all, you have to work with your team. This is definetely more fun with friends!
3143	1	a	Fantastic co-op game. Not the most realistic stealth, much more 'gamey' which actually makes it a lot more fun imo. Such a joy! Even SP it's still pretty good.
78	1	a	Okay, I love puzzles that give you the most minimal hints to solve them. And for the first few puzzles Lume was pretty fun. But then I hit the piano lock puzzle and the cabinet puzzle. No hints. No whispers of hints. I had to unmute the game to hear the noises of the piano puzzle (the soundtrack is a really short loop and not that nice). Worst part was the ending. This game took me an hour to do. I'm so glad I only bought it for $1.74 and not the full $6.99. I'd never pay 7 bucks for this. I know it's only part 1 of however many other parts, but really, you're better off not doing this. This is why I'm wary about Indie games.
4349	1	a	As a spritual successor to Katamari it is not bad, if a little quick. Haven't played too much into it yet, but it filled that much needed Katamari fix.
1056	1	a	I made this.
869	1	a	Man, I feel for the developers of this game. Steam kids are idiots, especially the f2p grazers.  No, this game is not entirely free. You'll find no game ever really is, since someone has to pay the developers. Instead, it's a demo (as the text explains) in which you have full access to all factions and maps for hours of playtime. The devs tried a new payment model, where you don't pay for the game or DLC, but pay-as-you-go instead. A round of play (20 mins) costs around 2 or 3 gold and you get 125 gold for EUR 5 or 1.000 gold for EUR 30 (which also includes the scenario maker, btw). That's over 300 games worth of gold and you never have to pay for DLC. That's actually pretty fair, in my book.    So what about the game itself? It's a pretty faithful remake of the board game. I would not have minded a less cartooney and more lifelike approach, especially since the board game does feature 3D models. Different scenarios come with different rules (the Russian chain of command rule drives me insane, for one) but despite that, it's really easy to pick up. You'll be playing inside 5 minutes after watching the tutorial vid.  The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed. It has a tendency to overextend and get its units into trouble. This is offset by it seemingly getting better command cards, which feels ho-hum. However, it's not overly obvious and the balance is actually pretty good.  If you're in for a really basic beer&amp;pretzels wargame, they don't come more basic than this. Expect around 6-8 hours of free play in the -otherwise unrestricted- demo. After that, you pay EUR 5 for every 10 hours of playtime max, probably a lot less. That's pretty decent in my book.
2277	1	a	This is one of the most fun co-op games, but the keyword here is cooperative. When you sucessfully pull one piece of the heist and you clean out any level with your best friends, I genuinely believe that's one of the best feelings I've had in awhile. Also: Hacker is a little too much fun. Go buy this, it's on sale -- I think. And even if it isn't, it will be eventually.
1146	1	a	10/10 would play again
5277	1	a	Great puzzle game with fantastic music and graphics, but more importantly, a really interesting progression style. Think 'the alien monkeys teaching you how to wall-jump' but for every action in the game. Some very clever puzzles.
1110	0	a	I bought this game because i wanted more steam games and it was like four bucks. I don't know why i did it. Should've stopped me.
30	1	a	With many similarites to 'Little Big Planet', this cute classic platform game has you running and jumping around crayon-drawn environments with moving obstacles, collecting sugar-cubes and stickers before finding your way out of the level. 'Storm in a Teacup' also has lots of Steam achievements and is definitely worth every penny of its tiny price tag.
2904	1	a	This is a fun, exciting game. It's not Payday, nor is it Left 4 Dead, but it's a fast paced multiplayer experience just the same. While it may be tough to get into if you're not used to overhead 2D graphics, it's quite enjoyable once you get used to it.  My main greivance is the lack of a single player mode, and that you need to play with others. If you're as bad as I am, it's embarrasing to die in front of others. Yet, I understand that programming AI for a heist game is pretty tough, and must be even more so for indie devs.  If you're not into playing face paced, quick games; this is not the game for you. However, if you're willing to give it a try, you'll find this game to be more than enjoyable, and what it lacks in a single player mode, it more than makes up for in the artistic sytle and captivating environment and music it provides.  Overall, I give it a 4.25/5.
5173	1	a	Keeper.. your dungeon is full of cutesy dwarves armed with dlc.
4733	1	a	An excellent installment in the growing field of first person puzzlers.
1955	1	a	THE best stealth game ever, and awesome multiplayer. Get it!
4058	0	a	What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥???
982	0	a	The hidden world is a good name, this puzzle game should be hidden so it never sees the light of day. Like the last game, this game suffers from low resolution objects, objects that are a few pixels in size, and objects where clicking right on them may be a futile effort. Playing this game is similar to being locked out of your house while drunk take all your keys off your keyring throwing them wildly about then attempting to find and pick up your door key with your elbows.  The voice acting is very good, but the story isnt enough to keep anyone playing, in fact this game is good at putting you to sleep. Puzzles due to the low resolution, and being finicky, are just so tiring to complete making the game experience feel labored without satisfaction. There is no way to skip puzzles or solutions, or hints, or a guide in this game which can lead players stuck unable to finish the game.   Rating: 1/10 Value: $0.50
154	1	a	Just bought it and i already like it. With the summer sale its a good game for only $1.25.
1107	0	a	The camera is too zoomed in, you never know what obstacle is ahead of you, which means you either have to repeat the levels over and over to get a good result or you need stupidly good reaction times.
3173	1	a	Obulis is probably one of the more satisfying puzzle games offered on Steam. The game showcases some really clever puzzle challenges using marbles. It encompasses a blend of patience, timing, and plain luck. Great stuff for puzzle lovers. There's plenty of 'Aha!' moments.
4935	1	a	Mess with different dimensions of time and weight in this puzzle-platformer to save your uncle that's lost in his mansion.
5205	1	a	Pleasant background music, challenging puzzles and cute animals (vampire bats and evil masks excluded). Game is now open-world rather than a set of different levels, and Toki Tori now only has a whistle and stomp ability and will often need to use the abilities of the creatures inhabiting that location to reach next collectible or checkpoint location.  The game is a bit difficult to follow initially as there are no instructions on how or why Toki Tori starts out moving in the forest, and what are the things the player has to look out for and to do to progress in the game. Eventually, the game will reward the player with achievements and secret locations for those who attempt to reach the ending and obtain every collectible in the game.
4081	1	a	Why people play Candy Crush in a world where this classic exists is beyond me.
524	1	a	Great boardgame which is just as great online.
991	1	a	it plays welll and you can finish it in an hour.
4269	1	a	It's like the Katamari Damacy games in that you are rolling up a potpourri of mundane objects into a giant ball. It's not like the Katamari Damacy games in that it sucks out all the charm and fun of rolling things into a giant ball. If you ever doubted that indie game developers are just amateurs using derivative concepts, this game should help clear up any misunderstanding.
835	1	a	A great game my family and I love to play. I watched the Ticket to Ride episode on Table Top with Wil Wheaton, and while the rules don't seem to have a steep learn curve it is great to have the game figure it all out for you.  I also love the multiplayer option and wish some of the other family board games sold on Steam had it. It makes the game so much more enjoyable over the hot-seat option.
5487	1	a	A bit expensive but loads of fun
429	1	a	I quickly grew to like this game and the subtle variations in play modes. The scoring is well done and visually its appealing. The ample number of achievements have been satisfying to complete. The interface allows for easy navigation and there are plenty of options. One minor omission is the inclusion of auto-fire, especially since there is no restriction on the amount of ammunition shot. I have no major complaints with the game itself however it does leave me with cramps from the rapid mouse movements needed to spray the hordes of nasties. 7/10
2146	1	a	A humorous co-op oriented game with a wide difficulty range from beating the level to 100% completion.
52	1	a	Short but nice. I like the artstyle!
1373	1	a	okay game with cute graphics, all in all it's nothing much.
5043	0	a	It's terrible
4270	1	a	I actually really like this game, mainly as it remminds me of WE &lt;3 KATAMARI. It is literally a game where you pick up smaller objects to become bigger so you can pick up bigger objects so you can pick up bigger objects... Sounds crap but there is something real addictive about it.  See also: WE &lt;3 KATAMARI
5028	1	a	Just like the first Puzzler World but with some different added puzzles. Fun to play every once in awhile when your fancy a puzzle or two. :)
1425	0	a	It's terrible..
5123	0	a	This is one of those games that you buy and then wonder, 'Why the F*@# did I buy this.'
1152	1	a	Possitives - Great multiplayer - Czech game ;-) - It takes only 56 MB on your HDD Negatives - Maps those you can play 2 times and after it they comes annoying as f*ck - My friend canÂ´t connect to multiplayer :/  It suck as â¥â¥â¥â¥ !!! But itÂ´s so great ^-^
5151	1	a	This game is a very casual game. I frequently mine nearly every tile I can before solving the main mission,just because I can without the fear of loosing. This is not an intense action game nor does it require deep strategy. I enjoy playing the slow paced when I need to unwind from a busy day.
297	1	a	A perfectly formed shoot them up, novel in its execution. Perfect for lunchtime spot of zen destruction, or late night andrenaline jolts.
4406	1	a	This is a delightful little game. Quite short, not too hard, but plenty of fun.
86	1	a	Pro : Game graphics are original, the game is challenging enough  Con : Given that the game can be finished within an hour, the price is really high
3207	0	a	Just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of a free flash, unable to tell what the balls will collide with and physics â¥â¥â¥â¥s up at least once on every level
3076	1	a	Oh my god. Monaco is possibly one of my favorite games to just pick up and play. The early levels are usually 5-10 minutes, with most levels being about 20 minutes, and maybe 30 minutes on the later levels. The game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ in solo. Don't buy it to play alone. If you're going to buy this game, make sure some friends have it too. Each character has a special skill, all of which are useful for the current situation. (Except the Pickpocket and Locksmith, they're only good for a speedrun)  There are 4 chapters, each told by a different character, and each one escalating in difficulty from the last. Notably, there are 3 versions of every level- Monaco 2013 has the original levels before updates were made, and Zonaco replaces all NPCs with zombies. The entire game is orchestrated by Austin Wintory's fantastic soundtrack(Discotheque Rouge is the best), and let's be honest, how many games feature ragtime in their soundtrack?
624	1	a	A solid implementation of the awesome boardgame. I prefer to mobile iterations, specifically the tablet, but this one has everything you need to enjoy the game, and is still much easier to navigate and play than the console versions.
3684	1	a	Picked this up in a humble bundle a while ago but am just getting down to actually playing it. The controls are a bit clunky initially, but overall it's been an extrememly enjoyable experience!
4213	1	a	Love it. I'm not a puzzle guy but I took a chance and couldn't be more pleased.
2174	1	a	
1899	1	a	must buy 9/10
4713	1	a	Game feels like Portal with different gaming mechanisms. So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it's difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you're doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that's a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous. Ultimately, getting it at a good discounted price (like 75%) is a good deal.
4801	1	a	 www.com/Quantum  Conundrum for more help
4410	0	a	First 15min Impressions: The Wonderful End of the World Verdict: Forgettable Katamari clone.  This is a straight-up Katamari Damacy clone, only you use a mouse and WASD instead of a gamepad.  I loved Katamari Damacy, but I'm thoroughly ambivalent about this game. It gets Katamari's core gameplay loop right, but it misses what makes Katamari Damacy special: - There is no delight in this game. WIthout delight, there's not much reason to play Katamari Damacy. - The level design is really uninspired. In Katamari there was always a way to grow, even if you went into an area that was too big for you. In this game it feels like there is only one way to beat a level. - It might be short. I played through half the visible levels in 15 minutes. Progressing required getting near 100% on all levels.  This might be worth 30-60 min of your time. Afterwards, you won't remember it.
3473	1	a	this is a good game 
3066	1	a	Great stealth heist game. Nice characters, awesome to play with others co-op, pvp or single player trying to do each level without dieing for intense stealth gameplay. Kinda like a simplistic top down version of payday. 8.8/10 &lt;3.
2545	1	a	This game is awesome, thats my epic review. Have a wonderful day
5302	1	a	Its a game for children. The game is about a happy bird.  The storyline could hold a child easy, but not for experiance player due to being so simple.  Adults* - 5/10 Children* - 8/10 (Child Tested for my opinion)
4439	0	a	game does not run on Windows 10 :-(
4024	1	a	A cute, funny, dorky game about Halloween (objectively the best holiday). The dialouge and interactions with npcs alone were worth it.
1177	1	a	this game gave me two erections 10/10
2408	1	a	Fun game for those heist type people!
337	1	a	Do you like insanely complex and visually striking dual stick shooters? Then look no further. Normally I don't like games without customization, score driven or arcadey-feeling top down shooters. In fact, I ususally hate them. The permadeth reminds me of all the frustrated moments I spent in mcdonalds playing galaga when I was a kid, and normally they get really sickening, really fast. Waves is the only exception. I've already logged a few hours on it, and being the noob I am I die, a lot. But the visuals, the challanging but deceptively simple gameplay, and the complexity of the enemies makes me want more. Slowing down time and setting off your bomb (completely controlled by building combos mind you) is the difference between life as death as the game goes on. Seven different game modes lets you choose what means of firey neon death you want to go out on. In short, the game is beautiful, insanely difficult, and heartpoundingly fun. On top of it all, it's probably the best bang for your buck you'll get in a long time, especially with the sale going on. If you don't have it, get it. Now. Don't even finish reading this. Buy. It's a 10/10 in my books, and by the looks of it I'm not the only one. Thank you Squid in a box. Your sarcasticly beautiful programming and commentary just made this sale worthwhile.
3983	1	a	As a fan of Double Fine's earlier efforts, especially Psychonauts, it's no surprise Costume Quest drew my attention with little effort. Given I'm also a fan of costuming and Halloween, this was pretty much an instant sell. Having fully completed the game, I can assure you it did not disappoint.  Right from the get-go, Costume Quest shows efforts to include every possible player, as you can choose to play as either the boy (Reynold) or girl (Wren) of a pair of twins. Soon after the twin you didn't select is kidnapped by monsters for dressing like a delicious-looking candy corn, you meet up with other trick-or-treaters your age that match your level of imagination and your desire to get your sibling back.  Costume Quest feels like an RPG stripped down to its essentials, with timing-centric, turn-based combat and set amounts of spawns in most areas. This, along with the enemies' leveling along with you, eliminates the need for experience grinding. Wiping out everything is still necessary for 100% completion and makes getting costume upgrades and some secrets easier, but you can get by if you stick to story-necessary encounters.  The game itself feels a bit small, area-wise, but there are plenty of tasks in each section to keep your party busy and searching for hidden items and secret costumes. A great balance is struck between backtracking through each section and forward progression, so it rarely, if ever, feels like a slog.  The variety of costumes is also nice, especially their in-combat forms. Due to the children's imaginations, whatever costume they're wearing transforms into a majestic, towering version of its mundane representation, all featuring beautiful animations and unique, often hilarious special attacks. As touched on before, combat is straightforward, with timed button presses coming into play on top of the base mechanics to lessen incoming damage and stack combos with your own attacks.  All in all, Costume Quest is relatively short, super sweet, and great for any time of year. Just remember that a couple of achievements (for the game and for the Grubbins On Ice DLC) are time-associated, so be ready to fire the game back up when more seasonably appropriate. You could just wiggle your PC clock a bit, but that'd be lame.
1043	1	a	buy this game right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now
4345	0	a	It's Katamari game where you add the stuff to yourself instead of a ball, with no King of All Space.  In other words, a Katamari game that's not worth playing.
4472	0	a	Possibly the most poorly-aged of the 7 Wonders series. It's before the games began breaking things up and adding extra challenge in the form of resource management/bonuses for 'better time' or the city-building aspects, or variable difficulty, or the assistance of recharging powerups, but with the bonus irritation of 'hey, you know how you usually need to drop the key stone off the board? Now make it navigate a maze on some of the strangest-shaped boards in the series.'  The problem with that is that while you might think it's an interesting variant on match-3 gameplay (the board rotates to assist in this), the time limit is INSANELY generous. I don't know if I ever went down further than a third of the meter, and that was while I was passing out and zonking out for a few seconds at a time every so many moves. It's ludicrously liberal on time. So the game is in no way challenging, just sort of annoying. I can see reasons to play earlier 7W games, and the later ones redefine things in their own way, but god, this one's a relic.
4149	1	a	This game is a mix of match 3 and traditional rpg gameplay. It doesn't look great, the enemies can be cheap, the puzzles are almost nonexistant, and I can't seem to stop playing.   Worth checking out if its on sale and hate having a life. I actually had a dream about playing a match of this game last night. I think that should be a warning, but I'm reccomending this game anyway.  
2314	1	a	Monaco is a neon-blooded marriage of Pac-Man and Thief, a grand tribute both to 1920s silent comedy capers and to modern-day heist movies. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Keystone Cops, played out top-down in a world of living blueprints. It's a criminal take on Laurel and Hardy, except with a four-man band instead of the dysfunctional duo. By and large, Monaco is one of those rare games that somehow stay magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right or your mission has turned into an eight-lane car crash.  'Monaco stays magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right.' And crashes of the non-software-related variety will happen in abundance. With Monaco's minimal approach to player guidance, the only way you're going to figure anything out is through trial and disaster. Have a Hacker (one of the game's many playable characters) interact with a power outlet and watch as sensors go out and security cameras turn friendly. Walk across a red panel and discover that there are, indeed, pressure plates connected to the security system.  The missions are all performed to a similar tune: get in, get the prize, get out. Or, in some instances, simply get out. You start in a safe area of the level, surrounded by items that you can take along with you. Once you've selected your weapon (or non-combat item of choice), it is your prerogative to determine what 'getting in' will actually entail. Do you cut through a queue at the local nightclub or do you sneak through a locked door on the other side? Though all the levels operate in largely the same way, there's sufficient diversity in the contents of each to make every playthrough outright enthralling. Should you circle around the main area of the map and inch towards the safe on the third floor, or do you take a quick detour through the guard-infested inventory room? (Hint: don't do that second one.) Your choice, your years behind bars, monsieur.
4924	1	a	With puzzles and overall art direction set to amuse, it is quite the conundrum why many have yet to play it.
4914	1	a	You will probably finish this game in one sitting, but there's always 100% completion.
1068	1	a	A delightfully fun physics-based game. Don't let the name fool you; while it may seem like a game for children, it can get ridiculously difficult at times. This game can certainly entertain you or a group of friends, no matter the age.
785	1	a	You'll get to play Ticket to Ride anytime you want!  Nobody will play with you over a board again becasue you'll woop them good.  11/10 - would crush friends moral again
150	1	a	Great game tons of fun and addicting as heck.
1668	1	a	Do it sneaky and 100% the map or just run though everyone and everything for fun and beat a level in a minute. Or... just make a cute house in a wall as a mole :P
3197	1	a	Well developers all I have to say with regards to Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, Music and Puzzle Difficulty is this...   http://youtu.be/IxAKFlpdcfc   If there was a second thumbs up button I would press that as well. The game will leave you with wanting more, more chapters, more prequel and sequels, they have a good thing here hope they continue it...
252	1	a	F is for friends who do stuff together U is for you and me (try it!) N is for anywhere and anytime at all  Down here in the deep, blue sea!
3547	1	a	Awesome fun. Great for anybody who misses old school RPG's ^_^ Just wish it was longer.
3361	1	a	Great fun! Always give this one a replay during the Halloween season!
463	1	a	This game is the best. On steam you dont find many games like this game in particular. I love this game because it has a lot of shooting and tons of action. And the more you are in the game, the more intense it gets. I would prefer you to get it now. Because its $0.99 right now. SO GO AND BUY THIS FREAKING AWESOME GAME
2942	1	a	wow that game is AWSOME!!!!!!
4931	1	a	DO you enjoy the feeling that can only be gotten from a achieving your goals through science. Then this is the game for you. Mad and armchair scientist all agree that this game will help stay on your toes long enough to enjoy the fruits of an insane experiment.
206	1	a	there's no reason not to have it in your Library. great Soundrack, simple but addicting gameplay
5256	1	a	This game is THE MOST INTERESTING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED and one of the best (next to portal 2) and I love it for the same reason most people probably hate it, you have to figure out not only the puzzles but how to play the game. there are no totorials, instructins or any words. (spoken or written) when you first start the game you are given a quick look at the (very simple) controls and then placed right into the game and are expected to figure everything else out!
3734	0	a	i did not enjoy it, the gamestyle isnt interesting and the plot is just plain old boring, played it for 10 minutes and just had to run away.
4259	1	a	A short but sweet game, similer to the Katamari games. It's very enjoyable and it's cheap. :D
417	1	a	!!!
2650	1	a	Well this is a basic but fun game. Get it if you have the chance I'll vote 9/10. 9 because the priced should be lowered to 8.99 or 9.99.  
1711	1	a	Great co-op game, recommend 3+ players when playing to make it interesting. Not very fun solo
4394	1	a	This is a game for lunatics.
393	1	a	Twin stick shooter heaven! 
2246	1	a	quite an entertaining game need to be played with frineds
1637	1	a	Love it!
2120	1	a	Great co-op game.
740	1	a	This is a fantastic conversion of the board game &amp; is almost as good as playing it in person (or better if your board game group has dispersed around the country like mine has)  As a bonus, this game includes cross-platform online multi-player. The steam version can play against the DRM-free version, the Android version and the IOS (iPad) version.
4725	1	a	Wow, just wow. This is a very nice puzzle game. Unique in every single aspect with puzzles that are both easy and hard to solve. Switching dimensions was never as easy as this! It's a must-have game!  Rating: 10/10
2791	1	a	This is an amazing game :3
4990	1	a	It has John deLancie (Q from Star Trek) doing the voices. Do I need to continue?
5112	0	a	Fun at start but to repetative. Every map is a restart. You feel a lack of overal progression. Even research has to be done from scratch every mission.
3480	1	a	Costume Quest is a charming, fun take on the turn based RPG genre. Sort of condensed. Instead of individually swapping weapons, spells, attacks, and actions you choose costumes that change your appearance, battle abilities and attacks, and help solve free roam puzzles with various actions. On top of that you can choose one additional action or buff for each character and swap them as you choose. Instead of finding and swapping party members you can instead choose their costumes. It really is sort of a 'My First RPG', which may sound dull to an adult but it works well enough to engage. My one issue with this system is that there wasn't enough difference between the costumes to incentivise change. You are forced to change to solve some puzzles but I would always switch back before a battle. The battle system is turned based and pretty simple with only a few options each turn. This style lends itself to a little repetition but I tended to enjoy them since they typically don't drag on. One twist (Maybe, I don't play a lot of turn based RPGs) is that to land more powerful attacks you have to complete a QTE. There are several variations but each attack only has one. Things like press at a certain time, wiggle a stick, or repeatedly tap a button. Personally I didn't find that it detracted from the experience and actually makes sure you're paying attention to the battle and lets you contribute in some way. In true Double Fine fashion the writing (literally because there is no voice acting. Not a problem, just a statement) is top notch. Funny, witty, and endearing with jokes for both adults and children. Don't write off Costume Quest because of its apparently juvenile theme, you'd be missing out. It's fun, funny, and really is a nice departure from what you've probably played last. It doesn't over stay it's welcome and is well worth your time.
1226	1	a	You can punch Penguins in the face, with fish! AWESOME 9/10 (1 point minus because of the fish bombs .. that's violent man )
3104	1	a	Great Indie game about a group of criminals. Funny dialogue, fun original gameplay. Probably better with friends - feels limited as one character. Frustrating in some places when you get seen.
1404	1	a	best game on steam 
1810	1	a	Thia game is so much fun me and my friends got a four pack when it went on sale. Its great.
4029	1	a	This is a game I would honestly play and do play whether or not it's halloween.
3769	1	a	I'll be upfront. I completely adored this game. I love, LOVE Halloween and this game gets the atmosphere so...right. Don't be put off by the cartoony graphics or simplistic turn based (with some QTE mixed in) combat. Yes, there is a quite a bit of said combat and some may find it repetitive but I found the need to finish to see where it goes with their adventure far outweighing that small issue. MSRP is $15 and I'd totally pay that but when the Double Fine bundles roll into a Steam sale it turns into a theft.
5512	1	a	Fun re-imagining of space invaders, where you get to upgrade your gun/tank/turret and choose what upgrades to use.
3693	1	a	A great game well worth the money that I paid for it. Definitely an interesting set of gameplay challenges and quests.
2310	1	a	One of the best co-op games I have ever played.
199	1	a	Not bad shooter! Currently for 0,99 Cent.... ..... ..
1361	1	a	You shoot penguins into water with fish that have dynamite crammed down their throats and they get eated up to death by sharks who eat specifically penguins of the blue, green, yellow, and red race. Afterwards you live out your life as a ghost penguin who's hobbies include, getting revenge on the penguin that got you eated to death by the shark, and launching bombs at other penguins to complete the first hobby that was mentioned.  All in all its a pretty simple and fun game i'd say.
3956	1	a	THIS LITTLE GAME IS SO CLEVER! I first played this when I was a young one, and now playing it again I've realized how many little jokes there are. Gameplay is very simple and fun, I love the game's graphic style, it's kid friendly, and really cheap when it's on sale. Can't wait to play the sequel, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!
4279	1	a	Great little Katamari clone with lots of fun little touches. Some goals are hard to get but you can easily get all the achievements in a day. Which leads to longevity, after the intial playthrough and Portal hidden levels, there's not much replay value other thant he occasional spritz around. Could benefit from extra levels added from time to time. Or DLC.
4882	1	a	A new way of thinking out of the box! Shift through the dimensions to manipulate almost every object that you come across!
4668	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a puzzle game centered around a weird science contraption that switches dimensions. Players take first-person control of a young child who comes to visit his scientist uncle at a crazy mansion. Upon arrival, the silent protagonist learns that his uncle is trapped in another dimension, and it is up to him to save his relative. In order to do this, all three of the generators in the mansion will need to be restarted. The puzzles are made up of simple elements that are combined into complicated and elaborate puzzles. Puzzles are completed by moving around objects, which are mostly just boxes. Heavy weights are used to trigger pressure plates, boxes can be stacked to climb on, and there are a whole bunch of other unique solutions that are pleasing to discover. This game is amazing. Quantum Conundrum is well made, it controls well and it is almost flawless.  It is perfect for people who like puzzle games like Portal. It is definitely worth to buy.  Sounds 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 9/10 Atmosphere 9/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
1491	1	a	Probably one of the best co-op (local or online) games out there. The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.  Now, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.
2760	1	a	This is very fun with friends, even when things go wrong it's fun running around and trying to find a hiding spot. Lots of laughs and very entertaining.
1967	1	a	Two words to describe this game... 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ it' 10/10
478	1	a	Ticket to Ride is board game brilliance. For those who love tabletop games the PC version of Ticket to Ride is a must buy. If you've never played a Eurogame, or are looking to get into board games, TtR is one of the best places to start.
485	0	a	Was a good game until recent 'update'. Now it is much slower and more cumbersome with useless graphics and sound. Want the old version back. This is poorly done.
570	1	a	Very fun digital board game.At first it might seem a bit crazy when you just look at it,but playing the game is quite simple.Become quite easy to beat the A.I. but thats about its only weakness. Playing against human players is where this game shines if you want to enjoy that board game experience. TBH this the sorta game that if tweaked a bit could make for a fantastic learning game for kids since it could teach colors,numbers and shapes. The game can be fun for a very short period of time or for at least a 30min play session. Multiplayer seems to be always active when I went online (a day before this review) there were at least 10-15 games up and I was on during early morning on a weekday.  Did not go into the details of the gameplay mechanics because the store page and trailer explains it all.If you want a simple game to enjoy for 5-30min solo or 10-30min multiplayer try the game out its a wonderful game.If you are looking for a more complicated board game you might want to skip this. This game is a great one if you have kids though I think they would enjoy it. I might not of clocked a lot of hours into this,but I played it enough to enjoy my time with it so it gets my thumbs if for casual + board game play.
4703	1	a	this gme is so much fun and I love the voice actor who plays your uncle. the only downfall is a lackluster end. not a sad end just sorta ok...
3723	1	a	I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.  The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.
4534	1	a	Designed to entice children, then force dad to figure it out. Boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ after a while.
2015	1	a	excellent 'goonish-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ burglar' simulation
1724	1	a	This game is, hands-down, fantastic so far. Both the classic and zombie mode are fantastic.
1612	1	a	Monaco is a action, stealth, and strategy heist game, where in every level you are passing through high-tech security to find the item you are looking for.  Pros: -Very unique characters -The jazz piano is unrivaled -The storyline is excellent -Barely any bugs or glitches -I like the very unique pixel graphics  Cons: -The only con I would have to say for this game is the repetitiveness in the game.   
4290	1	a	Two things: 1. It's a shameless Katamari Clone 2. It's a well-done shame Katamari Clone that you can play on your pc.
1324	1	a	99/50
3259	1	a	I won't lie, I bought this as a joke. However, I got pulled into it. The simplicity puts my mind at ease. Everything in it has a purpose, and a path. A nice graphic style and calming music add to the Zen feeling that surrounds the game.
3819	1	a	Absolutely adorable. A timing-based game with a wonderful adventure story. Captures exactly what children probably imagination their costumes to be. Beware, the mini-game is fairly easy and can get boring. There's no consequences to failing a battle. The game is probably targeting younger children. Despite this, the story is fun and the animation is a treat. Definitely recommend.
1772	1	a	Some say 8bit PayDay. But my first in game experience of this was similar to that of 'Metal Gear Solid'. A guard spotted me and a red '!' appeared above his head. I made a run for it juked out 2 guards and headed for the exit van.
2270	1	a	Freedom spoon, must play, fun, quick, adictive.
4070	1	a	Great little game. I originally played it on the Nintendo DS, and it was so good I bought it for PC.  It is best played on a touchscreen.  Best one of the series. Avoid all the other versions, as they are HELLA boring!
2780	1	a	This is probably one of the easiest games to pick up and play, yet still be a great game.
401	1	a	Waves is a highly entertaining top-down twin-stick shooter. With its retro aesthetic and its frenetic pace combined with a tight gameplay, Waves provides a great arena shooter experience. There is a decent number of modes with interesting rules, and also a good electronic musical score.
1281	1	a	this game is honestly a better arena shooter than quake, doom, cpma or even tf2 its incredible
5011	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great puzzle game that had come out of its year. Sadly not many people have played this game during its release. However, this game is a good alternate portal game without portals but uses four different environmental effects to solve puzzles. Its not very easy and its not very difficult. Its moderate in my opinion. However, the difficulty is always different for different people. Some puzzles take time and some are smooth as butter.
5070	1	a	It's clearly designed for a tablet, so the controls could be a little more PC friendly, and it would be nice if it had an American English mode, but it's got a lot of puzzles, and I've had fun playing it, and it's cheap, so I recommend it.
775	1	a	Some technical issues aside, this is a fun game and the online play seals the deal!
5041	0	a	I had issues with the first game, enough to put it into the 'not recommended' category, but was still able to put up with it enough to play the puzzles. The same cannot be said of the second game, which is readily apparent as being far inferior in quality. If a good game were equivalent to Ghostbusters, the first game was Batman Forever -- not good, but with enough redeeming values to be enjoyed. Puzzler World 2, however, is more on the level of Manos: The Hands of Fate; on several levels it doesn't just fall short of its goals, it fails to even be recognizable as making a worthwhile attempt.  The issues of the first game not only remain, they are exacerbated. The 'picture quiz' game, which has absolutely no business being in a puzzle publication on account of not being a puzzle (memorizing isn't problem solving), remains, as does the kindergarten-level Silhouette. Codeword, one of the more creative and intelligent games of the original, is removed. Hangman is still set at a level that is too easy for anybody who can read at a first grade level. The maximum number of wrong guesses one should be able to get in Hangman is 6, a quarter of the alphabet. PW2 allows eleven wrong guesses. Another irritation from the first game, that being crossword answers that have multiple viable spellings not being accepted (and not being blocked because it doesn't completely interlink the way a proper crossword should) also continues here... along with some clues just being wrong, at least by American definitions. ('Mooch' does not mean 'skulk'; it means 'freeload'.)  Still, issues of the puzzles' difficulty levels would be minor complaints on their own. What sinks this from a C average all the way to an uncontested F is the interface. There are numerous design changes in this version that are just baffling. The 'hint token' prize boxes of the first game -- mildly annoying on their own -- are replaced by a 'Wheel of Fortune' spinner, complete with requirement that you spin it with sufficient speed (remember, this is a puzzle game, not a skill game). The Fitword puzzle now requires that the words be manually dragged into their places rather than typed. The 'Sum Up' puzzle has the answers floating around aimlessly for no reason other than to make it harder to see what you're trying to click on; the actual problem solving isn't made any more difficult, it's just the physical aspect that's made irritating. The crossword puzzles skip over filled in letters while you're typing -- so for example, if you already have the 'N' in from another word, you can't type 'ORANGE', you have to type 'ORAGE'. Worst of all, the Link-A-Pix puzzles, the most fun game from the original, are rendered completely unplayable by a decision to require the user to scroll around the screen instead of showing the full puzzle.  As if these bad design decisions weren't enough, the game is also severely buggy. There's visible lag in response times, items don't always line up the way they should (the word search lines are often off-center), and worst of all, a lot of it just doesn't work. Scrolling in Challenge Mode can't be done with the mouse, but only with the keyboard. The scrolling in Master Mode and the Trophy Room don't even work with that. There are arrows there, but you can't click on them, you can't spin the mouse wheel, and you can't use the arrow keys. You're told there's stuff to scroll to, but you can't scroll to it. And to top it all off, there doesn't appear to be a 'QUIT' button for the program. I had to use Task Manager to shut this piece of crap down. I won't be starting it up again.
4102	1	a	I love Bejeweling â¥â¥â¥â¥ to death.
1690	1	a	This is one fo the best games ever. Very fun with friends.
558	1	a	Another digital variant of greatest tabletop game. Very colourful, plays smooth, and well supported by developer. Must buy..NOW.
1782	1	a	the only 2d bank heist game.
1679	1	a	It fun, and stuff
3531	1	a	  This game is funny, fun and cool. I'm really lucky to have gotten this as a gift ^^.
1048	1	a	Pricetag completely justified.
2712	1	a	A lot of fun in both single- and multiplayer. Easy to learn, hard to master. Well worth the price.
1790	1	a	This game is annoying and weird at first, however! after about 1 hour into gameplay and playing some with my friend, who also bought this game. It began to become fun. I give this a 30/10 :) for anyone who likes PvP and Heisting in France. The only catch is the new interface and the confusing intro. I also recommend playing this with a friend for best results :)
1882	1	a	I could not imagine that this game will be so awesome! Coop, pvp, stealth, different and balanced classes, workshop maps, HOTSEAT GAME! This is AMAZING!
1037	1	a	  Yay, smuggle truck! Better than expected! Of course, it remidns me the Hill Climb Racing. Hard and extreme levels are fun. Remember, small rocks are evil.
3906	1	a	I keep playing it over and over so much fun, But I wish there was A 3rd. If your looking to buy it and don't know GET IT. GREAT GAME I RATE IT 10/10
1467	0	a	it's too simplified, too blocky, clunky, and the tutorial was terrible and had spelling mistakes. No love put into it. would not recommend people playing a half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  no, I know more fun games you can play when you pull out the whiskey
790	1	a	really great, and fun. its the board game brought online perfectly
3998	1	a	This is a fabulous but short little game that kept me entertained from start to finish.  My only complaint is that the battle mechanics can be a bit tight, and the game can be somewhat unforgiving due to its lack of an easy ability to grind out levels when youâre up against a hard fight. Unless I just really misunderstood the strategy
1270	1	a	Penguins Arena: Smegma's World is my new favorite game.
3174	1	a	Good physics puzzle. Had a lot of fun with it. Very good music too.  Like some puzzles, you may end up doing an alternate solution by accident or luck instead of the actual solution. That may happen in some levels but not always.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.
3868	1	a	Boils down the standard RPG formula to its bare bones for even the most casual of players to digest and then throws in some collection elements. It only lasts about 6 hours or so and the combat will get a bit stale with the lack of a deep progression system, but the writing will keep you laughing and it's definitely a good $15 spent. I especially reccomend it to anyone interested in game design or development. There's a lot of interesting experiments with opening up the genre to casual audiences here that I'd say succeeded.
1603	1	a	The best crime/heist game i've ever played
529	1	a	Digital version of the board games. So uhhh, you know. Play the crap out of this so you'll annihilate your real life friends! Assuming you have any!  Whatev. 5 / 12
2935	1	a	very fun, but only if you have other people to play with.
4702	1	a	Loving this game. Dripping with atmosphere, interesting mechanics, and great puzzles. Highly recommended
2417	1	a	Great multiplayer antics!
1893	1	a	Great Game High replay Value this game is Amazeing and Fun its comical just by hearing Pst when u type to someone Very interesting and simple gameplay but complex Great game the Very Fun high high replay value Though its not for the young kids cause its not like Payday The heist or any other Heist style game its unique and fun in its own style Highly recommended
1983	1	a	really good game, only downside is that it is basically IMPOSSIBLE to play single player, so recommend at least a party of 3 people. besides that, real good fun. :D
3951	1	a	great game for any age and lots of fun
920	1	a	Simple in its concept but quite addictive. This can remind of bejeweled or any games using the same gameplay, but with more options. You also have to fight monsters using the attacks you gain by putting elements together (a line or goup of 3 or more tiles). Perfect for when you have just a short period of time to play (Most of the chapters are between 8 and 12 minutes). Cute graphics and story. Easy to understand and play. I have played about 20 chapters so far and intend to finish the game.   You get to travel with 4 elemental spirits that will help you fight along the way. For each chapter you complete, you gain a puzzle piece which you can use to buy upgrades for the spirits/elementals that fights with you. This gives you options to help you win the further chapters and fight more ennemies. You're also free to upgrade the spirits you want (there is no obligation so you can upgrade only one of them if you want).  There are some records to beat and level of difficulty as well, which is interesting.
5291	1	a	It is quite an interesting game, it is a game that will pull you in and it's interactive
2139	1	a	Awesome game kind of like gauntlet but with heists and alot more characters.
4059	1	a	One of the few pinball games on Steam (might be the only). Luckily, It's a great game! I am pretty critical of pinball games and this one delivers. For an extra treat look for the youtube video of this game and the smashed keyboards from people playing this game to death.
1470	1	a	Monaco truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled 'Best Plan Ever' complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying âReady? GO!â, only to see it backfire in seconds.The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. Monaco offers a new and unique kind of chaotic co-op stealth gameplay, resulting in a work of indie art worth stealing.
817	1	a	Just like to board game I enjoyed this release. A good game all round.  Rated 5/5 
1919	1	a	Awesome game! 'Payday 2' but in a even better perspetive!!!
2835	1	a	Amazing game. Whether you want to take it slowly on your own or hop online for some of the most chaotic and unpredictable heists - get the game. Go watch a gameplay vid if it helps - screenshots and trailers don't really do it justice.
566	1	a	Love this game. It's easy to find city destination on PC version.
2798	1	a	Pretty sick game, online is fun, can be difficult but is a very good and unique heisting game
3030	1	a	this is addicting game!
3941	1	a	Really, really loved the game. A tad bit short, but it was so fun. The 2nd one was great, too
5477	1	a	Nobody told me we needed a Space Invaders clone.
4672	1	a	6/10  Overall the game is quite good. Although after a time the commentary of the 'Professor and Inventor' started to annoy me. I would only recommend it if you really like puzzle/platformer games and if it's on an offer.
812	1	a	My husband introduced this game to me sometime last year and it has kept us interested since then. The game looks exactly like the board game equivalent: graphics, ambiance and style. Only problem we ran into is that sometimes when one of us try adding the other to the multiplayer game via invite, for some reason, it doesn't recognize the invitation and we have to invite the other person again.   The choo choo sound can get on one's nerves after the 1000th time. Fortunately, you can customize the settings so it doesn't get annoying.   One other thing I wish we could do is pick the avatar and stick with it regardless of who or what we're playing against. Maybe even allow us to change the colour of that avatar.
5166	1	a	The game a bit buggy but the gameplay makes up for this.
1239	1	a	A First Person Shooter where the characters are in fact penguins and you shoot snowballs. Penguins Arena starts from an original idea and delivers an appreciable little game. It's something you should consider buying during a sale.
2630	1	a	this game is amazing
1546	1	a	Super Hard at some levels but extremely Fun
2553	1	a	At first this game feels very redundant, but you'll feel glad that it is. Each level is absolutely stunning and presents their own challenges. I &lt;3 Hacker
3470	1	a	it was pretty spooky
2042	1	a	Honest review  Best gun simulator 2015 Enjoyed hitting people with wrenches while getting spanked by guards
4899	1	a	The game is fun enough with physics based puzzles using different dimensions. Where it falls short is the platforming that it relies on more and more as the game progresses. It is awkward and inaccurate most of the time. Often I found myself in the situation that although I'd worked out a puzzle's solution executing the required platforming bits took repeated trials. Nothing is more frustrating that being halted by an inability to perform simple platforming tasks rather than an actual puzzle conundrum. Although I got pretty far into the game, I think the pain in the neck platforming will cause me to put the game in the 'probably will never finish' category. Someday, when I'm feeling up to the repetitveness I may return to Quantum Conundrum but that will probably not be any time soon.
1987	1	a	Just by playing the one-day-for-free deal, I loved every sneaky little moment of it! Great game to play co-op!
4624	1	a	A fun and well designed spiritual successor to Sierra/Dynamix's The Incredible Machine series. While a few of the themed sections (lasers, notably) outstay their welcome a bit, it's still a very enjoyable puzzle game.
5178	0	a	An unfinished mess, that I was very hyped for WAY back then when the Yogscast played it before it's release.  Now that I bought it...    It's an unfinished pile of garbage with horrible animations, and generally just feels like an Early Access Pre-Alpha game. Even for it's time, it's just plain lazy. SO this for the Develoeprs.
876	1	a	its fun and free
2383	1	a	Fun local multiplayer, but I hadnt the courage to play online.
5329	1	a	Super cool game for a kid. My son have played it for hours and hours at 5-6 years old. He needed help in some places, but have managed many thing on his own. It's non-agressive, mind and logic challenging and very pretty. Good game for my son to play at.
4555	1	a	A fun 50's Sci-Fi Tower Defence game. Cutscenes are brilliant, gameplay is good.
2744	1	a	man oh man i having hade so much fun with any other one's simular to this brings me back to my fond memories
1753	1	a	High amounts of fun. Especially when played with 3 friends in coop
2522	1	a	Nice and cheap game, totally recommend
5104	0	a	If you want a good game that is what this game was supposedly trying to live up to by going off its structure:  Dwarf Fortress.  The game uses ASCII graphics, so basically its computer symbols colored to represent items.  If you have problems with the simple graphics of DF, go get a tileset. There isn't DLC as the entire game is free. Free to Download, Free to Play, Free to Rage at your noobiness. Now the game of Dwarf Fortress has the steep learning curve that makes you adapt a play style to meet survival and entertainment needs.  This game does NOT live up to it in the slightest. First up; You start with the basics of Dungeon Keeper and it kind of plays like a version of it. Now that means there is a cap for population; making you level up your dwarves you have to make them work in your favor. Now while Dwarf Fortress offers skills; DF allows you to have up to 200 drunken â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s to throw a tantrum spiral over being pushed in a hallway. Also they just move in. You abandon one of your old forts to the flooded underground city it is, you can see any surviving dwarves possibly move to the new city. Second; !FUN! does not exist in this game. You get, again like Dungeon Keeper, random 'caves' that have enemies and objects in them. In Dwarf Fortress, you get caverns. These caverns contain your worst nightmares and then will bend you over and shove a broom up your â¥â¥â¥ if you fail to meet the standards of defenses by that point. Not even to mention the Circus. Third; THIS GAME JUST GETS EXTREMELY BORING.  YOU KNOW DWARF FORTRESS DOES? YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE, THEN THE CARP EATS YOU. YOU SETTLE IN THE HAUNTED WOODS AND GET DEVOURED BY A HEAD OF A ZOMBIE WHILE YOUR CIVILIANS JOIN THEIR RANKS.  YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE FROM STARVING; THEN YOU REALIZE YOU FORGOT ABOUT DRINKS AND WINTER IS COMING. AND ALL OF YOUR DWARVES ARE PARTYING, THE POOR â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥S. THEY WILL NEVER SEE THE HILL TITAN COMING TO CLEANSE THEM IN FIRE. Oh and you ran out of food because you decided to build a storage unit above ground and you forgot about roofs and all the birds and monkeys came in and stole your pickaxes and... everything.
4045	0	a	after up grading my computor to window 10 this game just flickers and Steam is unwilling to refund or help with this issue. do not get this game if you are up grading your computor to windows 10!!!
4580	1	a	One of the best tower defense mini-game :D
2828	1	a	What can I say about Monaco? Well the 2D graphics are simple extraficant and eye catching, smooth and beautiful and also fun to play with. Monaco is a puzzle solving game. One of my favorites.  But there are some faults. Like inactivity of NPC. I would love to see something like an NPC in the futher makings of the game. It just fustrates me how you have to play by your self (just one character with one ability) making it hard to solve levels, multiplayer (online people from around the globe) you'll probably get left behind if you suck online, and splitscreen, if you have no friends then thats a big downer.  If there were NPC you could solve the levels at you own pace, not getting left behind or waiting for others. You can solve it easily and enjoyably and you can have some friends! No their not real get a life.  But in all honesty this game is fully enjoyable and I fully reccomend it to everyone who loves to solve puzzles without the impossible challenges. Monaco earns a good 7/10. Great platformer and I cant wait to see the improvements in the upcomming years.
2326	1	a	This game is fun with friends, not so much without. The best thing about this game is content never runs out. You have workshopand a bunch of regular missions.
1448	0	a	i would instal for get Trading cards again  god sake for bad games on steam, my cousin with 9 years old said wtf is that sh..t? haha no ones want to play this  Also de admin INSTA ban me from forums for say i hate this game and looks terrible like shovelware.  'acting like a kid who develop Kid games' - ign
3843	1	a	A triumphant, if slightly low budget, return for Double Fine.
3740	1	a	A fun and light hearted game - the combat gives enough depth to warrant a few hours thrown in to it (which is all the games lasts) but definitely not enough to make me want to complete every single quest. It's a funny game and I loved the art direction, but a lot of it was much of the same repeated. Still, I went on and enjoyed it through to the end.
3255	1	a	I give the game an overall 9/10 score. It's pure fun and keeps you puzzling for hours, but with a little thinking it's not too hard to solve everything. It'd be a 10/10 if it weren't for the credits who show up too soon and repeat a few more times before you actually finish the 100 percent.
662	1	a	It's great, and I never get to go first IRL because Cornwall is not a country.
5367	1	a	I kind of wish Steam allows us to give games ratings rather than a yes/no recommendation, but at least we get to make reviews now! So first off, I like all of Puppy Games products. They've got a consistent look-and-feel across the board, the visuals are a pleasant retro homage but not overly simplistic.  For Titan Attacks, I have to say it's not my favorite. I REALLY love Ultratron, which is a Robotron homage. Titan Attacks is a Space Invaders/Galaga/Galaxian arcade shooter homage. It does its job well, but I feel it has some imbalances:  1) You earn money (shooting enemies, capturing escaping aliens) to buy upgrades. However, as the game progresses it gets harder to capture escaping aliens. When they escape, you lose money. Eventually, you're caught in a cycle where you can only earn enough to keep yourself even and never progress to the higher upgrades. This isn't just that 'Oh hey it's harder because things are faster'. Often times you literally can not reach the escaping alien because there's barrier that will kill you if you do. I feel it'd be more balanced with some sort of change to that penalty. Either a lesser loss of money or losing points or reseting the bonus multiplier. Perhaps only losing money every other escape? But honestly, I found by the time I got to Saturn that 9 times out of 10, attempting to grab or even shoot the escaping alien was guaranteed to kill me and so I just had to sit and take the money penalty.  2) Unlike traditional Space Invaders, this is an arcade shooter where the collision detection isn't absolute. You're ship can actually brush up against enemy ships, bullets, etc. But it seems incosnsitent with how close you can get and varies depending on if its a bullet, an enemy, an enemy explosion, etc. I'd like to see some sort of indicator to show you're too close or something.  3) The bonuses dropped by a saucer when you shoot it are usually points or money, which is great. Sometimes it'll be a super shield or a super gun. In my experience, all too often this ends up being right at the ever end of the level when you least need it. Instead of those bonuses reseting at the end of the level, they should just run for a fixed period of time (5-10 seconds I suppose).  4) I hate the asteroids. And I hate you don't get any points or anything for shooting them. Not even a single $1 of money. :P  Despite these things, Titan Attacks is certainly not a bad game. It runs flawlessly for me. The visuals are great, the music keeps up pace with the action and it's got a huuuuge range of different kinds of enemies with unique appearances, behavior and attacks. It definitely keeps you surprised and alert as you progress. I feel the game would be even better with some tweaks to game play. 
2668	1	a	Looks good, fun to play, cheap. Overal just a great game. You should really get it.
1812	1	a	can the mole tunnel through the barrier of failure?
3314	0	a	Did I hate this game? No, but I can't say that I liked it either and therefore can't recommend it.   Things I liked: -The artwork is adorable -the plot isn't bad  Things I disliked: -Combat quickly become repetitive and contain lots of QTEs. -Repetitive gameplay. Every area you enter has you doing the same tasks -Limited combat strategy. Every character has a normal and an 'ultimate' attack and that is it.  I didn't dislike the game enough to stop playing, but I can't say that I liked the game either. Towards the end, it felt like I was dragging my way through because I had made it this far and might as well finish it. With that, I can't say that I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 12. 
2054	1	a	Awesome co-op game. A must have for any Pacman fan. Ive put in 200 plus hours on this baby and still going strong. The map editor is worth the money by itself. 10/10
1431	0	a	I shouldn't be too hard on this game because of what it is: a game for kids that I think I got in some mega-pack of other games.   Think of it like baby's first Doom, with penguins!  But honestly... pass. Not really even worth the novelty for anyone over the age of 12.
1535	1	a	It is payday pixilation in this handful of heists! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is all about knowing how to get all of that loot out, while staying in one piece. If you like puzzles with a shot of adreneline, this game is for you! Pick locks and pilfer loots in this amazing thrill of a game!
4731	1	a	Really fun, if you liked portal you will like this.
2028	1	a	i like to buy it but i cant steam is be a f***Er to me and say no you can play a good game so if you can buy it BUY IT i love to but like i say it will not let me if you can help me say so plz 
1794	1	a	Fantastic game, fast paced and tense with a multitude of roles to play. This game is best with a group of people and even better with friends, although you can still have a swell time if you're playing just by yourself. Definitely worth the price tag, especially in a sale.
4003	1	a	Quirky little game that my kids enjoyed more than I (I sent them to my consoles and phone to play it so I could play grown-up games like...Long Live The Queen). Has a variety of costumes with different effects, neat combat system, and story is definitely fun.
3668	1	a	Cool game with JRPG mechanics.
906	1	a	
1184	1	a	The worst game I will build a wall to keep it out.
16	1	a	Great for competitive play. Worth the 74 cents I spent on it.
265	1	a	I got 99 problems but this fun little Geometry Wars clone isn't one of them!
3641	0	a	Cute game. Maybe a decent one for very, very young kids.  Mostly cons: No difficulty: You can't lose. Combat is child-friendly.
1709	1	a	Game is awesome. Gets completely hectic at the drop of a hat and then dies back down into the slower paced stealth game it was designed to be. The art style is awesome, the music is amazing, and the accent is even better.
1124	0	a	Great music, great visuals, but more frustrating than it is fun.
1387	1	a	Lighthearted Quake  Penguin arena was somewhat of a pleasant surprise, as I was expecting some simple indie game.  There is minimal story to the game. Basically, global warming has made it difficult for penguins to gether enough resources to survive. A godess arrives and states that only one tribe can survive and the others will have to pass away for the greater good. IN order to decide which tribe survives, the penguins battle it out on the remaining icebergs...  Gameplay revolves simple FPS mechanics and sliding. Each match sets you up as one of the tribes of penguins and you basically have to push the other tribes off the iceberg without being pushed off yourself. There are basically three game modes which are team (16 players/bots), duel (each tribe has one player and multiple lives) and unlimited ammo duel (like duel except you have unlimited ammo for weapons). You can play these modes against three/two/one team depending on your preferences. You start off with a basic snowball as a weapon, but you can find other weapons such as rapid fire fish, bombs and mines. Every time someone gets hit, they will be pushed back and slide all over the place (due to the slippery surface). this makes gameplay surprisingly fun and challenging (if somewhat unpredictable) as players will be sliding all over the place (which is similar to quake/UT where characters bounce arond after being shot). After falling off the iceberg, you take control of one of your surviving team members (if they are a bot). After all memebrs are dead you will become an immovable ghost towering above the arena, where you can launch explosives at the guuys below. Multiplayer is dead, but you can still play against bots.  There isn't much audio to the game. Weapons sound decent as well as the music. There is no voice acting.  Graphics are appealing. Everything looks cartoony which adds to a light hearted atmosphere. The penguin models look alright, but I keep being reminded of 'Firbies' (the toy) when ever I look at them (due to their short nature and beak).  If you want a cartoony and simplified quake-like game, this game has you covered.
2035	1	a	I might say its a great game the story is nice the levels arnt too frustrationg the workshop and zombie mode are good player vs player could do with an upgrade.But this game is more demanding to be played online or with a friend so yeah 7/10 GOOD JOB EVERYONE!
1901	1	a	Do you like Oceans Eleven?!?!?!? WELL THIS BEATS IT!!!!  Monaco is an amazingly amazing incredible, frustrating, yelling at you friends while laughing! Type of game.  Monaco Prepare to Die Edition &gt;_&lt; You get caught heal your friends and most of all... RUN!!!!!
3077	1	a	Fantastic game which doesn't require coop but it does make it more fun. It's kind of hard to tell what things are since you are seeing everything from a top-down perspective.
2638	1	a	I played it for only 30 mins and it was sooooooooooooooooo awesome! Works really neatly with a controller aswell.
1302	1	a	Oh yeah. Thats right. Ladies and Gents, what you see before you is down right combat and bloodshed in it's concentrated form.  No one who has ever see that you may have had a hope that maybe, just maybe, you could get out alive can just forget it now. This is war. Not only is this war, but its a gang war; one of the most illegal types of war is gang war but dont let that get you down, son. Nothing can prepare you for what will go down on the streets, even if you keep your head down and check your corners and stay frosty, no one can be really for certain what is going down downtown pound town. You know?  This game is about that head ho dog, Sedna, and her nonsese that she brings about. She is pretty salty that her big boy league was deciding that she was down to get settled on the retirement fee of what she really has done. No one could have predicted that she went and caused that the fallout of the supermarkets would crash and all the rival gangs would start fighting. The penguins returned in force and decided that they must fight eachother in order to unite once again under one banner, under one day, under one sacrafice.  The day has gone that the world within the Sedna arena of death will rise again withing this day of the day of tomorrow.   One day, you will understand how this deep lore calls out for a good day in the day of me. Nonstop fun for the family.
2176	1	a	it's a lot of fun if you are playing it with friend/s. Not so much alone in my expirience
1517	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.  In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.  The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.
3900	1	a	This reminded me of the fun I had playing Psychonauts, granted this doesn't have the same depth, character development, or even voice acting. It was still great fun.  Gameplay is essentially going around trick-or-treating while fighting off monsters that the adults can't seem to see. Imagination kicks in when the battles start, and this is where it can get a bit hilarious. You can form powerful teams with different focuses for each enemy type, or boss type, and it'll either work or fail.  The one thing that frustrated me about this game was not being able to equip your team before a fight started. I found too often that my fights accidentally engaged with the costume I was using to travel with.
1293	1	a	best game i've ever played, club penguin, quake, cod, csgo, all in one (cod being the fact it crashes now and again, still crashes less than cod at least) but i play this and life becomes clear. i recommend a gtx titan x for the intense audio (better audio option in settings) it outputs tho so if u dont then consider upgrading sorry mate thanks same nice cheers
3569	0	a	double fine does it again. this game is one of the worst rps's i have ever played. secound worst i would say. the combat system alone is enough to strike up a laugh but when you have spent money on it than its no laughing matter. this joke of a game belongs on IoS for 1 dollar.
450	1	a	Amazing game, worth buying in my opinion. of course if you like colors and some explosions inside battlefield  
3729	1	a	Interesting rpg
4684	1	a	Itâs a decent game, I think I Just had higher expectations for it. Donât get me wrong here, this game is still great and I still think that anyone that enjoys first person puzzle games should give it a go. For me it just wasnât as fun or satisfying as it seemed. I watched the trailer and was super excited to play this game, maybe I hyped myself up to much, I donât know, but as I got into in I found it a little meh. A lot of people straight away notice the similarities it has to the portal franchise, and I have seen a lot of people saying itâs a copy or a rip off. Well straight up I just have to put that straight. That is complete crap. The person who made this worked on portal 1 and 2, so you can hardly say itâs a copy, when itâs their own work. Itâs got its similarities but itâs a completely different game all together. If you are wondering why I found it meh, I honestly donât know how to explain it. The mechanics for this game are great, the dialog is pretty amusing at times, the graphics look really good and it had a nice humour to it. I just didnât feel too great about this game, and after a little while it became a chore for me to finish. It felt like it dragged on a little bit, I didnât feel like there was any real purpose to the game, from what I remember the storyline was ok but nothing to griping.  Itâs a game thatâs been done fairly well, and I still like it. I just donât love it. Now that Iâve finished it I doubt I will play it again, and if I do, it wouldnât be for the game itself, it would be for the achievements. (That Iâve recently became obsessed with getting in games)  All in all itâs still a good game, maybe other people feel differently about it to how I feel.
1029	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ that entertains sometimes!
247	1	a	Dang this game is addictive.... if you like games like Geometry Wars, this is a game for you!!!  The music is very catchy too... I actually like the music for this game more than Geometry Wars.  Definatly worth the cost... actually it is a steal!
117	1	a	Critical Mass is a action puzzle-solving 3D game taking place in space, where you use the mouse buttons to rotate and place blocks. You start off with a cluster of cubes and your objective is to connect 4 or more, successfully make your way a little closer to zero.. or not and gradually it will start zooming in towards your inevitable fate. Sounds familiar? it's basically modern time tetris with a twist to it. My biggest problem with this game is the way the mechanics work, having everything in 3D can be very disorienting at times and given that you have the cursor pointing at an object isn't normally that hard but adding also that you're rotating the object at the same time makes it easy to misplace blocks which can be very annoying where you're playing the more time consuming levels.
4586	1	a	If you like Tower Defense Games, this one will blow your mind. I'm already addicted to it. The game design and music is really cool. Pure fun!! :-)
1512	1	a	Such an awesome game!  You can clear each level the way you want to. A lot of different characters and ways to play, difficult to get bored of it as you can always switch and try to beat the same area a different way or try and aim for the achievements.  Also one of the greatest and most fun games I've played in co-op with a couple of friends as you sit and devise the perfect plan to clear the level in the most clean way possible only to find  your group massacring everyone in your way and run for your lives!  10/10 would recommend this game to all types of gamers
1335	1	a	please make this game cheap again my friend needs it
3538	0	a	A game with lots of wit and humor, that could have been great. However, the combat is just brain dead boring. It's basically a much worse version of Paper Mario. At no point did I need to do anything other than hammer the A button at the strongest enemy, and press Y for a super when it charges. I want to finish the game but I simply cannot sit through any more of the combat!
4901	1	a	Perhaps a bit childish, but still fun. The puzzles are maybe a little too easy.
4574	1	a	I enjoyed this game. It puts a nice 'Spin' on the tower defense concept, pun intended.  I loved the throwback B-movie theme and had no issues other than the credits not reacting well to a click.
4637	1	a	Rub Godborg! Uhhhhh.
5234	1	a	it is just clean and colorfull, one of the best games for kids.
2509	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a truely unique game. In those times where you really don't know what to play, this is the game to fill that hole. It's an absolutely fantastic game to play solo and an even more spectacular game to play with friends  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDBYp82dZ5M) . A true gem.
2058	1	a	This is a great game with with everything you could want in a game. It has great graphics, fun gameplay, online co-op, great controls, lots of stuff to do, and best of all it's unique.
3751	1	a	Fun little time. Double fine makes such good games!
1825	1	a	Lots of fun!
3223	0	a	Why did i pay $0.50 for a flash game?
4635	0	a	Doesn't run. Do not buy.
4680	1	a	Somewhat along the lines of Portal, this is a puzzle game that sets you thinking! Very gentle game, very well thought out, drawn and animated, with plenty of nice touches. The four dimensions you work in offer many, many interesting possibilities. Highly recommended!
1913	1	a	1v1 me in club penguin i'll hack into your webkinz account
2030	1	a	Only played a few hours with friends. Not a bad game at all! Just tough to play with people who genuinely don't like 2D games and / or playing for realz.  Can't see anything wrong with it. 7 / 12
1630	1	a	Be heist or be silent. This !!!
2160	1	a	Monaco is a wonderful game and for all you heist loving fans this would be your type of game. It's a stealth co-op game. You cna work together as a team or do it yourself. But it is hard when you only have one person. All the characters are used in this game for different things.  Pros: - It's a good game, perfectly made and has a wonderful aspect to it.  Cons: - It's a more Team Effort game and not everyone is up for that and it's just hard doing it by yourself and there's not that meny people playing online to do it with. Despite the fact you can't choose servers it just hooks you up to a random one.  But overall this game is well done and i recommend this game to people who like a sneaky challange.
1754	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an amazaing game of stealth and sneakyness with many YOLO moments as well! Great with friends, Great for busting time, and AMAZING for general fun!  Get Shotgun, Get Money, Get Kills - NO WITNESSES!!!! 10/10 - Love It To BITS
1099	0	a	Rubbish!  Hill Climb Racing Fail!  Android games are better than this.
4387	1	a	A bit like Katamari Damacy, this game was surprisingly addictive, with catchy music on most levels. A bit short, with only about 2 hours worth of gameplay to get all trophies, somehow it just hooked me in.
3519	1	a	Costume Quest is the journey of a few kids to find as much candy as they can on Halloween (and maybe save one of their sisters along the way... if they feel like it).   It's innocent fun that conjures up feelings of nostalgia that I'm sure we can all relate to, while positively radiating with a pristine aura of charm and joy. Now if all that doesn't already sound appealing to you, there are also a ton of innuendos and jokes that only adults can connect with strewn throughout.  This journey should take you around 5 hours to complete, even if you seek to obtain every single collectable. It's definitely pretty brief in terms of longevity, but I still really enjoyed my experience.  If you're willing to let the kid inside of you out for a bit of fun, I'd say this game is worth at least one playthrough.
1625	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5080	0	a	As much potential as this game had, it's sad to see it never actually befoming a fun game. The digging is fun, and there's good bits of crafting and decorating and other things that are fun.  But the engine the devs used, killed any modding community or content sharing.   That and the tedium of the 'story' missions ie 'where can i dig to get to the sparkly square and tell my warriors to go' sadly remove all the acutal management and tactical parts of the game.   I wish this had gotten a sequel made in a more flexible engine that allowed for actual AI.   Skip it.
4848	1	a	have you ever imagined yourself Portal without portals? [almost] Without A.I.`s, but with mysterious alien-looking organic beings? Without Cave jonson, but with fancy genius uncle? Wihout gel, but with mysterious colorful pills? Bet you haven`t. Well, SURPRRISE!
1667	1	a	High amounts of fun. Especially when played with 3 friends in coop
2913	1	a	crazy insane co-op action, definately buy the four pack get some friends together and enjoy
1187	1	a	Get it while its on sale, it worth 0,19 â¬!
1034	1	a	Sexiest Truck I ever seen in my life
4466	1	a	This hidden object game tries to be different but it falls in mediocre category. It's fun when you want to waste time but meh, this game is only worth it when it's on sale.
4840	1	a	This game is sooo much fun! Nice challenging puzzles too.
4544	0	a	This is one of the worst puzzle games Iâve ever played. I donât even know where to start.  So the object of the game is to wait for some colored dots to spawn, then click on a variety of stationary tools to get them to fly into receptor objects. Sometimes the dots will fly wildly all over the screen until you activate magnets to suck them up. Other times they will break or decay and need to re-spawn. Yet other times they donât respawn, so if you mess up the puzzle you need to start all over. There are a few good ideas, but what game doesnât have a few good ideas? Here, itâs completely destroyed by a large number of issues:  * Non-deterministic physics. When I first played the game, the introductory level told me to âjust watch.â Then physics glitched out and two particles collided when they should not have, breaking the level and leaving me staring at the screen until I realized I had to restart. Things didnât get much better from there.  * Most of the puzzles donât involve planning, but having highly precise aim and timing. This is âI know what I need to do, but itâs taking me two hundred tries to do it: the gameâ   * Solved the puzzle? â Great, now you have to do it again. Four times. For some reason, clearing most stages requires you to repeat the exact same actions several times in a row, usually four times, sometimes more. All the while, the physics could glitch out at any time and require a restart.  * The only texture in the game is the space background. White textureless models are hard on the eyes and make it difficult to distinguish between different objects.  * Twitch-reaction solutions are very frustrating when they require quickly clicking on multiple tiny objects.  * Camera controls are a joke; the camera and the game canât be controlled at the same time, and it resets at the beginning of every level.  * The only music is a few 12-second ambient loops. Sounds are unremarkable. (The voice-overs for the tutorials were decent, though)  * It is impossible to play this game in full-screen if you have multiple monitors, it will crash instantly. You need to edit a config file just to let it run.  In short, this game is irritating, obtuse, unrewarding, glitchy, and visually awful.   On the bright side, I got all of the achievements in under 5 hoursâ¦ so if youâre an achievement hunter, go for it, just donât expect to have much fun.
5364	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
2521	1	a	Monaco is one of my favorite games, and probably will remain so. From my perspective, its meant to be played co-op and not too seriously. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously. You and three of your friends (or three strangers on the internet) get to run, hide, steal, and generally cavort your way through tons of zany levels. And due to the amazing level editor, the content does not stop when you finish the story mode. Its tons of fun, so go buy it! You won't be disappointed. This game knows that even without the most advanced graphics, perks, or features, its all about gameplay, and Monaco's gameplay cannot be beat.
5502	1	a	New age Galaga. Extremely entertaining and very addicting. Leaves you frustrated and satisfied at the same time. Good buy.
4359	0	a	It's like Katamari except with crappy music, lousy controls, and none of the charm. So I guess it's not much like Katamari at all.
4764	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great experience overall, but it somewhat lacks in a few aspects. First of all, if you liked the original Portal you will probably like this game, considering it was made by most of the same team. The puzzles are good, not too hard, but not so easy that I could fly right through them. I see a lot of potential here, if they are planning a sequel, they should try to do the same thing Valve did for Portal 2. If you feel like taking a trip to Quadrangle Manor I would reccomend that you wait for a sale before purchasing. But it is worth the price if you can't wait. 7.5/10
1271	1	a	Was looking for a well-made, action packed fps to play for hours on end and still never get bored.      then I said f*ck it and bought this instead.
805	1	a	Hello All, Anyone up for a game of trains.
1257	1	a	It's like engie mge but slightly more autistic  11/10 goty
1145	0	a	Unless you enjoy talking balls that make engine sounds and jump around in a small arena, I would not get this game. I only paid $0.29 for it, but I just don't like it. I closed the game after 5 minutes and never played it again.
2816	1	a	A geezer, a fat guy, a nerd, and a monkey walk into a bank....
4443	0	a	This game looked good for my kids aged 3-6, but you need good reading skills to play (practically no other way to work out how to play or what things mean), which rules out the younger kids, and it isn't that easy to follow what's going on. I would say it might be good for kids around age 8+  It is not good for younger kids than that.
2040	1	a	Killed my friends in pvp before they could grab guns. 10/10
1533	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played
3421	0	a	It's a children's game. I got bored with it very quickly, despite the art style, background music and animations (which are all done well). Combat is turn-based, and consists of attacking and defending. It's a very very simple turn-based RPG. You have quests, you have an item slot and you can level-up but it's all so very shallow. Would not recommend for anyone over the age of 15.
5009	1	a	This is a Great game, like portal but with physics
2621	1	a	This is a really fun stealthy grab everything topdown with sight line game, and if your friends play it, it's even better.
212	1	a	This is one of the best indie games I've played in my whole life. Soundtrack is fun and enjoyable, but could have a little bit more bass. Graphics are really cool, neon color scheme fits with the gameplay, game modes are kind of lacking in change, but overall, this game is a must.
3244	1	a	It's worth noting that the difficulty varies WILDLY throughout the game regardless of each level's difficulty rating and two or three puzzles (out of like 200) require millisecond-level timing. However, I did enjoy the game overall so it gets a recommendation from me.
3420	0	a	While I love Double Fine Adventures, this was not worth the time or money to me personally. It is a bit repetative and it lacks the ability to save wherevere/whenever I want. I quit playing after I kept starting from the same point after a while when I'd only want to play for about 20 mins or so (then again, I can sometimes be a slow gamer, so the checkpoints may arrive earlier for you).
4055	0	a	It bugs... Nice...
836	1	a	If you like this classic board game, you won't be disappointed. Works great on Windows (both 7 and 10), has got all the features. The music is nice so are the sound effects, they can be set up via menu. The graphics are minimal and well implemented. It's fun, fun and again fun. 
2846	1	a	Fun. Probably better with more people.
3847	1	a	Do you enjoy being happy? Enjoy smiling and being filled with that warm fuzzy feeling you get after laughing for 2 and a half minutes straight? Well then you should buy this game. If you know someone who also enjoys these things, then you should buy them a copy too. If you don't smile while playing this game, you can personally add me on steam and I'll send you a gift copy of Pyschonaughts.
5420	1	a	Very nice little timekiller that reminds me of galaga big plus for me is that i can play it mouse only, the game has a very retro oldschool feel to it in a nice way the graphics fit this game very good  nice powerup system you can upgrade for example your shields between levels and if you get hit you can add shield again later on after the level, if you get hit you loose some so you need to :) same goes for the rest so there is a reason to score you want the cash for your upgrades very nicely done  9/10
4220	1	a	Still a good game, though I am wondering why this isnt a port of the Xbox live version which had achievments and a small expansion of sorts. gameplay is still as good and frustrationg as ever.
3213	0	a	Uhhhh Soooo bored after playing this, I rather watch a screensaver!!!!! AVOID!
2516	1	a	What can i say: i spent 40 hours last week playing this beast. This is what i game for; pure playability depth, with trophie and score based levels.  Multiplayer-centric, but optional. Anyway, in the last levels you will really miss not having partners to help you, so mp is almost a must.  You can play 100%, mp, 1p, any% speedruning, you name it, and the gameplay changes entirely  It even has an story going (skippable), with plot-twists here and there.  Really looking forward for the next update, so i can munch more levels.  10/10
4751	1	a	Dis game is fun. Similar to a portal 2 but with very different game style. Portal has portals, this has dimensions. 4 different dimensions and sometimes,(like in portal) you need to act fast. I got this game and its a bit laggy, which makes it harder, but I got season pass or whatever. I'd get as you can get your money out of it.
2240	1	a	So much fun and frustration while playing with friends, would def recommend to anyone 10/10 A+ would shrek again
2475	1	a	It's like performing a heist in a movie, but harder. Lasers, guard dogs, civilians, and a particular man who keeps losing his job are all out to get you. But with both multiplayer and singleplayer gameplay, eight characters to suit you, and even a zombie survival gamemode, this game doesn't get old. It seems impossible at first, but you just have to think about how to come about it. You want to steal diamonds, but lasers are in the way? Hack the security or cut the power. Did your disguise fail, and the guards are starting to look at you funny? Time to casually walk around the corner and into a bush. Or, if things go poorly, you could always, you know, pull a gun on them.  The game is well balanced, and all the characters have a redeeming trait that makes them all fun to play. If you're playing multiplayer, it might be in your best interest to work together. Have someone lure out a guard while another person comes up from behind and knocks them out. Hack a nearby computer and turn off the cameras. You can mastermind much more powerful schemes with just one more person with you, but the game is also really fun in singleplayer. There seems to always be two ways to do something...  Overall, there's no reason not to give this game a shot. Stealth and planning are rewarded, but it doesn't take a genius to get hooked to this. Should you be playing Singleplayer, even if you die, you can play as another character and continue where your last character failed. If you fail to snag the loot in Multiplayer and go down, a friend can revive you if they can manage to get to you. It's possible to recover from a failure, and the game seems to encourage trying new things.  9/10, excellent game. Plus, if you beat the entire game, you can try robbing player-made levels. A real challange.
599	1	a	The best game ever made.
3431	1	a	Costume Quest is much like Halloween candy: fun-sized and sweet. Though itâs not a long game, itâs very enjoyable and it doesnât overstay its welcome. It employs JRPG elements that are reminiscent of the Paper Mario games and the mechanics are simple and accessible. But the big draw is the charm that is stuffed into every aspect of the story and characters. I thoroughly recommend joining Reynold and Wren in saving Halloween no matter what time of year it is.
458	1	a	Twin-Stick shooter AWESOMENESS!!!
1180	1	a	This is it, the game that will revolutionize society and the human way of life. If I hadn't played this glorious tribute to both the accomplishments and sins of mankind, I would not have acquired the cognitive skills I have today.  '10/10 would gumboy again.' -Rock, Paper, Shotgun '11/10 cured my wife's cancer and removed the blight of my crops.' -Otaku '7.8/10 too much gumboy.' -IGN
335	1	a	An extremely fun and simplistic shoot em up top down 'twin stick' shooting game. Its easy to pick up and put down, and with a variety of modes to choose from and the ability to slow time or blow it all up, it is a wonder its not more expensive.
5492	1	a	Titan Attacks is just Old School. When I want to get challenged I play this game. You have your rage moments but when you win you feels epic. This game is SUPER cheap and worth it! I don't know how you can't have it &gt;.&lt;
513	1	a	Quite good. Works good when you don't have any real people to play the normal boardgame with.
1764	1	a	Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop. I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard.  The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms. It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.  I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3
1473	1	a	Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.  Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.  The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).  As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.  On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.  In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win.   But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more.   The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.  Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.  The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.  All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.  Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.
5110	0	a	Painfully unfunny and horribly paced. There are many other, better dungeon/city building games than this.
197	1	a	  Waves Review - Ace Elite
1750	1	a	Surprisingly refreshing and entertaining, especially when played with friends. Stealth isn't a must, and is rather difficult to maintain at first, but it can come in handy when you don't have a lot of ammunition and want to avoid a high body count.
4118	1	a	Awsome time sink 8/10
3238	0	a	Not that great, could be ALOT better!
2691	1	a	...Moffilins (Muffins)
1287	1	a	Want a true Smash Bros and not this Brawl crap? Play Penguins Arena. The game is fast-paced and actually has gameplay with some depth in it. You can combo kicks and throw projectiles that affects how much you push your foes. This is a true PC gaming experience and remembers the basics such as lan-based multiplayer and windowed support. Taking advantage of PC Hardware, offers a true HD 60fps experience, something consoles wont give you. If you are a true pc gamer, or gamer in general, and this game doesnt have 500 hours of playtime on your account, you are a terrible person and should be ashamed of yourself.
625	1	a	True to the physical game.
3496	1	a	Really captures the feel of halloween during the 90s, back when people cared about halloween  
3214	0	a	Tactical game where u need reading skills. Cheap game to spend alot of time. Its hard and u MUST use ur brain to complete levels :D  But isnt making that much fun. If u want to spend time with thinking then yes. But im looking for a fun game
4864	1	a	really makes you think a great game for the price (if under 20$) took me about 25-30 hr's to clear all the dlc and reg game (which i did in reverse order..... don't ask)
4627	1	a	EDIT: You know, nowadays I quite realize that the game is way too literally broken to recommend it up and I should have recommended it down. It's just that I am biased heavily toward this series that I was willing to overlook it. You may want to try some older PsyhX or something. But yea, you probably should avoid this game after all.  Crazy Machines 2 is a sequel to Crazy Machine, not counting Crazy Machines 1.5, released in 2008. It's a game of genre of Incredible Machines, where you build a machines out of many details that will accomplish the goals in one way or another. Or more exactly, you feel the needed spaces with limited amount of elements to find one of few correct solution. More of classic puzzle than anything sandboxy you see lately. Game even supported PhysX new-by-then hardware.  And now, about how it runs nowadays on Steam. It runs badly! First, many people have trouble at making this game start at all. I didn't had problem with launching it. You should check demo version first somewhere to see if game will run for sure or not. If you will have trouble then try to find and (re)install OpenAL. Then I personally had physics not work in this game. Managed to fix it by reinstalling PsyhX and then rebooting computer. Though I have feeling that rebooting was enough, after all game itself should install PsyhX drivers. Anyway. Try to reboot computer first after installing game.  Get demo off Internet and try it first!  Once you are past launch troubles (which you may not have), you still have the amazingly screwed physics in game itself, which is quite a really bad thing for physics-based puzzle. The thing is that physics are not reliable. Tweaking some elements may change the resulting behavior of other elements that aren't connected to the one being tweaked in any way. You may be changing gears around in one part of map and it will somehow make baseball miss the bucked while rolling off slope somewhere else, for example. It's quite frustrating when you got solution right, yet it may not work until you play around with objects. That, and the way that physics work in game seemed to slightly change from when it originally came out. What it means is that some solution don't work anymore. Now, it doesn't affect Crazy Machines 2 much, I enjoyed beating it fully. but there is a single puzzle in Bonus Labs, puzzle number 18, where official full (with bonus objectives) solution doesn't work. You can however get to see the full solution that community figured out in a list of high score records, by watching replay, once you rush through puzzle without completing bonus objectives. DLCes seem to have more of broken puzzles, so watch out for those.  Puzzle instructions, which funny professor with overgrown moustaches narrates (instead of being annoying by popping in randomly for some always-repeated comment like in the original CM), also have small problems. The on-screen drawings that point out objectives appear much slower than voice reads the text. Even more, I noticed that some of the later puzzles have intros where voice narrations and text have little differences. And there was even a puzzle where text and voice instructions put 'in what order it should be done' incorrectly, different from on-screen drawings!  As you can see, Crazy Machines 2 is full of technical flaws. Which is quite a shame, because it's superb sequel to Crazy Machines.  It has a much more 'high-budget' feel to it than previous title, sporting modern-by-then shiny graphics, support of more complex physics (Like, ropes can be hanged without being connected to anything, useful for just pushing objects.), even 15 themes, with their own decoration and music. Soundtrack is a bit too much of 'stereotypical local', but got nice pieces, like Caribbean theme that sounds slightly like something from Monkey Island . On bad side it's hard to understand whole puzzle system from the first look, new graphics/style are quite messy, also having useless decorations mixed in.  It also introduced new complex systems of gears and laser, making them often main focus of puzzle. There are also robots made of 3 parts and switches on which you can place switch of any given type, like button or timer clock. Instead of puzzles being one-trick physics stuff, you often will have to manipulate whole system of gears, lasers, electricity, switches. Which isn't such bad thing, especially knowing that physics are buggy here.  And every puzzle in this sequel concentrates on mostly figuring out where in the system to place each elements. There are almost no puzzles where the only thing you have to do is pixel-perfect placing of elements, unlike original Crazy Machines. I mean, not when you figure out how it should work, but when you are busy tweaking placement, being frustrated with it. I like Crazy Machines 2 approach so much more! Not to mentioning that it saves some work when it comes to precise placement after all by having a minimal step which elements can be moved by, so to say.  Game also gives you mandatory and bonus objectives, while also providing with text clues and other hints, giving it less frustrating moments. Unlike Crazy Machines, where you either figure out solution to some-super-tricky puzzles or don't progress at all.  Overall, you will get 150 main puzzles to solve, with last 40 of which being hidden until you beat all previous ones properly. There is also 10 tutorial puzzles that you should do. 20 more Bonus puzzles. And 20 more bonus puzzles that were made exclusively for PhysX hardware. No, you can't access those. So no idea what to expect in them.  You also can design your own puzzles for your own amusement or to send it to others. Yes, you can download and upload your labs in the game to the server. And editor lets you do quite a lot of things too. Though, for some reason it has some elements locked. The requirements for those is to get some awards in main campaign, by, for example, using fireworks few times. Bad thing is that it doesn't tell you what exactly you are supposed to do to unlock them, from what I know. In all honesty, I didn't try making my own labs or try using others, so I can be wrong.  Overall, I can recommend this to only those who are ready to handle technical difficulties and those who loved Incredibly Machines games. It's good sequel and I can overlook all trouble I sometimes had for all fun I had with puzzles that didn't feel unfair. Everybody who doesn't want to bother, well, eh, should avoid this one.  Perhaps I should give this game thumbs down, but at core it's real good. I had fun.  Now, I also should mention that Back to Shop DLC, that has glitchy store page so you can't review it, is way too bugged. While it's good, few puzzles don't work properly anymore, official solutions will not do. So watch out, if you are planning to get it, then you will have to live with few unbeatable puzzles and not being able to access last 10 puzzles.
3992	1	a	Very short game but full of gladness in every moment of playing. Recommended to everyone who loves RPG and Halloween.
4730	1	a	A very fun and very clever game! Almost as frustrating as Portal
931	0	a	A lot like puzzle quest, in that it's bejeweled with some extra â¥â¥â¥â¥ tacked on to make it even more addicting. The kind of game you resent for not being really very good, but still you find yourself playing for hours.
4537	1	a	Virtual Families is like Tamagotchi evolved. Think of it like sims, only that the game continues even when you're asleep. The music is terrific, you can bond with your virtual family really good, and keep them on their toes, to guide them to prosperity. Its simple yet addicting.
1633	1	a	One of the most exciting and puzzling game i played. Its more fun to play with friends.
5000	1	a	A seemingly easy puzzle game at first, but every once in a while a tricky one comes up. Most of them can be overcome by figuring out a new concept, but a few require precise placement which can get quite frustrating at times.
1578	1	a	Very nice game! Makes for some really fun play with friends. Later missions in the game are really hard, so playing in teams of at least 3 is important.
2148	1	a	This game is very logical:   'Where did they go? I swear they went in this room'  'How about that bush in the corner?'  'Brian, don't be an idiot'  9/10 not enough pineapples
1846	1	a	Brilliant stealthy tactics in single player, with lots of chaotic fun in multiplayer, as well as a lovely sense of humour and excellent soundtrack. Definitely worth a buy.
705	1	a	This game might look like just trains, but it actually is fun. And addicting, money well spent.
5505	1	a	its like space invaders on crack, and you get mega upgrades!
1368	1	a	  Somehow this game can be very funny...
2632	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
4404	1	a	This could be one of the greatest games for wasting time in the universe.  From the makers of AaAAaaAAA! and 1..2...3...Kick It!; The Wonderful End Of The World is a game similar in style to Katamari Damacy. Walk around, pick things up, get bigger, pick more up, play hidden levels and have fun!
4923	1	a	As brain-bendingly punishing as you can imagine. It's a bit more linear than Portal, but you get more toys to play and experiment with and the humor, combined with John De Lancie's amazing voiceover work, makes for a HELL of a lot of fun. Definitely a buy.
2039	1	a	Eh, this game is alright. I enjoyed it mostly. Although this seems like a game that's better suited for consoles. I wouldn't get this game unless it is on sale.
4682	1	a	A fun and mentally stimulating puzzle/adventure game from one of the lead designers of the original Portal. If you liked the Portal games and want something similar, this is a great gem that you shouldn't miss. :)
3857	1	a	One of the few really good Halloween themed games.
5239	1	a	Bought this for the Wife and she seems to like it so far.
2065	1	a	Awesome game, the stealth, the knocking everyone down before you get caught. Just plain awesome. Buy this game. Now. Even when you're reading this.
2356	1	a	A humorous top-down 8-bit esque game involving hours of entertainment. The accents that the civilians and guards have is highly amusing and the gameplay is at first glance simple but becomes increasingly complex as each character plays in different ways and the complexity only goes up as you play with more people in different combinations trying to get the highest score. The gameplay can switch back and forth between frantic flight from the police to stealthy guard knockouts within less than a minute and at no point in the game will you not feel challenged. A good game for yourself, a great game for friends.
5203	1	a	At first i was skeptical to try the 2nd series because of the hardcore puzzles from the last one.   But it turned out that this one's more intuitive and engaging.   Great graphics, gameplay, puzzles, sound and animations. The music though i personally prefer the lat one.   Never the less, the game is actually fun to play and i would also recommend even the kids to play this game :). Mind the puzzles though, they can get a lot challenging as you progress further.
1311	1	a	I bought this game too far back to remember, and just left it sitting in my library, untouched. I started it up earlier to let it run in the background to get the cards, but thought 'What the heck, name sounds interesting, I'll play it for a minute.'   This game is extremely underrated! Seriously, if you're browsing the reviews and don't know whether to buy this game or not.... BUY IT! Seriously, you won't regret it.
2660	1	a	great game for anyone who likes coop games and loves to rob stuff :P 9/10
1735	1	a	I think the biggest issue this game has is getting people to give it a try due to the graphics.   Even though the graphics give off that old 8-bit atari feel, it feels nothing like it. Try to imagine a stealth game like theif in a more retro setting, and then add three other players plus lots of awesomeness. While it can be played single player, this game thrives as a team stealth game.   In terms of content Monaco has more than enough to keep you busy for months. There are tons of levels, each taking anywhere from 10-20 min on average, and even after you beat all the levels you can try the levels with different character combinations. Each character having it's own unique ability that helps your team in it's own unique way.  Truley an amazingly fun and challenging game, if you already have a group of friends you game with, this is definitly a game worth getting.  
3640	1	a	Costume Quest is a light-hearted adventure with great ambiance, fun gameplay, and funny dialouge. It's reminiscent of EarthBound.   Walking around is a little choppy but otherwise I have no complaints.
343	1	a	Great relaxing tool! Love this game!
470	1	a	Let's just say that this is the game that I wanted voted for the Love/Hate Relationship award. Trying to go achievement hunting with this game  almost made me cry ;_;  made me extremely furious, but I just LOVE the music and all the shooting. Just. Pure. Shooting. And explosions, and slow motion, but yeah. AMAZING, BUT NOT REALLY
5177	1	a	Minecraft meets the management of say... AOE. Humor level around orcs must die's tone. I highly recommend the game even tho the production levels are fairly low. Its cute and easy to lose yourself in it for 5 hours if you dont focus on the mission task.  Rumored to have broken achievements, will confirm.
3378	1	a	One word: 'AWESOME'.   That's just because I can't spell out that Supercalifragisomething word though. That and I'm too lazy to look it up.   I could not stop once I started the game. Costumes that turn into the real deal, a really cool excuse to hoard candy (Costume Quest: 'Saving the World One Candy at a Time'), and an adventure with little to no adult supervision? Who wouldn't want some of THAT for even just a single night? Count me in! Hygiene-wise, the whole rummaging garbage bins and picking up candy from dirty floors was kind of questionable, but I'm guessing nobody gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about these things. Candy is candy and it's love.   By the way, I 've never tried trick-or-treating. I know, I know... I had a really boring childhood. This game made me want to turn back time and give it a try for even just once though. But then again, who said only kids get to trick-or-treat? I'm adding that to my bucket list.
2971	1	a	Fantastic multiplayer game with fun level design and characters. 9/10

328	1	a	Good twin stick shooter. Feels well balanced. Offers some challenges, looks pretty. RIYL geometry wars. Don't see any obvious flaws. For the price, it's amazing.

5405	1	a	Upgrades and fancy graphics definitely made space invaders better. The controls can be a little bit frustrating at times, but when you're used to it, and playing in full screen to avoid the mouse leaving the screen, it can be a lot of fun.
281	1	a	Shoot em up on a fixed arena. You get to play many different modes. Basically shoot a veriety of bad guys, collect light to level up and boost the score. Cool soundtrack and very neat graphics!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0euskyHDdBU 
2223	1	a	A steal for its price, a must buy
2717	1	a	one of the best co-op game ever!  A Heist and stealth game for couch co-op
4418	1	a	It's Bejeweled!
5184	1	a	A nice change of pace for me. The level of customization to the world is nice. The graphics are respectable IMO. Game play is also respectable IMO. Over all a very well made and enjoyable game if you have the time and patiance to play it.
3713	1	a	The game is better than what it looks like at first sight. May get repetitive in the second half.  I liked it.
29	1	a	Game of the century!!!!!!! 100/100 10/10 5/5 1/1 PERFECT SCORES OMG YES SO GOOD PLEASE BUY. THIS GAME SUPPORTS SLAVERY. THIS GAME ADVERTISES NUCLEAR WAR. THIS GAME RECOMMENDS DRUG USE, SPECIFICALLY ECSTASY. THIS GAME IS LITERALLY A BAG OF RAINBOWS STUCK IN A HAIRY GORRILA â¥â¥â¥â¥. THIS GAME IS SO GOOD THAT I BOUGHT THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AFRICA BECAUSE IT'S SO NUTRITIONAL. GREAT GAME. YES. MUCH BUY. VERY GOOD.
1200	0	a	Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.
5508	1	a	It's space invaders 2000 edition.
3035	1	a	Enjoyable graphics and gameplay, and it's a blast to play with friends. I found it boring while playing solo, so wait for a sale, buy a four-pack, and guilt your friends in to playing it with you.  Side note: Purchasing this through the Humble Store comes with a Steam key and DRM-free version of the game.
3993	1	a	I get to be a robot.
427	1	a	More challenging than Geometry Wars, however there is a severe lack in diverse polygon-based enemies
289	1	a	Very fun and challenging game, if you are looking for a casual game to pass the time, this is the game!
2703	1	a	great game, very funny!
613	1	a	I was recently introduced to the board game. The computer version is even better because it is much cheaper than the board game, there is almost no setup/clean up, and you can play with random people (or friends) at times when you have a free 30-60 mins. Great translation from physical to digital!
945	1	a	I enjoyed Legend of Fae immensely. It caught me by surprise with its fun, unique and clever game mechanics and kept me hooked right until the end. The varied spells and enemies kept combat interesting and exciting, and the story was intriguing enough to catch my interest. Swapping back and forth between puzzle and attack mode in battle can be a little tiring, but it's a small complaint considering how enjoyable the rest of the game is.
4046	0	a	Great story background but with a very slow and unsatisfying progression. Amazingly long dialogues, most of them useless, minor gameplay issues and technically way below average.
4881	1	a	Great idea, you can solve puzzles in different dimensions. The game have a good feelings but the puzles going to a little bit boring after a time. ________________________________________________________  Ãtletes kis logikai jÃ¡tÃ©k, ahol kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÅzÅ dimenziÃ³kban kell egy-egy adott feladatot megoldanunk. Nagyon hangulatos, de a fejtÃ¶rÅk egy kicsit unalmasak lesznek egy idÅ utÃ¡n.
2680	1	a	Nice game! But make it free! All players want this free to play! Please just make it free!! I played it on free weekend its awesome!!
1279	1	a	Great game, if you are a RIC FAZERES fan!
2559	1	a	A Really Great Game, You should get this gmae if you are into slow-to-fast paced game, thinking what will happen beofre you should do it.
3482	1	a	A charming halloween themed adventure game. I originally heard about this game through Zac Gorman  (http://zacgorman.com/  /  http://magicalgametime.com/)  and how he has made it a tradition to play the game on halloween. I thought that was a neat idea as well and made it a part of my halloween celebrating. Cute little game, lots to do/collect, good Double Fine humor.
1593	1	a	I love this game so much. The artwork and gameplay throughout. I still haven't finished the game because the guards are binding my brain, but still. Singleplayer or Multiplayer. It's still a really great game. I like the soundtrack and theme of the levels. The characters are cool, too ;)  Great game. Get it now!
612	1	a	Fantastic board game. Translates well to PC play. Got the complete pack for $8 during the winter sale and it's well worth the price.
1079	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3761	1	a	Tons of fun. A good game to spend a Saturday (in October) playing. Not too involved, but engaging and funny.
374	1	a	Pretty cool...for like an hour, then get's pretty boring.
1726	1	a	Interesting game where you can choose between different characters with interesting abilities i give it 9/10 stars
2977	1	a	It's a top-down, stealth, arcade Payday! Play with friends for maximum enjoyment; Have funzies~
2168	1	a	A brilliant game.  Hard to do be yourself, hillarious with others.  You will find yourself in a level with 3 other people, being stealthy, robbing people blind without them knowing. Then suddenly... An alarm More alarms sound of gunfire and then your teammate runs through the door, spraying the area behind them with bullets and continues running, followed closely by a pack of dogs, some guards, some agents and some guy wielding an RPG  *Cannonfodder1995 has been shot by a gaurd*     10/10 would hide in the bush again
3153	1	a	One of the hardest puzzle games I ever played. 150+ levels of rage and frustration.
3790	1	a	This game is adorable, and if you've got kids, they'd probably love it. The combat isn't very difficult, and the stat building isn't too very important, but significant enough to give you a boost if you pay attention to it. It's a great intro to turn-based combat, and fun enough to hold your interest, even if you're a seasoned vet.
2872	1	a	it is a Tanelnted game that i would recommend, witch means try not to get cought by cops or anything related, or pve and try not to die
4829	1	a	Fun and unique puzzle game that falls a bit short. While this game may look like something that will make you think outside the box, it's actually the opposite. The game is quite linear for the most part, with not much flexibility given to the player. Most levels are designed to be solved in a specific way, but that is not to say that it isn't challenging. I think it's moderately difficult for the average player and achivements are well within reach if you try.  My score: 7.5/10
1758	1	a	
729	1	a	An excellent game, great translation on the PC.
4187	1	a	An RPG with a gem-matching game as combat. It works too! There's quite the range of RPG elements.You have quests, you level up and spend skill points, there is gear, crafting, companions, you can tame enemies and make them your mount or learn their abilities, you can capture cities and collect taxes from them, there are taverns where you pay to hear gossip, as you progress through the main story you unlock other areas of the map, etc. There's also some amazing music. The only downside is the endless wandering monsters, which you run into every few steps when you travel, and even though there's no question you will defeat them, you still need to play the gem-matching game. But this is an annoyance that many RPGs with turn-based combat have. If you like RPGs AND gem matching games (you've got to like both), and you don't mind old school 2D graphics, then this game will be worth it.
1127	0	a	There's really not much to say for Snuggle Truck... It's an okay mobile game but there are plenty of other games (both casual and hardcore) where your time would be better spent.
2596	1	a	its an awsome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it  
1214	1	a	If it was a grill i would â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game because its so gewd 10/10 
908	1	a	WOW. I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME. AND I PROBABLY NEVER WILL 
4482	0	a	Another Luxor game, If I'm correct this is the 5th installment in the series.   I won't explain what the game is about again but obviously 'Quest For The Afterlife' is pretty much exactly the same as it's predecessors. The main difference is the graphics are better and this time there's some kind of story but who cares about a story in a game like this?  The game is still fun and addicting but like I've already said it doesn't do much different from the other games in the series so I'd rather would've picked a 'neutral rating' but I simply do not recommend it for the price it's being sold for.
0	1	a	This game is a good old fashioned rail shooter that was decently executed. Its bright and colorful, and fast paced.  However this is ZERO support for this game, and if you use dual monitors the game will crash. You will have to disable a monitor to play.  I suggest a 360 gamepad to play.
3023	1	a	A game that requires true teamwork to get threw each individual heist.   8.8/10
3799	1	a	Best quality stuff from Double Fine, as usual... :-D
2331	1	a	I would definitely reccomend getting a group of friends together to play this game  PROS: +Decent visuals, easy to distinguish things on screen +Gameplay that never gets stale, plenty of different ways to take on each stage  8.5/10
481	1	a	Perfect adaptation of the board game! Looks and sounds nice, if you know the original (and like it) you won't be disappointed. You can play it offline if you want or with friends or strangers online. It's fun either way. There's even a pass n' play mode added in a recent update. I only wish there were more maps available (e.g. Nordic Countries).  Note: an option for limiting the time one can spend in a round would be useful, because quite often you are forced to wait long seconds for other players.
1851	1	a	it is AWESOME
1288	1	a	Whole point of game, kill penguins amen to me.
1944	1	a	Screw the mole so hard
5217	1	a	Satisfyingly difficult. The puzzles had me scratching my head quite often, but never to the point where it became too frustrating. The game manages to maintain a good balance in difficulty and introducing new ways to apply the few tools you get throughout the game. Kudos to Collin and Hessel, excellent job guys!
5469	1	a	I'm a sucker for new takes on arcade classics. Titan Attacks! is like Space Invaders, except it's pretty, has character upgrades, and features unique bosses. So it's Space Invaders, but better.
574	1	a	This is great as a casual game
2880	1	a	definitely worth getting on sale, great to play if you have a group of four, but pretty bland to run it solo imo
101	1	a	A charming point and click puzzle game that's just under an hour. Only one of its puzzles is BS hard. Otherwise a cute and easy play.
68	1	a	The main complaints seem to be about the shortness of the game verses the price. While I do agree that the price is a bit high for a very short game, I do recommend this game. There was only one really unintuitive puzzle (the cupboard under the sink. I DON'T GET IT!!) but the rest was a nice experience. There is not a lot of replayability so it's definitely better for younger kids who may get a bit more play time out of it. Though repetitive, the music is soft and unobtrusive and can easily be turned off if it starts bugging you. I understand the creators put a lot of heart and effort into this so I understand the price even if I disagree with it. If you can catch it on sale, get it for your kid.
94	1	a	Extrmely!!!!!!! short. But the puzzles are way worth it. If you can solve them with the little hints they give you, then you are a genius. Overal 7/10. Gameplay, 2 hours.
2041	1	a	monico is a stealin game its fun i tried to sneak around my partment and steal the gemsss but i gotcaught and had to pay the price  no more monico for a whole week oh no!
2528	1	a	Fun, interesting, unique, and made complicated at times by its simplicity.
1527	1	a	Extremely fun game especially with friends and with random people it is still really fun
1073	1	a	I like it :) It's fun, has its own 'persona'. I like snuggling.  If you're hesitating, wait for a discount. It's true that 5â¬ is a bit too much for that casual game. Watchout it seems that there is no steam-cloud saving in that game or i did something wrong. Whatever I lost my saves.  Runs smooth on linux and xbox 360 usb controller. No issue at all.
2908	1	a	Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic. The multiplayer is where it especially excels. The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level. All of this with an excellent musical backing. Watch some co-op here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oTlS5wQG0cuqhlYsE7mY0z 
1221	1	a	high intensity combat perfect for competitive play
974	0	a	The story is intreaging and all, but the screen is small and I can hardly decipher anything from my usual distance from the screen. Like another HO game I have to stick my face to the screen to be able to see clearly. It's very tiring. I got irritated many times playing it. I wouldn't really recommend it.
2193	1	a	VERY fun game whilst playing with friends, co-op is hilariously fun and challenging as well!
829	1	a	Just like the board game Pros:  - faster setup - faster turns (no waiting for that one person that must visit the facilities the moment before their turn begins) - faster restart after awful start - faster cleanup after the game done  Cons: - No opportunity to gloat if playing against AI - No table-flipping option when your opponent steals your section of track right at the end of the game  Summary: Like Ticket to Ride? Buy this game.
3377	1	a	I've been enjoying Costume Quest! It's cool, and puts me in the Halloween Holiday Spirit that is fast approaching. &amp; I can't wait to play Costume Quest 2! :)  This game is an Epic Deal on Sale and even worth if when it's not on sale!!
1803	1	a	Reminds me of like if Hotline Miami and Mark of the Ninja had a kid.
4556	1	a	pretty fun for the price
929	1	a	saw this pop up while searching and watched the little trailer..very interesting. so, i went online and got the demo. got to level 5 and made myself stop..happy to now have bought full game. story is good and easy to follow, graphics are cute and its a good take on matching games that always get spat out of everywhere now. sick of these re-hahses of bejeweled and angry birds and mario but its used here with a storyline and adventure,making a enjoyable,unique game. can just relax and play, with enemies to fight and progress made. also has some challenge and strategy to ensure success and move on, even has upgrade system. nice mix, good casual game, needs more recognition. if youre unsure, just go get the demo. youll enjoy it :)
4947	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
2884	1	a	Lot's of fun, but don't play alone - it's rather difficult for one player.
4491	1	a	Pretty game, but short and easy. (My total hours are inflated because I kept forgetting to exit the game and left it running while not playing it.) Good choice if you like hidden object games, but only recommended if on sale and bought in a bundle with the other Samantha Swift game. Rating: 3/5
3583	1	a	A fun and cute turn based adventure with a lot to offer for the $10 price tag! Whether you're an avid rpg player or simply someone who wants to try it out, this game is a great one to own!
766	1	a	This is the computer version of the classic board game Ticket to Ride. Ticket to Ride is known in the board game community as a classic. This version is just as good as the board game, and it has online! I recommend for anyone who enjoys a relaxing board game. Matches can get particularly competitve at times!
4288	0	a	TL:DR this game was made 12 year old who got a hold of the graphic's departments asset collection from 2002.  This game has too many faults to list. I've 100%'d this, so I'd say I've seen everything in it.  and there are no redeeming points.  It's just the kind of game where there is something bad about  everything . I could nitpick for literal HOURS on this.    Graphical style  ignoring the fact that it only ran at a stupidly low resolution for me, I mostly mean art style. It's...bad. it's GCSE 'I got hold of clipart on the school computer' bad. everything is WAY CARTOONY(!) or semi realistic, have bright pastel colours or earthy tones.    Gameplay  aside from making me a bit sick playing, this is just wrong. you drive slightly like a car, slightly like a tank. holding mouse 1 will make you go away from the camera..but you can just no use the mouse buttons and hold WASD. when you bump into something, one of about 4 things could happen. you stop, you do a 180 and walk forward, losing all of your momentum.  speed is totally random. on some levels, you get to 100 times your original size, and roll on like a bulldozer, stopping for nothing!...then other levels, you get 5 times bigger and you're crawling. there's no momentum, there's no fun what so ever in just playing the game. unless you're into masochism. then it's fun.   Balance  Ok, so you're playing. you've gotten pretty big, you're the size of a house after starting at 2 inches. run over that car. that's 1 poi- sorry 1 Billion points, I forgot. alright, ok. oh you ran over a 1 inch tall toy? that's also one point. that tree? 1 point. The whole point of this kind of game is buildup and then catharsis of 'haha now i'm huge, i'm gunna go eat a mountain', not 'hold on, this 50ft giant made of crap needs to carefully walk over woodwork tools for some points'. There is no variety, exploration, or difference in playthrough. you want to get A+? you pretty much have to take one route through the level, with maybe 1 or 2 deviations. you can't play how you want if you want that shiny 100%. you do whichever route is fastest by trial and error, a small mistake means you may as well drop that round. you move so slowly that the slightest off-course or inefficient route means losing a chunk of time.   The fact this game was made by a child with no attention span  It's...there's so many small things. things move randomly, stuff isn't animated properly, some stuff can be picked up sometimes when you're a size, some things can't, bumping into a snake's tail (whose hitbox extends about a foot from the snakes actual tail) flings you across the room, sometimes you climb things, sometimes you don't. there are 'scenes' setup that sound like a child made them either by imagining something (a gorilla standing on the other side of a tennis net to a person standing next to a racket LOL THEY'RE PLAYING TENNIS!) or just getting bored in the editor (here's a trail of tennis balls slowly getting bigger with a person standing on the last one). none of the levels have any kind of actual sense to them. the cafe has a full size tree in the middle, a line of paintbrushes on the floor.  Why are points measured in billion? pick up a dice? OH â¥â¥â¥â¥ THAT'S LIKE 1 BILLION POINTS! if they had made it increment; the larger you have to be in the stage to win, the more points, that could work. but nope.     little things. finally, on the level unlock screen. ok, so you can unlock a suburb level (level c we'll call it). to get this you have to 'beat either the garden (level a) or the sugar place (level b)'. to unlock level b? you have to beat a. do you see the problem? what's the point in saying 'do a or b, but b is a prerequisite to a so it doesn't matter'? it sounds small, but if anyone, LITERALLY ANYONE capable of thinking had played this before release, they would have burned the building containing the source code before it got loose.    I could nitpick down to the fact the main theme song doesn't actually work in context of the game, and how it being 'refreshing' MAKES NO DAMN SENSE, and how I genuinely felt like vomitting after playing, but I don't need to.  if you have this through a bundle, and are an acheivement freak then yeah, you can 100% this in a day, play it and bury it. if you don't own this game, stay that way.  I own another game by the devs. 1,2,3 kick it. this is a game released a while back, that was apparently so broken they're going to start over from scratch and remake it. hell, valve let them go on as an early access game! they must be committed!...they've made no progress on 1,2,3 for many months.  supposedly, these guys have been 'making games for 75 years'. aside from that being a dubious claim (really? so back in 1940 you guys were busting out hits? in a time when computers were pretty much just mechanical? even though you even state on the site your studio was founded in 1999?), they just honestly seem like the most scummy crew around. don't buy this.  actually scratch that. buy this for an enemy. who loves 100%ing games. either he plays it for the 100%, a fate I wouldn't wish on anyone, or he won't, leaving his steam account with a less than perfect game average. win-win.   while i'm here, steamstore page debunk time!  'The Wonderful End of the World takes you through 12 unique locations, with over a thousand treasures to gather before the end comes. Steal some sweets from the candy store, where gummi fish swim in a blueberry river; visit a surrealist library to find that the words have literally leapt out of their books; and explore the Megalopolis, where you'll watch a lively end-of-the-world parade and then gobble it up before making your way to grab the tallest skyscraper ever built.'  unique? so about 4 of them are just neighbourhoods/cities, the rest are just boring. the candy store? in level, it's not shown to be any kind of candy store, more a diarama with dolls staring down at you. gummi fish in the river? there are no fish in any river on that. the library is a room with 3 bookshelves, with a single line of some 'words that have literally leapt out of their books'. end of the world parade? there's 2 billboards saying 'end of the world' while a monkey and some people stand on a roof. you can't even grab all of the skyscraper, by the time you'd be big enough the score limit is reached and the level ends. and according to scale, none of the buildings are 'the tallest skyscraper ever built' by an measure from the last 50 years. just more hyperbole and bs that was written by the dev team's children.
4973	1	a	It's like Portal...but not
4587	1	a	Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by. They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun 'Super Hexagon' way. Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah. The worst kind of time sink...  Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial. It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way. Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists. There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.  Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good. It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick. It does a phenomenal job of it too. All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off. The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be. One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking 'War Rocket Ajax'.. *cough*.. I mean 'Invincible' :) .. about 40 years too early, :)  Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final 'death scene', each level begins and ends with a 'Galaxy News' transmission. . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced. Right up to the end, the game feels 'fleshed out', there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.  The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes. As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial. The 'orbital slots' are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time. Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.   There are only 22 'single player' levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something. The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of. Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you. I never found much use for the 'sweeper' or the 'webber', they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it. Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better! I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.  One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites. Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves. Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up. So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too. The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies. It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much. I quite like it. It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).   Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games. It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.   I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.
4790	1	a	A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.   Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.   The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.   Good stuff.
1188	0	a	This game sucks so bad, that makes Bad Rats look like Titanfall (but no seriously, Bad Rats was really fun, that i made 3 hours from the first launch, even i unlocked an achievement).  I am sorry for the people who bought it for full price. Atleast i spend 20 cents for this.
897	1	a	what have i done
1895	1	a	'never rob stuff without another' - Mrag
1062	1	a	The level editor adds a lot to this already cool little game.
3101	1	a	Great stealth game, especially with friends. I had so much fun playing it online ! You can unlock some interesting characters and play quite a long campaign on your own or online (neat idea). I loved the style of the graphics and the dialogues. Some levels are quite challenging but, oddly, i had the time of my life dying again and again after being chased, laughing at my screen like an idiot while my friend was trying to save me. That was a great experience, too bad not a lot of people play it now but i can only recommend it for all the great laughs I had !
1054	1	a	I dont know how it got this game...  I.... well it have a car and animals...   10/10 5 year olds would play
2480	1	a	This is one of the best coop games I have ever had the fortune to play. It is right up there with Left 4 Dead, and Portal 2, I just cant recomend it enough.
1206	0	a	If I had two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game would suck both of them.
2143	1	a	This game is everything I want in co-op. I've been introducing it as Pac-man but stealing money. Its fast-paced and frantic, yet very forgiving in its stealth elements. The controls are simple but have a lot of room for subtlety. On top of this it has a polish you don't expect from indie games. The music is absolutely fantastic and it has Steam Workshop support now so custom maps galore.  A warning though, the game loses all its charm to me when played solo. Play with friends or not at all. (It works very well both local and netplay though.)
4760	1	a	It's an okay game, finished it in 7 hours. Some puzzles are devious, but most can be solved in less than a minute of thinking. A little dissappointing in some respects, many repeated areas (in between the puzzles).   Asthetically beautiful though, the shifts between dimensions change colours, monitor filters, even the portraits on the the walls. Hopefully the DLC will feature either some new dimensions or much harder puzzles.
658	1	a	A good port of the board game. Exactly the same as the mobile version. Acheivments dont work for me :(
3475	0	a	Ummm... The game could be alright if you enjoy nothing but quicktime events and colectable hunting. Personally, not worth the money.  Edit: It's an adventure game though. This is what adventure games usually are. I should have also added, the Linux experience is flawless so don't worry about that. Still not my cup of tea though.
4619	0	a	Windows XP/Vista only. Does not run under Windows 7/8 (see developer's sticky in the steam forum).
4966	1	a	This is the greatest, funnest portaleque game since Portal. I had a blast, right up until the endgame levels which â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off A LOT by requiring 50 to 100 tries before things worked out properly. I still recommend it, just not wholeheartedly. Fourfifthsheartedly.
4193	1	a	Bejeweled mixed with a RPG and surprisingly very addictive. Recommended.
3687	0	a	On MAC - The text is to fast to read. its like read a paragraph or 2 in 1 second. our whole house could not read it. theirs no option to slow down the text and sadly their are some parts of the game that you can wait to read the text and press next but then the rest of the game theirs no option and its not understandable. I got this game for a kid to help with his reading for halloween but I canât even read it to him. If this is fixed I will delete this as soon as I notice and write a good review.
3081	1	a	Fun and cheap, lots of game modes and local coop - what else could you ask for?
3767	1	a	Costume Quest is a cel shaded RPG with a sense of humour. The game is short and gameplay is fairly linear, though the game's style and dialogue are entertaining to keep you playing the game. The story, while seemingly childish, works well for a game where cardboard costumes morph into towering avatars during the turn-based battle scenes. The game takes a certain appreciation for silliness to fully enjoy, otherwise the lame jokes and outlandish characters might become grating. The battle sequences are repetitive and not particularly challenging, but the real fun is in exploring the world for costumes and hidden items. Definitely worth a playthrough.
168	1	a	3-D tetris anyone? A neat game, fun idea, but frustrating. It has several modes for all types of players, pretty colors, and some nice sound, but it is a typical puzzler at its core. Sale or bundle buy, casual gaming only. Again, the marathon players and achievement hunters will be especially frustrated by it.
5259	1	a	The frog is much cuter than most creatures in the game.
646	1	a	Plays well, and I like how it uses the ELO rating system (although I haven't played online yet). Only disappointment is the lack of some expansions/maps from the board game.
4873	1	a	Reallly Really NICE!!!! Cool ideas and nice alternative to Portal!!! If u like Portal get IT is WORTH it!
3724	1	a	A sweet and incredibly entertaining game; a bit on the short side, which I don't think is bad. The fights can be a bit annoying sometimes, but the experience is totally worth it.
1505	1	a	For its money its definately a must! this game suprised me positively, it has everything an indie should have including multiplayer!
4007	1	a	Pretty good game, well...according to the reviews. I never actually played this game. I forgot about it and just let it run for 100+ hours.
5387	1	a	Space Invaders is by far my favorite Atari game of all time. Titan Attacks makes a very nice twist on it while adding various upgrades to choose from to make your guns more powerful and what not. it's a great game to go to when you need an intermision break from the primary game that you may be playing at the time. I am definately getting my moneys worth out of it.
4283	1	a	It is a clone of Katamari Damacy. I love Katamari Damacy, so even a weaker clone is an enjoyable game.  The latest Katamari game is a F2P mobile idle game. Seriously. Your money is better spent here, where at least you get the gameplay you are looking for.
4397	1	a	I wonder what my 10 Bucks was used on.
1818	1	a	A definitely recommendable game, with a very good concept, art style and humor. However, playing with friends is almost a must, especially in the later levels, and constitutes most of the fun. This is sadly a little bit hampered by the awkward private game creation system (x on the level for list of games, from there create, from there set to private, then send invites...). Perhaps the option for friendly A.I.s and a more streamlined private game with friends system would be of help.
2313	1	a	It's a cool game that works perfectly both playing on your own and with some friends.  The single player experience is really fun and invites you to try to beat the levels with all the different characters - depending who you choose to play as the experience will change but at least on most of the levels it will always feel fair too.  Multiplayer, at least with a group of friends, is an even more fun, sometimes chaotic beast - not that this is a bad thing.  Great music, great visuals (although they might be a bit confusing at first) and artistic direction... A great game indeed
4958	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
4229	1	a	this was one of the first games i ever bought idk why
4697	1	a	It's an enjoyable and humorous experience all-in-all. The concept is good and the atmosphere rather charming. In terms of level design, it hinges more and more on pin-point jump timing rather than actual puzzles, which starts to detract from the experience as you near the end.  Overall a decent game with a good price/value-ratio.
471	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game with plenty of replayability. There's no one set strategy to playing, which makes online play fun and engaging. Most of the players online are speedy and will play through the entire game, even if they're losing.  The addition of achievements has added some of the fun into playing with bots back into the game, even for long time players like me.  Unfortunately, the lastest update has virtually broken the game. Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.  I can't, in good concious, reccomend this game until a massive patch is pushed through. Pick this game up, with a few map packs, while it's on sale, but have patience.
1300	1	a	This game needs servers and more players. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's fun.
4957	1	a	yo dawg, we heard you wanted to hear John De Lancie tell you bad puns.
2941	1	a	
152	1	a	Great title. Love it. Play it when I don't want to bother with more in-depth games.
2513	1	a	Cool Game!
2459	1	a	The game is good, mainly for multiplayer. The only real downside is that it doens't have Jean Claude Van Damme as an extra character grabbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and stuff.
1850	1	a	Over priced but if it's 2 Euros, why not buy it?
2344	1	a	it is like playing payday but in casual way..at least you still can steal stuff
4296	1	a	I must write a recommendation for this game. It is one of my favorite purchases on steam. Though it is just a 'katamari clone', the levels are unque and interesting, the sounds, music, and visuals are all great, and it is decently challenging.
5247	1	a	This is a really cool puzzle game. Not quite MetroidVania, but almost. I say 'almost' because from my time playing, it felt quite linear. You do pick up new abilities though. I like the 'no handholding' deal where you gotta figure cool stuff out for yourself. Great controller game for the couch.   If it is on sale and you like puzzle platformers - you will really enjoy this little gem.
4079	1	a	Essentially RPG title with lots of things going on, there's even ability to craft gear or you can besiege cities to get tithes from them. Enemies can be captured for mounts or to learn new abilities/spells from them that are not available to your selected class (a mount comes with an ability of its own, too). And of course besides the main quest to get rid of Big Evil you get plenty of side quests, helpful companions, and there's even some gossip in taverns to enrich the lore.  Except the core game mechanic of resolving any kind of challenge that pops up is... a puzzle game of the type 'match 3+ pieces in a line', possibly best known from Bejewelled.  During standard combat you go in turns with your enemy, gathering different pieces for mana and executing special moves if you have enough, or there's a type of piece to deal direct damage (skulls). Some challenges slightly differ, like training mounts has time limit for turns, capturing enemies is a static puzzle to clear up the whole board, and learning spells is about matching enough different pieces (sadly for the latter it's a failure when you're out of moves, so the hard spells are pretty much impossible to learn from captives or at least not really worth it).  This mashup works pretty well and is quite addictive, you always want to have just one more battle to advance the story and maybe okay just one more... and the time flies.  Game has some balancing issues though, designers maybe get a bit carried away and some choices of gear/mounts/spells are clearly superior than others, whereas some even work against you if you use them. But of course you don't have to play with a min-maxer attitude for one, and secondly it doesn't really impact the game just makes it bit less complex than you'd think if you decide to ignore most of the choices. But you still have to get to proper levels to use some, and figuring out the real deal is part of fun too :]
4890	1	a	Has some of the people behind Portal working on it; and it's similar except the puzzles are solved by manipulating the properties of objects and the rooms by switching between various dimensions. Pretty clever situations in some cases.
5021	0	a	Not nearly as fun and Puzzler World 1.  1. There is no fullscreen for higher resolutions/screens - only windowed. 2. Somehow the whole engine is sticker/slower - the engine just doesn't seem to work as well. 3. Puzzles seem simpler somehow. For instance the Word Search doesn't have as many words to find.   Sad, really. Seems they just don't care enough. Puzzler Word 1 is great. Simple but really good fun.
113	1	a	I am usually not too much of a puzzle games guy, except maybe Tetris. But this game has really pulled me back into the genre. This is a game that I just keep finding myself playing. It's great to pass a little time. Plus I always want to replay it to try and exceed my previous score. The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is nice. I got it for $0.49 during the Winter Sale. Worth way more than that. Bought two more copies as gifts. Give it a go. You won't be disappointed.
1861	1	a	This game has a Dark Souls difficulty...
2336	1	a	This game doesn't get me excited so much, the game mechanics are good, you can decide depending on the character you've selected how you want to play the game, action or stealth approach, but from this point of view the game doesn't excels in neither of those two types, the soundtrack is appropriate for the game and it is very good, as for the graphics, i find the environments well done but i dislike how they have made all the characters like caricatures, i would have liked more the pixels style, like Hotline Miami;  it's more like a personal review but i don't recommend to buy this game at full price.
2419	1	a	Really fun with friends, best spent 1 key in my life.
809	1	a	Game is extremely fun &amp; addictive.
508	0	a	Horrible AI. The computer players seem to care less about completing their routes and more about getting as many trains laid down as possible. Very frustrating when you're working on a couple overlapping transcontinental routes and the AI ends the game before you can complete them.
909	1	a	Fun game, a little too random for some maybe.
3744	1	a	This is a funny little RPG. There's not a lot of depth to any portion of it. The combat is very repetitive, there's not much for customization besides the costumes themselves. One thing this does have is charm. It's a fun game which has its moments and never drags on. Unfortunately it offers nothing more than a quick game. For a couple of dollars it may be worth the experience. If you don't think you'd enjoy it from any of the screenshots, you probably won't.  2.5/5 Completion Time: 5.5 Hours
1250	1	a	Just to let you know, this game was pretty simple, was pretty funny and was pretty popular. Was especially good when there were people online...
2498	1	a	Can I buy the soundtrack? The music is awesome!
3094	1	a	Great game, but it's a shame that none of the playable characters are named Lewinsky. What a missed opportunity for a tasteless pop-culture reference!
697	1	a	one of the most fun board games that has translated well to the digital screen, highly recommend
1788	1	a	What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine.
4950	1	a	This game is a barrel of fun. It really just hits on a whole lot of platforming challenges with inventive ideas. Completely awesome to play. The only real issue I had with the game was the wonky physics engine. There would be moments where your jumps would cause you to skate off a ledge you had just been on. It didn't make a lot of sense to have the gravity arcs of your character be so... off?
1018	1	a	Most addicting game even better than Dota 2 but you dont have to hate russians.
243	1	a	Love the Game loving the Soundtrack, definatly a good buy!
780	1	a	A lot of fun and a very faithful re-creation of the board game.
3393	1	a	Cute, fun, &amp; quick game with some pretty easy RPG elements to it. Good for kids or casual play or anyone that likes Halloween.
2072	1	a	I have only opened this game for the trading cards.
241	1	a	This game is awesome, and the creator has an awesome sense of humor. (Go to the FAQ and read the sayings after every game)  It's addicting!
4068	1	a	Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords is an addicting puzzle game with an added roleplaying element. The title was developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Namco Networks America. Anyone who has played Tetris, Bejewelled or any similiar game will be quite familiar with the puzzle portion of this fantastic title but for me, as a heavy R.P.G. fan, it was this part of the game that really makes it stand apart from the others in the genre.   As in the start of a typical roleplaying game you select your character and class before the terrific story sends you traveling across a vast fantasy world in search of quests, battles and loot. I found the story to be extremely compelling and at times humorous. It definitely keeps your attention and makes you want to wander about and converse with any person or beast that would cross your path. The combat, of course, takes place in puzzle format and tasks you with matching pairs of colored gems, skulls and other items while casting spells as well as a variety of other attacks and moves against your opponent. As you battle you earn experience points which you can spend upgrading your skills as well as accquiring gold and loot with which you can better outfit your character. You also have the option to capture opponents and hold them in your dungeon. You can then learn new spells and combat tactics from your prisoners as well as use the captured beasts as mounts as you traverse the world.   The game is presented very well with a combination of fantastic hand drawn manga-like art for the cut scenes as well as an old school top down 'Legend Of Zelda' like world map. Shockingly one of the best parts of the game in my opinion is the music. I can't stress how great the soundtrack is in this title as it expertly captures the fantasy theme of the game. I fell in love with it after just a few days of playing the title. The sound effects during the puzzle battles are terrific as well. You never get tired of hearing the explosions, coin drops and other tell-tale effects when you successfully connect a line of gems and cause a cascade that devastates your opponent bringing them to their knees in defeat...absolutely priceless. I never thought I would be a fan of puzzle games but the Puzzle Quest series has, no pun intended, cast a spell on me. Highly recommended! I think I like this one better than Puzzle Quest 2 which I adore.
832	1	a	  Like the board game, that is to say fun! You can also play online for a random challange or against that friend who lives far away.
5455	1	a	WTF are you reading this, buy the game already, you wont regret it.
19	1	a	Cute platformer with cute graphics. I don't really understand why they chose a teacup but that's not really important. It took me around 4 hours to get perfect in all the game modes and I had a lot of fun completing all of them. There's really nice and unique level design thoughout the game. For the price of ~4â¬ I will happily recommend this game.
1732	1	a	Surprinsingly funny and addictive with several players. The general design is really good, and the graphics fit perfectly with the game.
2706	1	a	I find this to be a great co-op game. My friends and I have a great time playing Monaco. I do think that if you don't have friends(that is a joke I just mean if you do single player or don't have relieable friends) then you may have a lesser experience but it can still be a fun and humorous game.
4497	0	a	Casual Play itself game. Not offensive but I can't recommend it unless you have loads fo time to kill (and don't want to think)
2731	1	a	I picked up the 4-pack bundle on a whim and shared it with 3 of my friends. Best decision ever. This game highly encourages you to play with 4 people; the jobs are always possible no matter which of the 8 classes you choose, but the difficulty amps up with fewer tools at your disposal. Since each class has its own specialization that only they can do, not having certain elements available makes missions significantly more daunting when alone. Also, the stealth in this game is quite fun, though perhaps more forgiving than hardcore lovers of stealth games might enjoy. Running around the corner and hiding in a potted plant is usually the best course of action for getting guards off your tail.  9/10, will no doubt be playing this well into the future.
825	0	a	Fun game... but the online version crashes continuously... the scoring is erratic... the destination cards are NOT randomly dealt - you'll see the same combinations of choices over and over again. KICKS YOU OFF the game constantly... just a really poor online game - like 1990s technology!! 
2919	1	a	Really nice game to play with your friends :)
4452	1	a	I was expecting this game to be yet another swap a jewel type but it is different with the whole make each corner have the same symbol. it makes a big difference to the game play and each level does get harder as you go through the game at a gradual pace.  
1308	1	a	i recommand my second game,penguins areana:sednas world.this game is so fun,it hurts.its like call of duty4 mdern warefare2 but even better.it just needs more um,mod stuff.my 1st game is ,the path,and they are both my only reviews so far.the graphics are regular,the game play ,,is like cod4mw2,the fun ...is realy fun ,and eazy to like.hackers can stay away,it needs more servers.i wish they had a turbo version like street fighter.the price and game dont mix,but it is worth evbery penny you want to spen on it.
1273	1	a	There's not much to say about this game. It's basically a more casual version of the 3D Worms games, only with penguins instead of worms, where the objective is to throw your opponents out of the stage by throwing snowballs at them. It allows up to four teams, and there's a few different power ups scattered through the maps.  It also offers different gamemodes; a team deathmatch mode, where the last team standing wins, a duel mode, where each team has a set number of 'lives' and a single member, an unlimited mode, and a custom map mode, which is just like team deathmatch.  As I mentioned above, it's similar to Worms, not only in the gameplay, but in artistic style as well. Unlike Worms however, this game doesn't feature terrain destruction or heavy weaponry, the most 'dangerous' weapons are a huge mine that simply pushes your opponents back, and a fish with a dynamite stick coming out of its mouth.  Still, it's somewhat fun to play, although a bit frustrating at times, since the terrain is very slippery.
1693	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is heck of a fun little game. It follows the story of four (and later more) bandits on their quest to flee the country. How? By doing what they do best, stealing and thievin'. It has very unique art style, in pixelatted goodness, and uses a top-down view, which allows you for better planning in the heists you will be making. The game has you select different characters to pull these off. Each character has its own assets and they are all very unique. You will need to use their different abilities to collect money and other collectibles and complete a variety of missions. You can play this game offline or with friends in a four player online co-op game, which is the has its assets and its disadvantages. Alone you only have the benefits of a single character skill, but you are less likely to be caught, so the way you play really suits your style. It has a great number of missions in the main campaign, to which is added another campaign of harder difficulty, PvP maps where you can duke it out against others online to see who can collect the most treasure or kill the opponent(s) first, to which are added other levels that explain the origins of the characters through score-attack like levels. The game can even be played in whole in 'Zombie mode', where the whole game has not only a zombie skin change, but the characters have different abilities too. And finally, the integration of custom maps made by the users only make Monaco a potential source of infinite fun. I highly recommend it.
5027	0	a	I got the game for 9 cents, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, but the puzzles never even get to the difficulty level you get in a Games Magazine or a Dell Logic Problem book, and yet are the same sort. Adding to this problem is the inexpert port from what what was clearly an iphone game, the viewing window is far to small, especially for Link-a-Pix, and it's annoying to have to point and drag, rather than more normal methods of, say, scrolling through a list, which is because it intends you to swipe.
3190	1	a	I bought this for $0.50 with a 90% off coupon I received for crafting a badge for Bit Trip Beat, because that's what the world is like now. The game is fine.
3065	1	a	give me money! Give me money! Give me Money!
2550	1	a	Excellent fun with friends
3408	1	a	A clear love letter to JRPG masterpieces of the past (console) generations, mixed with a pinch of Double Fine's weirdness and a great sense of humor. If games like Earthbound the Persona series are on your personal all-time favorite lists you'd be doing yourself a massive disservice in passing up this title.
1163	1	a	This game is pure magic from the moment you strap on your codpiece to the moment you blow up the moon 
3919	1	a	Costume Quest is a great little game with cute characters and quirky quests. If you're looking for something casual but still a lot of fun, I'd definitely recommend it.   Sometimes it crashes though so be sure to save often!
2987	1	a	Endearing and frantic, this is definitely worth your time, if maybe not the standard price.
1904	1	a	Great 'stealth' top-down game to play with friends... that have patience!
2622	1	a	Entertaining certainly, but only becomes fun when you start competing not for completion of levels, but rather points.
5288	1	a	Come to Steam, children! This is the feeling I get when I look at this game's graphics, all very cute and colorful. This is an OK casual game. It would be better if it wasn't for the rather slow pace.
3938	1	a	Cutsy game that is easy to play if you're not feeling well and want to feel better,
327	1	a	I bought this thinking it would just be a geometry wars clone with some dope music. Oh man, I could not have been further off. This game is crack. BUY IT NOW! Srsly, its only $10.
1684	1	a	What a fantastic little game. Playing by yourself is a ton of fun, as you take on one of many theif roles in daring top-down heist gameplay. Multiplayer is also a blast, but also a totally different game, as something inevitably goes wrong and you must make a panicked escape through the levels. Definitly worth the cash, with many hours of fun to be had both on your own and with friends.
4536	1	a	Easy, fun, casual. Great to have going in the background when you are doing something
4207	1	a	If you like the match 3 games, and you like RPGs, you cant go wrong with this
517	1	a	Tickt to Ride is a RISK Sim that plays as well and can grow to become just as intense. Get yourself a few friends and grab a boxset of this game and have a load of fun. Games last around 1hr per game and i wouldn't reccomend the add-on packs, they are pricey and unless you have a fetish for different names places it really won't change the game at all. save your pennys and wait for them to go on sale.   A fun game for 2-5 players. and a very easy to use and stylish interface. :)
2788	1	a	A great heist game in its own nature
3045	1	a	10/10
2842	1	a	Monaco has very simple mechanics: walk into things to use them, line of sight the gaurds/civs, and steal everything of value. The classes pretty much do the same thing as the next class can do but are specialized in some actions. Locksmith picks locks and safes fast, Pickpocket hides in bushes fast, etc etc. Some classes have special abilities as well, like Mole can dig into most walls, Redhead can charm enemies, etc etc.  Unlike most stealth games, Monaco doesn't end when you're seen. Your score isn't based on how stealthy you are, but how fast you cleared the level with coins missed adding time. It's a ton of fun when you're with 4 people, alarms are going off, and everybody is disorganized.  Despite the simple mechanics, it's a challenging game. Towards the end you're up against SWAT guys with shotguns who can pretty much 2-3 shot you from accross the room so STAY HIDDEN!  UPDATE DEC 21 '13: I should note that the game comes out with free updates. Last update came new game mechanics like pickpocketing keys off gaurds to unlock doors in the mission or 'buttcash' (people used to stand on top of coins, now they have wallets) which should have been in the game from the start but is in now. Last update also nerfed some of the difficulty in a lot of the missions in order to allow for all players to get through the game.
871	0	a	I gave it a a down because of their pay to play but their UI and everytjing else is great. It was a great demo for the board game ! first 2 missions are free so give it a try and if liked it go for the board game it comes out cheaper than purchasing in game coins.
5073	1	a	This is a great little game. I bought it quite by accident and found it irresistable. Once I completed 100% of the game I died a little inside.  So many unique, but challenging puzzles, everything from Hangman to colouring in puzzles, you will find something to entertain you.
5066	0	a	The first game, Puzzler World, was excellent, though too easy. PW2 is just a reskin, with added annoyances, for instance making selectables floating around instead of standing still, etc. And some differences in some games doesn't make sense and isn't covered in the instructions, so you have to either experiment to make out the rules, or just blindly guess.  Other annoyances really confused me a bit, until I figured out what the heck was going on, mainly link-a-pix: it may appear to not having all the pairs - this is because it doesn't show the whole playfield, it's zoomed in on just a part of it.  They tried to make it different, but took away the fun in the process. I have rarely been so disappointed with any game before.  Avoid PW2 like the plague, go play the first game instead.
1577	1	a	This is Payday in 2D without the character customization.  -Easy to learn but hard to master -Fun
1478	1	a	This is a well built stealth game, a game genre we are lacking in quality. You have your choice of several characters, each with unique abilities and unique styles to play through the maps.  What this game offers is more variability of gameplay. If you're spotted or set off an alarm, you have options. You can try gunning down the enemies, running around corners, sneaking behind a nearby bush or running for a vent. It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.  The difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?  The in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.  The bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.  I highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.

3874	1	a	Great game!
4842	1	a	Another clever and adorable little game ruined by inexplicable motion sickness. Damn my actual eyes!
1544	1	a	Step 1: Acquire friends. Step 2: Play Monaco.
3253	1	a	that game is awesome but hard.
1228	1	a	 This is not a review, it is a philosophical question about current state of this game.    Why in the name of the Lord, no one plays this game!?   I had som much fun in single player, against PC, and i can vividly imagine how my hormones of happiness would increase even more with knowledge that my snowballs hitting real players to their beaks. I know, i know, it was released in 2008, but come on, game like this should survive five, ten, twenty years or even mankind as we know it.  I was a little bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, when i found out about achievements, that you have to update into them; Dut DAMN! this is so much fun.
480	0	a	This pains me to have to not recommend this game. It used to be awesome. I played it for many hundreds of hours on ipad before getting it here. I played this game once here before the updates, and it was great other than not being able to use my ipad account to play here. It's understandable though, so not a huge deal. Just really didn't like having to start over in karma.  I can't even get into a game to play anymore because nobody wants to play with low karma players. I know how to play, I just don't look like it before I even start to play. This is only an issue NOW because before it didn't matter what your karma was, they couldn't kick you out for it. I get why people would want that feature added, so it's great for those who don't have to start from the beginning.  I tried starting my own game. The new game making system was just tacked in there, and there are loads of new options which aren't very clearly explained. The UI is horribly messy. On the old system, you could make a game for 5 people and start it before you get that many people with the push of a button if you changed your mind or didn't want to wait for that many people. You can't do that anymore. You just have to wait for the board to fill up with the specific amount, or go back and change the settings and then wait for people to show up again as doing that removes the game you had already created.  I never got the chance to experience what the online game itself was like after the update though as the game forever said it was waiting for new players. There was no button to start the game. I was just left waiting for something to happen. 10 minutes waiting for something to happen when you have your game seats filled is rediculous. I couldn't even tell them what was going on as the chat wasn't working. It's very broken. I don't know if this is just the mac version of the game that experiences these play glitches, but it wasn't very enjoyable.  So, here's to hoping they fix this once brilliant game. There was no need to retrofit new gameplay options in. If it aint broke, don't fix it.
1811	1	a	This game is awesome !!! It has nice graphics, low requirements and it looks cool. It is totally worth buying.
4679	1	a	It took me almost a year to finish Quantum Conundrum. I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped. I guess it didn't pull me in like Portal once did. That doesn't make it a bad game, not at all. It just lacks that certain charm. The puzzles, however, are pretty cool.   So, I decided to continue the game just recently and I have to say the game actually gets a lot better near the end, when you have access to all 4 dimensions (fluffy, weight, anti-gravity and slow). Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling. And while the game lasts only about 6-7 hours, it's long and challenging enough to keep your attention (for most of us anyway ;)).  Now that QC2 has appeared in the Steam registry I'm actually really excited again (edit: I guess this will never happen since the studio closed) !  I â¥ first person puzzle games.  [Rating: 86/100]

2488	1	a	A humorous top-down 8-bit esque game involving hours of entertainment. The accents that the civilians and guards have is highly amusing and the gameplay is at first glance simple but becomes increasingly complex as each character plays in different ways and the complexity only goes up as you play with more people in different combinations trying to get the highest score. The gameplay can switch back and forth between frantic flight from the police to stealthy guard knockouts within less than a minute and at no point in the game will you not feel challenged. A good game for yourself, a great game for friends.
4904	1	a	It took me far too long to play this game through. I pre-ordered it way back when and, like many other games in my Library, inexplicably stopped after playing a good chunk. Only in the last few days of 2014 did I finally get back to it and complete the last 2/3rds, and I'm sad it took me so long to finish this wonderful game.  Shortly after your mother drops you off to visit your uncle (Professor Quadrangle, voiced by John de Lancie who narrates the game in a GLaDOS-like manner), you find that an incident has placed him in some sort of strange pocket dimension and cut off power to his mansion. Using one of his latest inventions, the Inter-Dimensional Shift device (IDS), you push through puzzles to power the place back up utilizing four different dimensions in which the properties of time, matter, and gravity are changed. These dimensions are unlocked as you progress, and can only be utilized when the corresponding battery is in the room. The batteries won't always be plugged in either, meaning sometimes you'll have to retrieve them from another part of the room before you can go forward.  I'm not a huge puzzle master, and I'm pretty sure more than once I 'solved' a puzzle in a way that wasn't meant to happen, but I never found myself hopelessly stuck; it was always just a matter of trying a couple different things until something worked, or knowing what I had to do but having to get it right. The puzzle difficulty felt perfect, hard enough that it felt good to solve and wasn't a boring pushover, but not too hard where I could spend half an hour desperately trying to figure things out. Every time a dimension is added to your roster there's a puzzle or two to help you get the hang of what it does and how it works. I suppose if you're a puzzle master, however, it might seem like child's play.  Through the narration of John de Lancie and a beautiful soundtrack there's never a dull moment...not that things can get very dull when you're flying through the air on a coffee table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had already purchased the soundtrack...and all the DLC! I don't remember doing that, hm.  I'm a little upset at how many negative reviews are on the front page, but I suppose you can't please everyone. The ending WAS lackluster, though maybe it's resolved in some way in the DLC. Many people seem to hate the narration and the physics engine too, but I didn't have a problem with either. In fact I very much enjoyed the constant voice acting, and didn't find it annoying in the slightest. I guess I just really like John de Lancie's voice.  Overall I must recommend it. It's cute, it's fun, it's silly.
4128	0	a	It's bejewled with a fantasy plot of sorts. If you enjoy that kind of puzzle game, then go for it. I ended up losing my taste for it after so many hours though and never ended up finishing it.
2	1	a	Decent-ish. Difficult to recommend one way or the other. Poor resolution and gamepad support, but the basic gameplay is some fun starfox-like business. It's quite pretty, although the gameplay is not quite as nuanced as its contemporaries (sin and punishment 2?).  Still, compared to Yar's Revenge, Aces of the Galaxy is good, and might be the best on-rails shmups on Steam, if that's your fancy.
5045	1	a	I like previous Puzzler World more than this one. Game interface feels like it's lazy port from tablet version. But Colour-in game is nice and I got the game for cheap so I don't complain much. It is on sale very often too.   For Achievement hunter:  100% - You play each type of puzzle 10 times. Getting All Achievement from Bonus Puzzle games can be a bit annoying because one main puzzle will lead to one of the two bonus puzzles. For example, after you finished Sudoku puzzle, it's bonus game will be either Sum-up or Add-up bonus game. You can check the guide so you won't waste too much time completing main puzzle. 
1738	1	a	It was great fun playing with friends. I recommend you buy the 4 pack! It's especially fun when someone messes up, everyone starts to panic!
1485	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of 'Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!' way. Monaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it. The way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket. The difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together. Replay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, 'Fin'. I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up. The story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with 'Identity'. The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of 'how we got here' thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised. If I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though. All in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries. Singleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging. Multiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had. Art: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous. Sound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french. Difficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time. Replay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.
2036	1	a	What's yours is mine. My virginity is no ones.
3424	1	a	This is one of the few games I've played through multiple times and enjoyed the ride each trip.  It's a short, turn based RPG with quirky characters, Psychonaut-esque graphics (yay, Double Fine!), and a fairly entertaining story.  The combat system isn't all that exciting and if you're a person that doesn't like to switch between costumes/character builds, odds are it'll grow tiresome quickly.  Still though - if you like Double Fine, weird characters, good humor, and decent gameplay, you can't go wrong.
2190	1	a	Tons of fun with friends!
518	1	a	My group of friends is very into board games, however we live hundreds of miles away from each other. Therefore, Ticket to Ride seemed like a good idea (and it was). I will say that interface-wise, what you see is what you get: it is a true-as-can-be replication of the board game with a little bit of sound. After some initial futzing around, the game client is relatively easy to operate. Joining games can be a little odd, and because the game was designed for mobile devices, clicking can be a bit off at times (CTRL acts as a drag or double click or something). Given these minor bugs, being able to play a board game with friends faraway is a win in my book, even if the controls lag out once in a while. At the end of the day, the game is solid and does what it should. Plus, it has a wistful harmonica melody that will haunt your dreams while adding atmosphere to your game about railroads!  PROS: stays true to it's physical counterpart, online play, no sorting of little plastic trains! CONS: wonky controls, more misclicks than I would like
827	0	a	This is a very faithful recreation of the Boardgame. I would, however much rather play the boardgame or at least the tablet version with pass and play. It turns out that TTR isn't really all that captivating without other people around.
5174	1	a	Do you like to dig?  Oh of course you do, you are a dwarf! This game brings the dwarf life.... well, to life! Mine, build, survive, and thrive. Fun to play and find all sorts of hidden treasures far underground in your mines.  If you like a simple dwarf colony game with mining, building, gathering, farming, and much much more. Check this one out as you won't be disappointed.
1116	0	a	'It's like Trials with animals' -IGN    Neh, 1/10
5423	1	a	simple, fun, not easy, but not impossible!! how fast are your fingers? this takes space invaders to a whole new level....im glad this is in my library!
4298	1	a	It's a clone of Katamari, but it's charming, easy to play, perfect for casual pick-up-and-play gaming, and contains references to Discworld and Blues Brothers. Hard to dislike.
1713	1	a	As many people have said, if you look at the disrecommendations, this game is very easy and boring. However, what those people fail to realize is that, they didn't try hard enough. This game is so boring and simple if you just run through, grab the objectives, and dodge bullets. Now, on the other hand, if you actually go for the achievements, try sneaking through undetected, getting every coin, and not dying, it quickly becomes very difficult and fun. Several people have stated it lacks challenge and strategizing, but that's probably because they played the first levels designed for newcomers, and didn't even try to do good. My friend and I played through the entire game, getting every trophy and achievement, including a hidden one, and it was not easy at several points. For example, in one level, guards spawn every 20 seconds, and form giant conga lines of destruction. Now try sneaking past their unpredictable routes into a guarded room, knocking out the guards without getting seen, so that you can hack a computer and hope that everything works out to let you get through the other 2 rooms, past some lasers, and giving you enough time to grab the cash and get out. My friend and I got rather good at the game and it took us about 30 tries to get lucky on that level. This game has tons of gameplay, and even more replayability with the many character combinations and strategies you can use on each level. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
3163	0	a	I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. The physics are B-A-D. You do the same action over and over again and the result is different every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing single time, until the game itself decides that you can finally proceed after all this torture. It's buggy at some stages and that 'it's all about the timing' thing, is so frustrating, because you can totally miss the target for miliseconds of delay. Don't get me wrong though, it's a fun game to play and very challeging.  5.5/10
589	1	a	This is a faithful, well-programmed, easy to play version of the amazing board game. You can play with multiple people on the computer, AI opponents, and even human players over the internet.   This version has a TON of maps to play as well. US, US Big Cities, US 1919 (or something like that), Europe, Legendary Asia, Swiss, and I think one other.The only one that I've noticed isn't there is the German one with the travelers. Otherwise, this board game is the whole package.  If you're a fan of this board game, or even board games in general, pick it up. I'm more than happy with my purchase.
5400	1	a	Simple fun... I did not expect much but at 50+ hours of gameplay it was worth the money (try to catch on sale).
5213	1	a	A fantastic, lighthearted, open-world (ala Metroid) puzzle adventure game. No hand-holding; rather than granting you new abilities, you start with everything you need to solve every puzzle from the beginning, learning new ways of interacting with what's around you as you go. A game that's hard not to love; highly recommended.
609	1	a	Love this game, but I can't log into the online features! Please fix this!
2115	1	a	Really nice game to play with your friends :)
2499	1	a	This game is amazing. I love it so much. It makes you feel like you are really a criminal. I loved going through the storyline running for my life as hundreds of cops chase me and I am scared so bad.
3037	1	a	this is addicting game!
1952	1	a	Monaco is a great stealth action-packed game. You take the role of 8 different thieves with very different gameplay through two campaigns and great number of challenges. The gameplay is solid. While you can pretty much force your way through the first levels, you really must avoid getting caught later on. The difficulty of the second campaign is quite hard, with a lot of achivements to go for. While the game is great in solo, it really shines in coop multiplayer, where each player control a different thief. There's also versus multiplayer, which is great fun too.   Monaco also has a very fitting soundtrack and a very interesting storyline, mostly because of the way it is told. For those interested, there's also a great deal of community maps made with the very complete level editor in the game. The game recently recieved an update consisting of a reworked campaign and a zombie mode with new enemies.   If you like stealth games, monaco really is a blast. I especially recommend it if you can find friends to play with.
824	1	a	I've played way too much of this 10/10
2481	1	a	This is a very fun game. Very much like an 8-bit Pay-Day. It's a fun heist game and playing online, you never know, who you're going to meet and be friends with forever.
2467	1	a	It's a great game especially for the price Friends I have two copies if you want. Only downside is you have to play with other people. You're supposed to have 4 but 3 would do.
5128	0	a	I can NOT recommend getting this game, I got it for free and have been playing it quite a bit just because its somewhat similar to Dungeon Keeper, then i played it because I wanted to be finished with it, and just now I ragequitted because a dwarf starved to death and the first audio queue I got about it was when he died.  Its ugly as hell. It lacks challenge. Its extremely time-consuming.  I still wanna finish it because its made by Swedish devs, but I cant recommend it to anyone.  If youre German you might enjoy it, but id rather point you in the direction of Dungeon Keeper.
4696	1	a	It's kinda like portal, except without portals, and longer.
5427	1	a	A reboot of the old arcade style games. Titan Attacks really delivers on it's simple form of fun with great music and visuals.
3083	1	a	Freaking awesome game. Simple but very fun, do-able as a 2 person game so great for couples, also works with the full party but co-operation is required.
3501	1	a	I love this game! Its cute, Its funny, and just plan FUN! Not to hard for kids and just fun and funny for adults!  I recommend this game WHOLE HEARTEDLY!
3959	0	a	Fun at first but then becomes very repetitive. The game isn't all bad it deffinitly gets points for style and writing. If there was a little more depth and less repetitive this could be a better game. Stopped playing when I realized I was doing the same thing over and over.
4507	1	a	I always wondered what it would be like to grow pot. Thanks to Plant Tycoon, I was able to realize the financial possibilities and explore myself during a time of identity crisis. Thank you, Plant Tycoon. I would definitely recommend this simulator to anybody considering producing illicit products as a living.
969	0	a	The game is too short and the story is totally dull. The hidden object scenes are ok, but the rest of the game is fogettable. Don't bother with this one, you can play The Clockwork Man: The Hidden World though - it's much much better.
5398	1	a	Buy? Yes. A short and too the point arcade action title inspired by Space Invaders and Heavy Weapon. Lovable art style and rewarding gameplay. Nice little title to finish in a few hours.
64	1	a	Lume is a little game, packed with several puzzles that you must solve. It took some time to get them all solved and some of them are quite tricky (especially the second locker). What I found the most interesting is the design: Lume is an indie game to behold, made for those who cares about aesthetics more than anything else. After installing and entering the game, my first reaction was 'you must be kidding me', because everything is filmed, all the scenario is handmade and the soundtrack is immersive...  It's a short game and, definitely, a beautiful revival of the adventure/point-and-click genre. I spent just Â¥299, after looking for some indie games with the same vibe of those made by Amanita Design (Machinarium, Botanicula, Samorost 2). If you like Indie Games, Puzzle, Adventure/Point-and-click and, most of all, you enjoy the art and music, Lume is a nice one. Already getting ready for Lumino City.
882	0	a	Don't play this game. The dice always are in favor of the AI if you play solo You will lose without any reasonable chance.
1565	1	a	This game is great if you want to do something with your friends. It has amzaing gameplay that is well balanced, and lots of fun missions that gives plenty hours of fun.
4402	1	a	It's a great short trip, when you need a Katamari kick. Give it a try, but keep your expectations low as the worlds are not huge, but they're still a blast to play though.
3364	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those games that you get from a bundle and it just sits in your library for months on end. That happened to me and then I thought that I should probably play the game. So I did and I found it to be an immersive RPG that should not be over looked. The whole concept of this game is great its something original combining turn based strategy with humour and Halloween. It is something that is definitely worth playing.
3302	1	a	When monsters invade to disrupt the sacred trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween, kidnap your twin, and attempt to steal all the candy that is yours by right, there's nothing to do but turn your costume up to eleven and kick them back into the netherworld from whence they came. Thus is the setup to Costume Quest, a hilarious and creative RPG-lite from Double Fine that is as sweet as the candy you so eagerly collect, despite its gameplay being highly simplified.  You spend most of your time exploring the world, collecting costume pieces, and of course knocking on houses with the hope that a bundle of candy will be waiting for you on the other side. There are also a handful of side-quests to complete, most in the form of hide-and-seek games or typical fetching errands. Though in most games I find quests such as these mundane and uninteresting, here they are full of so much humor and charm that it was hard for me to keep from smiling the whole way through.  But supposing someone not so nice and full of candy answers the door, then it's time to for some Persona like turn-based combat to occur. This is where gameplay hits a snag, as while fully functional the battle mechanics are extremely basic, revolving almost entirely around quicktime events with little to no variation or strategy to speak of. They are also terribly easy (I failed all but once, and on the final boss no less) which made the few options you are given for altering your character's attacks even less noticeable and necessary. That's not to say battles are completely devoid of fun, as I did enjoy them to an extent, but after only a few hours the repetition becomes grating so much as to have me actively try and avoid encounters (as if the Ninja costume wasn't already awesome enough). Thankfully with the story clocking in at 6-7 hours, it never got so bad as to greatly degrade the experience, and so long as you keep play sessions to short bursts are little more than a minor annoyance.  The big head celshaded look works surprisingly well with the theme of the game, making transitions between the lighthearted character models to the much more intricate (and in some cases suitably creepy) characters used for battles seamless, on top of simply being cute. The fixed camera is at times a hassle, but for the most part works well for the style of gameplay and stays out of your mind where it belongs. I do have one odd complaint about the presentation, which is the lack of any music or sound effects for most cutscenes. Even a simple text scrolling sound would have helped, as the way it is now made them feel awkward and drawn out, not to mention greatly reduced the impact of significant plot points.  Regardless of any problems I mentioned, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Costume Quest to anyone who has enjoyed a Double Fine game in the past. The writing is comedy gold, the characters lively and likeable, and its concept is completely unique. If you are looking for a complex and involving RPG then you won't find it here, but if you can look past the simple mechanics for the heartfelt adventure underneath it is greatly entertaining and worth playing.
2811	1	a	I'm playing crokinole with the princess of Monaco!
3818	1	a	RPG elements rolled into a fun little package. Very happy with my purchase
3412	1	a	So, I'd like to say I've been putting off buying this game for ages. Literally, ages. What happened was with the recent summer sale in June, I bought the bundle of both games for 6$. Heres what I have to say,  ++ GREAT humor and storyline, ('Gus from section 5, your wife is worried SICK.' and the kid in a banana suit who said, 'This is a total banana-fest'. LOL. ++ really lovely backgrounds,  ++also you get to choose if you wanna be a girl or boy, which was not what I was expecting when I saw 'your sister does this' and etc.,  The game itself is really short which is a bummer to me. It has four levels, but they're all long in their own way. You have to trick or treat and solve an issue in each level, and you can play hide-and-seek (well its optional actually), and they'll upgrade your trick or treat bags to cuter and cooler things, you can make optional costumes in the game which can have a big effect on your battle; (I'm not a battling kind of person, but this game was fun and cute.) Battle stamps are the best.  The Grubbin's on Ice was really interesting too, its an add on to the game's ending.  I just feel sad its a bit short for me. Just a bit over 8 hours and I've finished it with all with all achivements to boot with no guide. You shouldn't need a guide for this game! It's fun and good like that!
3191	1	a	How is this not a eSport?
4314	1	a	WONDERFUL music and it TOTALLY doesn't have anything to do with that Katamari game.
4373	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. BUGGY AS CRAP and I HATE IT. &gt;:C
2283	1	a	simply addicting game! Oi, not so simple, but godamn fun! Buy it or u will cry miss this awesome game! 354/10
3261	1	a	This game is just OK, honestly. There are a lot of in-browser games that have a lot of the same mechanics as Obulis, but Obulis has a lot more levels than the in-browser ones. There's nothing mind-blowing about this game, it's just very simple.
276	1	a	My 1.7 ghz and still works. XD Great game, Quick, Simple, Fun, etc. Great music too.
160	1	a	Absolutely love this game, if you are into puzzle games this is a must get.  I havn't got extremely far into the game, but I will say it does get very challenging fast.  4.5/5 Cant give it a 5 because I havn't played it all the way through.
2449	1	a	If this was a potato it would be a good potato
4517	1	a	So actually this is a pretty well made little tycoon game. If you're down with keeping it chill sometimes, this is a nice little gem. While you may not be able to capture the feel of becoming a captain of industry with this title, it will melt your stresses away.  The idea behind the game is to cross-breed plants together so they create unique seeds. Plant the seeds and wait for them to grow to see if you've found a rare species you can farm &amp; sell.  Obviously this isnt a game for everyone but its a solid tycoon title if you can handle the subject matter.
3996	1	a	Need a game you can complete in under 10 hours and have fun? Costume Quest fits the bill nicely and it's so sweet and adorable you may get diabetes.   You control a group of trick-or-treaters that gain strength and powers based on the costumes they wear to battle evil candy stealing monsters from another dimension. You roam around the world, looking for candy, collectable cards, pieces of your costumes, and others things on a quest to save your brother or sister (the game changes based on if you play as a boy or girl).   The combat is a turn based affair with your kids gaining a special ability every 3rd turn, that based on their costume will either deal massive damage or heal or protect other teammates. It is very easy to master, and you get even more power-ups with the various stamps you collect. Towards the end game I felt the combat got slightly repetive and boring, maybe too easy for older gamers.   Even though the game is rather short, I can't really call it a negative in this case. If it went on to a 20+ hour game they would have to make a whole lot more additions to every aspect of the game. This tight little bundle of gaming is the perfect length and pacing for its content. Costume Quest is a fun and funny game to play.
3550	0	a	Do you like classic JRPGs? Yes? Then you will surely like the innovative reaction games, quick-time events and whatnot, that are required for actually winning the battles! Costume Quest really requires the hard tactical experince of a person that can understand the difficult concepts of 'a monster that heals other monsters' and 'a monster that deals high damage'. If those terms sound difficult to comprehend and you cannot understand why they should be the primary targets, you might be more at home with some lighter strategy games.
3520	1	a	One of the best games that i played in my life. Alot of adventrues and fun.
4141	1	a	An interesting match-3 type game where you actually level up your character like an RPG. Lots of fun and it is easy to get in a quick session here and there without wasting too much time.
1974	1	a	Let's get some money with this
1564	1	a	Love it. So much fun to play it with friends! Especailly thanks to the cross platform, the gameplay, and the music!
800	1	a	If you like the actual board game, but wanna be a master so u can screw them all over quickly and efficiently get this game. much fun. - 11/10
1186	0	a	I remember playing it outside of Steam, it was great. Too bad it's Steam version has extremely low framerate for some reason which is important for such a fast-paced game. There is no way to solve this problem.
3040	1	a	This game is awesome. The gameplay, the music, the pixelized astetics, everything. Granted, this game is best played with friends, but if you have the patience to get through the game, each level you finish becomes one you can play with whoever is hosting that level.  The Heists are fun and have a good learning curve. You can mess around all you want at the start, and even the slightest wrong move will kill you in the last levels. My favorite aspect of the game is the PvP. One on one, the gameplay is very tactical, and stratigic, if you're killed holding all the trophies, then you've basically lost. If you have the fortune to get in a lobby with two or three other people, then a riot will ensue, unless you've honed your skills, you will be constantly killed, and constanty be killing the other players. Matches can last a long time and be utterly epic when you win. Like others have said, get the four pack, and share it with your friends, or if you don't have any, just wait around for open lobbys to pop up. You won't regret it. (The music is epic too)
3198	1	a	This is the best game in the Indie Pack. Its easy to pick up and play but dificult to complete.
3903	1	a	Straight forward RPG fun with a nice look to it. Only thing that lets it down is the fight mechanics, which are basic and mean that replay isn't on the books. Around 8 hours of gameplay total (including all of the side missions and hidden achievements)
4579	1	a	Well done! They NAILED the science-fiction feel with the cut scenes, music, and artwork. I buy a lot of games, and only a few really grab me -- this is one of them. The ability to save/resume or rewind time would make it even better, but I suppose this builds more tension and sense of victory when you finally beat a tough board. Production value is really high, and the gameplay is fun if you like tower defense games. Where's the sequel and why did it take four years to hear about it?! Make another one and market it! I put this at my #3 with Defense Grid (will it ever be beat?), and Orcs Must Die (amazing).
5200	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is not at all the game I was expecting it to be. The original game was a series of self-contained puzzle levels that were solved using a limited set of items. Toki Tori 2 is not that at all. Instead, the game drops you in the middle of a vast open 2D world and leaves you to figure everything out on your own. There are no instructions, tutorials, levels or items. The whole world is open from the start and you just need to figure out how to get through it while collecting a series of, err... collectibles. Unlike the previous game, Toki no longer uses items to solve puzzles. Instead, your abilities are limited to walking, singing and stomping. That's it. Where the complexity (and genius) comes in is how you can combine those actions with the various creatures that populate the world. For example, you can lure birds to pick you up with chirps, move bugs by stomping, and much, much more. I won't say anything further on that, as half the fun is figuring out the rules of the game on your own. As with the previous game, level/puzzle design is utterly brilliant. So many times you will think there is no way to proceed past an area, only to have the solution click a few minutes later (and you subsequently smack yourself upside the head because of how simple it actually was). That is a sign of good design, and I admire it a lot. I can't really think of any puzzles that were totally unfair, although there were a handful that were somewhat tedious. The singing mechanic is also a pretty neat new feature. In addition to its standard functionality, you learn a series of songs that provide other abilities, such as time-rewind, warping around the map, and more. And oh yeah, the characters are all really cute - especially Toki and the frogs (if you're into that sort of thing as a selling point). It all comes together nicely in a really well-executed package. Overall, I liked this a lot better than the first game, due to the open-ended exploration/collection gameplay and the 'complex simplicity' in the puzzle design. It's a fun, laid-back game that should appeal to puzzle fans. A-
5415	1	a	Let's get down to Brass Tax. Titan Attacks warrants a TRUE RECOMMENDATION! This evolution of 'Space Invaders' may start out slow and simple, but then it starts to reveal its true greatness! Like Space Invaders 95, this one ramps up the cool and offers customizations ala' 'Ultratron!' I got a Puppygames bundle including all their titles for 60% off during a Steam sale. If it comes to that price again, MAKE SURE TO PICK IT UP!
1446	0	a	Please remove the use of unfunny internet culture from your store page.
2458	1	a	co-op is the best. THE BEST.
3093	1	a	Straight out stealth, can't run and gun like payday unless your boss. 8/10 for zombies, but took me 15 minutes to figure stuff out. Needs a better tutorial system and user friendly interfaces.
3381	1	a	Costume Quest is awesome. If you're a fan of any of Double Fines previous games you will love it too. South Park the Stick of Truth reminds me a lot of this game. The development team probably looked at this game for inspiration. Fun story with fun mechanics.
5039	1	a	Great mom-casual collection of puzzle games, some interesting and cool, and some laughably stupid and mindless, like word searches. Prequel is more of the same. Pick them up alongside Everyday Genius: Square Logic for something to keep your parents busy for hours during Thanksgiving so you don't have to talk to them.
5322	1	a	Very good game, In some cases need a lot of mental endurance, but mostly the solution is pretty easy you just have to do it right.
5518	1	a	A modern day Space Invaders. Not the prettiest but quite good.
2993	1	a	quite an entertaining game need to be played with frineds
543	0	a	Help .... Ticket to ride -Europe can not find tutorials in the game ? I have no idea to play with this DLC.
2815	1	a	It's a fun little casual game that gives numerous replay opportunities.
205	1	a	I guess for a shooter that isn't beatable, it doesn't make sense to wait until I beat it to review it, and I've played it for several hours already. This is just super great. In some ways it's just a very well done twin-stick shooter, which makes for a good game but doesn't really stand out by itself. It's polished, and all the fundamental mechanics feel and look and sound good. The things that really keep me coming back for a couple rounds every few days are the extra mechanics on top of the basic ones and the well thought out game modes (one in particular).  A slow motion ability is not exactly a new or unique concept, but it's used well in this game, with a limited meter for it that drains VERY quickly and recharges moderately quickly, so it's very often available, but only in small amounts. You also get bonus points while using it, so you have to decide whether to trade off using it to save your life or be risky and use it to pad combos for more points. The other main mechanic is the bomb system. Your combo multiplier goes up as you kill more enemies without a break of more than I think three seconds in between, and at certain multiples you're awarded a bomb, which as in most games insta-kills anything in a relatively large radius around you. However, unlike most games, you cannot save it for later use. You have a few seconds to activate it, or it's gone forever. If timed/chained properly though, you can use a bomb to get you a good chunk of the way to your next bomb, then repeat. Of course, when there are enough things on the screen that you can get away with that, you need to be on your toes or you won't last long.  It has some common game modes like unlimited time with a limited number of lives, or infinite lives but a fixed amount of playtime, and some more exotic or panic-inducing ones like the one which lights up a small spot on the screen, and if you don't move to it within a few seconds you die. Once you get there, it picks a new random location. Oh, and you also have to keep playing the normal game while doing that. Good luck. The one I've really gotten stuck on is Bombing Run, which takes away your guns entirely but continues to spawn enemies. It places a bomb pad at a random location where you can pick up a bomb, at which point it creates a delivery point at a different random location. When you bring the bomb there, it detonates like a bomb in the other normal modes, and a new bomb pad is generated. If you get a high enough combo, you can get a single-use defensive shield, but mostly it's about positioning, movement, and reading patterns and paths through what becomes a huge, chaotic mess at higher levels. It's really great for practicing that stuff without being distracted by all the shooting you're normally doing in most modes of most games, and it's just plain fun.
1960	1	a	LOTS of fun if you have more than one friend.
2936	1	a	If you like old school graphics, and a cat/mouse type game, then this is for you. Id say 7/10 ... Not bad, can be a bit hectic.
2053	1	a	  This game is awesome!!!
3901	1	a	Little kids transforming on Halloween night to beat up monsters for candy. Fun for everyone. Another good Double Fine game.
3257	1	a	Very nice, very addictive! ILIKE!
1326	1	a	Most MLG Club Penguin Simulator I've ever played.  10/10 GOTY
826	1	a	So much fun, especially now that most of the bugs have been ironed out. Can't wait to get the UK map when it comes out.
4851	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
3215	0	a	Obulis is a great game about finding the right solution and making a stand. It is about acceptance, patience and persistence. Strongly recomended for all those who: 1)enjoyed Titan quest, Aion and/or wished there were more mobs in Prince of Persia 2)are profoundly pleased by repeatedly pressing the retry button A warning: uncontrolable weeping, especially bloody tears of rejoice upon completition An advice: tag it TIMING, cos, you know, PUZZLES are generally about thinking
3920	1	a	THis is such a great game for playing around October. It brings a sense of nostalgia to the table, and is super easy to pick up.
2373	1	a	Heaps of fun if you are looking for a light, casual game to play with your friends.   
3932	1	a	Something about this game really appeals to me. I think it's the atmosphere. It makes you feel like a kid, yet most of the dialogs are written with an adult player in mind. I usually struggle to complete games because I get bored quickly, but with this one I didn't put it down on the PS3 until I found all secrets and got all achievements. Now I picked up the PC version and looks like I'm going to play it till the end once more before the Costume Quest 2 comes out.
4778	1	a	It's good, not great but good. More platformer than puzzle game. The story is a bit shallow. It's also pretty short so wait for a sale.
2932	1	a	'I AM THE MOLE.'
3962	1	a	Simple and fun. Was a great laid back game to play, also SWEET A** B**CHIN' AS HELL RAINBOW MOTHER-EFFIN' UUUUNICORNS!!!! YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHh!!!!
4818	1	a	I think this game may have more in common with Portal than Portal 2 did. The mechanics of changing dimensions on the fly feel very natural and organic in much the same way the portal gun does, and the puzzles are a joy to work through. Professor Quadwrangle doesn't have quite as much personality as GLaDOS, but his voiceovers are still fun to listen to and do more than an adequate job of guiding the player through the mansions that makes up the setting.
1109	0	a	While fun, not very fit for a PC game, buy it on mobile instead.
4312	1	a	You walk around, stuff sticks to you, you get bigger and finally, you consume the whole world. Katamari Damacy on PC. And it's fun. And funny. Buy it. It's Dejobaan Games.
4576	1	a	This is a great TD game itself and the orbit mechanics make it really intersting to play. great replayable value also. absolutely recomended
3365	1	a	If you're expecting an enthralling epic, don't look here. It's fun, it's simple, and it's reasonably amusing.
645	1	a	If you can't get any friends together to play the board game, or don't actually have any real life friends, this PC version is an exact replica. The AI is tough, too.
4001	1	a	beat this game multiple times still love it, simple, easy, fun!
3109	1	a	A great local multiplayer game, me and my friends have had hours of fun playing this in the past.
2549	1	a	I love this game. This game is diffrent than most games like these. The layout and the story line depending on the charactors are really laid out. This game is a really planned out game. It has a nice sound track. The smooth jazz always fits in with the sneaking or even the running. And the charactors all have that special layout. If i could rate this game i would give it a 10/10. I recomend this game to friends. And even if on youtube the sound track and the gameplay will give it that feeling of suspence or suspicouseness in the game. All i have to say now is.... Nicely done.
48	1	a	music is very well. pleasant game
4320	1	a	This game is just weird. You are some weird thing that obsorb things smaller than you such that you can grow bigger and obsorb even bigger objects. It's a shame the game is so extreme short (2-3 to ace all levels) since it's actually a decent fun game.
975	0	a	It's a nice game, but there's hardly any game time... I mean, I accidentally left it running for a day, so it recorded as 9 hours, but I think it's closer to 1,5-2 hours of gameplay. Bit disappointing, especially for the price. Looks good though and it's a good game, so get it on sale!
3055	1	a	Very fun, and filled with strategy! That or you can run in head first and blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up but it wont end well. Violence never ends well with Monaco.
3659	1	a	I wanted to like this game, but unfortunately it was a bit of a let down. The main story is good enough, but the game play is boring and repetitive. Maybe if you could change the difficulty level things would have been better, but as the game stands you can defeat 90% of the monsters without using any battle stamps whatsoever. I was sick of trick or treating and all its monotony by the 2nd level. Cute game, but it's probably best left for the kiddos to play.  6/10
629	1	a	I love days of wonder every board game I own from them is amazing. All together I own 7 different games, ticket to ride is the best with different maps and ways to reach each city. I just got the 10th year one on table top hope they bring it to pc soon.
3062	1	a	I love this game but can never get 3 people to play!
4354	0	a	It's alright. Who doesn't like rolling around collecting â¥â¥â¥â¥?
1556	1	a	You can pee in the toilets, and if there is an npc already at the toilet, you can share. That's a good enough reason to buy this game. It also has pretty colors.
5304	1	a	This is a very cute adventure puzzle platformer for anyone from toddlers (age 3+) to obsessive gamers. The storyline is quite open ended and there's always more achievements and collectables to chase.
4813	1	a	Absolutely love it. It makes me think, sometimes it makes me curse in frustration, and the dialog is funny and interesting. Totally worth the money for the game.
4222	1	a	it is very addictive
191	1	a	Why do I have 250+ hours in this simple, yet captivating arcade game?   because i have no life   11/10 m8  EDIT:  My serious review.  Waves is a arcade shooter that is very easy to get into, but requires an adept to achieve a high score. It's more for the old school and casual gamers like me. Just buy it and play.
1718	1	a	I'm a big fan of Heist type games/movies and cooperative gameplay, Monaco is one of a kind and aside from such games as Payday, Monaco delivers a more unique user experience with it's immersive gameplay, style, and it's playable classes of characters. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone!
3025	1	a	I played the demo, and despite being moderately difficult, I enjoyed it. Overall, it was a good play, and if you enjoy Hotline Miami, you should definitely buy it. It's sort of like a fast-paced stealth shooter, it requires a lot of skill, and is good paired with a sunny afternoon of Portal and possibly some tea. Overall, I'd have to give this game a 9/10. Also, HAPPY HALLOWEEN!
4823	1	a	Fun little game, lots of interesting puzzles to solve and I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoyed the humour and puzzle solving of portal as this is in a similar style.
1985	1	a	I bought this game to play with friends and family. I really enjoyed playing with them, but I found that playing solo or with others it was either super tough or close to unbeatable...  Its a good game to have in your library and when you play... just remember.... TEAM WORK! other wise everyone runs around like group of chickens leaving feathers and what have you all over the place. :)
1538	1	a	Monaco is possibly the closest thing we'll ever get to an Ocean's Eleven video game. If you're a fan of classic heist movies this is the title you've been waiting for. Assemble a team and pull off the job of a lifetime.   What's yours is mine.  5/5
821	1	a	A good little fun game. Worth a pick up.
2348	1	a	Great game. That's all it is. Great game.
1765	1	a	Very fun! Simple concept but very addicting, the replay value is pretty high especially when you get friends involved!
1830	1	a	Monaco is an incredibly varied game with very simple game mechanism. Itâs actually quite staggering with how much you can get done and nuanceful (thatâs a real word I am sure) your game play can be with so few commands at your disposal. Itâs nothing short of brilliant. It also makes its very approachable and in all probability resulted in 8 different character classes rather than one multitalented one and too, is very cool since it opens up a nice setting for very fun multiplayer games that rely heavily on co-op to get things done efficiently. And with a game play as smooth as Monaco's it really is a treat!  So what type of game is it? Itâs a stealth action planning coop game where you collect treasure, whack out baddies and hide in the bushes. Occasionally when things go wrong and might have to put the shotgun on the table and some cleaning.  The game has a top down view, you have a field of vision (opponents too) and you can see most of the buildings layoutes once you have explored them. You move around with arrow keys and with the help of different character you can go through walls, pick locks or hack computers etc. Your goal is get through security and fine the 'cake'.   For me itâs the coop that really shines since you can have your buddies set up different scenarios or organize traps for the baddies and itâs just a lot of fun. Itâs also the type of game you can easily play with your girlfriend!  9/10 in my book. 
4508	1	a	Played this game since I was still a kid, this brings back memories and is still a wonderful game to this day, would recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest some time in growing virtual plants and to relax, destress after a long day at school/work or after raging at a FPS game like Counter Strike or Team Fortress 2.
717	1	a	A board game on pc of course is not like the real game, but this one manages to be close enough. A lot faster and very easy to find oponents and play with 2,3,4,5 players. But still not as good as the real board game
1102	0	a	In this game you're the proprietor of a white van with tinted windows. Your goal is to drive around the town and recruit various children who are loitering around the school after hours to help find your lost puppy. When you pick a child up it is then your duty to brutally and savagely anally â¥â¥â¥â¥ them. This is the 'snuggle' part of the game. You then must drive down a secluded road miles away from their home and dump them off in the middle of the woods.
45	1	a	First off: this is a game about the aesthetic. The hand-made set and camera moves makes this game among the prettiest I've ever played. It's also super short, serving as a taster for the upcoming Lumino City, made in the same handcrafted way - I personally can't wait to explore a bigger world that's this beautiful.  Niggles: - It sucks that the resolution is so low. It takes away from the awesomeness of the visuals, which is what the game's about in the first place. - The puzzles aren't that clever or anything. But it's a point and click, so what can one expect.  It's cheap. It's beautiful. Buy it.
526	1	a	You can play Solo, or Multiplayer (online, hotseat, or LAN)! Simple but fun game, and well made.
3181	1	a	Obulis is your standard physics puzzle game. You try to get the balls in their containers by hitting off of walls and other balls, rolling on platforms, and swinging off of chains. It's a pretty known concept, but the different environments created for the game definitely make the game a relaxing one. There are about 150 different puzzles to solve, and they range from simple to master difficulty, with 6 difficulties in between.  I read the other reviews written so far, and I gotta say I disagree completely with them; If you repeat a level, and do exactly the same moves every time, you will always yield the same result. By definition, that means there isn't any luck involved. Some levels do take a bit of precise timing, but they tend to have large margins for error, and the levels reset very quickly, so it's not like messing up takes too much time. All you need to solve the puzzles is a bit of patience (only necessary for the hard ones) and a brain (also really only necessary for the hard ones).  It took me about 6 hours to get through all of the levels and unlock all of the achievements. For a puzzle game with a fairly simple premise, I think that's more than good enough. I was fortunate enough to be gifted a copy of this game, but I feel like it's worth the $5 normal price, given that for me, that's like $0.80/hr of gameplay. And if you don't think it's worth it, pretty much all steam games go on sale 4 times a year, usually for more than half-off.  If you like Casual games, if you like puzzle games, if you care about atmosphere as much as gameplay, then I would recommend this game to you.
1695	1	a	The mole is very judicious in his digging.
648	1	a	Very good game; I started playing the physical board game, the digital version is just as good. Cheaper than physical game, and more maps to play with. Games are ~20+ minutes, perfection.
2181	1	a	Very fun for the amount of money you pay for it
4201	1	a	A very good time waster... it's basically your typical rpg set up coupled with puzzles that you do in place of the tradtional rpg battle.   the story is okay... not that bad, but not great nethier. it's kind of medicore. basically, only get this if you like playing puzzle games and use it to pass the time.
1236	1	a	Very simple game, but is quite a laugh for a short while. Think TF2 with penguins and no killing.
759	1	a	Ah, the good old days when I played this as a board game, with actual people.  Anyway, great board game turned decent PC game. Bit pricey for what it is, but still.
1265	1	a	For a Very small and Basic indie game party game it's decent. I wouldn't say it good but as I was playing it just a little to get the trading cards somehow i got lost track of time and played for nearly 3 hours straight. So if this piece is cheap and on special get it link it with a few friend and play for a while.   This game does need go to a beta mode to get the steam achievement and it's probably one of the easiest game to get 100%. I was able to get it today when I just playing it for the card drop.  6/10
1231	1	a	i actually found this game fun, not something i would play often but its a guilty pleasure for me.  10/10 its like fallout 3 but with penguins
3189	1	a	PLUSES: + Nice graphics + Very interesting game + Some physics laws may work uncorrectly, and believe me, you can solve levels using another way, especially in ultra levels  MINUSES: - When I capture video, most physics laws work uncorrectly. For example, without capturing I can hit the ball 10 times in a row and it always goes on its way, but when I capture I hit the ball, but it doesn't go on its way or it loses its power.
3791	1	a	A short, cute, and funny adventure game with some jrpg-lite combat elements. The humor is excellent and there is little out there that gives such a great feeling as the first time your character turns from big-eyed kid into a giant war-robot.
1194	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥ balls dont buy
2100	1	a	This game is sick !
3573	1	a	Awesome game, it plays just like Final Fantasy VII (7) and reminds it by every aspect, even dialogs have no voice overs and you need to reed comic baloons, just like in old good FF7. The only difference - this is a parody and funny game, while FF7 was pretty serious and dramatic. Must buy!
2817	1	a	Awesome fast paced game, worth every cent and then some!
1576	1	a	This game, while having a simple premise, quickly leads itself to be a formidable challenge to any gamer. Countless times my friend and I had to restart a level from failing due to one too many mistakes. Most definitely a multiplayer game, playing by yourself is no fun. While challenging it is definitely worth the fight and I recommend it to any gamer (and their friends!).
2147	1	a	1 Minute Review of Monaco.  This is a great game with its retro arcade machine feel but the problem is when it comes to playing with strangers who don't appreciate the stealth aspects involved. They can ruin the fun.  Final Word Buy if you have 3 friends to play with or at least a friend... Buy a copy for them if they are cheap. Don't Buy if you have no friends, in which case you should probably be out socializing instead of playing games.
3839	1	a	Simple, but fast-paced Final Fantasy clone, with a touch of Zelda, its own colectibles, a few mini games, but, most importantly, the charm of a heartfelt Halloween story for kids.
2878	1	a	Would only recommend if you've got friends, probably would kill myself if I played solo.
3428	1	a	'You guys, can we make a pact? Let's do this every Halloween!'
3414	1	a	This is a great game, with two story lines and multiple ways to play it's just great. The only thing I would have to criticize is that some of the controls are a little wacky and when you cange then they go back, this may be just my problem. Even though you should defiantly buy this game.
1396	1	a	It is a snowball fight.  I really can't say NO, but I would not buy this game again.  I snagged it when I first got on Steam a very long time ago, and it is not a bad or broken game, I am sure a lot of love went into it.  It is just a basic arena game, much like Fur Fighters multiplayer battles IMO  If you do not mind that it is an outdated feel and a rather short and small game, it might be worth your money.  I hate to give a thumbs down based on my opinions over the game being broken, so I am still giving it a thums up.  I am sure some niche will enjoy it.
398	1	a	What an awesome game if you looking at killing time! Insanely fun!
1266	1	a	There's not much to say about this game. It's basically a more casual version of the 3D Worms games, only with penguins instead of worms, where the objective is to throw your opponents out of the stage by throwing snowballs at them. It allows up to four teams, and there's a few different power ups scattered through the maps.  It also offers different gamemodes; a team deathmatch mode, where the last team standing wins, a duel mode, where each team has a set number of 'lives' and a single member, an unlimited mode, and a custom map mode, which is just like team deathmatch.  As I mentioned above, it's similar to Worms, not only in the gameplay, but in artistic style as well. Unlike Worms however, this game doesn't feature terrain destruction or heavy weaponry, the most 'dangerous' weapons are a huge mine that simply pushes your opponents back, and a fish with a dynamite stick coming out of its mouth.  Still, it's somewhat fun to play, although a bit frustrating at times, since the terrain is very slippery.
1215	0	a	If your response to this game is anything other than wanting to violently bash your nose against a wall, you clearly see something in this game I don't.
5129	1	a	Amusing little time waster.   The 'carve out your kingdom' thing is fun - but the attacks five levels down can get complicated as your fighters wend their way up and down (or falll into a pit and starve without you noticing).  Actually, falling into pits and starving can be way to common if you get disturbed and 'forget' what you were doing . . .  A build without monsters option could be fun as well
3717	1	a	very cute and surprisingly addictive! Combat does get a bit repetitive after awhile but overall still a fun and light-hearted game!
1371	1	a	It's OK.
1504	1	a	Amazing co-op and fun singleplayer, can be played with chaos or stealth. A combination of both will guarantee success. Must buy, $15 is a steal for the amount of play time and possibilities this game has to offer.
1244	1	a	5min of this game         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  5min of Penguins Arena: Sedna's World - highlights&nbsp;
601	0	a	I've played this game as a parlor game, it was great! But the PC-Version isn't in a playable state... I've tryed everything but I can't click on anything in the game. Not by using the Mouse or any key on the keyboard. I haven't ever bought a game on Steam that is that buggy and unplayable.  I recommend to safe the money and instead buying the original parlor game!
126	1	a	This is a good timewaster make sure to buy it if you got some extra $$$.  Needs more game modes though :|  7/10
4662	1	a	A colorful and fun arcade style game where you launch your Arkonaut from the bounce pad to collect DNA blocks. You not only control the bounce pad but also the Arkonaut as well which adds extra challenge. The avatars are cute and the music is catchy. This game is deffinitely worth giving a shot.
641	1	a	This game is awesome!
3876	1	a	Great game. Simple (a bit repetitive...) gameplay, but super cute setting and characters.
5440	1	a	I love this game. It's fast-paced frantic fun, and quite a good update on the old Space Invaders formula. Sometimes enemy ships will plummet to the surface instead of exploding, sometimes they will drop alien parachuters who you can catch for money, or shoot in mid-air, there are bonus waves, there are bosses, there are upgrades, and the games only last roughly 30 minutes unless you're really bad or really good.  Definitely worth 5 bones.
2957	1	a	Interesting game to play with friends because there are a max of 4 players and each character only has one ability meaning the levels are much easier if you have more players to perform different tasks. If you're looking for a relaxing co-op game, then give this a shot.
4568	1	a	Don't worry, the GORGs in this? They're actually stoppable.
1479	1	a	it's like payday but without microtransaction
2034	1	a	Great fun! Much better when you play with mates... Almost like a 2D Payday if that makes sense &gt;.&lt;
1645	1	a	This game is very addictive. It's fun to play with your friends either online or in the same room as you. Monaco is a very simple game, but getting the gold coins can be tricky. I always have that sense of suspense when a guard sees me and I have to immediately figure out a way to hide. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.
4591	1	a	this game boasting its unstoppable times, but after 5 minutes i wanted it to end.. I never went back for another round of GORG. it was too pre fabricated so that you werent really doing any fighting yer self.. i guess thats what towers do, in tower defence games, i would rather play out side and get fresh air.. I was not disapointed because my standards were low when i was tricked into buying this game by its flashy video, but sadly was a fool for believeing smoke and mirrors, those dasterdly programmers making it look cooler than it really is.. 4/10 
1689	1	a	An incredibly fun 'heist' game. Has a huge campaign (both for single-player and multi-player), local coop, online coop, matchmaking, user-created levels (via Steam Workshop)...
3359	1	a	Simple old school style turned based RPG strategy fun.
271	1	a	This is the kind of game that when you lose you say 'Ok, I'm gonna play just one more...' and then you wake up 3 days later totally wasted with you controller crashed against the wall and all you can see is colorful dots flying around your vision. Seriously, this game is a challenge that makes you keep trying to best yourself even though you know that, by the end, the game always wins.  It's fun, it's cheap, it has a high replayability factor and don't let me get started with the sarcastic jokes all around the game!
1821	1	a	dirty criminals should think like dirty criminals.
3635	1	a	This game, in a word, is ADORABLE. I just love it. Creative, highly entertaining - the only downvote is that it's clearly a console port as it makes you go through keyboard acrobatics during combat, but the special abilities, gorgeous graphics and great music make up for all that. Perfect for all ages, get it!
4939	1	a	Quantum Conundrum - a game that sit somewhere in shadows of its more popular puzzle game brother - Portal. And while both of those video games are 3D puzzle games with platforming elements, the similarity really ends here. The concepts of the two franchises are different and I wish people would stop comparing them or claming that Portal will always be a better game without even playing Quantum Conundrum. If you're a fan of the genre, you will enjoy Quantum Conundrum even though it might be a bit too easy after playing other, similar titles.   But, enough of that. It might be already clear, but I did enjoy Quantum Conundrum A LOT. And I probably enjoyed it a lot more than Portal 2. Yes, the story is pretty much a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and the ending is a set up for the sequel (which hopefully will happen although I doubt it...). Yes, the puzzles are mostly pretty easy and after getting tricky they still can be solved in under 30 minutes, But I still enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum...  Its concept is interesting. The game gives the player the control over the enviroment instead of one particular thing (as with Portal and QUBE). It plays with physics letting you make elements weight more or less, slow the flow of time or even the entire gravity of the room. And it does so in unexpected ways such as makes you throw boxes so you can basically fly through the level using the gravity or lets you bounce on the platforms using a couch that you can make heavier and then lighter to fling yourself upwards. Those little mechanics that make the player say 'yeah, that clever' and then use those mechanics and mix them up in another level of the game. A concept of dimensions gives a bunch of possibilities for those mechanics and (again, hoping for it) there are a lot of paths that a sequel might take.   The puzzles are never too hard. Something I dislike about puzzle games is the difficulty curve that gets really high after a while without letting the player understand what he should be doing. Quantum Conundrum teaches the player its mechanics and does a good job at it also bringing back things introduced in previous chapters in the later ones. The player never gets stuck for good or frustrated that he can't figure out a solution. The levels go by pretty fast and it gives the player the feeling of progress which, of course, pushes him forward through the game. I never felt like the game is too easy. It gave me a good challenge showing me what I can do and then mixing it up and making me do it. I never felt mad at the game for having some riddiculus solution for a puzzle. It wasn't complicated. It was always a simple concept.   As for the story, well... I didn't really care too much for it and I don't think it is a bad thing either. The story was just there as a filler, the narration was okay and I see people really liking the professor. It just wasn't my thing, but it also didn't overshadow the gameplay. Everything is presented in a really lighthearted way, the graphics are bright and colorful and the overall game has a lot of character.   So what about the negatives? There are negatives. As I've mentioned previously - the story is just a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and since the checkpoints bring you back to a set spot, you often have to listen to the same voice clip over and over again. The puzzles are simple, but not too simple and Portal veterans might breeze through the game. There are also corridors between levels that act as hidden loading screens and a 'story time' kind of deal. Those get repeated pretty fast and they're mildly annoying. The fact that they are in fact just a window of time for the game to load the next map, also might result in a bit of a frame drop from time to time. Also, I should probably mention that Quantum Conundrum loves platforming a lot more than other 3D puzzle games. Something you should probably have in mind.   Overall, I had a fantastic time with the game. It wasn't anything amazing, but it has a lot of potential and character to it and I wish we see a sequel one of these days.
4639	1	a	I remember playing this game as a child back when it came out, and I love everything about it, even now. Challenging puzzles and flowing gameplay. Overall I highly recommend this game, I think kids will especially enjoy it.
1547	1	a	The game looks simple at first glance due to its artwork and design. But honestly, it very challenging once you play it. This game shows that indie games aren't sucks, as a matter of fact most of the time they are the ones that make compelling games even if it looks cheap graphically, financially. Anyhow, I will definitely recommend this game.
2558	1	a	screew that i dont wanna buy this! i already downloaded it! 
686	0	a	Just played a few hours because i was curious how this game would be on the computer instead of the board game, the rules are same and the tutorial is easy to pickup but....  the bad: the game is full of advertisement for other/new games. the complete settingsscreen isnt working, i can't login change colours nor sound settings etc. because there isnt any progress saved and i have to change my username every game, the game feels very unfinnished.  I guess it could have been a good game when everything is working properly, this game will go into the bin for me I'll stick to the real boardgame.
3096	1	a	Its a very fun 8-bit sneaky game but can turn very poor if you either have a very toxic person or people just trying to run in and grab stuff not knowing and end up getting themselves killed but you can just switch to single player wich is just as fun with an amazing story mode and ive had a very hard time finding server that dont have 300+ ping but if get a friend or a group of friends it is very fun trying out new strategies like diging through everything and not get caught as the mole or doing somthing stupid like that good experience but the gamplay alone is enough to make up for all the problems it has has and the level design is very well put together and thought out it all around a really good game.
223	1	a	Easily one of the best time wasters there is. First game i bought and cant stop playing it. Humor just is the icing on the cake
2774	1	a	Good game not great. Not alot of action but its still fun. I'm more into shooter/survival type games but this is still alot of fun 7/10
84	1	a	It's a beautiful game with an interesting look. The puzzles were easy, given enough thought, though the answers were not always obvious. My only complaint is that it was much too short. I know more episodes are due to come out, but I was able to beat it in 45 minutes (including cut scenes).
1698	1	a	Nice graphics, cool music. Really like enhanced levels, they seem to be much more polished. Online gameplay is quite fast and funny. A lot of workshop levels with funny dialog and nicely arranged assets. Offline play is quite fun too with two controllers
1905	1	a	This game is amazing. Some people don't like it just because its a little hard. But its actually really fun! On xbox i was bad, but on pc im really good for some reason. Even tho i only played 1.0 hours so far, i still really think people should get this game. 9/10 - HeadZipper
5138	1	a	Fun to control your own Dwarven army and build your own empire:)
676	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun and great adaption of the Board game where you are a railroad tycoon, racing to connect the country with your own railroad company before your opponents do the same. You can play solo against suprisingly skilled bots or online against friends. The rules are simple and easy to get the hang off. The graphics are functional and simple although the menus are a bit clunky. The random draw of tickets and carriage cards means luck does play a part (especially when you need that last carriage or locomotive to finish a route!) but it means each game is different and the various maps available each provide their own quite different challenges. Fortunately the game keeps track of all the scoring (one of the more difficult tasks in the board game). Make sure you get all of the Maps in the bundle and you will have endless entertainment with a game that is ideal as a time filler in between other tasks or games or perfect for honing skills in-between tabletop sessions! Excellent value for money.
1828	1	a	This game is tons of fun! It has a complex storyline, the map design is brilliant! Music is nice too, I love it!
4883	1	a	Enjoy the portal-esque puzzles. Hate the first-person platforming. Love the art-style. Q is your narrator. Worth my money.
4099	1	a	Arguably better than PQ2. Still looks great and is tons of fun, if you like RPGs and puzzle games its a no brainer.
917	1	a	Check this out. It is totally cool once you get over the toy soldier look. Easier to set up through Steam, if you've got it.
3524	1	a	Costume Quest is the journey of a few kids to find as much candy as they can on Halloween (and maybe save one of their sisters along the way... if they feel like it).   It's innocent fun that conjures up feelings of nostalgia that I'm sure we can all relate to, while positively radiating with a pristine aura of charm and joy. Now if all that doesn't already sound appealing to you, there are also a ton of innuendos and jokes that only adults can connect with strewn throughout.  This journey should take you around 5 hours to complete, even if you seek to obtain every single collectable. It's definitely pretty brief in terms of longevity, but I still really enjoyed my experience.  If you're willing to let the kid inside of you out for a bit of fun, I'd say this game is worth at least one playthrough.
4673	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is quite a conundrum to review.   On one hand, the gameplay and visuals are solid. Everything from the fluffy-iness of the fluffy dimension to the roughness of the heavy dimension is rendered beautifully. The Uncle's mansion is such an incredibly unique style. Even the only NPC you ever actually interact with looks like something straight out of a Disney or Pixar film. Gameplay is obviously inspired by Portal, but it takes the concept from that game and changes it into something completely different and incredibly similar at the same time. Three dimensions, light and soft; normal; heavy and hard, govern the elements of the puzzles you'll find in your Uncle's mansion. Along with the intriguing gameplay, are tons of hidden collectables. This makes the game a treasure trove for completionists.  On the other hand, this Quantum Conundrum is plagued by a badly voiced Uncle and a story that leaves much to be desired. The Uncle drones on while you play through each level. Either giving you hints to certain puzzles or just fumbling around seemingly holding you back by mistakes or errors comitted on his part. The voice acting is sadly bland. To be frank, there was a lack of anything. The Uncle sounded as though a preset voice created by a computer. Perhaps, that was what the game's story was implying, but I can never be to sure because there was almost a complete lack of a story. The underlying goal of the game was for me to finally meet up with my uncle, but other than that there wasn't much of a plot. The ending is equally as frustrating. Nothing is even remote resolved or answered. The ending implied a continuation of the game in a sequel, but after two years I haven't heard of anything.  Instead of implementing a half-baked story with an Uncle and his estranged nephew, I would've much rather have the game just focused on the puzzles. Trying to recreate the Portal experience of having a robot entity taunt you throughout the game just wasn't a good idea and detracted from what was otherwise a wonderful game.  I give this game a 7/10. The puzzles are definitely worth the price tag of $9, just don't expect a story-telling masterpiece.  Pros: Unique Artstyle Interesting Gameplay Addicting Collectables  Cons: Poor Story Voice Acting Leaves Much To Be Desired
2671	1	a	One of the best Top-Down stealth games on the pc is worth a try.
2234	1	a	Get the four pack, it's like a six pack only it entails you sitting at a computer tugging at your scalp (you've torn out all your hair already) and screaming at your friends, rather than entailing that you exercise regularly.  10/10 Would reanimate my friend's dead corpse while hiding in a bush again.
323	1	a	It's a fun game. But you'll get bored of it most probably after playing a while, but that's with alot of games...  Overall, it's fun to play.
319	1	a	Awesome graphics songs!!
1894	1	a	this game is an awesome game is great game to play co-op :D
5067	1	a	Love it. Lots of fun puzzles to do.
4041	1	a	Great adventure game. Perfect storyline and characters. Graphics are a bit outdated but if you're really an adventure game fan, you probably would not care for that. 
5425	1	a	This game is addictive and fun. Among the other awsome games by Puppygames, this one is my favorite. I enjoy playing this simple, yet fun and addictive game whenever im not feeling like playing shooters and other more complex games. Controls are easy all you need is your mouse. Graphisc are awsome. In conclusion this game helps me relax. I recommend it.
1421	0	a	Luckily I got this for free. Is a bit too silly and penguins aren't really that easy to control. I'll leave this one for the kids.
874	1	a	I have the physical game, this is good digital replacement for when no one is around to battle. Board game is great also, highly recommended.
2861	1	a	Great game, tons of fun to play with friends, and a really cool soundtrack. Definitely recommend this game to anyone! Use a controller, the game is better with one.
2220	1	a	Watch out for the guyy. he's gonna put you in jail
5148	1	a	This game looked interesting. The price is reasonable. I bought it. It is a lot of fun. It reminds me of Dungeon Keeper mixed with some other things. It lacks the urgency of invasions, but the developers seem very involved with the community, so I expect new things for this. My wife wanted a copy. Then she blamed it as the reason she crawled into bed at 5am. That is a pretty good endorsement for a $10 game from indie developers. :) I recommend this game.
1816	1	a	Fun and a bit challenging worth it if you can get it on sale. 
3721	1	a	A game for kids and adults. If you want to have a laugh while playing a great game, Costume Quest is what needs to be in your games collection!
657	1	a	I love this game, had it on the Xbox 360 too. Never played the orignal board game. A good strategic game where it can be frustrating when another player buys your route or likewise fun when you buy someone elses route you know they need.
387	1	a	Surprisingly Awesome!
3851	1	a	It's been a long time since I truly enjoyed an rpg, and Costume Quest was no disappointment. I'd been waiting a long time to play it and I'm glad I finally did. It took me about 10 hours to beat the base game and then the dlc. The best part of this game was the imagination of the kids that allowed them to use their cardboard Halloween costumes as amazingly deadly characters in battle. Truly a unique game. I recommend this game to ANYONE of any age, whether you like rpgs or not.
2909	1	a	This is a fun little co-op game, as long as you have a friend or two to play it with. Otherwise it's not worth a damn.  Final Verdict 3 out of 5
804	1	a	Original and captivating game. Just as much fun and as addictive as the table top version, only here you don't have to constantly bug your friends to play!
3631	1	a	Short but sweet (Get it?).
1868	1	a	Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.  The goal of each level is to go through a series of 'floors' of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.  The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong. You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.  The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!  All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!
2517	1	a	This may be one of the best games I've played. With a beautiful soundtrack, unique, yet still aesthetically pleasing style, and an amazing multiplayer, this one is definitely one to get. Happy heisting.
4959	1	a	I was looking for a Portal-like puzzle fix when a friend recommended QC. Strange Facility: Yes Odd narrator/overseer: Yes (John DeLancie!) Odd 'Support' Character: Yes Puzzles: Yes and Yes Item Hunt: Yes Low Stress: Yes (time trials are an optional pain) Humorous and colorful, QC is a fun puzzle-platformer game. It is more casual in nature than Portal. Things can get quite Heavy (or Fluffy) at times. Keyboard-mouse works fine, though I did resort to a mouse side-button for really quick activation of an ability. There's also two DLC for more fun. Enjoy!   Overdue Update: DLC weren't as fun as expected. No plot or narrator, only challenging puzzles. I'll admit that I didn't get very far, but I didn't feel the same atmosphere that I enjoyed in the main game. If you're looking for challenge, the DLC might be worthwhile. Myself, I've found some Portal fan-creations for my time.
73	1	a	Lume is a cute little game with charm. I've honestly never seen another game like it. The aesthetic is definitely there, and the puzzles were fun and challenging. However, it almost feels more like a demo than a full-fledged game. I do recommend Lume, but I would wait for it to be on sale before buying as it's quite short and I don't believe there's enough content to justify the $5.99 Steam is asking for.
5014	1	a	Loved the art style
473	0	a	The last update is a disaster. Instead of normal online game you now get something with 'notifications' that spam your inbox (sound effects notifying your turn were obviously found not useful and are now used when you end your turn), graphics wants to bite your eyes out and whoever did the design forgot to play the game at least once to see how it works (adding new ticket always showed you where the towns you need are, now you can't see it because there's random stuff flashlighted on the map)  Don't fix something that ain't broken?
2729	1	a	It's an absolute blast with friends.
5466	1	a	Titan Attacks! really works as a retro style space shooter. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything looks and plays great. Who wouldn't have fun blowing up alien invaders with a super-powered and fully upgradable tank? This game reminds me of the classic arcade sh*t. And that's a good thing.
2242	1	a	10/10 GET ME THIS GAME OR I WILL DESTROY EVERY ONE.
2415	1	a	Good multiplayer, interesting concept, and the most important, FUN!
1253	1	a	10/10 would suck â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this game anyday
3691	1	a	I really liked this game! It was quite easy but also fun. The story and art/music are super cute, too! The battles do get incredibly repetitive after a while, but you can try to switch it up a little by using different costumes in battle. Some of them have VEEERRRRY interesting special powers. (Lady Liberty's patriotism heal is fantastic, LOL) The overall game was actually a lot longer than I thought it was going to be, which I think is a plus. Even more, I got this game off of humble bundle, AND it technically includes a second game within it (Grubbins on Ice), so heyyyy for bonus stuff!
2289	1	a	A hell of a game for the intuitive and the observant. This game boasts nerve-racking single-player campaign and multi-player chaos for up to 4 people! A genuine must play for the sneak and greedy people!
4451	1	a	Nice mini game  even the game is very simple, but.. I like it
5144	1	a	It's awesome fun and yet keeps you calm and relaxed the whole time. It's like playing a game while being high when your not high. Come on.. give it a go... it's only Â£8!
5251	1	a	A great platform game with insanely cute graphics and quirky ways to solve the puzzles throughout. I challenge anyone to play this game without smiling at least a little bit.
2308	1	a	Its a good game, but if you play with your friends you will end up killing them
2732	1	a	I recommend Monaco as both a good single player game and an amazing co-op experience. This cross betweern pac-man and payday delivers fun gameplay unlike many titles before. Pick this game up with a few friends and you'll have a blast.
4077	1	a	A truly addicting and stimulating game that sucks you in the moment you start playing. Good RPG elements with an interesting story, giving the player the opportunity to choose whether to be 'good' or less so. My only complaint is that the expansion pack isn't available for the PC version, withholding 4 additional classes (available on the PS3. Yes, I have this game on multiple platforms, it's THAT good.)
2739	1	a	Great game, addictive!
4735	1	a	Definitely worth the purchase, this is a must play especially if you enjoy Portal. You solve puzzles just like in Portal but with different dimensions instead of portals. Very fun and awesome game plus two DLCs coming out soon, what more could you want? Play it now!
507	1	a	The PC version stays true to the formula and offers both single and online play. Online play comes with your standard chat room where you can create games and invite friends (or strangers) to test your mettle. If youâre the anti-social sort, like me, you can play against the AI. There are also other maps available for purchase via DLC in case you get tired of seeing the USA map. Thereâs not much else to say besides that the PC version works well and is easy on the eyes. The electronic version is nice to play for when you donât have a lot of time to set up and clean up the board game version. If youâre a fan of light strategy games or âTicket to Rideâ in general, then I highly recommend picking this up.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P_SdBudZC8

4474	1	a	   Fun little Time-water   I remember playing the original 7 Wonders game and several of the follow ups in the past. I can't remember where I played them, but I do remember the art style, and building the 'Wonders'. So, let's get into it here...   Pros:  -Game is exactly what it is advertised as: A   Casual   Match 3 Puzzle game. (And by Casual, I mean VERY Casual...) -Nice music -Nice graphics -Runs smoothly on a toaster, or a potato, or a turnip... would run well on a mobile device (which is what it seems best suited for...) -Workers are still as cute and annoying as always, annoying enough to be cute or vice versa -Board rotation (allowed constantly w/o needing to earn it), and needing to move a special piece through a set path, to lock it into a specified location to finish each level is different from many Match 3 games, so a few twists on the standard. -EASY, with a very generous timer and power ups (This is both good and bad... good if you want very casual and easy...)   Cons:  -EASY, possibly TOO easy for anyone looking for a challenge. Timer allows far too much time to really ever feel any imperative to make matches quickly, power ups are almost too easy to get and too plentiful. Totally subjective. - Price - I got a key for free, so I can't complain. But I would NOT recommend this game at full price ($10 USD is way too much), would not recommend unless you get it for 75% off or more.  Game has replayability to a degree, since it does rely on random placement of the tiles you have to match. I have played for a few hours, 15 minutes at a time. I could keep playing this as a pure, casual, relaxed time waster. But it is at the bottom of my list if I want a challenge tbh.  Fun little game, but don't get this thinking it is as 'difficult' as earlier versions of the game, The frustration and challenge were removed in this version. That said, it would be a great game for kids, because the satisfaction of completing levels and successfully building a Wonder are almost guaranteed. But a possible disappointment to fans of earlier versions of the game.  6/10 Overall Would buy at 75% off or better, would never buy at full price of $9.99 USD
2714	1	a	Mole has freedom spoon.
5026	0	a	I got the game for 9 cents, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, but the puzzles never even get to the difficulty level you get in a Games Magazine or a Dell Logic Problem book, and yet are the same sort. Adding to this problem is the inexpert port from what what was clearly an iphone game, the viewing window is far to small, especially for Link-a-Pix, and it's annoying to have to point and drag, rather than more normal methods of, say, scrolling through a list, which is because it intends you to swipe.
3134	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. You are guaranteed plenty of frustration and fun. Co-op is the best!
597	0	a	i played with my friend, had no idea whats going on, and i still won! wouldnt play again.
2838	1	a	Really amazing game to play locally with friends.  Perfect music too.
1994	1	a	I bought this game to play with friends and family. I really enjoyed playing with them, but I found that playing solo or with others it was either super tough or close to unbeatable...  Its a good game to have in your library and when you play... just remember.... TEAM WORK! other wise everyone runs around like group of chickens leaving feathers and what have you all over the place. :)
116	1	a	I must admit, that i got this game because i had 77 cents on steam! But, i din't expect such an addictive and fun game! The video and pictures might make the game seem hard, but it's easy. (at least the controls are) But, there are many so many challenging levels and addictive puzzles, that you want to come back for more! Never makes me bored! It's like the next gen tetris! I highly recommend this game! Get it while it's at it's cheapest! Btw, the music is AWESOME! What's better than placing blocks and watching cubes EXPLODE!
2724	1	a	not expecting to really enjoy this game. but i had a great time with this game!
689	1	a	Who wants to play ticket to ride?
1298	1	a	This game is DLC for Club Penguin and as we all know Club Penguin is the best XxX_PenguinPu$$ySlayer_XxX game and i think that we should all buy this game now  10/10 - Ign 'Ten outta ten, Hundred outta Hundred, best game BEST GAME' - Jontron 
4143	1	a	This scratches too many itches to list.
320	1	a	It's like someone mixed Geometry Dash with Gearcrack Arena It's perfect and don't even get me started on the soundtrack
2589	1	a	Its pretty good. I like the multiplayer quite a bit. It can be hard sometimes but then you realize its actually a pretty strategic game and requires a plan to win. 8/10
1205	1	a	best racing game I ever played.
5369	1	a	Space Invaders but better
3692	1	a	This is a nice short game that gets you in the Halloween mood. The gameplay is nice and even though it is turn based you are still a bit active in having to push certain keys at the right time. It can get a bit repetative but switching up costumes and stamps can change it up a bit. If you looking for a game to play on Halloween this is a good one to get.
2945	1	a	Its a really fun game and great for a Inde game. However from time to time it can give you a couple issues (The Whole Screen is Issuey 
4160	1	a	Still the best match 3 game ever.
4423	1	a	Luxor Amun Rising is the follow up to the original Luxor.   Not much has changed since the last one; you still shoot balls and try to match 3 (+) to score points and stop the caterpillar from reaching your base.  I would rather go with one of the new(er) versions, also the price is pretty steep for a game like this.  Still I recommend the game because it's fun and addicting.
3334	1	a	Costume Quest nails the 'atmosphere' of Halloween night; I can't really explain it, but it gives me those warm, fuzzy, autumnal feelings inside :)  The RPG (the actual game part) stays simple in a good way; the childlike-ness is appropriate to the setting and characters. And the length allows it to be one of those games you can play every year.  (I originally played it on Xbox 360; this PC port has some minor technical issues, but it's not that big of a deal)
4304	1	a	A lightweight, bright and colorful game which doesn't take itself really serious. Basically, you walk around, start small, grow bigger by collecting stuff and collect even bigger stuff.
5297	1	a	this is a bright and cheerful platformer wonderful game for relaxing
4553	1	a	An nice little tower defence game, seems fairly challanging. Not my favourite genre of game, so perhaps you should look elsewhere for a review of gameplay comparisons, but I can say I found them enjoyable. Being able to rotate the orbits of your defence buildings is an interesting mechanic, meaning the placement of your guns takes a little more spacial awareness than it would elsewhere. As far as I played, the maps seems smaller than other games, where you'd place less towers, but as you're expected to move them this is a good thing. Means you have to conisder your placements even more.  Why I love this game is the style. Playing through the story you get 50's style info clips, with a perfectly done voice over, perfect cheesy style, film of bad alien costumes and spaceships hanging from wires, It's lovely, and fits so well. It even has a couple of easter eggs in the films, which was a nice touch. Anyone who has ever smiled at cheesy 1950s sci-fi stuff will enjoy these scenes. You couple that with a like of tower defence and spacial awareness puzzles and you should maybe buy this.
4661	1	a	I haven't played this, and you shouldn't either
1294	1	a	one of the defining games of this generation, Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a game not to be missed. Combining elements from masterpieces such as: Quake, Unreal Tournament, Depression Quest, and Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Penguin's Arena: Sedna's World is a high-octane first person shooter beloved by the most hardcore of FPS players.
1067	1	a	The best thing in this game is clearly the pony mode.
5137	1	a	I like the playstile of the game but it can be improved
4226	1	a	Ninja Reflex just doesn't seem to pack a ton of value, and the repetitive nature of the minigames may grate on you after a while. There's also a sense that this is probably a much better game on the Wii, since that system actually requires you to use your arms like a ninja. Overall, I would say it's 'Okay' about a 6/10.
28	1	a	This isn't really a POSITIVE recommendation. It's more of a 'Beware of buying this' recommendation.  First of all, this game is SUPER easy. I'm thinking it was probably developed with 10-13 year olds in mind. As in, if you have a 10-13 year old, they MIGHT find this game challenging (maybe), but you certainly won't. The only way you'll find this even remotely challenging is if your fingers don't work, for some reason, and you're forced to play with your toes and/or tongue.  That being said, it is kind of cute, though. The levels start out super bland, but as you advance through the levels, the puzzles and gameplay turn more and more clever and amusing, although still not any more challenging.  I'm betting a good gamer could finish the whole game in about half an hour. I guess that's why it's only 5 bucks.  I'd suggest getting it if you're extremely bored and have nothing else to do and want a good way to waste half an hour. DO NOT expect a hard game, though.
342	1	a	Way better than Geometry Wars 3. Music lets you completely zone out into the game.
2477	1	a	The most enjoyable local co-op game in my collection.
537	1	a	Lots of fun. Plays well as an online boardgame and doesn't take long to play but is something you can keep playing and always a little different.
1986	1	a	Best birds' eye view game out there
2132	1	a	This game its sooo awesome.You must to play it if u like to be sneaky
3796	1	a	A mediocre RPG propped up by the considerable charm of the writers of Double Fine Productions. Combat is often agonizingly boring, with almost no options but requiring timed button presses that doesn't let you just blur it all out like you would Final Fantasy or Pokemon battles. Still, the game is adorable and features wonderfully written dialogue all the way down to the NPCs, making you want to explore the world and all of it's crannys, even if the battles frequently make you want to put it down. Hopefully some depth will be added to the upcoming sequel, but until then this is a cute, if slight, addition to the rich Double Fine canon.
440	1	a	One of my favorite arcade games. I swear at it fairly regularly.
83	1	a	Pro : Game graphics are original, the game is challenging enough  Con : Given that the game can be finished within an hour, the price is really high
3237	1	a	Obulis is a neat little puzzle game where you got to get your balls to their spots. To do that you got to basically break the ropes/chains at the right time and in the correct order. Honestly, the game isn't that hard, it just takes a bit of trial and error. But this doesn't mean the game sucks. The game is still great for a puzzle game. It also has new mechanics introduced every now and then which makes the game more interesting and keeps you playing.  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83b_jXI1n4 
1984	1	a	Awesome game! The only flaw in this game that I've noticed is the lack of people playing.
4793	1	a	Quite an innovative and clever game. The humour is a little bit lacking at times, and the plot is one that relies on a character having amnesia, but the puzzles are what makes this game shine. Each dimensional shift ability you gain is presented to you in a thoughtful and well-designed manner, which you then have to master before gaining full control of each, one by one. This makes the learning curve quite appropriate for everybody. The graphical style is cartoony, but it fits the theme of the game perfectly.  Definitely worth getting this game, especially for people who enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal.
2307	1	a	Buy this game now
299	1	a	This game is light casual shooting game. I like this style game. Very Fun! :D
1442	0	a	Why am i writing this.
2175	1	a	Gameplay is excellent. Multiplayer is excellent. Art Design is excellent. This is a purely excellent game!
3068	1	a	It is a very nice stealth-coop game
3078	1	a	If you wanna have a night of fun, Monaco is the true coop experience for with 3 friends. Such a lot of fun!  9/10 this truly deserves it because it is one of the most colorful, fun and just cool.
934	1	a	Really fun game I enjoy the puzzle/ fighting style.
414	1	a	Better than geometry wars
955	1	a	If you like the genre, this is one of the better ones. However, it's very short.
3909	1	a	It was really fun to play
132	1	a	This is a fun 3D puzzler vaguely reminiscent of Tetrisphere and the puzzles from the Android game  Hero Forge .  Check out the demo.
3220	0	a	It has all the depth of a flash game. The music is repetitive. The level design is really annoying when you can't tell if something is in the foreground or the background.  It wasn't buggy, but it was a very shallow game with far too many luck-based time puzzles.
4034	1	a	The best adventure since Blade Runner for me. You do not use your mouse to check every pixel for that one thing you miss. Instead you have to decide how to talk to people, what to mention, what to hide, how to proceed. You don't have to find *the* right solution. You find *your* solution. I got hooked by this one.
3526	1	a	Funny and charming. Really nice art style. Gameplay is pretty simple throughout but as the game itself isn't too long I never got bored. Really love the idea of the gameplay and characters being brought to life by these kids imaginations and their costumes. Just a sweet game, would recommend checking it out.
4424	1	a	Good little casual match 3 game. 89:100
4593	1	a	I feel like i'm playing an Ed Wood movie. This is fantastic and inspiring.
3630	1	a	Not the type of game I usually play but it came in Amazon's Double Fine Bundle and I gave it a go. I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls &amp; combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.  Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game &amp; DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.
925	1	a	Yeehaw, excellent game. It's like Puzzle Quest (yes, again) or Henry Hatsworth. You basically 'control' a girl. You do this by moving and combining orbs. Purple orbs move the girl, red orbs do fire attacks, yellow - wind, green - earth, blue - water. And then you have clear orbs to rid yourself of poison or blindness. There are also spells to protect yourself and there's a meter that builds up while you create combos as well. And... you can collect gears and gems. Gears to upgrade your spells and gems to complete the book you're carrying. It's pretty complex for an 'orb matching' game. If you couldn't already tell; I like it. Worth the money ? Hell yeah.  [Rating: 73/100]
219	1	a	Probably one of the most underrated games on Steam. And it's pretty damn cheap too. Fast-paced gameplay, easy controls, great graphics and light effects, awesome soundtrack... Do you really need more reasons? Go buy it, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it!
403	1	a	This is a unique twin-stick shooter with great visual effects and sound. A really great game for old-school Asteroids fans.
338	1	a	This game is a meth trip and a half 9/10
2407	1	a	pimp co-op, redhead is BANGIN, highly recommend.
1469	1	a	Before I even say anything, I love the guard AI.  'Hey, Pierre. I keep hearing these strange sounds behind me.' 'I know right? It's weird. Everytime I turn around to look at it, all I see is a big gaping hole in the wall.' 'Damn straight. Not only that, but these damn theives keep disappearing.' 'Tell me about it. I'm chasing a guy armed with a sledgehammer, but he runs around a corner and poof! He's gone.' 'Huh. Well, keep a look out for anyone not in a suit or dress. They're obviously imposters.' 'What about that guy in the suit with the rocket launcher? The one aiming at us right now?' 'Nah, he's cool. He's got a suit, see?'  TL;DR: It's fun as hell. Go for it, man. Buy the damn game.
2167	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends! I had it on my Xbox 360 and played it a ton with my brother.  The item pickups and character abilities are cool. The levels are interesting and pretty challenging later on. The art style and music make the game more fun and intense.  I recommend adding this game to your wishlist and that you and a friend buy it during a good sale!
757	1	a	This is a perfect copy of the board game and it is easier to play since the scores are automatically calculated. If you are a fan of the original board game then you should buy this.
3564	0	a	I thought this game was pretty dumb...
303	1	a	Awesome game for chillin
4927	1	a	Made by some of the people who did Portal, going into it this game with very little knowledge of it, I could feel the Portal like elements seeping through the screen as I played along. Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!) With that said, I do recommend this game. It helps wake up your brain and is a good little brain worker for those than enjoy puzzles (like I do)
4339	1	a	Fantastic little time waster if you don't want to invest to much into a game., has a great soundtrack too.
2998	1	a	I like and respect this game. Unfortunately, a lot of the multiplayer community is gone, which leaves the cooperative aspect fairly limited.  Edit: The multiplayer community comes and goes when this game goes on sale.  Why I like it: Gameplay is how you choose to play, which gives a great open environment feel that lets an action game be an adventure game if you want it to be. As you progress into the story, there's a lot of flexibility on how you can play, which even furthers this feeling of open environment. Almost anything can be destroyed or mined through, and can, in some regards, be looked at as a scaled down, 2D version of Payday.  Why I respect it: This game is the embodiment of the idea that not all great games need great models. A lot of the game is basic pixels scaled up. There are no flashy skins or gorgeous maps.   The atmosphere fits the game perfectly, and playing it just feels right. It's hard to explain why this game feels good to play - stealth, fighting, sneaking around, all packed into an 8-bit-style game about robbery.  As a single player experience, it's not bad. But where this game really shines is multiplayer.
2999	1	a	Very fun game if you like robbing stores and running away from cops
4922	1	a	This was alright in a very (appropriately enough) fluffy way... some of the puzzles, particularly in the second and third acts, are interesting and need some thought, but the story and presentation generally are pretty ropey. Eurogamer gave it 5/10 which seemed harsh at times but having finished the game now I think it doesn't stretch much above a 6.
2279	1	a	Fun with friends - be sure to buy the 4-pack! This game is definitely more engaging with company.
2700	1	a	This is a really great game. One of my favourite games of all time. It has Workshop and a big community, but sometimes there is hardly anyone online.
312	1	a	bought for 99 Cent, great little game!  
4197	1	a	I don't like puzzle games. But I love this game. It is the best puzzle match three game ever made. Screw the sequels. This is totally worth ten bucks or if you happen to catch it on sale. HOURS of fun!
1106	0	a	Pretty much a phone game to it's core, barely done any improvements on PC version if any at all. Resolution is upscaled pretty badly and the meniu is just eye mauling. However it's pretty good for little kids, it's a mobile game, but it's still blows mobile version on 24 inch monitor in their mind.   Either way would not recommend spending more than 1$ on this.
3783	1	a	Very cute game! Love being able to become the costume!
4645	1	a	I built stuff. I tested it. I blew sh!t up. I fixed stuff. I made sh!t. I took a sh!t. I was happy about my work. I completed the task. I did all the things the Professor wanted me to do. I blew everything up. I went home and gave this game a good rating because I can blow stuff up. I, as a long time buyer, bought this was first released for the PC many years ago. I have purchased it once more for no need to use the disk. I have the disk. It smelled like plastic.
4103	1	a	I like this game so much, but now I have a mac PC, by the way I play this game at iPad &gt;.&lt;
1269	1	a	i got this game in a bundle so i was sceptical about it i thought it was going to be a rip of of club penguin or somethin (not that i like that game) but as soon as i played it i entered a world of ragdoll phisics , slaping phisics and state of the art rocket jumping,not to mention the catchy music.
13	1	a	Nice little game, good getaway from all these AAA titles. Also, its my first perfected game on Steam :D
4368	1	a	If you are a huge Katamari Damacy fan like me then you will LOVE this game to death. You first start off in what appears to be a big garden. 'Woah, this place is pretty big! I don't think it can get any bigger!' WRONG! The level only gets bigger and bigger moving into a yard and then a whole suburb! Well, the levels aren't THAT big but they will surprise and impress you by how big they get compared to the start. The only down part to this game is how short it is. There is about 12 levels total and the game can be completed in one sitting.  ANYWAYS, this game is totally worth buying if you like Katamari Damacy or you just happen to find something else that draws you to this game. It's unique, fun and worth a try! 9.5/10
4073	1	a	I've bought and started playing this game like 3-4 years ago and then abandoned it until recently. It was something new and fresh in the field of 'match 3 gems' games. It had story, fantasy background, skills, spells. And then it got even overwhelming. Too many stuff to know, handle. Too many side quests, too many spells, skills, items, town management, mounts, followers, etc. Yeah, you didn't have to do all, but if you wanted to be good and fight even more powerful foes, you had to improve on all fields. So i've got tired and didn't want to launch it again. Even more annoying thing was, that while traveling through a huge map of a world you didn't only had to confront creatures tied to the quests, but on those paths between towns and towers there were same creatures and they were constantly randomly respawning. So if you wanted to go across the map to solve some quest, you had to fight them over and over again and then on your way back.. It became boring and frustrating very fast.  But after completing Gyromancer and not liking it much i've decided to give this another try and finish a story. So i did. Though the last boss was haaaard. And i had to go to the map and grind for more experience, doing every side quest i could and improving skills, getting better items, etc. And finally i've beat him!  The story was fine. Mechanics are interesting. So i give it a Yes, but i won't be getting back to it, and i hear that sequel is even more boredom and grinding without a decent story, so i'll probably pass.
3786	1	a	An adorable blend of JRPG gameplay and cartoon-style adventure.
3584	1	a	
1619	1	a	super great for wasting a few hours with a couple homies.
1089	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a straightforward but fun physics puzzler. You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.  The risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.  I'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.
2226	1	a	Hackersaretooover-poweredforyoufriend. 10/10
1964	1	a	IDK WHAT THIS GAME IS
1093	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:  Pros:   â¦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game) â¦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level) â¦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you donât like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably wonât find this as fun as I did) â¦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game) â¦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus) â¦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level) â¦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game) â¦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game) â¦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons youâll get your $5 worth)   Cons:  â¦ No Steam Cloud Storage (Iâve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I shouldâve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesnât make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldnât be on Steam) â¦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a â+moreâ menu. The â+more+ menu doesnât lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once youâve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didnât mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the â+moreâ menu) â¦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels donât always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesnât explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)  â¦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you canât actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why itâs even called DLC) â¦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You canât close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing) â¦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work) â¦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable) â¦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you canât actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing) â¦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesnât act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesnât function properly) â¦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they donât function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is âTestâ which shouldnât be the case)  Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I canât recommend this game. I canât recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.
3467	1	a	A great little RPG game with a candy bag full of character and charm, if your looking for an RPG but don't want to spend 60 odd hours to finish it then this is not a bad choice.
135	1	a	This Was An Addicting Game
1377	1	a	quite alot of fun, more so then i was expecting i suspect this game would shine in a LAN, the bots AI isnt to bad and its got a scaled difficulty level few different modes and ER MAH GAWD customise your penguin! totally had a space pengiun then a cowboy!
2699	1	a	Monaco is a wonderful game, especially if you get your friends playing with everyone on voice chat. If you're looking for a simple yet complex multiplayer title to sink some time into, this is your game.
5190	1	a	We may never see dungeon keeper 3 thanks to EA, but if you love DK series, this is one of those games you should play.  The game is simply and fun to play, just like DK; except this time you get to play with dwarves.   Sorry lad, no mistress this time!
3430	1	a	great animations, and fun, until it gets repetitive, still good though 7/10
2410	1	a	I love this game but can never get 3 people to play!
5332	1	a	It's like Space Invaders, but with a few additions that make it feel fresh and new. Not as good as Space Invaders Extreme, but worth checking out if you like these kinds of games.
3534	0	a	What do Tim Schaefer and Adolf Hitler have in common? They both burned millions and never accomplished their end goals.
3770	1	a	Everything about this game is amazing. All the costumes are amazing and change up your strategy in battles. Difficulty level is just right and the game is hilarious.
997	0	a	damn thing wont start!!!!!!!
2641	1	a	Only buy if u have someone to play with
2101	1	a	Strategy, cunning, craziness
2014	1	a	This is a good video game
5278	1	a	This game is our goal to prevent racism in our society.
57	1	a	This is an enjoyable indie game experience. Nice puzzles and graphics. Was very short though.
5274	1	a	Great idea. Quite impressive what you can do with only two ways to interact with things.
354	1	a	Best twin-stick gunner crack around!
2208	1	a	It's okay. I wouldnt pay more than a cheap sale price for it (I paid like $1.50 or something). It's a top down game w/ pixelated graphics and it's very simple. Theres 4 classes (locksmith, etc.) and you do these missions where you traverse through structures of traps and bad guys to achieve goals like getting an item or saving some guy.  I don't want to rate it poorly b/c it didn't dissapoint me. My expectations were low given it was a cheap game, but overall compared to what other games are available and what you could be spending your time playing, this is pretty boring.  
841	1	a	If you're a fan of the board game then this is for you! If you've never heard of the board game... then guess what! This is for you! Its a fantastic adaptation of a fantastic game and I honestly can't say enough good things about it!
3725	1	a	I really enjoy playing this. It looks childish and it kind of feels childish too but its a nice adventure and not as easy as you'd expect.
1651	1	a	u git 2 b a bank robber my life long dream :)))))))
4889	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
4841	1	a	Best puzzle game since Portal (1), story not as good, but gameplay is awsome!
803	1	a	Addictive!!!
4948	1	a	If you liked the original Portal, you'll love this as well. Who knew couch surfing could be so mind-blowingly fun?
1345	1	a	BUY THIS PART OF THE ACTION INDIE PACK I love this game i mean..your a customizable penguin whos main goal is to BLOW THE HECK OUT OF OTHER PENGUINS  10/10
385	1	a	Amazing twin stick arcade game like Geometry Wars, with sweet 8 bit music in it. Utterly addictive. Works with 360 controller on PC too.
2354	1	a	Its great with ranch.
130	1	a	66/100 Colour matching game, more of a 3D version, wish there where more stuff such as power ups or w/e.
4729	1	a	Portal-grade quality. Don't miss it!
3383	1	a	Such a cute laid back game. Worth a play through. I finished everything. It was fun and worth a try for a simple RPG.
4465	1	a	Samantha could be Indiana Jones' relative (but she is not). :) I really enjoyed to play this little adventure of hidden object searching puzzle game. :) Setting is really nice, graphics are lovely. Puzzles are not too complicated, but some of them make you think of what to do next. I like the scanner option that shows you the shape of the item from the list once you click on its name. And if you make too many mistakes the scanner breaks for few seconds. I had really not many moments where I had to use the hints (which you collect by searching for a thunder symbol). I won't spoil anything, but I will just say that I really like the end of the game, so I really recommend to play it to see it. ;)
3493	0	a	I don't want to hate on this game. I love the story. I love the characters. I love the dialogue. I love the art style.  I hate grindy JRPG combat.  Where 75% of your game time is spent in combat, it should be engaging; not a throwback to the NES era. After my fourth fight, I found myself avoiding enemies whenever possible. Not because of the difficulty, but because each fight is another 2-3 minute delay from that quest item that I was looking for in the game world. I challenge anyone to convince me that this style of combat makes the game fun.  If there were a quarter as many enemies, and you used puzzle-solving to overcome them, this game would gel a lot better.
2773	1	a	Buy this game at your own Peril!
5036	0	a	-
4388	1	a	fun but short game
5294	1	a	Super cool game for a kid. My son have played it for hours and hours at 5-6 years old. He needed help in some places, but have managed many thing on his own. It's non-agressive, mind and logic challenging and very pretty. Good game for my son to play at.
560	1	a	There's really no way you can go wrong with Ticket to Ride.  Firstly, the game is brilliant in it's simplicity. There's only three types of moves you can make (alright, a couple others in additional maps, but the point is pretty much the same) and yet it's endlessly fun to play. It's a brilliant adaptation of the board game that, for once, does the original justice.   Multiplayer adds great depth and infinite replayability. While the lobby and game set up could use some polishing, it doesn't /need/ it. They work! Plus, you can use the pass-and-play to practice against yourself from as many players as you add to the game. You can play bots. Still so much replayability, just as always the AI will never live up to the fun of playing other people, most likely. I found something oddly dulling about it, even before I tried multiplayer, and I'm usually not a multiplayer person.  This is one board game you do not want to pass up, and this rendition of it is just as worthwhile, plus cheaper and easier to get a game going!  
721	1	a	Ticket To Ride is one of the most enjoyable board games I've played in a long time!
2912	1	a	I think some people will like this game but its not for me. I only played about 10 missions and it just didnt grab me in any meaningful way. I dont think its a bad game so it stills gets a thumbs up. Its kind of like Hotline Miami with less challenge and tension.
3306	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game.   Story: Funny. Search and rescue. Fight the evil one and monsters on a turn based fight .  You will dress up as a robot, a vampire... and each of them will have powers to use against the monsters.   Music: Not the best I have seen but... it's ok.  Game: Isometric view except the fights.   When to play it? Halloween will be the best moment xD   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552931418 
61	1	a	Short and sweet.
3823	1	a	Great game but too short even with the DLC it's less than 8h. I suppose some of the Trick or Treating aspect could've got a bit dull going forward but otherwise more costumes would've been ace.
1230	1	a	This is one of the best open-world survival-horror FPS that I've ever had the incredible fortune of being gifted over steam by a creepy old dude with an eyepatch. Be prepared to experience dynamic combat in the frigid antarctic, and team up with your friends in revolutionary cooperative penguin gameplay.   Would recommend if held at gunpoint Banana Pudding/10
5262	1	a	worth
4277	1	a	fun. If you like Katamari Damacy you'll probably enjoy this. It is short however.
3438	1	a	It's a fun little overlooked game, especially for people who would enjoy exploring and collecting items in a colourful Halloween setting. Get it on sale and you can't go wrong.
5414	1	a	Nostalgia city with this game. A retro arcade 2-D shooter that's super fun and addicting to play. The pixelated aesthetic of the game brings back memories and is a refreshing trip down memory lane you didn't know you wanted until you play it. It's simplistic in every way, but a blast to play none the less. Give it a go! It's a new age space invaders you know you want to try!
938	1	a	This game is fun. Match up and break rows/columns of jewels to do pretty much anything.
1274	1	a	Stupid fun that never gets old.
1890	1	a	Good story but only a few hours of fun. 7/10
1958	1	a	Monaco is a great stealth action-packed game. You take the role of 8 different thieves with very different gameplay through two campaigns and great number of challenges. The gameplay is solid. While you can pretty much force your way through the first levels, you really must avoid getting caught later on. The difficulty of the second campaign is quite hard, with a lot of achivements to go for. While the game is great in solo, it really shines in coop multiplayer, where each player control a different thief. There's also versus multiplayer, which is great fun too.   Monaco also has a very fitting soundtrack and a very interesting storyline, mostly because of the way it is told. For those interested, there's also a great deal of community maps made with the very complete level editor in the game. The game recently recieved an update consisting of a reworked campaign and a zombie mode with new enemies.   If you like stealth games, monaco really is a blast. I especially recommend it if you can find friends to play with.
3559	0	a	I wanted to be a sexy lion. This game doesn't have sexy lions
1195	1	a	Sequel please Bioware has some competition 260/420 would smoke again
4752	1	a	It's alright. It's like Portal's quirky derpy little brother.  7/10
142	1	a	Played 4 hours - i am a HARDCORE player, with 7 hours of gameplay you get the title of ELITE player in AMD gaming evolved.  Still it's nice - i enjoy the meditation mode. Recommend to buy it when it's on SALEs ONLY.
2772	1	a	Overall an insanely fun little time waster, it gets more entertaining the more friends or people you play with, can't complain!
1087	1	a	A total laugh for 5 minutes of spare time, which often turns into much more. My kids also love it!
4175	1	a	Puzzle-rific! I'm addicted to the simple gameplay intertwined with well-thought RPG elements. Pure fun and found on sale for only a buck!
2963	1	a	There is a hidden dinosaur following you.
5161	1	a	Where do I even start? This is is expansive and has such rich and vivid storyline! You start off as a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sucking the commander's â¥â¥â¥â¥ so you can get promoted but then Orcs come and kill eveyone but with your quick wit and huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ you defend them off the commander dies YOU BECOME THE COMMANDER!!!! You get to lead a whole midget settlement underground and fight off evil â¥â¥â¥â¥ like hindus and orcs (no joke they hate hindus). WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR A â¥â¥â¥â¥ ON A CHEST? GO BUY IT AND LIVE LIKE A DWARF IN THIS FIRST PERSON ATTACK/ DEFEND GAME/ RPG!
4432	1	a	The hours I've put into this game far outweights the price I paid for it. I got it on sale on a whim not know much about it. I saw from the screenshots the basic gameplay. I've put 25 hours into the game and while that might not seem like much given the gameplay and how much one 'level' lasts it is a long time. I've beaten it on easy, normal, hard and I'm now working on very hard. It is one of those types of games you can easily be playing forever.
2217	1	a	The saying 'Hitman meets Pac-Man' is somewhat accurate for this game.  You play as one of many robbers, each with their own special traits. From there, you sneak though the level, using your ability and stealth to pick up as much loot scattered around the level before getting your main prize and escaping.  While it can be played single player, co-op is much better. Instead of just one person with four lives, it can go up to four players, working together.
886	1	a	Oh yeah! Hit me up.. A great translation of a marvelous table top game!!!
2317	1	a	I really enjoy playing this game.
4979	1	a	Fun little game that is remenicent of Portal. Challenging puzzles that make you feel good once you solve them. Story is okay but nothign special. Feels like it would be designed for kids, but may be a bit too complex for them. Might be more enjoyable with a controller, sometimes the keyboard controls are hard to use with some of the platforming elements. Overall, a good game.
1002	1	a	Fun game, smooth gameplay made me really enjoy it. just 'WASD' , delivering the 'animals' to zoo as quickly as possible.   7/10 
2796	1	a	poop face
2255	1	a	fun game but it is more fun when you have friends playing with you.
4192	1	a	Very addictive, though it seems that sometimes the computer is cheating...
4653	1	a	Played it a lot as a kid, it's plain fun and you get to blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up.
232	1	a	I enjoyed this game quite a bit, its very reminicent of a certain geometric game that has you shooting colorful shapes, while this is more in depth than the PC port of that mini game, the sequel to the minigame, is better than this one, but this is the best you're going to get because the publisher does not want to spend the money to port the sequel over from xbox 360, which is a shame because I enjoyed the hell out of it.  This game is different in that, there is a 'leveling' system that tells you how difficult the game will be as you progress, the game has a great soundtrack and interesting enemy types, I just wish there was more variety in the game types, and weapons for the ship.
5290	1	a	Don't be fooled by it's colorful and child-like appearance. Toki Tori 2+ is awesome!  Toki Tori 2+ will have you smiling ear-to-ear, as you play a fat little bird who sings and butt-slams his way through his colorful world.I haven't felt this platforming magic since playing Super Mario Bros 2 or Yoshi's Island. It is a patient side-scroller. There's no crazy jumps or wild enemies that you have to avoid. It keeps it simple by letting you explore, find treasure, and figure out how the world works with only a handful of actions. The visuals are really pretty.   This is definitely a call-back to classic platforming.
802	1	a	Love the boardgame, and the virtual game is just as fun. I think the AI is a bit too easy, but I might have it set too low. I haven't been able to get a networked game to run, so I can't comment on that. It's worth getting the extra maps, I think. Fun little quick game!
1981	1	a	Pros: -Extremely fun -Nice gamemodes -4 Player coop -Incredibly nice map designes -Good ai -Nice graphics for a retro game Cons: -The feel when you left a coin behind -You can't understand wtf is going on on 4 player coop  
632	1	a	Great adaptation of a board game to the screen.
189	1	a	I've owned  Waves  since its release in 2011 &amp; I still come back to for a few rounds from time to time. My original review written back then was pretty hyped, basically chanting slogans like 'I'm Hooked', 'It's Uber!', 'Grab it now!'  (As you can tell, I was pretty impressed!) .   In a retrospective  (&amp; more balanced)  look,  Waves  boasts solid mechanics, simple design &amp; challenging arenas/modes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity though, this game is hardcore! The small circular  'Neo-Cyberspace'  arena to navigate, along with the swiftly increasing viruses, bugs  (&amp; other strange spawners)  that trigger  wave after wave  make this a true challenge to survive for any extended period. This difficulty can be off putting to some, but I really enjoy the intense gameplay - it keeps me coming back .. sweaty palms and all!  Being a twin-stick shooter you are obviously able to move &amp; shoot independently on each analog stick, but in Waves you also have a slow-mo  'Bullet Time'  rechargeable power-up which gives you those split seconds needed to make an escape or clear some spawners when things just become too hectic. You can use this strategically to boost your scores too, such as getting a combo to enable your timed  'mega bomb'  or get up close &amp; double your points with the  'Point Blank'  bonus. Movement &amp; aiming are fluid &amp; these additional tactical features become instinctive to use after a very short time playing.  Enemies are distinct, visually, clearly identifiable &amp; have complementing attack moves. They have some cool mechanics, although you will learn there patterns before long  (there aren't a lot of different enemies) . The sheer numbers in later waves &amp; the combinations of enemies used negates their relative simplicity. When you experience these large number of enemies with the vast amount of effects &amp; action happening on screen, it can be hard to keep track of your location. This is the only downside I have found overall, and is really due to having such nice graphical effects  (take the good with the bad I guess  :)  ) .  Of all the modes, the classic  Survival  mode remains my favourite, although there are another six unique modes also available to tackle. Some are harder than others. There is the  Challenge  mode offering unique puzzle like waves to clear,  Crunch Time  offers short burst 3min timed runs &amp;  Bombing Run  where you have no guns, only bombs to defend yourself with. Destroy the Cubes as quickly as possible in  Rush , try the  âRun'n'Gunâ   Chase  mode where you need to hit the spawning markers within 5 secs to continue &amp; the newest mode call  Hold  where you have a small moving circle to stay within to enable your weapons which I find perhaps the toughest of them all!  Below is straight gameplay footage of Survival mode - A taste of what  Waves  is like in action:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325677941   All these great modes, enemy types &amp; overall challenge add up to a lot of replayability. When you wrap that up in some smooth controls, gorgeous visual eye candy, pumping electro musical score  (that has that tendency to get stuck in your head!) , add online &amp; friends leaderboards, a swag of interesting achievements &amp; a big picture friendly design, you really have something special. You can see a lot of time has been put in to balance out, refine &amp; improve the gameplay by the one-man development team @  Squid In A Box .   Waves  has held strong against the tide of new twin-stick shooter titles over the years, remaining one of the best available on Steam. If you missed this when it came out, itâs certainly worth a look now its half the price. It's great quality &amp; great value!  Just as much fun to play now as it was when I got it!

3247	1	a	Obulis is a pleasant, casual puzzle game, based upon little spheres transferring kinetic energy to one another, until each end up exactly where they're supposed to be: the pot (or sometimes, flower) of the same colour. There's something very calming about this premise, and the graphical design as well as sound direction really bolster this effect. The game opts to create a soft wall of sound out of sound effects appropriate to the setting, rather than plaster the levels with repetitive music. The result is a game that is a pleasure to play, for short bursts or long stretches.  Many of the puzzles do require precise timing, to varying degrees of difficulty, and some of the puzzles are difficult enough to become frustrating. However, when the solution is finally completed, it is often very elegant, and there is a great sense of satisfaction putting the complex little machinery into action, observing it working in perfect synchronicity, and watching the balls fall one by one into their respective pots, with a satisfying 'clink'.  It doesn't sound like much, but this atmosphere that the game fostered, has drawn me back to finish it three times. It's definitely worth a try.
1464	0	a	Surprisingly fun for the premise, but the lack of other people playing and the lack of any real soundtrack prevent me from recommending this at full price.
590	1	a	Great implementation of the board game! Very nice and user friendly. Wish it had all the newer maps (only has the classic ones with their variants (US, Europe, Switzerland, and Asia)).
3211	0	a	Seeing it in my library makes me sad.
2345	1	a	Bought on recommendation from a friend. So much fun to play! I mainly play online because by myself is a little boring but once you're in a team and chatting away it's a lot of fun.
2200	1	a	Yh i recomend this game to everyone, i think people who have played stealth â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ will like this game.
4028	1	a	great story with an awesome RPG-like fighting style
875	1	a	I have the boardgame version of this game, and it's really fun to play but when you don't have anyone to play with it's great to play against your computer.
2514	1	a	very fun game if you want to play something with a friend
1315	1	a	This game supports animal abuse, 10/10.
2688	1	a	Really great!
237	1	a	Great shoot 'em up with a similar voice as GLaDOS, great music and a British humour. Check the demo and buy it!
1064	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.
2758	1	a	This little coop game is amazingly addictive and suprisingly suspenseful! It has a charming story and doesn't get boring easily.
3432	1	a	I've first played Brutal Legend, and now Costume Quest. Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings. Costume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid!  Essencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister.  So, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way. That sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.   The game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat.  In combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks.  Each costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them.  There are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle. You have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.  I didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow. To its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.  Outside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests.  There are quite a few 'secrets' and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!  Besides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat. The various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!   The graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for. Music was up there as well, really enjoyed it!  Most of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!   So... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well. But that's my biggest complain with this game.  Other than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.  It looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively.  It's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist! I'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!
1264	1	a	The FPS experience in this game greatly surpasses any modern shooter you would play today. Incredible gameplay mechanics with interactive glacier melting enviornment. If you are looking for the ultimate FPS, this is it.
594	0	a	Stupid game, doesn't follow it's own game logic. Hard to play the game that way!
3069	1	a	Beautiful game, 100% worth.
2634	1	a	Excellent when playing co op, less so when solo, but still a great romp nonetheless.
2681	1	a	very nice game 
1634	1	a	This is by far my favourite 2d game i have ever played, i find the graphics are very easy to look at and both the gameplay &amp; storyline are great :)
4057	0	a	Just DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ...........Stay away from it
1435	0	a	Come on, even the people that made this know it's terrible
3166	1	a	Are you looking for an exciting chain breaking, ball throwing, flower petal action?WELL THIS THE GAME FOR YOU!! This game is hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and when it comes to throwing blue balls into those blue flower petals. This game is so ridiculously hard i've only beaten six levels. 10/10 if you're up for a hard â¥â¥â¥â¥ challenge.
4228	1	a	This is THE training gane to have if you are new to FPS's
5218	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is so much more different than the first game. There's still puzzles but the main focus seems to be exploration and collecting items. The controls are simple, directional movement, chirp and stomp. Two actions but, surpirsingly, the game is mechanically deep. Not a lot is explained and it's all up to the player to figure out how to navigate the world. The puzzles are straightforward in the beginning and get more difficult as you progress. You may get stuck more than a few times especially if you're going for 100% completion.  Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes simple but challenging puzzle games. See how much you can manage without a guide. There's a lot to do and no hand-holding.
2396	1	a	Very fun stealth game
3763	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those games that shows what Tim Schafer and the rest of Double Fine are capable of pulling off time and again: a fun, child-ish game with intereseting mechanics and crap-tons of easter eggs and references for fans of the studio.  The Good: -The storyline is genuinely funny -Character interactions are decent -Easter eggs out the â¥â¥â¥  The Bad: -The combat is fairly bland. It stays at just about the same level of complexity throughout, and it's almost impossible to lose against any enemies outside of maybe the final two bosses -Lack of a map means that, for objectives like trick or treating every house, you can get stuck for a long time trying to figure out which spot you haven't visited yet.  Overall: This game is well worth the 10 dollars.
3016	1	a	Monaco is a neon-blooded marriage of Pac-Man and Thief, a grand tribute both to 1920s silent comedy capers and to modern-day heist movies. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Keystone Cops, played out top-down in a world of living blueprints. It's a criminal take on Laurel and Hardy, except with a four-man band instead of the dysfunctional duo. By and large, Monaco is one of those rare games that somehow stay magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right or your mission has turned into an eight-lane car crash.  'Monaco stays magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right.' And crashes of the non-software-related variety will happen in abundance. With Monaco's minimal approach to player guidance, the only way you're going to figure anything out is through trial and disaster. Have a Hacker (one of the game's many playable characters) interact with a power outlet and watch as sensors go out and security cameras turn friendly. Walk across a red panel and discover that there are, indeed, pressure plates connected to the security system.  The missions are all performed to a similar tune: get in, get the prize, get out. Or, in some instances, simply get out. You start in a safe area of the level, surrounded by items that you can take along with you. Once you've selected your weapon (or non-combat item of choice), it is your prerogative to determine what 'getting in' will actually entail. Do you cut through a queue at the local nightclub or do you sneak through a locked door on the other side? Though all the levels operate in largely the same way, there's sufficient diversity in the contents of each to make every playthrough outright enthralling. Should you circle around the main area of the map and inch towards the safe on the third floor, or do you take a quick detour through the guard-infested inventory room? (Hint: don't do that second one.) Your choice, your years behind bars, monsieur.
5101	1	a	This game will eat large chubnks of your life before you realise it but I found it to be creatively rerwarding. It's a bit like a very simplified Sims with Dwarves in a Minecraft world. Also there's a tech tree inside each level and one outside. The one outside does really help determine your playstyle but the one inside the level will be completely filled out about halfway through any given level. It's a good game for building floating, 3D gardens and learning how to conduct strategic tunnel sieges. But the traps are rather useless and hard to implement. Easier just to block things off. See what I did there. Play the game and you'll get pun. That's all I can promise.
3010	1	a	If you can read this i reccomend buying this game!!!!!!!
5474	1	a	If your a fan of Space Invaders than this is the game for you.  Think of this as Space invaders MK.2 on LSD. The music is good and the graphics are enough to keep me playing alone. The game play is solid and continues to get more difficult as levels progress. There are Bosses and tons of levels.  For $10 you cant go wrong (but I got this game for 50 cents with a coupon :3), still would have paid full price for it though 
1208	0	a	.
760	1	a	Absolutely love this game, I would recommend this game to everyone. I first got my wife addicted to it, then we bought the actual boardgame (US map) and everyone we would play with ended up absolutely loving it. This game is a must, but if you have others to play with, I prefer the physical board game. 10/10
3675	1	a	After trying Stacking and being disappointed, I wasn't sure if I'd like Costume Quest. Psychonauts was good - if not limited by platforming - and Costume Quest is right up there with it.  The style is a charming, delightfully-quirky one that puts you in the role of a child on Halloween, trick or treating with their sibling. The pace spirals beautifully until you're facing off against giant monsters in a twisted maze, firing rockets.  One of this game's seeling points is its fantastic humour; like Psychonauts it puts you in the position of a child and throws referential and meta humour at you, barrelling on whether you get the jokes or not. This is one of its strongest aspects as it's funny to those who get it and doesn't slow down those who don't.  The combat is surprisingly deep considering the simple controls and is very balanced...except for the final boss in the extra adventure, Grubbins On Ice. The final boss of that doesn't follow the rules established in all the rest of the combat. Despite this little hiccough, it is a easy to grasp, QTE-based combat with scope for personal preference.  One last thing to note is that it isn't very long; 9 hours to 100% it with all the achievements. There are shorter games out there and there are certainly longer games, but this is one of the funniest.
2172	1	a	Great, fun party game. If you want some awesome stealth and heist-themed gameplay but not the crazy, fast-paced, teamwork-is-essential gameplay like the Payday series, give this game a try.  Story: Main story is short, however there are other side missions that take place after the main game is completed, as well as custom missions you can find, adding replayability.  Gameplay: Emphasizes on stealth a lot, but not always required, so pick the character based on your play style and go to town. Enemies can overwhelm you rapidly but if you know what you're doing, you can get away reasonably quick.  Controls: Absolutely simple, with the theme of 'within reach.' Moving with WASD and using gadgets with the Spacebar or Left Mouse button? Couldn't get easier.  In all, very fun game that's easy to get into, with easy achievements for the new guy, to the hard ones for the hunter who wants it all.
4111	1	a	One of the best games ever made. I probably have hundreds of hours logged on it before I re-purchased it for my steam library.
3282	1	a	Best puzzle game i have played so far in my life.Although i am no fan of the genre this one is very well made and the physics work prety well.It also features some phenomenal levels which will really challenge your mind.
4101	1	a	Classic that started the genre. Graphics are dated compared to Gems of War, but the gameplay is still there.
4092	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS CHEATING GAME. I LOVE IT.
5237	1	a	not a bad game at all. a very fun game and worth it if on sale.
2524	1	a	Nice one,just buy and enjoy it. XD
5033	1	a	Easy game to start. Easy way to get a perfect game under your belt. Achievements are great considering you only have to do 10 of each.
2185	1	a	As Monaco is only really for the dwindling few its various characthers and missions keep it interesting and plentyful. If you're into co-op games with a twist I recommend purchasing the 4 pack and start taking on some missions!
1128	0	a	Do i even need to say anything about this one ?
5396	1	a	A really cool Space Invaders style game. Puppygames are masters of modern retro styled games and although this one isn't my favourite from them it's still really playable and fun. You can upgrade your rig with all sorts of upgrades and attachments with cash you've collected. Definately worth playing.
2333	1	a	Its great fun if you have friends to play it with... If you have friends to play it with
4723	1	a	You should play the game AT LEAST because of John de Lancie's voiceacting. You know, it is kinda funny to listen to Discord's advices. AND evenmore we have an awesome trans-dimensional puzzle, that will test your wits!
1652	1	a	This game is, hands-down, fantastic so far. Both the classic and zombie mode are fantastic.
987	1	a	Essentially the same game as the first but in a different location. Simple puzzle-sovling and hidden objects gameplay.
5183	1	a	a pretty fun game if you like stradegy games 
1819	1	a	Smash walls, get paid. Need more? Hella mad co-op. Get in on it.
844	1	a	Despite the hype and negative comments I bought the game as an amusement when I was board and needed something quick and light hearted. is it perfect no, but I find it fun to play and for a few bucks compaired to the boxed version it gives me what I need.   It has been fine on my Windows 10 machine....
3405	1	a	Let me just say that I am a massive fan of Double Fine. I love that they push as far as they can in the game medium to see what they can do.  This game is fun. Especially if you enjoyed the SNES era RPG battle system.
2619	1	a	Crack safes! Hack stuff! Sneak past French-speaking security guards!  Recommended to play with friends though, going solo is a recipe for disaster.
3968	1	a	A fun game, despite itself.  The combat is boring, the quests are repetitive. You will only end up using a few of the costumes once you've figured out a good build...  But darn it! This game is just too charming! I want to hate it! But it is just so loveable!  So, my recommendation: Buy it on sale. (Last sale it sold for $0.99)  
2696	1	a	Not bad, confusing at times. 8.8/10
428	1	a	Fun game and not too expensive. Graphics seem to drag on my card pretty hard though.
2496	1	a	This is a great game if you want a fun challange you can play as a variity of skilled players
4086	1	a	Take a classic puzzle game (think Bejeweled), add RPG elements and a plot progression where all battles are carried out through that puzzle sequence where both players alternate while sharing the board, and you've got the general idea of what Puzzle Quest is.  Puzzle Quest is a silly wrapper around the puzzle game which ends up strangely compelling - you get special abilities your character can use which use 'mana' depending on which colored jewels you combine. You collect experience and money by matching those, and deal damage to your opponent via lining up skulls. Victory is defeating your enemy before your own health runs out. It manages to take an already addictive formula and make it even more addictive.  I was first exposed to this game via the Nintendo DS game, and honestly think that the game is more suited to a mobile platform than to the PC, but the game is still a lot of fun here. Check it out if you haven't.
4202	1	a	A fun and challenging game bringing together the best of Bejeweled and a JRPG.
1388	1	a	One of my favourite childhood games,only buy it if you wanna play with friends,otherwise you will get bored really fast because there aren't any servers online,only hosted by players.
268	1	a	I feel this game is perfect for Pick-up-and-plays before work or as a reward for studying in the Crunch Time mode but is also an enjoyable progression curve for durational play. The soundtrack is active and the gameplay sucks you in. I love playing this game once a day so far!
1733	1	a	Its a game!
5053	1	a	Great game :-)
4968	1	a	With puzzles and overall art direction set to amuse, it is quite the conundrum why many have yet to play it.
1551	1	a	Im drunk while writing this review so this game is a 10/10 Edit: Now that I'm sober this game isn't that great 7/10
1365	1	a	Do we like penguins? - Yes we do Do we love throwing rotten fish and bombs at other penguins? - Yes we do Do we miss our childhood and wish to play games that bring the feeling back? - Yes we do DO we wish to waste hours on games like these and then mourn about it ? - Yes we do  then this is the game for you give it a try :)
2312	1	a	7/10 Overall Monaco was a highly enjoyable coop top down stealth game. This game blew my expectations sky high as the combat, soundtrack, and graphics blew me away. This is a sturdy game for all to enjoy.
3413	1	a	this game is really fun!!!!!
1962	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO MUCH FUN But the real thing So its alot of fun, even singleplayer, good way to let time fly 100000000000000000/10
1884	1	a	Me and my friends robbed everyone inside a whole building. In order to escape, we had to rob a car, so me and another fella got inside a common-ish looking car while the other guy was outside looking at a nice looking lamborghini. 'No, since we're at it, let's take this one instead' - He said So the 2 of us left the common-ish looking car and attempted to steal the lamborghini. The alarm went off. We all got shot in the face. Started over, and damn right we stole the lamborghini!  This game is pure evil. 10/10 would die again
74	1	a	I understand the negative reviews. 6 bucks IS a fair amount for such a short game, it's only about an hour and a half long, and its more of a setup for a yet to be released sequal called Lumino City. Despite all of this, I reccomend getting this game on sale. The art style is unique, and the paper art style of the characters clashing with the realistic background is actually very appealing to the eye. It is one of the cutest games I've ever played. Even more unique are the puzzles. I would recommend not using a guide to this game, it makes completing the game that much more satisfying, Overall, If you can get this game on sale, or you are willing to spend $6 on ad hour and a half of gameplay, I would definatley pick it up
3114	1	a	Amazing game with friends, solo is ok my hours are short here but on console i played around 400 hours ish
4106	1	a	I hate games of chance/luck. The only games of chance that should be played are games like Poker. At least with Poker you have a chance of making money. With this game you have a 100% chance of losing money, and as a bonus, 100% lost time.
1591	1	a	This game, if you play it with friends, is absolutely amazing. Such fun, screaming at each other and laughing your â¥â¥â¥ off, truly spectacular.
2380	1	a	I remember my Nintendo and Sega Genesis games - 90% of them had the option to play co-op (Player 2 PRESS START!!!). Now, if you want a co-op game, you have to search - and that's very sad.  So, if you're looking for a co-op game - you can easily grab this. It will soothe all your co-op needs.
369	1	a	A game that would be perfectly at home on Xbox, very polished and addictive. Good stuff
1542	1	a	What The Hell Is Going On? 10/10
5050	1	a	If you are looking for a traditional puzzle game for your PC, this is the sequel to Puzzler World 2. Don't expect any fancy graphics, 3D or soundtrack. This time there's 9 different puzzle types and over 1200 puzzles. Plenty of achievements to work towards to - one seems to be broken however. This will provide hours of fun for the casual puzzler.
2813	1	a	I've wanted this game for quite a while. It's a pretty fun stealth game. There are several characters, each with it's own ability such as hacking or faster lock picking or breaking through walls which adds depth to the game. You can approach these levels several different ways, from hacking your way and to shooting your way out to diging through the level. It's a surprisingly long game, and there is a emphasis on co-op. Who doesn't want to rob banks with friends? Buy this game!
4272	1	a	this is a good game for these upcoming reasons:  you are a beautiful red-haired telekenesis master.  you get big really fast.  if you see something bigger, no worries mate, its time will come.  you destroy the world. you save the world. subtle rap is employed so minorities are represented (very PC!) there is a dinosaur, i think. rolling is fun and its all you do! (easy recipe for success. take notes game devs!) pick up the right thing at the right time to see an easter egg (school bus dong!!!) embrace buddha. amen
4018	1	a	  Very Fun casual game, was really surprised how much fun it would be, behind all the kids graphics, it's a good paced action. The characters are also really interesting, without any vocal voices, but subtitles
2434	1	a	Fun addictive game, great to play with other people.
4993	1	a	Plays like a cartooney version of Portal.
5515	1	a	This game is an update/love letter to Space Invaders (itself still an enjoyable arcade classic). It adds a money/xp system with upgrades, more enemy variety, and smooth control. It's perfect for scratching the itch you get when you want to play something old school and arcadey like Space Invaders, Galaga, or Phoenix.  Also check out Ultratron, which is a similar update to Robotron.
2297	1	a	Best co-op game forever
5334	1	a	Absolutely glorious remaster of the classic Space Invaders game. Innovative, advanced, and scores of fun to be had.  When aliens living on Titan, Saturn's moon, decide to attack, they lay waste to Earth's military forces. Well most of it. You are the last remaining Tank Commander on Earth, and you are one bad mofo. Battle your way across Earth to stop the invasion, and then you take it to the skies as you hit the Titans' outpost on the Moon, and obliterate it. Next stop, the Titans' Martian colony. They wiped out all the little green men also and need to pay. After Mars, you find yourself on Saturn, and the enemy forces are strong. But not as strong as when you reach Titan itself, taking on the nest of the alien scourge to nearly end our way of life... and the poor Martians.  5 levels, 5 mothership bosses, an entire armada of Titan forces, some rogue and oddly light blue asteroids, and 1 lone tank to destroy them all. Fight your way across the Solar System as you upgrade your tank; outfitting it with extra weapons, additional bullets, faster recharge time, more powerful attacks, Shields, and deadly Smart Bombs. You start out small, but by the time you reach Titan, the force of your tank is ridiculous. But that doesn't mean it's easy. Each world you come to is upping the difficulty, more enemies, more styles of fighting, and a tougher Boss.  Not to mention fun bonus Challenge stages after every 7 waves you defeat, where harmless yet swift yellow flying saucers shoot across the sky. Destroy them all with perfect aim and you get bonus prices.  This game is complete with Highscore boards showing the scores of other players across Steam. Compare your best with others and strive to be the best. All the while this game's gloriously beautiful soundtrack playing in the background as you squash Titan scum.  The tank comander from the original Space Invaders would be jealous to see the rig you are in control of now.
1832	1	a	If you're into 8-bit games, and into intense strategy, then this is a must-buy.  Atmosphere: The background music is great, gives a nice touch while playing.  Gameplay:  Alot a variety with 8 'classes' with each with his/her own specialization. Multiplayer is where this really starts to shine.  Graphics: It's a 8-bit game, why bother?  Story: If you're willing to read every dialog, then the story itslef is pretty good.  Downsides: Controls and gameplay styles are easy to play, but hard to master.  Overall: I'd give it a 9/10, one of the best games of it's type out there.
5212	1	a	English: This is a very nice game. Simple puzzles with nice music...just what i like! :) French: II s'agit d'un jeu tres agreable. Puzzles simples avec de la bonne musique...tout ce que j'aime! Meow
472	0	a	I cannot unfortunately recommend the latest update of this beloved game.  Put quite simply, the AI has changed from somewhat rational and predictable humanlike AI into completely braindead train-layers who will overlay multiple routes to get from A to B. Further, the layout of the game screen and buttons has changed, making gameplay confusing.   The prior iterations of this game were sublime; this one is a drag.
1341	1	a	N0scoped a penguin with a snowball.   I r8 1337/420.69
4230	1	a	More then just a game, increase your reflexes, your art of breathing, and overall body, mind, and spirit. This can be used as a tool to improve your performance in other video games and even real life.
596	1	a	Really great way to play an awesome game that has a lot of pieces. It's pretty seemless and I enjoy playing it online as well as by myself. Smallworld 2 is also very good; but I would recommend starting here.
3454	1	a	A great introduction to the JRPG genre. Very high accessability while not being too shallow means anyone can get into it. Fun, fast paced battles are spaced out with minigames and level exploration. Even contains a nice class system much akin to FF3.
5340	1	a	Another fantastic looking retro game from Puppygames! It is the 2014 version of the classic game, Space Invaders, where you are the last surviving tank commander defending Earth from alien invasion.  The idea is still same as in 1978. Alien forces slowly approach you, while you bring destruction with your tank and laugh at them. At the same time you collect points and upgrades, which you then use for tank upgrades between levels. Upgrades vary from shields to extra ammo and smart bombs etc. Nothing major or too complex though, just enough to give the old concept a refreshing twist.  It's a great and challenging mini game that pretty much anyone with two working hands and a set of brains can start playing immediately. 
2686	1	a	Kirby-tested, Kirby-approved
231	1	a	Anyone who is a fan of oldskool arcade arena shoot em ups, stuff like geometry wars.. This is really amazing. Very easy to jump in and out of quickly. I found the games in geometry wars took much longer to get exciting, waves gets into the crazyness quite fast and keeps you there as long as you can stay alive. It looks great, the soundtrack is great and the feel is very responsive. High scores can be destroyed if you manage to pull off amazing stunts. Don't get me wrong, Geometry Wars was and is a true classic, not saying Waves is necessarily better.. I just find this more modernised and it requires less commitment to get that burst of fun in :)
726	1	a	a fantastic adaptation of the amazing board game. recommend buying
3477	1	a	I usually try to stay away from stuff that is cute and kidsy, but this game is actually not really like that. It is a charming little game with really great graphic design and a good turn based rpg combat system like Final Fantasy style. You go around a town map doing quests and it is so far a lot of fun. Double Fine â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up Iron Brigade bad which was really unfortunate, but they have a gem on their hands here with this game. The huge flaws in this game though is that it is very short (I beat the main game + the dlc in 7 hours), there is no replay value: once you beat it there is no reason to ever play it again, and it could also be more difficult. One of my favorite short playthroughs that I have played in a long time. I don't know why exactly but it just strikes a chord with me and I love it. I think because it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time, Earthbound on the Super Nintendo. A very good game, just way too short. Catch it on sale and only on sale.
5336	1	a	Puppygames seems to specialise in teaching old dogs new tricks. The old dog in this case is Space Invaders, and the new tricks make it well worth playing again. As you progress you earn money which you use to upgrade your tank, turning it into a laser-spitting death machine. But the aliens are upgrading too, getting faster and deadlier with new abilities. There are five worlds, with a boss at the end of each, and challenge stages every seven levels.  At heart it's still a simple game - nothing can change that - but it's addictive and the graphics are distinctive. It's a good game to play as a break from more complex games.
971	0	a	The video game equivalent of highlights for kids.
79	1	a	very nice, very short :)  If you can get it for a good price (75% sale or bundle) - take it! ;-)  Those people who completed it in 30 min are eighter a genius or they play it with opened walktrough :D (or at least they are not blind like me :D)
4016	1	a	this Games is so Cute and with a very cool mechanic the costumes are really cute and cool.
2192	1	a	A fun game to play with friends, and the price is nice. The PVP is a bit broken, a player can get everyone's trophy only to get killed once and the killer takes all trophies and wins. The story is good I guess.
1545	1	a	On sale or not - this game is fun to play. Here is a link to some game play with me and some friends.  Let's Play Monaco #1 with friends 
905	0	a	i fell asleep watching the promo vid...........................................................................
4825	1	a	(I had a previous review but i don't think it posted so i'll try again)  Well, I finished the game. I have to say, it was very interesting to go through. I enjoyed it for many reasons, but many others don't for the same reasons. Some people complained that it was a very slow and tedious to progress, but I thought it was very fun to have to figure out what you needed to do in order to finish the level. Many complained that getting all the new dimensions took to long, but i thought it was smart of them to add in the dimensions one at a time, making it so you understand the best way to use this dimension, instead of rushing through and never really learning the proper/best way. I agree that the puzzles weren't hard, but this game is pretty old. (Yes, 2012 is old for a game.) The puzzle industry around that time was growing, and this was a great game for it's time. The graphics were also really great, again considering that it was released 2012, and was up in the higher game quality. (Some games released at that year were Borderlands 2, Hotline Miami, Halo 4, Assassin's Creed 3, Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, MAX PAYNE 3, DIABLO 3, SOMETHING 3 JEEZ LOUIS COME UP WITH A DIFFRENT GAME ALREADY WE DON'T NEED 3 F*****G GAMES... Sorry lost my cool. :) I also agree that the ending was a little anti-climtic, making it kind of a bit hard to want to go back and get all the achivements, but none the less it was an ending that wrapped things up. Another thing would be that we never actually saw our uncle in real life, so that kind of ruined it for me too. Many people said the uncles jokes weren't really funny, but honestly, if you have a real uncle you know that all of their jokes are about as funny as your dad's. (WOOT WOOT just offended a couple orphans here! I am on FIRE!) However even though others complained that the jokes weren't good, i thought they were hilarious, maybe just my sense of humour. Another thing to was that he didn't pretend that you were dumb. He didn't go, 'The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. Oh, that means it makes two metal thingys stick together reall well.' He would go 'The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. I remeber the one time my friend made it, but spilled some on workshope table and a piece of metal he was working on, with his hand stuck in between! Oh my, he had a fun time explaining that to the paramedics!' Instead of dumbing it down for you, he simply made it easier for you to understand what happened or what it does.  I think i'm nearing the end of my review now. I'm pretty sure I covered the bigger parts. I think this game would have been amazing if they had added in a world editor so you could build your own little puzzles, and steam workshop support. All in all I rate this game a good 9/10. not perfect but definitely something i would buy again if given the choice.   When i read comments that normally sways my verdict if i should get this game or not. I don't want someone missing out on a game or getting a game and not liking it because of my rating. Decide for yourself if you want to get it or not, my rating should just be something that you read and go 'Oh, He liked it. That's good for him.' That's all!  Edit: This isn't going to be short. I missed a couple things. I'll try to keep it shorter but i suck at that so... Anyways, people complained about the Physics engine not being very good. I actually had no problem with the controls and thought they were decent enough to use and not be frustrated. It may just be me being used to crudy quality engines, spending my time playing games like- actually maybe i shouldn't mention but you get the point. Another thing people complained about was amount of time it took. I got this on sale for like 2 bucks so i wasn't going to be overly 'Wow, I spent 199.99 bucks on this, it better be an amazing game or else i'll be really mad!' I thought the play time was great, and yes i know i spent 11 hours on it, but that was because i left it open for an hour or two, and i accidentaly had to re-play 2 hours worth because of steam save file crap that screwed me over. I thought that it was a great amounnt of time on a game i really enjoyed. I also probably missed something else so there may be another edit.
4674	1	a	Going into Quantum Conundrum i expected a Portal like expierence but with different dimensions to toggle, especially because Portal's former lead designer 'Kim Swift' worked on this game. And yes, there are some similarities like going from room to room to solve 'puzzles' and a narrator making dumb but often funny jokes. But sadly the puzzles aren't as great.... I expected brain twisting and greatly designed puzzles. But what we got are puzzle like environments based more on momentum and physics than actually solving diffecult puzzles. This however is fun and original aswell, it creates a good balance between solving puzzles and platforming.  Now i really enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum. The game has great cartoony graphics and the mad scientist voiced by 'John de Lancie' is quite funny sometimes. And even though the game is rather short, this actually benefits the game in my opinion. For me the length was perfect, around the point it all got a bit repetitive the end was near. Something else Quantum Conundrum does really well is create a original and great universe. Everything is made really well, and just fits. Unfortunately the ending is rushed and just not satisfying in anyway.... And although the game has a great balance between puzzles and physics, timing certain actions can get frustrating at times.  I still recommend this game to any puzzle fan out there. It's a fun and challenging puzzle platformer with a well made atmoshpere. The game will take you around 4 to 6 hours to finish. However there are alot of collectables and achievements to get if you would like to get the game on 100%.
5188	1	a	Like a prettier version of Dwarf Fortress.
2368	1	a	this game oozes class, best co-op in ages - pure and simple fun if you have taste please buy this and support the devs
4398	1	a	A fun game that will keep you busy for a few hours.   If this Katamari game everyone seems to be talking about is so great, why isn't it available on PC?
127	1	a	This is a very fun puzzle game that really makes you use your brain to create a 3d tetris of blocks. 10 / 10 for price and value!
661	1	a	This is a fun game, but it is inferior to the iPad version, which I also own. The Mac version does not have the ability to choose different computer players (i.e. different difficulty levels). Also, there don't seem to be any built-in game achievements. The Steam application has a clickable 'view all achievements' link, but it leads to a page with only one item.
2887	1	a	Nice indiegame for short plays and fun.
5462	1	a	Im a big fan of old school arcade games, such as Galaga, and seeing this made me instantly buy it, which was a good idea on my part. I enjoyed this game. It had clean and crisp graphics for a pixel,and 2D shooter game that is, and later on in the game you encounter new enemies and bosses to spice up the gameplay, it also becomes more of a challenge and almost forces you to think on what upgrades you should buy with the money you saved... which is what I like about the game.   All in all, I Loved the game. It had a mix of challenge and strategy, along with tiny things to spice the game up and give it a bit of variety. The only thing I'd like to see is improved controller support, and maybe even specific missions. :)
5094	1	a	Its a great game, although its farely repetitive, its still very good, but it lacks multiplayer so if you play the campaign for to long it might get boring, i would just wish there was versus or some kind of co-op campaign, i really think it would make the game more fun, and less the same, as you would have company, overall though, it only needs multiplayer then it would be perfect, except for all the micro transactions, they tend to be a litte to powerfull.
4105	0	a	The AI will screw you over; this is truth. At times, it will feel like every move you make sets up the AI for a nice, fat combo. Then you'll start analyzing the consequences of each possible move; that's when the AI just matches 3 blocks ANYWHERE, and tells the game to drop whatever it needs to get extra turns/wildcards/4&amp;5 of a kind/skull row (sometimes all of the above in one turn).  This WAS a good idea for an RPG; unfortunately, they screwed the pooch somewhere along the way.
1665	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an amazaing game of stealth and sneakyness with many YOLO moments as well! Great with friends, Great for busting time, and AMAZING for general fun!  Get Shotgun, Get Money, Get Kills - NO WITNESSES!!!! 10/10 - Love It To BITS
3663	1	a	Funny, cute, clever and, above all, fun! Not the most complicated game you'll ever play, but it has a lot to offer to all ages of casual gamers.
5430	1	a	        YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Steam Cleaning - Titan Attacks&nbsp;
3660	1	a	Short but sweet RPG. Worth your time.
3117	1	a	This is an amazing game - the retro feel makes it that much enjoyable with the wide array of characters. Whether playing with friends, or solo, it's a great game all around.
3132	1	a	This game is one of the best coop indie games out there. Every level is cleverly designed to be completable with any of the cast, all who have unique skillsets. However, no character makes any level too easy. Similarly, playing with friends doesn't make the game any easier / harder, but instead changes how you approach it, with new challenges, and also new tools to overcome those challenges.  Plus, the graphics and controls are simple yet beautiful, and the story is something that I didn't think I'd even pay attention to, yet it captivated me. This game is probably the most polished indie game I've seen, and is a must get for any colletion for fans of coop or stealth games.
2436	1	a	Its just so much fun to play &lt;3
4049	0	a	for a mystery adventure game it was boring coridors were two long everything was too far away from each other and you spend more time walking and running half the time in circles rather than solveing the case only those who the patiance of a saint can put up with this game personal rating 1/10 and thats being generous
1774	1	a	This is a really nice game, was a good change of pace from most of the hardcore action games i've been playing really enjoyed it.
3881	1	a	A short, cute, and funny adventure game with some jrpg-lite combat elements. The humor is excellent and there is little out there that gives such a great feeling as the first time your character turns from big-eyed kid into a giant war-robot.
4107	1	a	Best game i have! Awesome Puzzle game with great RPG elements. Hours of fun gameplay, a real winner this one.
1338	1	a	
4176	1	a	i think i enjoyed it for a short while some time ago i dont remember too well, something about shinies....
4426	0	a	Luxor 2 will not work on Windows 7. Two Bad becuse all the other ' LUXOR ' Games seemto2 work fine.   I can't find a work around, That works
2048	1	a	Best fireworks show I've seen in ages 10/10
1316	1	a	  Best 8 minutes of my entire life, 10/10 cured my cancer cleaned my pores and brought my grandma back from the dead to say goodbye to the family. Would not reccommend
1934	1	a	I hid in a bush~ 10/10
2793	1	a	Great game , worth every penny
4064	0	a	I have never been able to get this game to work on any of the systems I have tried (desktop or laptop). I was really looking forward to a 'realistic' pinball game that simulates a physical machine. Fortunately, I probably bought this for a significant discount. I don't know why/how I did not look at the reviews before buying this.
4606	0	a	just like the first but with make you puke grafics (probably misstyped that)
4701	1	a	Portal with John â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DeLancie
4737	1	a	kind of a portal knock off but still good in it's own way.
1749	1	a	Really fun game to play with your friends! 15 bucks is a bit much, but anything below that during a sale, etc. would be a great deal.
4235	1	a	Probably the best katamari ripoff on PC, may also be the only katamari ripoff on PC.
5204	1	a	I want a neutral button, I don't recommend it if you loved the first one or if you like to play games without having to look up what is the point of this or if you like puzzles in the normal sense of the word. But it's pretty and there are puzzles kind of, but this wasn't at all what I expected after playing Toki Tori 1 and I was disapointed. It's not a puzzle game like the first game it's an open world 2D platform explorer with puzzle elements. And like the new blurb says it tells you nothing about anything you have to figure out everything yourself, there is no kinda of tutorial at all. But it's not bad so I don't not recommend it if this is what you looking for, just be aware it's nothing like the first Toki Tori.
823	1	a	I love this adaptation. Well, I love the original board game itself too, but I'm finding that many board game adapations are being developed a little sloppily. It's good to see that in Ticket to Ride they took care of all the details.
4886	1	a	I dont want to just say this game is Portal......but this game is Portal. Instead of portals you get DIMENSIONS. Thats right kids you can mess with the fabric of space time and other fabrics to solve puzzles! WHO DOESNT LIKE PUZZLES? NO ONE THATS WHO. Really though its well designed and has a great deal of charm and save for a few frustratiingly designed puzzles its a damn near perfect game. So give it a shot. I know you'll just wait till its on sale but thats ok. DO A THING!
4868	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES MY BRAIN HURT IN A GOOD WAY
2020	1	a	Strictly one of the most brilliant and immersive games I've played in a while. And it's even better with co-op.
3820	1	a	A really great and imaginative game. Never played anything like it ( Well, besides the RPG part).   You must choose betwee a brother or a sister, Reynold and Wren, and save the one you did not choose from Evil monsters tryng to steal candy from Halloween! Luckily you have super powerful costumes on your side!  I've had this game for years but I wanted to play it during the Halloween season. Finished it in about less than a week, but I'm sure I could have finished it in a day. Not too much content, but I feel its worth it. At the time of this review, I have not played through the DLC that came with the game, Grubbins on Ice ( Saving that for Christmas).  This game shows that Double Fine are kings of imaginative games, and even in gameplay they know their stuff.  
3070	1	a	Probably the best coop sleath game I've ever played. 10/10 if playing with friends
1655	1	a	Metal Gear ? Splinter cell ? ( waht's yours is mine) :trophy:
3546	1	a	Go trick-or-treating but the trick is bombing the neighborhood.
2107	1	a	Playing alone, it's probably a 6/10. Playing with friends with open mic chat? 10/10. Hilarious.
5442	1	a	Great little game. Short but cheap. Fun but difficult. If you want a small fun and challenging game you can play every now and then for a few minutes, this might be OK.
3685	1	a	Very entertaining and fun to play.
3074	1	a	Damn good heist and coop game. 8 classes and maps are nice. Map editor is coolest thing in this game I loved to make levels with it. ^^  6,8/10
1721	1	a	u git 2 b a bank robber my life long dream :)))))))
2598	1	a	its kinda boring but i dont like how i keep dying and my team dies and fails the misson
4501	1	a	same mechanics as the first one, just a new story and goals. still fun though. good to have running in the background or for playing in class. only have to check on it every half hour or so 
685	1	a	Great casual game. Feel like you're playing the board game version. Love it.
4986	1	a	I spent hours on end shifting colors and bathing in my uncles science juices. Like young Michael Jackson.
3739	1	a	very nice little game, not too long, difficult or complex but fun. Definately a casual game.
208	1	a	The game constantly challenges me, and even annoys me at some points but ultimately is really fun. It is hard to control using only your keyboard (my mouse is broken, don't ask how) so the controls can definitely be better but using a mouse it should be no problem. I do recommend this game!! just .. don't get too addicted aha.   oh oh !! and it has really nice music to go along with the pretty graphics and gameplay so theres that too.
2141	1	a	This game is sweet. ridiculous fun. get it!
3442	1	a	Fun and cute little rpg game. Recommended for those who just want to play an rpg without the huge time investment.  Pros: -Cute -no grinding required (unless you want to 100% the game, and even then very little grinding is required) -short -lovable cast of characters -interesting dynamic where you're not really pigeon holed into making each character follow a specific role, lots of room for variation and you can always switch up your stats/abilities.  Cons: -short, only took me 9 hours to 100% the whole game -movement can be a bit janky, I got stuck on the environment a lot -dialog is slow.  Overall I recomment this game to anyone who just wants a short casual style rpg with a cute factor.
3339	1	a	 Quest to obtain Costumes   I got this game of double fine humble bundle and was the first among the three games that I played. I have to say that the game is quite short and the depth of the RPG mechanism is shallow. It might be one of the easiest RPG game that I have ever played. The total playtime is around 5 hours and the plot is simple, you basically just   save your sister  .  I would recommend this game if you just enter into RPG scene but to those veterans, you might just pick the game up for the cuteness.  Verdict: 3 out 5
3593	1	a	Addictive and cute game from Double Fine. Turn Based RPG in a simple, fun package.
5482	1	a	Simple and really fun! GO PLAY IT!
959	1	a	If you like the genre, this is one of the better ones. However, it's very short.
743	1	a	Really fun &amp; addicting game. Would recommend to anyone.
3260	1	a	Obulis is a really fun puzzle game. I didnt expect to play it as much as I do. It's basically like the love child of billiards and mini-golf.
1579	1	a	I really love the simple graphics and the music. I quite enjoy playing this game although I can only play in short bursts as it is very stressful! There will be a lot of yelling while playing and begging your teammates to come revive you (if you suck at it like I do!)
4336	1	a	Decent enough time sink.  I can't believe it is still 10 dollars though.
2749	1	a	This game is really fun,worth every cent. :D
4757	1	a	Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!
930	1	a	This game is addicting. It gets really tough towards the end though. Probably not very helpful review, but you get what you see from the trailer and that's important for me. :)
5453	1	a	Need to kill time? Space invaders on steroids, Do it.
2961	1	a	Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .
3014	1	a	It's a very nice game if you wants a puzzel-game to play with youre friends. You can play it in singel player mode, but the co-op makes the game.  
4946	1	a	Very nice puzzle game with an entertaining storyline and a lot of very good sometimes hidden jokes. The difficulty is comparable to Portal 1/2...you will definitly have to think while playing this game.  And besides: the graphics style is also very nice.  For fans of games like Portal and Antichamber definitely worth playing!
1026	1	a	I bought this because the words snuggle and truck were in the title and next to each other.
2154	1	a	Very strange but fun - mostly fun with friends only 6/10
3051	1	a	So I first played this game on an Xbox 360 and LOVED IT. This game is even up there to compete with games such as Payday 2 and other big titles. 11/10 -IGN would recommend again.
3270	1	a	Very fun and sometimes really hard. I would recommend this to people who like hard puzzle games. I would give this a 7.8 out of 10
3902	1	a	I LOVE thisgame. It's a perfect RPG for young kids. I can't wait for Costume Quest 2!!
756	1	a	The good news is that it's literally an electronic version of the board game. Everything works how it should, for the most part. The tutorial is fairly well done and a decent way to teach people how to play the game if you're sick of explaining it, and the AI is passable but not great if you just want to play casually by yourself. More importantly, it supports cross-platform multiplayer between the PC, Mac, web, and iPad versions. It does NOT support playing with the Pocket (read: iPhone) version, which for some reason is the only one which allows asynchronous play, which is kind of lame. It also has no hotseat mode. By far the specialest thing about it is that it installs its own private (probably non-updated) JVM, which is kind of counter to one of the main points of using something like Java in the first place. It's otherwise functional, even if there are a few weird design decisions.
3298	1	a	Yet again Double Fine surprises me and yet again they manage to make another rather unique and great game. Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween. You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes. Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat. The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle. There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn. You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest. Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny. Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining. In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say. You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this. Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game.
3022	1	a	Great game with so many ways to play. You can choose how you go through the game
2136	1	a	This is a really good game
1410	1	a	This is legitimately the best game I've ever played. Buy this. Buy this for yourself. Buy this for your wife. Buy this for your kid. Buy this for your boss. Buy this for you penguin.
3570	1	a	Fun rpg-like but falls prey to repetition. Could have been a great game with a little more depth and variety.
3091	1	a	Freaking awesome game. Simple but very fun, do-able as a 2 person game so great for couples, also works with the full party but co-operation is required.
3171	1	a	nice little physics based game, really good although frustrating in stages :)
1880	1	a	Monaco is a fantastic game with great level designs that can be tackled in numerous ways. Every class has its own methos to get through each challenge and to work together. A note however is the beginning parts start of rather easy, however the challenge lies in getting all the coins(cleaning out). For a great experience make sure you have a friend to play with and enjoy yourself in the heist of the century!
5040	1	a	A nice relaxing puzzle game. Not for kids. 2
5320	1	a	One of the best puzzle games ever made, which let the player guess what he can do and how. Very clever game, highly recommended !

4698	1	a	This game is a nice Puzzling game with funny humor (in my eyes), challenging puzzles and awesome physics. It's played through quite fast, but it is definately worth it. Just a little tips: Read the titles of the books and look at the pictures/paintings on the walls while shivting through the dimensions. Always good for a laugh or two.
3706	1	a	Battle system can get a bit repetitive, but otherwise I really enjoy it! Love the art and environments especially :)
5354	1	a	holey moley! when i got puppygames' ultrabundle i haven't expected the included space invaders clone to become my favourite of the four games. very addictive title with great visuals and audio. the ability to upgrade your ship between levels adds a nice feel of strategy when you're new to the game and a progressive motivation for the intermediate players.
864	0	a	First and foremost, this is a great implementation of the original board game. The execution of the game's rules along with a clean user interface and having absolutely no set-up time makes it desirable.  However, the pay-to-play model that they employ is a travesty. If it were a one-time purchase, I would buy in a heartbeat because of the potential to reach a larger player base. Unfortunately, as it is, I would only suggest playing the free scenarios, using the limited free plays they offer and, if you really enjoy it, purchase the actual board game. It's just too bad the publisher had to be greedy on this one!
5346	1	a	If you like an invaders type of game you will enjoy this.
5130	1	a	This is one of my favorite games. It appeals to the builder in me that loved Sim City, but includes some light fighting and mystery. This is one of the games that I can play while relaxing. I hate to micromanage my minions, and the dwarves in this game just need me to set them up with resources and give them a direction to dig. The storyline is cute and lighthearted. The only con is that I have encountered a few bugs, the worst of which is in the higher levels. These bugs have not prevented me from playing and don't cause too much frustration, except in my OCD. Because of them, I cannot accomplish all the achievements, but I am still able to play the game and finish the campaign.
4457	1	a	I love this game! Why can't I play it on Windows 10?!?! :'(
4448	1	a	With some polish, this could have been a PopCap title. If you don't mind ugly and can grab it at a discount, this is a fun time-waster.
4429	1	a	cool little casual game not very strenuous even on hard   68/100
3711	1	a	Gives true meaning to the infamous phrase, You're a kid now, you're a giant robot now! 10/10
5388	1	a	A nice new take on Space Invaders / Shmup. Lots of very quick levels, upgradeable ship, smooth graphics. Good to pick up in the discounted Ultra Bundle.
4983	1	a	this is actually pretty cool, if a bit fiddly in parts. and it has john de lancie! whoo!
3511	1	a	Great fun, not at all what I usually play. I got it discounted and thought I'd give it a try. Funny and engaging dialogue, simple (but more complex at later stages) and customizable combat, and baased in a world of puzzles, secret chests and exploration, Costume Quest excels itself as both a children's game and one for adults.  I am six hours through at the moment and just finished the main story. There is an expansion so I'm expecting total playtime to be about 10 hours. Not bad at all for the price.  If you are a fan of RPGs, levelling up, area exploration, turn-based combat, or completionist gaming, there will be something here for you. I highly recommend it.
949	1	a	One of the more interesting hidden objects games out there. With nice graphics that don't make your eyes bleed from all the staring ;)
4552	1	a	A middling tower defense game. Has decent graphics and cool retro-futurism designs and cinematics. Its very original concept, a tactical perimeter based on satelites and orbits around a base or planet, is ruined by emplacements restriction, the marching of foes timed to the second, and the random trayectories of asteroids that prevent get better classifications. Sometimes the weapons point to closer enemies instead of ones first of the row... Requires many patience and perseverance to pass levels at high difficultly with perfect stadistics. Worth with a great discount.
815	1	a	The only game Iâm terrified of playing with my wife. She does not like to lose this.
2367	1	a	One of the best games I've bought from steam. And I bought this for 1,40â¬ from summer sale!
1858	1	a	Its challenging fun with great elements of stealth! 8/10!
3175	1	a	a reasonable little puzzle game, not the best out there but its okay.
2612	1	a	If you like hilarious games that go brilliantly wrong despite your best efforts, here is the brilliant mmo for you. Monoco is amazingly done and I wholly recommend it.
4198	1	a	This game is a mix of match 3 and traditional rpg gameplay. It doesn't look great, the enemies can be cheap, the puzzles are almost nonexistant, and I can't seem to stop playing.   Worth checking out if its on sale and hate having a life. I actually had a dream about playing a match of this game last night. I think that should be a warning, but I'm reccomending this game anyway.  
2398	1	a	My favorite parts of the game were digging and shooting people in multiplayer.  WE DIG DIG DIG DIG dig dig dig dig dig THATS WHAT WE LIKE TO DO  WE DIG DIG DIG DIG dig dig dig dig dig THATS WHAT WE LIKE to do  WHITE GIRLS  WHITE GIRLS  looking at looking at looking at me  WHITE GIRLS  WHITE GIRLS  
40	1	a	Should be a free game i guess...  But well its ok to play it with your kids or little cousins.  Too much hearts and stuff like that going on tho -.-
2996	1	a	A very fun Indle/Stealth/Heist game like PAYDAY 2. I suggest it for playing Co-Op with your friends!!
1977	1	a	This game is amazing fun to play with friends due to the amount of co-operation you have to do and if you dont work together it just ends bad, but overall its just fun to play
4485	0	a	Games Crashes Everytime on Upon Loading
5439	1	a	Another excellent release from Puppygames.   More than just 'Space Invaders meets Galaga', this top quality shooter features well-honed controls, upgrades, power-ups, an awesome soundtrack and beautifully-realized graphics.  Titan Attacks! plays well enough on Android, but better on PC with a full-sized keyboard.  - Skinny from the Fat B*stard  (curator link) 
4969	1	a	It's pretty cool. nice mechanics, and challenging puzzels.
46	1	a	Lume is a very short yet very well executed adventure game. The graphics are original, supposedly made entirely of cardboard, and the puzzles aren't too difficult to turn people away. You are a little girl looking for her grandfather and you have to figure out how to turn on the lights in order to find him. Very cute little game, though very very short. A sequel was just released recently, and I hope that when the price is right that I will get that in order to see the story continue.
1870	1	a	A very interesting, entertaining game. The devs are also awesome!
3485	1	a	Adorable halloween story with turn-based RPG+QTE battle system.
3038	1	a	Want to run around screaming? Want to panic and hide in the bushes? Want to dig with your freedm spoon?   Play monaco. With Friends of course.
80	1	a	It's a beautiful game with an interesting look. The puzzles were easy, given enough thought, though the answers were not always obvious. My only complaint is that it was much too short. I know more episodes are due to come out, but I was able to beat it in 45 minutes (including cut scenes).
3390	1	a	I love this game! I was looking for something to get me in the mood for Halloween and this was perfect- cute, spooky and full of little details and secrets. There are lots of side-quests and things to collect along the way, which appeals to me a lot. The costumes and battle opening sequences for each costume are really well done. The one thing I struggled with initially was the mechanics during battles; you have to press the specified key at exactly the right time to execute a successful attack or defence which took me a while to get my head around! After a while, though, I found this aspect to be enjoyable and the difficulty curve was just right, I think. All in all I loved playing this, and would definitely recommend to those who like cuteness, collecting things and really well decorated Halloween scenes :)
3516	1	a	Adorable, actually decently challenging, simple to follow, great controller support, just the right amount of silliness, and just generally an incredibly fun game. I've played for hours now and the only reason I've stopped that I have to go to work. Highly recommended by this VERY picky gamer.
372	1	a	Geometry Wars on roid really.
4458	0	a	Eh, not as good as the other Luxor's. Not too many power ups. Gets really hard, some levels are really close to unbeatable. So definately not gonna recommend to anyone.
4997	1	a	I really like this game. It's a fun puzzle/platformer with a similar feel to Portal. It's not all that difficult but it also isn't too easy. The DLC is where the real challenging levels where for me. It has great physics, which is really important, because all the puzzles are physics based. Really the only thing else I want from this game, is for someone to make a mod adding Vive support,
944	1	a	Great combination of puzzle and RPG. Mixing matching mechanics with spells this game have enough variety to keep you interested for many hours-that you will need to complete the game because is quite long for casual genre. The plot is also very nice, if you like classic fairy tales. Recommended if you want to play something different but not so dense. Donât miss it on sale.
196	1	a	I mean, it has colors, I guess thats pretty cool  Edit: Now it has Colors in 4K
2338	1	a	The game is simple to learn, but don't let it's retro graphics decieve you, it has a huge depth to master, and produces exciting spy movie moments on the fly.
2443	1	a	Love this game. Best played with friends, but mostly oldschool arcade fun.
3458	1	a	It's simple, addictive, short and sweet (pun intended) If you're looking for a compelling story, raw challenge or innovative game play... please look elsewhere.  This game is meant as an introductionary game for RPG noobies. It takes elements from Mario RPG / Paper Mario with timed attacks, so the game tricks you in to thinking you're doing more than selecting 'Fight' from a menu. The costumes are fun to change up, half of them are useless and impractical but they look cool.  The challenge does ramp up a bit at the very end and the final boss can be very obnoxious if you don't bring a healing costume in with you. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy for it's job system and Paper Mario for it's timed button strikes, you'll enjoy this game.  Only downside is how slow the game can be at times, having to watch repeated animations over and over before a battle begins... also it can be a tad clunky especially when using the dash feature from the Robot costume...   This brings me to final point that it was bad game design on Double Fines part to allow this costume to dash and none of the others... It makes it manditory for you to utilize this first costume at all times meaning it doesn't give you much in the way of variety... Thankfully this was fixed in CQ2 with an actual dash button.  The DLC Grubbin's on Ice is around the same length as one of the in game core chapters, 2 hours in length. Worthy addition to the game and links the events of CQ1 and 2 so it's basically manditory to play if you intend to continue your Costume Quest. :P
693	1	a	Much faster than the board game, very good for short breakes.
4649	1	a	Wow! This is only 43.1 MB! Quite impressive. Anyways, this is a really fun game with both sandbox building of inventions and very difficult puzzle gameplay in challenge mode. Definitly worth picking this title up!
820	1	a	An excellent adaptation of the board game.
121	1	a	The most fun i had in this was trying to survive... I was never good at Puzzle Games Especially games that have a Rubix Cube, Space design.  9.75/10
1423	0	a	ok right away dont think i am a total hater. this game is not that great in my opinion though. yeah i only played 2 rounds but then agein those two rounds were frusterationg. the number of bombs they can through at you is also stupid. basicly in this game you are a penguin pushing other penguins off the iceburg, and maybe even killing them in the deadly waters. i think that this game is not worth even close to fiffteen dollers and to end this review there are great games out there but this, this let me down.
2309	1	a	Enjoyable graphics and gameplay, and it's a blast to play with friends. I found it boring while playing solo, so wait for a sale, buy a four-pack, and guilt your friends in to playing it with you.  Side note: Purchasing this through the Humble Store comes with a Steam key and DRM-free version of the game.
4488	1	a	This is the sequel to Samanth Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, and it follows exactly the same formula: you visit different countries searching for separate components to a myserious object that will save the day. Each place you visit involves a number of hidden object scenes, finding things that are lying around, and using tools in mostly obvious (and sometimes extremely unlikely) places. Occasionally there's a mild puzzle to solve, such as solitaire, match 3, jigsaw puzzles etc. It's all very easy, the cartoony style makes the objects stand out quite clearly, although in each scene there's usually one or two objects that are hidden a little better than the others. However, the game really falls over itself to give you hints, clues and not-so-gentle nudges, so you're unlikely to get stuck for more than half a minute. Hover a tool anywhere in the general vicinity of where you have to click, and a shower of sparkles erupts from your cursor. No doubt there, then! There are an abudance of hints that basically show you exactly what to do, by the end of the game we'd amassed nearly 40 of them and didn't use one. I mean, it's all good, clean fun and best enjoyed as a group, but it was easier than the first game. It really needs a 'hard mode' where you can turn all that stuff off. Still, a good time was had by all, and I'd recommend it if you like this kind of thing. Just don't expect much of a challenge.
3577	1	a	A simple and satisfying game for young or old. Quest for candy, destroy monsters, and watch as your Halloween costumes spring to life in battle.
984	1	a	A fairly typical 'find the hidden object' game. The plot of this sequal is better than the first game and you miss nothing by skipping directly. On Linux, I found both games to suffer severely with graphical glitches, poor performance and misuse of widescreen resolutions, to the impact of showing what should be off screen graphics in the letterboxing used to pad the 4:3 ratio scenes on my widescreen display. Overall, enjoyable but does little to separate itself from the plethora of similar games on the market.
787	1	a	Great little turn based game. Well thought out and implemented.
2776	1	a	I've never wanted to throw up so hard after robbing a bank.
4280	1	a	like katamari..... loves it but the music sucks.
1568	1	a	This is a great multiplayer game up to 4 players, each character has a specific skill, and they need to work together to beat each level.  Levels are like  heists , you get in, get the valuables and get out.  The graphics are retro style, in good taste and with gameplay functions in mind.  The music is very good, and it draws inspiration from old piano music composed for black and white mute movies.  The gameplay is where it's at, it is a lot of fun to play multiplayer with friends, public games are also fun if you are lucky and meet cool people.  Playing solo is also fun but a lot harder, the game then becomes more stealthy.  You can also pick up and use items like guns, bombs and tranquilizers that you may use if you're not feeling particularly stealthy, thus playing the game more like an action game.  In fact you even have a bonus ( unlocked from the start )  Zombie  mode where you are encouraged to kill the enemies.  The story, while not the main attraction, will keep you entertained ( should you choose to read it, since you can skip it ), it contains humour and a few unexpected twists and turns.  There's a lot of content, and it'll take you a while to beat it all ( some of the later levels are quite hard ).   I recommend. 
1518	1	a	Wow! So fun!
102	1	a	It is an ok game - the music is relaxing but i struggled ti get into it as this is not my type of game. Would still recommend it though on the basis of its ambitions.
5300	1	a	Wonderful, tricky puzzle game with colorful and cute graphics. Well done Two Tribes, keep up the good work!
637	1	a	A classic game converted into an electronic version. What more could you ask for? The game occasionally chugs (pun intended) but is true to the original. I've played many rounds of just the base game and will keep going back for more.
1902	1	a	moccasins: what sores in my
1939	1	a	This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.  As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.  As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).
1414	0	a	Penguins Arena: Senda's World is a really fun multiplayer game, but it's not worth your money.  Penguins Arena is a multiplayer game where you play as Penguins and you fight other Penguins to be the last penguins alive.  The game has an SP mode which is you fighting Penguins in an endless mode and most of it get's boring after a while and the only way to enjoy the game is to play with real people and this is where all the bad begins.  The game is completely dead. I tried joining a server, but no one was playing and it's quite sad cause the developer has been updating the game, but sadly there's no point in buying this game.  The audio design is also no that good, the soundtrack is really annoying and most of the time I turn it off when I start playing.  The game is really fun, but playing solo is not fun and unless you have friends who will play with you, don't bother with this game.  Pros: + Fun gameplay  Cons: - Dead Online - Boring Solo mode -Terrible audio design  Final Rating: 4/10 - Not worth it  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

3753	1	a	If the thought of children in Halloween costumes, parading around for candy is your kind of thing, then you should probably get some help. On the other hand, if you're just bored and fancy a Final Fantasy-style game by the makers of Psychonauts, then you're in luck. This game is more fun than a clown on ecstasy.
4759	1	a	Really fun game from the dev of Portal
3300	1	a	Be a kid. Collect candy. Save the world. Fun game if you are looking for something short and sweet.
4646	1	a	Nice puzzle game in the spirit of The Incredible Machine series from the 90s.  It does have a quite uneven difficulty curve, where about half of the levels are way too easy (like a prolonged tutorial), and later hits you with some quite illogical puzzles where you don't really use any skills you've picked up along the way, but instead just keeps throwing new, more intricate stuff at you.  All in all, the levels are always more fun than frustrating, but the first half of the game seems rather pointless and I wish the level progression was more inspired.  If someone held a crossbow -- tied to a 1 KG weight set to trigger once a basketball tipped over a domino brick -- to my head, I would give it 3/5.
1971	1	a	  i don't own this game, but if you give it to me for free ill play it and rreview it for you ;^)
3349	1	a	Pros +Very charming graphics, characters and setting. +Dialogue is very cute and nice to read, you may or may not like this but I loved it. +The overall feel of the game reminds me of when I was a kid on Halloween, so it has a very nostalgic feeling.  +Outside of the DLC (which comes free with the steam version) mission, the game never really drags.  +Nice variety in costumes.  Cons -The actual battle system is unplayable with out an Xbox 360 controller. -Even then it's not that great of combat, though some of the bosses can be fun. -The dialogue is the same and doesn't matter which kid you chose, this almost made the character development feel pointless. -Even then it's not really that fun.  A pretty fun game, has a lot of short comings but still a pretty solid game.
2518	1	a	Without friends, very boring game. With friends, very fun game. Easy to learn, hard to master. The trophies on each level are fun to attempt to achieve.
3417	1	a	Nice in resonably small doses. The novelty of the combat and the variation in the costumes keeps it interesting, pretty much for the whole game. It's quite short and I think that's probably a good thing as it was rather starting to grate by the time I hit the bonus content. It's cute, funny and occasionally touching and you should definitely watch a gameplay video to see how it plays before you decide if you want it....
4988	1	a	Just got through spending a good amount of time with this game! I filmed a first impressions video and posted it on YouTube. If anyone's interested, please take a look:           YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Quantum Conundrum - Pass or Play&nbsp;
2997	1	a	My friend bought me this game i thought its some â¥â¥â¥â¥ BUT !!!!! its rly funny this game is nice coop game i love payday and this is as good as payday the idea is rly good !
1260	1	a	This game is literally how you 1v1 on club penguin properly by making the dankest airshots, and throw scrubs off the cliff with any possible method, so they can become shark food before they do the same thing to you.  Fastest way to win is to use bombs agressivly.  Teammates don't really matter that much except for the extra lives.
3138	1	a	This game is one of the best coop indie games out there. Every level is cleverly designed to be completable with any of the cast, all who have unique skillsets. However, no character makes any level too easy. Similarly, playing with friends doesn't make the game any easier / harder, but instead changes how you approach it, with new challenges, and also new tools to overcome those challenges.  Plus, the graphics and controls are simple yet beautiful, and the story is something that I didn't think I'd even pay attention to, yet it captivated me. This game is probably the most polished indie game I've seen, and is a must get for any colletion for fans of coop or stealth games.
4872	1	a	First-person puzzler from Portal designer Kim Swift. Features delightful narration by John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation). Do NOT bother with the DLC, which features no story or narration at all! You have been warned.
4955	1	a	This is a pleasant puzzle game, like a Saturday Morning cartoon version of Portal. Please take note that it's quite short (finished the story in 7 hours, give or take time being baffled by a room), but the light-hearted sardonically humorous dialogue and art makes up for it.  ALSO, if you are a fan of the vocal stylings of John de Lancie ( voice of Q and Discord), you will adore being his nephew. Hopping over unsafe lasers and dodging falling safes while listening to your new inventor uncle advise and patronize you is a most enjoyable mind-testing experience. Definitely buy it if you've got spare cash for a few hours of wholesome fun!
1514	1	a	prison break simulator 2.0 don't drop the soap
3536	1	a	I want to suck Tim Schaefer's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
724	1	a	This game is a lot of fun and easy to play. :D
4150	1	a	A very nice puzzle game for a casual session in between. Also check out puzzle quest 2.
4828	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great puzzle game that had come out of its year. Sadly not many people have played this game during its release. However, this game is a good alternate portal game without portals but uses four different environmental effects to solve puzzles. Its not very easy and its not very difficult. Its moderate in my opinion. However, the difficulty is always different for different people. Some puzzles take time and some are smooth as butter.
4157	1	a	Still as awesome as ever -- actually, better on PC. Played it to death on my DS handheld, but it's one of those evergreen games that never grows old. There are still some minor quibbles with the sound and music (they're great, but they seem to cut off abruptly after combat, etc.), but all in all this is still the deepest puzzle RPG I've ever played. The writing is also better than the games that followed. PQ2 didn't quite live up to the first in that department, though it did add some fun, new gameplay mechanics. Going back to this, though, it still holds up like it was brand new. Highly recommended.
3854	1	a	This is a cute little game about three friends who set out, not to save the world, but a friend and sibling. It's cute, funny and very easy. Do you wish you could just finish a game for once? Do you mind if there's a slightest taste of JRPG? Whatever you answer, give Costume Quest a chance, don't let the monsters win and destroy halloween.
1246	1	a	Greatest game of our time
2424	1	a	A nice casual stealth like game that is always there to help cut off the edge from your normal day. I highly recommend that you buy this game, it offers multiplayer with up to you and 3 other players, (Friends not included). But regardless you play it either alone or with friends its a hell of alot of fun to play.
267	1	a	It's just (J)awesome!!!
4019	1	a	Great little game for the holiday season. cute and quirky. i enjoy the graphics and gameplay. complete with a unqiue battle system. tons of laughs for me and my little ones. good win for pc for family.
3793	1	a	Now that I've beaten Costume Quest and the Grubbins on Ice DLC expansion I feel that I can review it properly. This game was fantastic! I don't beat many of my games because of time constraint, so it speaks a lot to a game when I actually finish it. This game was a fantastic nostalgic trip. Its an awesome adventure game by DoubleFine (those guys rock). In this game, whatever haloween costume you are wearing you transform into for battle. Great game! ~PR0XIDIAN
5348	1	a	Do you like space invaders? Want an updated/different take on it? Titan Attacks is basically just that. There are powerups, many enemy types. It's a modern verson of space invaders. It's really fun. The music is enjoyable, the sprites are easy to distinguish from the bullets (I rarely lost myself in the chaos). This game is a blast. However, don't bother investing any money if you're played out on space invaders. There isn't anything new fundementally. If you don't like the fundementals of the gameplay the bells and whistles will be meaningless. Hope this helps. Game on! :D
3054	1	a	I wish I had someone to play with ;-;
344	1	a	Addictive game. Music is great and matches the theme. Worth every penny. Hope it is compatible with Mac OS. 10/10
1081	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
4386	0	a	There is nothing wonderful about this game. Nothing. The attempt at copying Katamari Damacy was so â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor that no negative statement could even come close to describing it. What thought that went through Valve's mind to associate this black stain of an indie game with Portal 2 must have been addled by booze or magical drugs.  But seriously - This game blows.
3598	0	a	I hate this game. I tried, I really did. Good story, nice graphics and interesting concept. The game play is reptative and annoying. I read the reviews and I understand that most people breezed through this game. That makes me hate this game more. I feel like â¥â¥â¥â¥ now! Why? I simlpy SUCK at this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off.
4967	1	a	Very much a successor to Portal. It's a puzzler based around physics, which, like portal, focuses on an idea that's simple in theory and AWESOME in practice!
2952	1	a	it is great with friends
2210	1	a	One of the funnest games I played in 2013, especially if you have a group of people to play with. At 80% off you can't afford NOT to buy it.
1622	1	a	Superb music, vibrant colors, and superb gameplay makes Monaco one of the best indie games i've played in 2013. Multiple classes, and the ability to play as any of them to clear a level, adds replayability as you try to beat the clock or clear all the loot on each level.   Monaco's multiplayer makes it even greater. The game is hectic as everyone tries to combine their individual skills to complete the game. While it's online multiplayer isn't the liveliest, the local co-op allows your for your friends and families to easily join in the fun.   In short, this game is a real gem. 
4601	0	a	Bunch of physics related bugs making it impossible to complete some optional objectives (Level 1-4's wagon wheel gets stuck) and some main objectives (level 1-7). Didn't bother playing past that point.
4677	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great game for people looking to be puzzled or just want a cute and funny challenge :3.  - Graphics/How It Plays: Now don't let the 'Childish' graphics detur you, the game plays well on most computers and looks great if all the settings are maxed out (Which any potato of a computer could do). The only complant about graphics/how it plays is that instead of using loading screens, Quantum Conundrum uses long hallways, so you get some REALLY bad frame drop inbetween levels, and some hallways are just WAY too long. I would give the graphics and how it plays a 5/5  - Level Disign: The levels are very well created and have a mix between science lab and mansion/victorian feel. Sometimes though it is hard to tell what the objective in a level is, I would have liked like a big red 'Exit' sign at the exit door so I could see it. I would rate the level disign a 4/5.  - Music and Audio: All I can say is the music in this game is just astounding, even though this game does not look to be that popular, so much work has gone into the music I HIGHLY recomend buying the Soundtrack while buying the game. Some sound effects are a bit obnoxios, but most sound fine and work well with the feel of the game. I would give the sounds and music a 5/5.  - Controls and Menu: The menu is sometimes confusing but may I just say THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU, you have to go into 'Start Game' to exit the game I mean how counter intuative can you get. Also the mouse sensativity settings in the menu had like 3 different levels, not just a slider and I would have liked to see more than 1 audio slider. The controls where great out of the box, everything you would expect, exept jump. Jump was space BUT unlike in some games when you jumped, if you weren't EXACTLY on the ground you woulden't jump and in some situations in the game, that ment life or death. I would give the controls and menu a 2/5.  Overall this game is a great game with a very easy story to follow and challenging levels. I would DEFFENENTLY recommend buying the DLCs because the game is about a 4 hour playthrough so if you are still thursty for some demention switching I would recommend the DLCs.  I would give this game a overall rating of 4/5 and would DEFFENENTALY recommend it. And it's cheep so buy it boiiiii.
4341	1	a	Nothing extra, but its fun to play with.
282	1	a	Probably the best top-down shooter I ever played. Highly addictive and it gives you that 'one-more-try' feel to it every time.  Also, the game will insult you no matter what your score is at the end. Yes, it's funny.  10/10 will play it every day
4560	1	a	Quite fun, retro style video clips.  Limited placements on towers, but with spinning orbits makes it a different type of td.
2847	1	a	Monaco is good, if you have friends its good. play monaco, it has good good
2017	1	a	this game is the  bomb.com 
3817	1	a	Nothing I could say would prepare you to this wonderful game. Those kids have humor &amp; attics so charming you will fall under their spell. The entire package just oozes style &amp; show how much Tim Schafer loves to create games. Simply a must have for any gamer who wants to have pure fun.
3429	1	a	Everyone should play this game during Christmas like I did.
1318	1	a	This game is basically 'AIRSHOT Training'   i love it
618	1	a	A great board game and transfers well digitally.
2898	1	a	6/10  Was OK, not really my style. Liked how you have the option to complete each mission in different ways.
2667	1	a	Gameplay is simple, but fun and interesting. Also, good single player and co-op.
1394	1	a	A pretty good Call of Duty clone
4887	1	a	Didn't like the first hour or so. Then came a rather steady increase in fun, which continued through the end, and by then I was enjoying myself enough to decide it was well worthwhile and write this recommendation.
2567	1	a	Highly recommended. Excellent game. Very fun multiplayer, especially single screen multiplayer.
3151	1	a	 This is a long review so if you just want a summary of why I recommend this game skip to  Results  and read from there.   IonFX makes a fun little puzzle game that produces a special world that combines Newtons three laws with gravity pushing your puzzle solving to the test. With sweet music and pleasant level design Obulis offers a deceivingly peaceful play through.    Gameplay:  After nine fearless hours I have completed Obulis. Obulis is an interesting game, but surely isnât for everyone. In the category of puzzle games Obulis tests you by using a version of physics without friction to propel, roll, jump, shoot, catapult, and bounce spheres into containers. The levels vary and there are about 152 levels. The level difficulties go from Simple to Master with everything in-between. There is no difficulty setting for the campaign so in a single play-through you will play through a various difficulty settings, which pushes you through a rather smooth difficulty curve. Each section of Obulis has an ULTRA level which unlock after completing challenges throughout the âentireâ campaign. These levels push you to the test and completing them unlocks achievements.    Features:  One of my favorite aspects of Obulis is that there is no rating for the puzzles. You either solve a puzzle or fail a puzzle, there is no score. I like this concept, but it essentially means there is no replay value to Obulis as there is nothing to do after you complete the game. The puzzles keep you on your toes, and the slowly getting more difficult challenges keep pushing you to new levels. As you progress through the chapters of the game the not only are the levels changing, but they introduce new concepts: cannons, catapults, ballista, trebuchet, gears, horizontal moving floors, vertical moving floors, and more. These concepts differentiate the puzzles and make each of the levels seem unique rather than repetitive.    Game Issues:  I write a lot about this, but if you love puzzles and like precise timing you will probably get past this quiet easily. My major gripe about this game is that the puzzles are really more based on precise timing rather than finding a solution. You may find the solution on your first attempt, but because you have to time each click perfectly youâll be sitting there for hours. When I was playing Obulis there were actually times where I went online to look at guides to see if I was solving the puzzle correct only to find out I was, but my clicks were not timed exactly perfect. On some puzzles it gets to the point where it stops being a puzzle game and it becomes more like âSports Arenaâ the arcade game made by Sammy USA Corporation where there are lights circling the border and to win prizes you must push a button right as the light next to the prize goes on. If you have never heard of this Arcade Machine you may be able to assume that itâs essentially impossible to win because of how difficult it is to time when to push the button. Obulis presents similar annoyances as âSports Arenaâ. Essentially you are just sitting there clicking a button at slightly different times to solve a puzzle you figured out the answer too quite some time ago. One of the other annoyances was that Obulis didnât always give the same result to the same physical interaction. Sometimes the ball would move slightly differently even though the same exact event was occurring. This âglitchâ sometimes resulted in me having to restart even when all the clicks were correct. Luckily if you are worrying during gameplay about whether you solved a puzzle correct and are just timing the clicks wrong there is a way to ease the pain. Go on YouTube and all the puzzles have been solved and made into videos, this can allow you to view if youâre making the mistake or not.   Results:  The tedious timing issues and the minor glitches in the physics engine didnât take away from Obulis; Obulis is actually a good play through. It offers about seven hours of puzzle solving (about two of the hours I played was with the game on pause while I was out doing other things). I recommend this game if you can get it in the Indie Puzzle Pack for a discount. I would not recommend paying full price for this game as it is essentially something youâd be able to find free elsewhere.   Pros: +Over 152 different puzzles +Fun simple puzzles with nice serene music +Comes in the Indie Puzzle Pack with a few other games +Puzzles of varying difficulty, not all puzzles have to be solved to complete the game (some of the hardest puzzles can be skipped) +Very easy controls, only requires a mouse +Puzzles vary, add new challenges, and increase in variation as you get further in the game.   Cons: -All the achievements are for completing the Ultra Puzzles -The game has some flaws in the physics engine -Most of the puzzles have obvious solutions but require tedious work to correctly time to collisions

5010	1	a	p cool game upvoted
4232	1	a	Keep them reaction skills in shape !!!!
3313	1	a	This is the first and best game to ever truly capture the spirit of why Halloween is the treasured holiday that it is. From the childlike fantasy that costumes are a transformation rather than a mask to the currency systems of candy and collectible stamps, the nostalgic whimsy is endearing and addictive.  Every year I look forward to playing this game (I have it on PS3, thus the short play hours on Steam) and whenever I need a little dose of Halloween but it's not October, this game scratches that itch.  If you love Halloween, this game embodies it like no other.
4936	1	a	10/10 FANTASTIC! Extremely highly reccomended! Exactly what I expected...Clever puzzles - numerous solved with clever tricks that would have taken ages to think of..(probably) Must Get... I can't comment on this one - I don't know what to say...Yes I do....BUY IT!   P.S. Hey everyone...Puzzle games can be replayed, you know...'oh, but I already know what happens in the story!'...Puzzle games...Its in the name - you play them because of the puzzles...Not the story...
690	1	a	Excellent game! I really enjoy playing on PC and the board game. I wish the visuals were a bit better on PC though.
653	1	a	If you enjoyed the classic board game then this is a servicable digital version. There are some issues I wish would have been addressed. Some minor bugs and lack of polish... As of this writing, it's been several months since the achivements were added to the game, and they all remain frustratingly unobtainable. In any case, the game mechanic is sound and so far there's been no game breaking issues with it. The online lobby nearly always has a few games going and matchmaking is surprisingly quick.  if you enjoy board games and want to jump into a quick match with strangers, then you could do worse than Ticket to Ride.
3236	1	a	.54 cents you can not loose. wish it was for android aswell. Good little gravity simulator. Very short but lots of replay. I'd expect addon levels coming for this title. Some really good action reaction get the ball in the cup chanlenges.
4021	1	a	Every Halloween
3566	0	a	Unfortunately, personality cannot save this game's bland and repetitive gameplay. 2/5
25	0	a	This game gave me progeria.
1569	1	a	Fun Fun Fun and for Thiefing Fun
3754	1	a	I thought this game was pretty stupid at first but after about ten minutes it became better and pretty fun. Repetitive as hell though.
3646	1	a	A fun little Halloween Theamed adventure featuring some Fun Costumes,Great Dialogue and all around a good time :3
2227	1	a	great game, totally recommended for playing.  this game is addicting !
979	0	a	One of the puzzles was broken, it lacks other gameplay elements that you usually find in other hidden object games. In this game there is dialog then you have a hidden object puzzle, pretty much all the way through the game, only a few other puzzles
4719	1	a	This game is just too much fun!
2142	1	a	Bought the four pack on sale to play with friends. Find a group of four and play through the levels. Great workshop support as well so it seems like you wont ever really run out of levels to play through. Live the graphic scheme too; very appealing.
85	1	a	This game's charm and visual style is phenomenal... But the length (about half an hour for my trip through it) is extremely jarring. I guess I sort of expected more once I realized the game's most complicated puzzle involved me needing to brush up on my music reading skills (which took longer than the length of the game to read -- although this is still better than learning to count in D'ni...)
1390	1	a	Old but gold !
5368	1	a	VERY amazing twist to Space Invaders.  I do recommend this game; however, be warned, it is fairly easy to beat.  After you beat the entire game, it will start you back at the beginning (while you can still pick up on any of your past levels at any time). BUT, this is good. Because of you missed any of the challenge mode achievements; you can go right back into achieving them.  Tons of fun. The ability to upgrade your ship is brilliant. The idea of especially the cash system overall is brilliant, and the saucer drops are brilliant.  This game was a brilliant creation, and is definitely worth the money if you are looking for an enjoyable game to let your mind get into.
1251	1	a	Games are meant to have fun, and what did I get from this game!? Fun, I got fun, not instantly though. I played this game for a good 1 hour and I immediately regretted it, so in order to redeem my gaming fun. I decided to play Call of Duty, the all superior game that beats everything, so I was playing then I realised every kill I was getting was a 360 no-scope cross map with no hitmarkers at all. Then  I realised that this game taught me how to be Faze in almost every fps game I've ever played. Now though, it's even  affected my life, whenever I pick up food from my cafeteria at school, I have to do a 360 which spills my food all the time. It's uncontrollable, I can't sleep without 360-ing continuosly in my bed. This game ruined me. I can't hug friends/family. Noone loves me anymore. I can't pay attention to school. I can't love.  Otherwise it's a great game  10/10 - Faze SpongeCake
933	1	a	Sea Cross Island was a quiet haven just off the mainland, but recently strange things have been happening! Mysterious creatures known as Fae have started appearing and are wreaking havoc. A young girl named Claudia, is thrust into adventure as she searches for her missing uncle amongst the chaos. It's a dangerous journey but she's not without friends. Four elementals are drawn to her aid as Claudia finds out that sheâs actually a sorceress! Embark on a journey to discover the secret behind the mysterious Faery Gates.
4212	1	a	This is the best out of the puzzlequest group. VERY addictive!
1090	1	a	This game is a blast. Adults and kids alike will enjoy it.
1581	1	a	I began playing this game alone, and I simply loved it. Then my brother started playing co-op with me, and i can say it is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Simply a must-have for any REAL gamer
4712	1	a	If you are a sucker for 3d puzzle platformers this should be something you enjoy. Just be warned most of the puzzles are fairly easy and you need to buy the DLCs if you want something more challenging.   Rating:  Best game ever 
3463	1	a	If you would have asked me if it was possible to turn trick-or-treating into a fun video game, I would have laughed. But after playing Costume Quest, I'm simply left in awe. It is so clever, witty, and charming--a perfect game for kids or just the kid in you. The look, feel and gameplay is somewhat similar to On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness. There's a lot of thought that went into the costumes, quests, battle stamps, and the special attacks. I challenge all doubters to say they can't find an enjoyable game in here. Two thumbs up.
2194	1	a	Best couch co-op I've played in a long time
659	1	a	Very fun and challenging and a pretty good AI. It beats me more often than I beat it. I bet multiplayer is a blast but never have tried it. :)
2024	1	a	awesome experience unique game you have to try it it is worth it

1968	1	a	i dont really like this game becuase i dont know whats going on when i play it but i like the idea and i would recomend it
3705	1	a	simple, fun, and long enough that the charm of it remains with you after finishing the game. pick it up if you want to play a short but fun RPG even if you only have a little spare time,. This game is totally managable and affordable!
2462	1	a	I really love this game How you must play through different condition But, I recommend to play this game online Because there are so many things you can do more than just play alone  So don't be hesitate, buy and play this game Regards  Kirik-Kirik
365	1	a	A fun, though a little graphics intensive, arcade shooter to play through to burn a good couple minutes off. Kinda feels like Geometry Wars+. Similar gameplay, similar attitude, more game modes.
4142	1	a	Bejeweled plus D&amp;D style gameplay, while a very frustrating and sometimes difficult game, makes this a very fun game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or puzzle games.
5374	1	a	Very nice indie game, with nostalgic controls and gameplay resembling Space Invaders. Definitely a game you should get if you're a fan of Space Invaders, or just want a casual game to play offline.

2654	1	a	This game so far is very fun should get it for fun 4 co-op family night.
3411	1	a	I originally played this on xbox 360 when DoubleFine first released it. It was interesting and I loved the atmosphere then. Now, I still love every second of it. The combat isn't ever boring and the game has great personality!
2980	1	a	its the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr i will bye the full vershon when it comes out  
3184	1	a	Simple, fun, semi-addicting. Exactly what you want from a casual game. It's not hard and it's enjoyable. I recommend this game, but only if you are able to buy it in a bundle or for 1 euro. It's not a game that will keep you occupied for over a day and it's definitly not worth it's full price.   The idea of the game is that you have colored balls that you will have to get into a vase which will have the same color. The physics are well made and easy to understand. The levels you have to complete in order to get achievements can be tricky but all in all it's more like a puzzle book you take out to a holiday which you could complete in a day but might just do a puzzle a day.  Fan of mediocre puzzle games? Get it. Fan of hard puzzle games? Might want to check a video on youtube about this. Fan of achievement grinding? Get it.
5509	1	a	A great Space Invaders homage. Lots of levels, 5 words, and upgrades for your defensive ship/tank thingy. 'Tis a winner, this one.
3326	1	a	If you don't want to play as a battle unicorn, I don't want to know you as a human being
2845	1	a	This game is pretty much the most amazing thing ever. Equal parts utter terror, intense frustration, careful planning, and excited exhilaration! Highly recommend; not for those who charge in without thinking, though.
3945	1	a	This game is great. There, that should do it.
4693	1	a	This games holds a variety of puzzles with a touch of creativity that makes it stand out on its own. From shifting to different dimensions, to even getting timing down to a key; this games is rather entertaining even for the roughly 7 hours it took to complete.  Overall, the game left me wanting more(2 upcoming dlcs sometime soon) and that's a good thing.
5089	0	a	It needed a bit more work. The game is essentially fine but it could have used an update or two with some important features; like being able to create farmable soil so you don't have plants randomly all over your build. Buy it at $5 or less.
1917	1	a	Okay....I'll admit it. For a long time I didn't like Monaco because it just felt strange to me. It's an acquired taste (As one of my friends said in his reviews).  But after many heists with friends, I must make a confession....I LOVE THIS BLOODY GAME!!!!!  It's not too good in single player, but when you're playing with friends, the chaos becomes your new best friend!   You can relate this game to a top-down Metal Gear game, but with a charm of it's own.   BRILLIANT story-telling. BEAUTIFUL music. WONDERFUL chaos. FUN gameplay. GREAT mechanics.  If this game is not in your library, then why are you even on Steam?!  If you meet me in a server, be ready for a good time. But don't forget........what's yours is mine!
5507	1	a	Classic Space-Invaders / Galaga with cool mouse control system, definitely worth buying for some hours of extreme fun
3647	1	a	An awesome little game, full of humor and smart dialogue that provided me with a very enjoyable gaming experience. Would definately recommend picking this up.
2324	1	a	This game is all about the multiplayer. Oceans 11 wouldn't have been as fun if it was just Ocean's 1. Pulling off the perfect caper with your team is truly fun.
3082	1	a	Played for a few hours and its already pretty fun! When I get more time definitely gonna put more hours in!
214	1	a	Pretty good time killer with a nice soundtrack.
2322	1	a	10/10
5484	1	a	Wonderful old school touch, kinda overloaded on certain levels. But enjoyable.
1731	1	a	GUARD. GUARD. Is all i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hear. Theres no black guy in this game, so it's super unrealistic. I'm also waiting for the Zombie's mode dlc, so I can buy the RPG on the wall with chalkboard. BTW, the gentleman is gay â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. He's a ripoff of spy from TF2 but hes not french, so he's not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I also like mole because it takes balls to dig a hole. Lookout is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ character that likes to suck other's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for vision.    (I do not mean all of this. Don't kill me pls)  69/10 would buy more DLC
383	1	a	Poster child of a twin stick shooter!
1117	0	a	Snuggle Truck sounds like a creepy van where you will either get murdered or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
816	1	a	good game when you do not have a lot of time for gaming
4367	1	a	It's like Katamari but not as good. Worth it for cheap. Good little waste of time.
2833	1	a	great multiplayer gaming experience!
1131	1	a	Very well built physics based game. Good strong deep intellectual story line Great complex characters. I'll never forget the final boss fight.. nearly put me to tears. Highly skill based. I would not be surprised if this game was considered for MLG. Not for everyone however. The competitive edge will turn some casuals away. 10/10
4519	1	a	The concept for fish tycoon works for the man who is occupied with work and can every so often take a short break to check on things, such as social media and, in this case, virtual fish. This is not a casual experience you sit in front of and make stuff happen, this is a game were everything takes it's sweet time to do...something-anything! It does things on its own, and every so often you need to come back and make sure nothing dies. Although its not the best game, it certainly is entertaining.
5473	1	a	the game is space invaders, but with that awesome puppygames or whatever awesomeness into it, the music amazing has always, and is a challange the more you move forward, but somewhat easy considering the 2Âº time I play it, I not only beat the final boss, but was able to get the 56Âº score on the online top 100, under the name 'ALL BUSINESS*, but the game is worth, and a huge thanks for my friend (current name at time of post) Icy-Spicy for gifting it to me *huggles and wuvs &lt;3*
3001	1	a	The only problem with this game is you can't get the god damn amazing soundtrack.
1325	1	a	Real-life situations.
66	1	a	wish this game was finished!!
4817	1	a	3d puzzle games that requires you to work between dimensions, The main Story puzzles are Easy. but doing the challenges might be a bit more difficult than you think.  Did I forget to Mention the narrator is john de lancie
4122	0	a	Was interesting for the first few rounds. But then got ultra annoying because the enemy always gets better gems. Felt massively unfair and frustrating.
5311	1	a	Great puzzle game with fantastic music and graphics, but more importantly, a really interesting progression style. Think 'the alien monkeys teaching you how to wall-jump' but for every action in the game. Some very clever puzzles.
3607	1	a	TRICK OR TREAT ALL DAY
2903	1	a	Broke into a house and used their toilet. Then hid in a bush. 10/10
5495	1	a	It's Space Invaders evolved &amp; it's not pulling any punches. The game sticks with the oldtime graphics from the atari days, but adds upbeat music with challenging gameplay. A must for any retro-gamer.
3330	1	a	This helps me deal with the trauma of not being able to trick or treat as an adult. I love this game.
3044	1	a	Monaco has the foundations of a great co-op heist game. Each character has a special ability and quirky attitude, and when you have 2-4 people working together, the cooperative stealth in this game truly makes it fun. The music is absolutely delightful to listen to with the push and pull of the cautious environment. There are many different playing options in levels and style of playing too. It definitey has something great going here.  But, there is one thing I find a little annoying and odd. When I started playing, I was expecting there to be some sort of brief on each mission; map layout, special persons, particular weapons/traits, just something to predetermine some strategy. This is a heist game after all.   To be fair though it's not that big of a deal, but it would save me time in having to put up with a rather really slow and overly cautious play through, or, a hectic and rushed one, just so I can get some strategy down.  8/10
2169	1	a	Such game Much enjoy Very Monaco Omg Wow.
1032	1	a	Ok, Snuggle Truck (and Smuggle Truck) are pretty fun little games. Sometimes I like to relax with a casual game like this for a few minutes, I picked this up months ago.  But just now they added 'Brony Mode'... They snuck bronies into my Steam game collection. My Steam list is tainted forever now. Jerks.
2251	1	a	I stole everything!
5135	0	a	It's... kinda hard to describe. It's... very...... It's like a /very/ simplified Dwarf Fortress, I suppose, but with more of an emphasis on fighting and actual maps/objectives. It's not that fun, and VERY grindy.
1295	1	a	penguin arena inspired me to have a penguin fighting ring that is valued at $50,000 thank you penguin arena
220	1	a	So far I haven't played much of this game, but when I play more or the game gets an update I will edit my review as I see fit.  Waves is a twinstick shooter with the main objective of getting the highest score possible by shooting enemies.  Graphics: The graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful. Even the smallest details in this game look amazing. 10/10  Gameplay: Personally I haven't found any problems with the gameplay, it's very smooth and fast paced. This game can be played with the sticks on a gamepad, or if you prefer you can play with a mouse and keyboard. 10/10  Soundtrack: The music in this game is very nice and fits the 'environment'. 9/10  Overall: I love this game and I think it is definetily worth $5 dollars. 10/10   
3611	1	a	Love this game. Its like penny arcade meets halloween
4543	1	a	can't make them â¥â¥â¥â¥, i wanna see â¥â¥â¥â¥ in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ action i wanna see these little 8 bit â¥â¥â¥â¥s doing it
1561	1	a	Really wonderful retro style game. The map editor is really great too. Just buy it and start robbing like a boss!
4998	1	a	I spent hours on end shifting colors and bathing in my uncles science juices. Like young Michael Jackson.
141	1	a	I like this game. It's not a great production, the background is the same all the time and the music is annoying, but it's cool and the game modes are creative.
3834	1	a	Fun little RPG. A bit linear, but otherwise excellent. Buy, buy, buy.
5058	1	a	The puzzles are good, but tech support is nonexistent and there are a couple of areas right at the end of the game that are broken. If you're OK with a nearly-completed game, then this will occupy your mind well for a while...
188	1	a	 A twin-stick shooter with a calm, polished, cybernetic aesthetic, Waves is a solid member of the genre with interesting mechanics but limited content.   Waves is a game where you control a sphere rolling within a cylinder, shooting a spray of bullets with the aim of removing an array of shapes which you are motivated to kill because A) They give you points, and B) You blow up and stop moving when they hit you. The game has a few interesting auxilliary mechanics. First is the buffer which is a rechargable bullet-time power that is a main panic button, and the second is bombs that become available based on your combo multiplier. If your combo breaks than the bomb disappears so there is an interesting anxiety if saving a bomb, and also a chance to chain together a large number of bombs for maximum efficacy. As difficulty ramps up and the chances of missing decreases due to the large number of baddies on the screen, bombs become more and more frequent, which leads to a fun chaotic dynamic when things get tougher.  This game has a small, understated, relaxing techno themed soundtrack that goes well with the hex-gridded environment and the polygonal, computer themed enemies. It took me a while to appreciate the game's design as there is quite a bit of subtlety, but in the end I appreciated the vision.  Though ultimately enjoyable there are some minor gripes. First, I can't pause between death and respawn, though often I wish to simply restart the level after an early untimely death. Also, the challenge mode often perplexingly doesn't trigger success for the challenes appropriately. Further, the UI is a bit crowded and oddly designed. For example, a high score is often displayed proiminently in the middle right of the screen, while the current score is displayed on the middle left of the screen. There is a lot of data on the screen. Aesthetically it works in a sort of augmented vision manner, but practically I would like to reduce a lot of this clutter. My worst is criticism is Ithat he amount of content is limited. Many game modes play out quite similarly and there is only the one stage. After a few hours you've seen it all, and you may not want to grind the same set up repeatedly.  Though unfair due Waves' differing mechanics, I feel this game asks to be compared with installments of Geometry Wars. If you liked Geometry Wars, then you will like Waves. If you didn't, you won't. If you've never played Geometry Wars than Waves is a cheap introduction to the genre when it is on sale. The game is a solid effort, and personally, I'm excited for the sequel, which as of this writing is in Early Access.   Waves are a physical phenomena resulting from specific excitation in a medium. Most waves involving the medium itself are limited by the speed of sound in that medium, while the travel of optical and electromagnetic waves depends on the speed of light in that medium. This review brought to you in part using waves from  Original Curator Group . 
2733	1	a	This is a really good game, it's basic, has basic controls, has interesting levels and charactors, and has a solid goal for each level. Honestly, I can't find anything about this game that is bad.   My cousin introduced it to me to Monaco and I'm glad he did. Over all, it's a great game and fun to play with friends. I think Monaco is great for anyone and will enjoy this game.
3017	1	a	Really fun game, still kinda challenging though. Takes skill and is better with friends
55	1	a	An adorable little puzzle game (the cardboard and paper backgrounds are amazing!) that is fun, with easy controls. The puzzles range from simple to relatively challenging, so your brain will not be lacking mental excercise once you're finished with it.
1164	1	a	this game is so good it cured my ebola!!!!
860	0	a	Memoir 44 the boardgame (+ copious expansions) is great. Memoir 44 online is a pretty good implementation -- it's faster to set up, though it lacks the physical fun of rolling dice.  But you have to pay continually to play, which is a massive rip off. So why bother?
3773	1	a	Actually found this game by chance, got the discount voucher after crafting badge and *wham*, i bought this game.  I really love this game! Even though the story itself is short, but it's refreshing! I've never play this kind of casual RPG before so it's so good to know that there's a game like this.  The game itself is like JRPG with turn based element, but the whackiness of the game is the element in it. The puzzle is good, not hard (well it would be somewhat hard for kids) too. The graphic is 3D cartoonized. For the story, if you want to know how kids feel in Halloween, then you must buy this game.  I really hope that there is another type of RPG like this in European game, simple but make you refresh to play it.  Overall 8.5/10. I really recommend it for the casual or hardcore gamer out there to play this game!
2465	1	a	It was awesome! 
2186	1	a	This is a great game to play! The gameplay is enjoyable, and the graphics give the feeling of an old fashioned 90's gane. However, don't be fooled! This game is HARD to play as a singleplayer, so playing it with someone else is a must. Prepare for laughs , raging, and a sudden hatered for france.
4123	1	a	Fun game. Go play Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, instead, though.
4300	0	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a pretty simple casual game. The concept seemed very alien to me at first despite it's simplicity but I am told this a fairly populated genre although most of the good incarnations are apparently exclusively Asian in origin. Despite glowing recommendations from my friends of these games I am having trouble imagining any game in this genre ever being anything more than a shallow time sink. The kind of game that would probably be at home on a mobile.  The game is very simple. You run around a map consuming objects by running into them. You can only consume stuff smaller than yourself and as you consume more and more objects you become bigger and eventually starts consuming the very map itself. The game is timed and as such it is simply a question of choosing the most optimal route through the map to reach those required high scores.  There is not very much else to say about it. The graphics are not very impressive and the sounds are pretty mediocre. The music is decent however although that is mostly because it is unlikely that you will ever play this game for long enough sessions for it to become stale.  Not really a game that can be recommended as anything more than a simple time waster for when you're bored and only have 5-10 minutes to play.
5416	1	a	If you liked Space Invaders you will like this, there's a bunch of ship upgrades to buy and increase your firepower in different ways. The art style is cool. On my 2nd game I got into the #33 position of the leaderboards, so the game isn't that hard. The difficulty curve is kinda random, some stages are way harder than others because of all the stuff in the screen and the enemies bombing you, shotting you and coming down to you. For 1â¬ you can't go wrong.
4363	1	a	Discount Katamari Damacy. I would recommend that you get this if it's on sale and you like katamari.
555	1	a	I bought this game two years ago and it was sitting in my pile of games to play. A recent update saw me click on it to see what it was about. That was two days ago. I am really enjoying this game. It doesn't tale long to pick up the game play although I've got to admit I was still a bit lost after the tutorial game. The game is quite challenging against multiple computer players. I've only tried the solo game as I've yet to play online, I will give this a go once I feel a bit more competent. I've player the Asia, Europe and American maps. I keep coming back to the American map for the qucik games as I found the Asian map confusing with lines disappearing and then being replaced. The Europe map is quite good and more difficult than the American maps with the need for tunnels and ferries.  The current update has a few issues on the Linux version . Detailed below which I hope get fixed soon and will update this review accordingly.  1) DLC maps are not recognised. You need to start the game on a windows computer and then they appear in the Linux version. 2) Steam Achievements are not working at all for me. I can ony get them when playing on a Windows computer. But even on the Windows computer quite often achievements are not being passed to steam. They appear in game but not on steam. A recent example for me was the pressure gauge 200 achievement which didn't show after scoring over 200 points. 3) Crashes often. The game will quite often simply quit mid-game. This is not as bad as it seems as the game loads quickly and you can carry on from where you left off. Also when quitting a game to go to the main menu the game will sometimes simply quit the game.  Overall the game is a highly enjoyable game and highly recommended despite the few teething problems with this update, which appears to have been quite a large update to the game.    
1348	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR ALL THE YEARS. MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE. IT'S LIKE TRIBES BUT WITH AWESOME PENGUINS SO IT'S LIKE 20045 TIMES BETTER.
4000	1	a	For some one who doesent really like the RPG genre it's weird that i would put COSTUME QUEST in my top 20 games of all time. But it's True it's a masterpiece i love the halloween setting the quirky humour and characters everything about this game is charming and magical, i have still yet to play through the sequel i need to
3772	1	a	Loved this game from start to finish. Not a lot of depth in the battle mechanics but very fun none the less!
3057	1	a	I didn't expect it but this is one of the most intresting games. Its so simple but so fun at the same time. And so many ways to do something simple and all roles are useful.
2213	1	a	This is a brilliant game in art, and gameplay. Didn't really pay attention to the story, I should look into that. But GO BUY THIS GAME!!
4063	0	a	Steam hasn't addressed the fact that this game will not play on Windows 7 or Windows 8. There is no support for it. The home page for the game goes to a Japanese 404 site.  YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY IF YOU BUY THIS GAME! SHAME ON YOU STEAM FOR SELLING IT!
634	1	a	Everybody likes trains, and when I beat the computer nobody feels bad, mostly.
2025	1	a	Killed my friends in pvp before they could grab guns. 10/10
420	1	a	one of the most fun twin-stick shooter out there. It starts off slow then puts you on steroids after a while
5351	1	a	Old school retro gaming remade for the 21st century. I like how they added more depth to a simple formula, but didn't lose any part of the original formula. Lots of fun.
2546	1	a	i like this game it is really boss
2476	1	a	Great little co-op game. Get 4 players in there for a rioutous time. 
1720	1	a	This is a fun game with plenty of challenging levels, neat graphics, co-op AND pvp, and a level editor. It also has the most amazing music ever. Get it now.
4036	1	a	Public Notice: I made an uncut patch for Steam (the original uncut version is no longer available for sale) which adds full subtitles, decensors the game and has bonuses, here:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697262043   My playtime is low even though I finished the game because I played using the uncut version executable.  Now the review: Culpa Innata is a fantastic and quite unique adventure game, it does a lot of things most games don't and really deserves your time and money.  Many adventure games are set in criminal investigations but none succeed in actually making you feel like an official investigator going through actual interviews non-sequentially and piecing together the evidence like Culpa Innata. You have a limited amount of time - in the game that translates to the number of people you can interview based on travel time to location - and must choose wisely whom to interview, what to ask and which leads to follow up (and report) in the game's many locations. You also have a well developed private life after the day's investigations in which some other plot threads are explored. The game is non-linear and major reveals therefore happen in a way that is specific to how you chose to advance.  Another great success is the game world in which characters' scripts, motivations and way of life feel very lived-in and set in the new world order established by a subtly totalitarian regime very different from the one we live in. The main character herself sometimes says questionable things as she is an active part of the system up to a point. This does make you as the player explore this world on a deeper level than if you were controlling a detached completely-different-from-everyone protagonist meant to make you empathise with a corrupt society that cannot be accepted. The story is very interesting and while the game suitably ends the main plot there are some secret threads set up for a sequel that hopefully sees the light of day sometime.  For its age, the visuals are great and the facial animation is solid. Faces having an almost photorealistic feel at times due to the way it uses film grain without being excessive. The soundtrack is nice too, fits the mood well. The voice acting is also very good. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or crashes when playing the game (Note: I was using the uncut version patch shared on top of this review).  All in all, a fantastic adventure game I'm glad I played and highly recommend it to you all!
514	1	a	Easy to learn, not hard to master, and as addicting as chocolate crack. Pick it up so we can pounce each other!
3504	1	a	Short but wonderful, only a handful or so hours long, you won't be playing Costume Quest for ever, but its still a great treat.  A traditional JRPG at its heart, CQ really nails the comedy of Holloween as well as any nostalgia for it you might have.   The characters you play as and meet are more than interesting and its a great story that makes you want to see it through.
3168	1	a	2D puzzle game with decent music, mechanics and graphics.  I's all about getting the orbs of different colors into a basket of matching color by activating small mechanics in the surrounding, so no direct contact is allowed and it's all placed with just the mouse. The difficulty increase level by level, and will required better timing and cognitive thinking, but mainly just timing. This makes it very addictive though, since it trigger a nice sense of achievement when you finally succeed some of the trickier levels.  For me it felt like it was all mainly about relaxing and work on my patience, since some levels demanded a few tries to get the timing right.  I would say that this is a nice game if you are looking for a relaxing way to practise your patience, including a calm brain teaser. It's pretty good for when you need a short break from doing something else.
2592	1	a	Simple, but not easy. Addictive game play!
4297	0	a	This game is so.. very.. boring. I bought this game because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS 2 game. Sadly it's far from it.   In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. but the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy.   Don't buy this game, if you really want to play something but can't get a copy of Katamari Damacy, try this link:   http://www.kongregate.com/games/dingogames/tasty-planet?acomplete=tasty+pl   shorter and sweeter. 
2092	1	a	If you like Payday: The Heist or Payday 2, I highly recommend this game. It's like a 2D version of Payday: The Heist, but better.
2852	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
1601	1	a	Great fun with a friend. Probably even more fun with three. Don't buy it for single player, but absolutely pick it up for some great co-op action.
397	1	a	A fun small twinstick shooter. Simple yet intuitive mechanics, unique graphics and a good soundtrack. Perfect for some minutes gaming or to relax, though there are still multiple gamemodi so it doesn't get boring aso fast (especially because of the achievements). The enemies are very fun, some spread like viruses and some dogde your shots, it is enjoyable that the longer you play the harder and interesting the enemies become.  Only downpoints is no story, no multiplayer and maybe that sometimes it feels a tiny bit random, but that's a problem of all twinstick shooters I think :P
5005	1	a	Fun and puzzling game. I like first-person puzzle game, and this game delivers. Great gameplay, as you can change your environment in four different ways. Recommend!
5531	1	a	Simple and really fun! GO PLAY IT!
4262	1	a	Yes, it is a Katamari clone. Like other games by this publisher, it's a bit of a frankengame in terms of character and art direction. A few hours' play in this one, price accordingly.
2574	1	a	worth while
249	1	a	It's Freaking Glowing! 10/10
4408	1	a	Now if you are a die-hard Katamari fan or just want a pc Katamari. This may very well be right up your alley.  Now dont get me wrong this isnt some straight port and its not as physicsy as katamari is. If you run into a wall you dont get bumped or anything. But that doesnt mean its anything bad.  Its possibly not for you if you refuse to play anything with very low detail or low resolutions. But really the game has no option for resolution. Bit of a problem there but i never let graphics or technical limits stop me from playing a good game.  Story wise its pretty simple. There is a girl who ive named Terra (as some images in the files are named terra_angry or terra_duck and such) who controlls this puppet who goes around sucking up stuff kinda like a tornado. The world is about to be eatan by a giant fish head and you need to save as much stuff as possible before that happens. Most people will say there are 12 levels but there are actually 12 + 2 secret levels. So 14 in total. The last level    Has sad music playing and everything is on fire and it really does look like the world is collapsing     When i wanted to 100% this game i would spend hours on end playing the same level. Sevral nights were wasted trying to get an A+ just to hear someone say 'Chips Challenge'    Yes that is a real thing    Which is really why it deserves my nomination for the 'Just 5 More Minutes' award even if im probably the only who will vote. But my answer came from the heart. And thats all that matters.
720	1	a	Love playing this game with my husband, nice and casual, yet still challenging.
1252	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. Gripping story, fast paced action, and it will thrust you into battle constantly. I'd rate 8/8. Truly gr8.
2271	1	a	Fun and cute game if you like being sneaky and grabby. This game definitely revolves around team work. You will learn quickly that communication is key and going in alone is not the best approach. Good pick up.
4615	1	a	My â¥â¥â¥â¥ actually fell off 8/10 Weiners
1366	1	a	Club Penguin with violence
4326	1	a	This is essentially Katamari methadone, but it also provides an object lesson as to why Katamari is a ball and not a towering human puppet thing. If you know the basic concepts of Katamari, it'll take you about little over an hour to beat, artificial gameplay performance grading system and all barring you temporarily from the final level. (Without it the game would be about thirty minutes long.) What might make or break this game for you is Dejobaan's nonsensical whimsy, which you'll either find delightful or â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying. Either way, this is the closest that Katamari has gotten to the PC.
5175	1	a	Very Fun game but there are a few bugs.. nothing game breaking that ive encountered though. I Think this might be abandoned unless theres some HUGE update coming. Anyway its still fun so im rating it up.. Though you could just get dwarf fortress with a tileset and its well.. More complete :P
3275	1	a	Cut The Rope Acient Edition
691	1	a	Fun game. Somewhat frustrating when things don't work out, but that's board games for you.  The interface is good, it does justice to the original board game. The AI could be improved a bit, they tend towards more obnoxious strategies (like the poker player who goes all-in on almost every hand kind of obnoxious), but again that's computerized board games for you.
3179	1	a	I love this game. Many people have already reviewed Obulis so I'll be short and lazy: it's fun and addictive. Most levels can be beaten by using your brain, but sometimes you'll need much skill to get the perfect timing. If you like billard or 'pÃ©tanque' (french game using hand-thrown metal balls), you will feel things you know... and new things. A really nice and peaceful game.
3340	0	a	Let's see... Costume Quest is one of those games that you may only enjoy if you're 13 yo. or younger, or you just have some serious nostalgia going on... I do hate to not recommend this game, but you can probably tell if its for you by looking at the screenshots. Thats about it.
4385	1	a	I love you 'The Wonderful End of the World', but damn you 'Word Forge'!
1936	1	a	I hid in a bush~ 10/10
3766	1	a	A cute, turn-based adventure from Tim Schaffer's company Double Fine, known for humor-ful games like Psychonauts, Monkey Island, Brutal Legend, etc.  While a bit short, it is just the right length for what it is. The combat is a mix of standard turn-based RPG fare, with a twist. You can make different costumes with materials you find which alter your fighting style.  If you want to relive your days of trick-or-treating, playing make believe, and grabbing all the candy you can, try this one out.
4469	0	a	wont run game. says its running. but i duno where...space prolly. only way to shut it down is ctr-at-del. if anyone knows whats going on help meee.  till then a waste of 10 bucks
5062	1	a	I love this game. It really makes you use your brain :)
1443	0	a	the entire game is you throwing snowballs at penguins if thats not animal cruelty i dont know what is
2005	1	a	 What I liked:      Missions start out easy, but get more difficult later on     Every character has a good use, some are better on certian missions ( I liked the Cleaner)     Has mod support     It's a great stealth game, how many of those exist?   What You Need to Know:      You would be lucky to find anyone playing this game     I tried singleplayer, wasn't bad, just not the true way to play      You need a good team, because you everyone has to escape, so one person can ruin the game    My Score:
2766	1	a	great game, very funny!
5201	1	a	 http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028914/movie480.webm?t=1447358275    i dont play this game too much after i installed this game, i just play few times only but when i leave my PC, i saw my 6 years old daughter play it she look happy and very enjoy playing this  hard to believe it, she can play this without tutorial with more than 800 hours on record playing this game now i am no wonder she can earn all achievements for this game  casual, adventure, puzzle, and very cute characters (tutu,frog, berry,etc) this game is suit for all age  
2523	1	a	There's nothing quite like the experience of tripping an alarm and having to run for your life.
3885	1	a	Another fun title from the folks over at Double Fine. Costume Quest has a lot of charm, as well as some fun silliness just in overall premise. Quite nostalgic to play this game and look back at the Halloween costumes the kids are wearing, Halloween parties, and trick or treating... while trying to hunt out actual monsters/demons who have entered our world. A fun 8-10 hour play through.
4561	1	a	A Tower Defense game with an interesting twist. And the gameplay isn't the only awesome thing this game has to offer: the inter-mission cutscenes, stylized as humorous sci-fi movies from the first half of the previous century are brilliant and well-made.   It may not be very long, but it sure is worth the few â¬ it costs. If you like TD, definitely give it a try.
1255	1	a	Wish it could be better. A fun,well made game,but due to some non implemented features,it could be just better. Still,its a good one to try out.
2052	1	a	Very fun game especially during co-op. Definitely recommended to anyone with a computer.
1091	0	a	The concept is fun and addictive at the start, but in all it doesn't feel like anything more than a Flash game; the only thing it's missing is a Newgrounds logo. It's a well-made game, but most of the levels are just user-made garbage with lots of unfair traps and the physics can be wonky at times. I also got the occasional crash.  Buy this on sale only; it's worth about 3 bucks in my opinion. It's got a good amount of content and the concept is entertaining, but in spirit it feels like any other Box2D Flash game that has been flooding the Internet for free since 2006,
3603	1	a	Short but sweet RPG. Worth your time.
1006	1	a	Great game, very funny, Very good music. I really loved it. Thanks!
2843	1	a	Pac-Man meets Gauntlet in all the best ways!
56	1	a	A cute little puzzle game, but very very VERY short. Recommended if you can pick it up super cheap.
3568	0	a	fryman costume doesn't even transform into frylock/10 i went in expecting something, but after beating the game (both grubbins on ice and the main costume quest) i was given nothing
256	1	a	Of all of the non-Geometry Wars twin-stick shooters, this is becoming one of my favorites. Cool graphics/effects, frantic gameplay and a decent selection of game modes make this a really good game for the price.
416	1	a	God help you. God help you all. That drug addiction you kicked? A nervous tic. If your friends describe you as the poster child for addictive personalities, then just click away and save yourself the glorious, swarming, bullet-hell-esque heart ache.  I won't keep hitting you with vague hyperboles, but you need to check this out while getting it is easy. The value you're getting out of this game for $0.99 is stupid. It's simple, but visually it's surprisingly attractive, and there are several game modes to suit your play style. Perhaps the most accurate way I can paint an image for you is by drawing a parallel with Super Meatboy. It's lacks any sort of story depth that Super Meatboy may have, but it has that same lightning-fast, razor's edge pace that demands every ounce of attention you can possibly wring from your brain. That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.  Minimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics. Get this while it's on sale. Seriously. There is not another game on Steam as of this date that is a better buy for $0.99. If you're reading this later, I feel like it may well be worth the regular $5.00 price tag.
1417	0	a	I have no idea how this abomination got over 600 positive reviews.  Multiplayer only 'arena' shooter with zero multiplayer. Seriously, no one is playing this.  'Arena' is a peanut sized island where you get catapultet into the water and die everytime a returded penguin farts in your general direction.  Rounds end in about 10 seconds because you either get thrown into the water or just commit suicide out of boredom.  No animations - The returded pengiuns just hobble around.  Crap graphics - looks like 3D stock models drawn in paintbrush  Crap physics - It takes my returded pengiun 10 seconds to hurl his retured snowball at another returded pengiun.  Annoying 'Surfs up dood!' 3 second loop music in an arctic themed game.  Probably took me longer to write this review than it took them to make this game.  Only play this if you're a returded pengiun.  Final verdit: Smelly fish
889	1	a	Free - ish. At least you get to try it out a bit for genuine free, but need to cough up if you want to play properly. Fair enough I guess, sort of demo model in a way. Game itself is good, and compared to the price of actual board games, bargain even when have to pay.
2350	1	a	Best played with 3 friends. This game is all about cooperation and strategy, if anything. Totally recommended.
4539	0	a	Was great for 9 generations until the game would not offer a spouse until I was 51, and then they couldn't conceive. The game is over if you don't have any children to pass on to.  All the hours I spent getting to 98% completed on 'trophies' was wiped out.   I wish I had never played this game.
2291	1	a	The game play is challening and rewarding. You'd think there'd be an urge to race to the end but the it's quite fun to challenge yourself and try to 'steal' as much moolah as possible. The co-op play can turn pretty hectic.
3764	1	a	I had so much fun with this game the story is fun and the costume mechanics are awesome. Really looking forward to Costume Quest 2. Don't think twice get this gem of a game.
1928	1	a	  it's very fun multi / single player game :) 9/10
1459	0	a	For a free game it's nice, but it's not a free game.
545	0	a	Way too expensive for what it is and not suited for PC  Buy on iPad and save money
3488	1	a	Very strong story and very fun to play. I suggest this game to anyone who wants to have general fun in their gaming experience.
3274	0	a	Trial and error, oops 2 pixels too soon, sory that't won't do.
1766	1	a	Fit and playing with friends
2243	1	a	An absolutely fantastic game to play locally with 3 of your friends, though I can't quite get my head around why one of us was forced to use a keyboard and mouse rather than a 4th controller. The game's biggest strength is its simplicity; you get your choice of 4 characters (8 by the end) and each has one distinct function, with perhaps one other side function. You take your little team through numerous 3 or 4 level stages and try to steal as much stuff as you can, as fast as you can, while trying not to be seen. We were incredibly bad at it but still managed to finish the main campaign and have 12 hours of fun on a lazy Sunday doing it.  Also, you revive your teammates by pressing against their dead bodies while your character makes a bunch of slurping noises. Just saying.
2165	1	a	Great Game
1121	0	a	This is a $5 version of Happy Wheels. It's not even worth the $5 either. It's not a bad game, because it's stealing for Happy Wheels, but it's not a good game because your losing $5 for something that you can get that's better for free.
2195	1	a	This Is a fun Co-Op game the gameplay can range from hectic to strategic gameplay depending on your friends. It has a tonne of levels and workshop support so you'll never be bored. Best played with friends so I suggest picking up the 4 pack for the best experience
2402	1	a	piano soundtrack is YES!
60	1	a	It's short, it's a fun puzzle game, it looks pretty, the music is good. It's not worth the $7, but if you see it on sale (it regularly goes down by around 70%) then pick it up.  Honestly, it's short. Like, an hour short.
4771	1	a	It's like Kim Swift took the concept of Portal- solving puzzles in first person using a device while you are completely alone save someone talking to you over an intercom system- and added John de Lancie. More games could use John de Lancie. Let's make John de Lancie the new Nolan North. I would like that very much.
4242	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is, in short, a PC clone of Katamari Damacy, so it is easy to just say if you like that style of game you will like this one, but there are some quirks you should know going in.  The idea of the game is simple, you play this walking man made of magnetic balls that when you get near objects of your size or smaller you pull them into you, letting them become a part of your body and making you grow, you keep growing bigger and bigger and your objective is to reach a set score before the timer runs out, this is the main game mode, once you beat all twelve levels you unlock endless modes and whatnot, letting you goof around.  This concept is fine and the game itself is fun but there are some mixed feelings I have for it, to start the sound design leaves much to be desired, basically every item you pick up makes the same sound save for a telephone or something of that nature, all the sounds in game were obviously done on the cheap with what sounds like people making noises with their mouths, but that is not entirely a bad thing and has some charm to it as well.  The music is very well done and as with most Dejobaan games the overall design of the game is well put together, comical and tight, though there are issues that can be nitpicked, the controls are at times quite loose, it is not a very hard game or long either, you can beat the whole game in one sitting (In fact there is an achevement for doing that) and though the levels are very well made with unique art designs, there is very little replay value.  It is impossible to not compare this game to Katamari, but if you do so you will find that Wonderful falls a bit short from reaching that charming and very Japanese series of games, however despite that I still recommend this game, it's a fun time waster, doesn't cost a lot, and has just enough charm in it to get by, not to mention that if you are a fan of Katamari you have very few options on the PC for games like it.
1806	1	a	Unique classes with different abilities, doesnt require a good laptop, fun (especially with friends), but later on gets kinda boring. 7/10
1058	1	a	I want to snuggle inside truck.
4011	1	a	Charming game. Very simple combat. It's a short game, about 6 hours. If the combat was more complex then the game could sustain a longer journey. Fun for a Halloween night.
996	0	a	Clock Work Man (Hidden) I have asked three times for help in the puzzle and nothing. I have restarted three times and still puzzle is not working. Too many hours and a dead end. Now I can't find the refund button, so I'm just going to throw the money away and delete it.
3651	0	a	Nice charm to it, but this game performs terribly. I can max out Dark Souls 2 and BioShock Infinite, but not this game? If the devs fixed this, I'd recommend, but not until then.
2881	1	a	Really fun to play! I actually got into this from people playing it on youtube and it was worth every cent I spent! :) Definitly reccomend
4921	1	a	if you liked the portal games by valve you will like this, more of a physics puzzler. more first person puzzle action then you can handle.
4441	0	a	Little Farm is another one of these 'matching colour' games but this time you will have to match the vegetables. You have to draw squares on your field and in every corner there must be the same vegetable.  The game is easy to learn and not difficult so it's a nice kids game to play with for a few hours but nothing more.   
581	1	a	Based on the brilliant board game. Ticket to ride is a strategic game that puts you in the shoes of a railway tycoon.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4SnHt5A2mk 
5325	1	a	OMG, this game iis freaking awesome! the level design is impressive and interesting!
3116	1	a	A very good stealth game except for the fact it suffers from the same problem all stealth games have: Enemies can find and track you regardless of the mechanics built into the game regarding stealth. It doesn't matter if you just started the level or if you're hiding on the far side of the level, all enemies will converge near on your location and will never leave. Other than that large issue, it's pretty fun.
2685	1	a	i love this game
5296	1	a	You just need to buy this game, it's a really fun game to play.
5072	1	a	Ehhh. Some puzzles are fun. Some are terrible. Worth it if you like puzzle games and it is on sale for a buck or two, otherwise find some free apps somewhere else.
1509	1	a	Sat and played the piano until death.   10/10
2063	1	a	I wish i knew how to be good at this game, becasuse it looks â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cool!
134	1	a	this game sometimes gets me quite annoyed but it's not the game's fault, it's just really hard at times ;) It is constantly installed on my computer and I play it for a while almost every week.. It is cheap and recommended.
3716	1	a	Costume Quest is a role-playng adventure game from Double Fine Productions, where you play as one of two siblings on a mission to rescue the other who has been kidnapped by candy-grubbing monsters on Halloween night.   The game is centered around exploration, item collection, turn-based combat, and minor puzzle-solving. Outside of combat, trick-or-treating is the predominant method of accruing candy, which is spent as currency to purchase 'Battle Stamps'. Battle Stamps enhance your attacks during the combat phases of the game, and a successful battle in turn leads to more candy and other rewards. Also up for collection are the multitude of costumes which give you new special abilities, both in and out of combat. The player can also collect the aptly named 'Creepy Treat Cards' which span from amusing to hilarious to downright disgusting.  The real charm of Costume Quest however, lies with its sole ambition of placing you in the shoes of a child on Halloween night and successfully recreating the atmosphere of magic and spooky fun of All Hallow's Eve. The setpieces are well-chosen, including the oddly familiar haunts of a suburban neighbourhood, a shopping mall, a sleepy village on the outskirts of town, and even a Halloween-themed carnival.   Costume Quest is a labour of love, designed to invoke the memories of Halloweens past, and celebrate them. You can't go back and reexperience Halloween through the eyes of a child, but you CAN play Costume Quest, which is almost as good.  Highly recommended.
1427	0	a	I redownloaded this game after a year so I could play it the one minute longer I needed in order to warn you away. Nobody plays it. The online is dead. Stay away!
3789	1	a	This is a great little game, fun from beginning to end
1193	1	a	I don't recommend this game for adults. You can buy it for your kids, and i 100 percent sure, they will like it.
902	1	a	A free board game with explosive effects. That's about it.
3288	0	a	Guess it's fun to play for a little bit. But then it gets pretty meh.  4/10
3279	1	a	A great underrated puzzle game. Seems hard at first but addicting as all hell once you get a handle on it.
3904	1	a	One really great achievement of Costume Quest is the combination of childhood fantasy stories filled with knights, robots, pirates and such ; the classical gameplay of japanese adventure rpg and the whole spiced-up with humor.  Sure the game might seem short for a grown-up, even too easy or too linear, but that's the kind of game I'd have loved to play when I was a child and one of the most enjoyable I've played recently. Costume Quest was so refreshing after a trail of damn-too-serious or damn-too-hard-core games, I just can't wait to play the second one !  Thanks Double Fine !
4365	0	a	Poorly made Katamari rip-off
2593	1	a	Fun multi or single player stratagy escape game with smooth gameplay and cool 8-bit graphics. A must buy.
957	1	a	A hidden-picture game with a bit of a plot. Pretty light, mostly-filler plot, but plot none the less. It's super-quick--I think I finished it in two whole hours--and is mostly good as a time waster. But it does have lovely pictures.
5093	1	a	It's a good game, but not a perfect one. Gameplay is fun and flexible but a bit slow. The microtransactin store is a joke but it's easy to ignore. Overall, a lot of fun to be had if this is your type of game.
1604	1	a	Awesome game, great multiplayer, and great level editor!
2091	1	a	...
3122	1	a	Morning gentleman. Nice day for a heist, see? NEAH SEE NEAH
3150	1	a	ONE OF THE BEST THERE IS *TRADING CARDS *WORKSHOP *ACHIEVEMENTS *MULTIPLAYER AND CO-OP BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE FUN INDIE GAME MUST PLAY WITH FRIENDS INCLUDES ZOMBIE MODE *GUARANTEED LAUGHS* GREAT COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY VOICE CHAT 10/10 FIVE STARS
4758	1	a	cool!
1378	1	a	BUY THIS PART OF THE ACTION INDIE PACK I love this game i mean..your a customizable penguin whos main goal is to BLOW THE HECK OUT OF OTHER PENGUINS  10/10
4960	1	a	A physics puzzle-platformer with ties to the Portal series both in theme and production (it was directed by Kim Swift, who worked as lead designer on Portal) and though the puzzles in QC are (subjectively) better than Portal's, it lacks any of the latter's charm or personality.  The level design is templated similarly to Portal, with the main character (here a 12-year old boy) moving from room to room in a massive mansion repurposed into a research facility (that is, a mansion repurposed to look like Aperature) with the hero's amnesiac mad scientist uncle playing the part of GLaDOS, instructing him (ie, the main character) through the facility espousing hints, quips, and barbs. Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.  And though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y. I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.  All in all, I'd give it a B  If you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.
2438	1	a	Finish thief game I've played. Its easy to pick up and gets intense instantly. It'll steal your hours away. Be sure to play with friends! That's were the fun is
3142	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. You are guaranteed plenty of frustration and fun. Co-op is the best!
2670	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
4	0	a	It seems cool, it seems nice, but it's a trap. It's not close from being a solid platformer. The music is nice, I must say, but the game is deadly short and Storm is not that easy to control. All the nice mechanics are in the bonus levels. There are some cool parts in the game that are hommages to older games.  It's not worth 5$ at all in my humble opinion.
4155	1	a	Must play. Loving it, loving it, loving it. Addictive, I tell you, Addictive. :)
5221	1	a	I don't pay much attention to this game, but my little daughter loves it. Though she has a hard to time too progress sometimes.   Great game for kids!
4337	0	a	Alright, letâs get the obvious stuff out of the way. Yes this is a katamari rip off, yes the game is short, and yes the gameplay leaves much to be desired. But let me explain my reasoning.  I enjoy the original katamari games, even to this day (Katamari Damacy is one of my favorite PS2 games). They had a feel and a style not many games had at the time of release. I am not sure how many 'katamari' rip offs there are on the PC, but if you are interested in the original idea of katamari, youâre better off getting the original games.  Right from the start of this game, you get a feel for the experience you have ahead of you. I don't want to judge a game from its cover, but all the menu buttons are small spinning circles, and the options menu is just a wall of comic sans-ish text for crying out loud. Once you start a level you will find it is very much like its source material. You roll around, pick up objects smaller then you, work up to larger ones. That is one of the very first of many issues with the game though. In katamari you have a ball to judge what you can and canât pick up, and it works well. Here, when you pick objects up, you absorb them and they sort of morph into a human like shape. This makes it very hard to see what you can and cannot pick up. There are some objects that you are clearly much bigger then, however you cannot pick it up, or vice versa. You also have very limited camera control, and are only allowed basic left and right camera movement. This is not usually a problem, but in some cases it makes it hard to find objects.  Now, on to the music. The Katamari soundtracks were more than memorable, the music in this game, well, not all of it was terrible, but it was nothing great, just general stock music, some that I even recognized. Now I know this game had a much smaller development team then katamari, but it's hard to fill in such large shoes, and since they decided to try, it's only fair that I critique them on it.  Overall I do not recommend this game. I got very little playtime out of it, even though I unlocked every level. Almost every level made me feel like I was trapped in a small box, and there was little to nothing that I could take away from the game, experience wise. And for the current whopping price of $10, itâs a novelty to own at best, a low grade rip off at worst. 
4261	1	a	Sometimes the world ends. What better way to cope with it, than to collect as much worldly things as possible, before the world goes away.
4975	1	a	Now you're thinking with por-... errr, Dimensions!
5406	1	a	If you've played Space Invaders (and who hasn't at some point?) then you already know what this game is about.   That said, it's not a direct clone. There are upgrades you can get, along with some special weapons.   Yeah, I know. This doesn't sound very exciting. Well, it's not the most thrilling game in the world, but it's cheap, easy to play (in that it requires virtually no time commitment), and has extremely low PC requirements. So it's a good little time waster, for those situations where you've got too much time to just sit around, but not enough time to play a more in-depth game.  Something else this game has -- that I really like -- is it saves your game whenever you exit, no matter where you are or what you're doing. It's more of a 'save state' in that your saved game is erased as soon as you load it. There are checkpoints are certain intervals, so if you die you don't need to start from the beginning (but you might have to redo a few levels).  If you've got young kids, this would be a good game for them as well. It's not overly complex and there's no adult themes to worry about.
5355	1	a	Space Invaders
2851	1	a	Great game and even better with friends. Missions are competetive to get the best time and not get seen and get all the coins.
1618	1	a	Dont Look The Trailer Or The Screenshot You Have To Play It By Yourself This Game Was So Awesome
4435	1	a	Casual ball-popping game. Nothing special. Doesn't work on Windows 7 x64.
2275	1	a	enjoyable game play.  simple story, but some how i cant play with my controler :( 
5263	1	a	This is easily one of the best puzzle games, let alone puzzle platformer games, out there, especially for its pricepoint. The level design is consistently solid and new elements and new ways to utilize existing elements are constantly introduced without ever breaking the flow of gameplay and without feeling the slightest bit handholdy. There is an immense sense of discovery to every aspect of the game as shortcuts and hidden paths are constantly present and it is up to the player to decide where to go and to discover how to best use everything the game presents them with. The game also does a great job of adjusting to the player's skill level (or the player's desired difficulty) as there is always a clear path to take, but harder, hidden routes through the game's world are ever-present for players who wish to discover all that this game has to offer.  With its excellent sense of physical and mechanical exploration and puzzles which range from fairly easy to outright diabolical, Toki Tori 2+ is a game which puzzle fans should leap at the chance to play as soon as they can.
5265	1	a	This is a fun puzzle game. You are a cute little bird who goes through different levels and tries to find a way around different obstacles, without dying. Really colourful and nice to look at. the levels become more difficult. fun for casual play and simple to learn, only 2 buttons to use.
88	1	a	Nice short puzzle for everyone who enjoys a to tinker a bit. Made with love and features an original paper art!
3530	1	a	One of the best games that i played in my life. Alot of adventrues and fun.
3466	1	a	A great little Game from DoubleFine! The graphics are simple but the style is one of the best with its cell shading-look. The Fighting-system isn't too complex but it is enough to keep you away from boredom. The story isnt complicated but well told. If you like action_adventures with level-you-character-up and collect-some-things mechanics AND with humor, this is for you!
2991	1	a	Fun top-down Ocean's Eleven simulator where nothing is left to chance. Although guards and civilians are dense and forgetful you'll have a hard time bypassing sensors, dogs, turrets and other death-dealing devices public buildings shouldn't have. Very good and forgiving difficulty curve although you'll need some brute force (C4 and guns) to wipe out obstacles in the last levels; especially if you're playing solo. Great for couch co-op but the graphics are so tiny and detailed you'll want to push your couch a little closer to the TV.
1455	0	a	I want you to imagine Team Fortress 2, in that this is a competitive, team-based multiplayer first-person shooter.  Except you're all penguins, and there are 4 teams.  And it costs money.  Also, it's a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5467	1	a	Old skool space invaders clone thingy.
3694	1	a	Terrific Halloween-themed RPG (Final Fantasy style) with a free Arrested Development reference included.
3263	1	a	This is a very challenging game, it takes a lot of attention to detail, timing, a little luck, and a ton of patience to get all achievements completed.  It is very simple graphicaly, but I found this was a good thing, as it didn;t distract you from trying to obtain the obhectives.  I would deffinatly recommend this game to any puzzle lovers out there.
242	1	a	 I beat a high score and the game's narrator said 'whatever.' 11/10   A really tight twin stick shooter. The graphics, music, interface are marvelous. The menus are peppered with snarky remarks.  The gameplay itself is highly enjoyable and offers several modes that suit differen't people's tastes.  Highly recommended for fans of twin stick shooters.  PS. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode.
5428	1	a	I got this in a humble bundle and I'm glad I did! This is a good retro themed game, pretty fun!
3562	0	a	 This review explains how Double Fine's  Costume Quest  is a shallow, repetitive, featureless example of the RPG adventure game genre.
509	0	a	The latest update of this game is a real let down. It worked wonderfully before. As many folks have indicated, the AI is horrid. Previous AI was more human like. All it does is lay down tracks. I don't think I've seen the AI pick additional destination tickets aside from the first ones it picks. I wish there was a setting for choosing the AI's pattern/thought. Why did they feel the need to update?  As it is, I can't recommend it. The board game itself is great, but I don't enjoy it like I did before the update.
5361	1	a	A nice new take on Space Invaders / Shmup. Lots of very quick levels, upgradeable ship, smooth graphics. Good to pick up in the discounted Ultra Bundle.
3325	1	a	 Costume Quest  is a Double Fine RPG set around Halloween where by some magical intervention, your character and his or her friends gain the ability to transform into super powered versions of their costumes to save your sibling who has been mistakenly kidnapped as a result of dressing in a terrible candy costume.  It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.  It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having 'random encounters' limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood. It fits into the game's world organically, so I can appreciate that.
4255	1	a	Everyone says this game is bad, but fails to forget its an indie game and a good one at that.  The main thing you'll be doing in this game is walking over things that are smaller than you and absorb them, making you bigger, when you get to a certain size, you complete the level.   I can honestly say, I had a blast playing this cheap little game.
4301	1	a	katamari damacy, without that complicated ball rolling mechanic. also without the really great music or warm sense of humor. this is still a decent budget game.
4303	1	a	First of all, they say this game heavily resembles Katamari Damacy, a Playstation 2 game, but I haven't played that one: that makes me kind of an independent reviewer.  Basically, one could describe The Wonderful End of the World as a game where you grow bigger by grabbing stuff to eventually grab even bigger stuff. You can only grab things that are smaller than you, so beginning small, you will soon discover by growing that the levels are a lot bigger than initial view grants. You move around with keys and mouse (that I used) or gamepad, the initial obstacles becoming grabbing material soon enough.  Challenge is to grow big fast enough, given a time frame, but this is easy enough after a couple of tries. There are also a couple of achievements to find and collect special stuff like dinosaurs and giant gorillas.  It looks nice and the gameplay is fun enough, but what really gets me is the music. Funky, funny verses are a very nice background. While a decent game, sadly, there's only things to do for a couple of hours before seeing it all. Because of that I'd say to get it when it's on sale.
3923	1	a	Don't really know what to say... It's funny, it's cute and it's very fun to just play and chill, forget about things. It has a 'warm' feeling to it, just purely enjoyable.
822	1	a	not a fan of the update, but this game is okay. can't afford the boardgame, so I'm happy with the digital version which is waaay cheaper (only 10% of the boardgame price)
4916	1	a	done by the creator of portal, a device that changes dimensions and a glados type character voiced by star treks Q
1490	1	a	You can pee in the middle of the heist and seduce zombies with a redhead.
349	1	a	This is one of the best games that I have purchased under $5. Waves is Very Addicting and Intense. While the Soundtrack is outstanding. I highly recommend this game as I have over 10+ hours into it.   Final Verdict 10/10
2786	1	a	It may look dumb, but so did Hotline Miami and boy! Was I wrong about that game as well. Just give it a try if your reading this while its still on sale or maybe consider buying later on the full price if you missed the sale.
1598	1	a	Very fun game, played a few hours so far. Reminds me a lot of Hotline Miami, but with a slower pace that makes it easier to play. I love the idea of having four specialized characters that each have a different skill. It is fun to sneak around, knock out guards, hack computers and security systems while stealing money.
63	1	a	For what it is, it's not bad.  If I had to critisise it on any point it would be that it's pretty short.  There's a sequel out now called Lumino City that I haven't played, so I don't know if it lasts longer and how much it adds to Lume's story.  The strongest point of this game is the paper cut-out look of it and if you like puzzlers you'll like this one.  Purely based on the length of this one, I'd say only grab it if it's on sale or if you don't mind it being short.
3592	1	a	This is a great SNES type of RPG. It plays exactly like Earthbound, but graphically updated. It isn't a long game, but it is worth the price. There are some side quests, but there isn't anything to do, once you beat the game.   Rating: 8/10
2198	1	a	Fantastic fun! 10/10 would play always haha
204	1	a	This was my first dual stick game, it is also my favourite for relaxing. The music and the colours just keep the player mesmerised. There is a score cap but can you reach it?!
3052	1	a	10/10 would write review again
4546	1	a	A very clever yet obscure puzzle game. I would definitely try this if you are considering.
2158	1	a	its great plebs
5454	1	a	it's basically a spin-off of space invaders with thier own little twist, btw it's addicting as â¥â¥â¥â¥
3652	1	a	Costume Quest with its add-on Grubbins on Ice is a nice Halloween-themed almost-RPG. It's, in one word, candy. I like candy.  I highly recommend using a controller with this game. Keyboard controls felt pretty odd.  Achievement Hint:   The game doesn't know the date. It asks your machine for the date.    + Creepy Treats (collectibles) design + Non-irritating but forgettable music + Back To The Future discovery sound + Costumes with exploration effects in addition to battle effects + Costume battle action design 0 no map 0 Mostly inconsequential Battle Stamps (buffs) 0 Level caps - Incorrect Battle Stamp descriptions - Pretty linear - Almost consistently no challenge - No description on save slots when loading - After the main game we see the credits headlined 'Grubbins on Ice'  Technically the game is about quasi-isometric exploration with battle intermezzi. The battles are similar to those associated with RPG-Maker games or for example Final Fantasy 7 but instead of action meters there is simply a battle order. Without fail, first your up to three character attack, then the up to three enemies - repeat until defeat.  Although this may sound dry, the game is surprisingly fun. I played the game for maybe 11 hours, got stuck twice for a total of about 90 Minutes (misunderstood game mechanics in the beginning + final boss in the add-on) and it was entertaining enough to feel like around 4 hours. This is mostly due to a number of good design decision. For me, the game wasn't so much about the main storyline but more about your party of characters speaking with each other, other inhabitants of the area and enemies, and it was about the battles. For some reason those things made me think, I'd like to play this in a Spongebob Squarepants world, at one point.  In order of relevance the advancements in the game are: gaining companions, completing new costumes and getting Battle Stamps. Ultimately progress in the game requires the player to win fights (actually you go trick-or-treating but half the time that results in fights) but there are a number of obstacles that require you to explore beforehand.  *Companions* Companions come with a new costume and provide an extra action per round in battle.  *Costumes* You get costumes with characters or you are given a blueprint which sort of tells you, by way of a somewhat indiscriminate outline, which three components/materials you need to complete the costume. Components are unique and can be found in more or less hidden treasure chests, given to you by inhabitants of the world, and maybe, I don't quite remember, be part of battle spoils. Once a costume is complete, it can be assigned to any of your characters. Half of the costumes come with an Exploration Ability, i.e. an ability that can and (with the exception of one costume in the add-on) must be used in the exploration part of the game. The most important ability is the Boost that you get with your very first costume. The Boost allows your party to speed across the area and is essential to the pacing of the game. At one point or another, the player is likely to miss something plus there is a little back and forth in the game anyway. Without the Boost ability that could have easily turned into a chore - very good design decision. All of the costumes but one have a Combat Ability, i.e. a special that needs two battle rounds to load and can be executed instead of a normal attack. Apart from having an effect on game-play the costumes just look cool. Even if there wasn't an achievement connected to that I'd still recommend to take every costume into battle at least once. I simply like the progression of the costumes from the materials you have to collect over the (not really) crappy 'not quite there' or 'Dad did the best he could' design of the costume as the characters are wearing it in exploration mode to the awesome 'this is how the kids see it' (or maybe 'this is what adult think how the kids see it') design in battle, character design and attacks.  *Buffs* Battle Stamps are buffs that can be assigned to your party's characters, one each. Buffs include boosts to health, defence, dodging, counter-attacks, the over-powerful stun and the underwhelming auto-revive - usually buffs are passive. I basically stuck to the same buffs throughout the game, occasionally upgrading when a better version of the buff turned up. Unfortunately, some of the buffs have misleading descriptions, most irritatingly the auto-revive is supposed to revive a character after one round. While this is technically correct a more apt description would explain, the character is revived after two rounds (one round after one round, see?). I only ever tried the buff when I had trouble with the final boss in the add-on and having a character inactive for two rounds is just unacceptable in that fight.  *Collectibles* The Creepy Treats are mostly just nice-to-have. You collect them mainly as battle spoils and sometimes trade them with inhabitants. I guess they are mostly original ideas, e.g. Licorice Cables, Chocolate Hamburgers, Coconuts &amp; Bolts, Misfortune Cookies.  *Battles* As said before, each round in battle has your character(s) act first, then the up to three enemies. Usually, rounds go on until one side is defeated. In theory, there is an option to run away but I haven't tried it yet. Each round each character chooses one of standard attack, the costume's Combat Ability (if ready) or the Battle Stamp buff (if active). Standard attacks have QTEs connected to them. There is a number of different QTEs, i.e. hitting a specific, dynamic button in time, hitting a specific, dynamic button on time, moving the left analogue stick around, and repeatedly pressing a specific, dynamic button. The type of QTE is dependent on the costume. If you pass the QTE, the character deals 50% more damage. Combat Abilities need two rounds to load so they can be used every third round. They are usually a tactical option and it's not always useful to use them right away. For some reason, attack buffs do not affect Combat Abilities. This may even make the standard attack a preferable option overall. Some Battle Stamp active buffs can be executed instead of a standard attack. Of those the most powerful are likely the different stun abilities which can take a single enemy out of the fight for up to two rounds. Except for bosses, the later game can be played without ever getting hit by an enemy. This is very powerful since even a 'failed' enemy attack can take as much as 25% of a characters live away. Some Combat Abilities can prevent almost all damage to characters. Enemies mostly do standard attacks which lead to a defensive QTE which, on success, prevents half of the damage to the character. Magically inclined enemies can heal, buff attack or defence of one of the enemies. Battles are pretty short and easy but fun, largely because of the costumes.   *Game Experience* A few more words on the game. One of the rather negative aspects about the game is its linearity. Bring me this and that or you cannot go on, fight those guys or you cannot go on, complete a costume or you cannot go on. But this is well compensated by the entertainment factor. Even though of limited use, I'd have liked a map to come with each area. This was sort of addressed in the add-on where you gain the ability to zoom out a bit with a costume. The game was a bit on the easy side. When loading/continuing a previous savestate the game doesn't tell you anything about the progress made. The game simply lists 'Slot 1', 'Slot 2' and 'Slot 3'. There isn't even an indication whether the slot actually contains any saved progress. This is a minor ugliness.  I had a lot of fun with Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice and highly recommend the game. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.
2582	1	a	Beautiful game, but too much stupids player. it ruin the game
2646	1	a	Such a fun game! -Must play with friends -Cheap -Unique artstyle Overall great game
2906	1	a	Pretty good, but lacks content
1607	1	a	A top-down retro-styled thief 'em up, Monaco has a delightful soundtrack and makes a fun co-op game with the right people. By yourself you may find yourself playing far more cautiously and conservatively, fully exploiting the bag of tricks provided to you, but Monaco is at its most fun with 3 friends played as a hectic anything goes heist.  Difficulty curve for solo players may provide quite steep at times, especially the need to 'clear out' levels to advance the more interesting plot (which is well worth exploring right to the end to fully appreciate the whole story), while co-op with randoms is, as expected, a hit-or-miss experience.
5133	1	a	It is like Dwarf fortress meets Dungeon Keeper. Fun and frustrating.
5338	1	a	Who get the kill? Titans or you?  Titan Attacks is an retro 2D game about Titans attacking earth. The title is based on the convention of the old game 'Space Invaders' from 1978. Your quest is to destroy incoming race by moving the cannon to the left-right while shooting. Easy? Not really. The enemies want to destroy your cannon by shooting and getting closer to you. You need to be really fast and precise to finish every wave without a scratch. The game brings a lot of fun and give you the possibility to work on some abilities like reflex, focus and patience.  So who wins? You and your cannon or the whole Titan race?  Besides the main goal to destroy incoming enemies you also have many things to do in the game. With the next waves aliens becomes stronger and stronger so you have to upgrade your cannon by increasing rate, power or adding special weapons. On every planet the last wave is the boss level so you need to destroy the mothership to go further. Also there's a challenge stage where you can win special prizes and bonuses.  It's not an easy task to finish the game. I played a lot (^ hours) and right now I haven't completed the last 'Titan' level of difficulty at the end - boss is too strong :) But I'm ranked in global Top 30 ^^  + demanding game based on the idea of Space Invaders + has it's individual style + nice fun with friends and  + online statistics and friends comparison  + good balance for cannon upgrades + brings memories of old gaming + unlimited game time + checkpoints after completing every planet  Small bugs that could be fixed: - controller is partly supported - there's a lack of Pause and Exit button
4691	1	a	science is awesome give it a try!
4478	1	a	Undemanding little puzzle game good for playing in a spare moment  63/100   
1673	1	a	This is by far my favourite 2d game i have ever played, i find the graphics are very easy to look at and both the gameplay &amp; storyline are great :)

3453	1	a	Costume Quest is a Halloween-themed and RPG-ish adventure game with adorable graphics, detailed levels and thoroughly humorous dialogues.  The story is rather simple: Your brother/sister gets kidnapped by candy-stealing monsters, so it's all up to you to rescue him/her and save Halloween.  Over the course of the game you collect various costumes, each with it's own special ability, which you can equip on any of the 3 characters of your 'squad' to be as efficient as possible during the combat sequences.  By collecting candy that is scattered throughout the levels you can also purchase battle stamps, which work as perks for your costumes and can enhance them with various abilities to make you even more powerful.  The quests lack quite a bit of variety so, even though the levels vary, the quests themselves feel pretty repetitive after a while, but all in all it is a widely enjoyable game which sould keep you entertained for a solid 7-8 hours. I recommend to play it with a Xbox360 pad.
4980	1	a	An amazing game with clever puzzles, a brilliant voice actor, and the worst ending to a game since Borderlands. Seriously, that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ending made me wish I had never played the game. 7/10
3749	1	a	Cute, cute, cute! Absolutely adore this game, from start to finish! Combat style is fun, even though it does get a bit repetitive getting closer to the end, but generally is very enjoyable. I actually kind of wish there were more bosses that were harder, like the end bosses. I'm very satisfied with this game, though I would really like to see Costume Quest 2!
171	1	a	After buying this game for $1 on sale, I have played quite a bit, and I enjoy it. the negative reviews keep getting stuck on the fact it needs internet connection, and one reviewer sounds like he was pretty stoned when he was playing, 'hands shaking'. Its a good, cheap puzzle game that is well made, cheaply priced and very addictive. if you like puzzles, try this out. if your stoned with shaky hands, try a Booster Juice drink.
3331	1	a	Costume Quest - unusual game with RPG and quest elements in the entourage f Hellowen and cartoonish design. Gameplay is divided into exploring, collection and fighting. Here the protagonist turns into a powerful robot that solves all the problems of apostates. Overall, not bad. Fans of the genre can take on any given day.

348	1	a	in the first few minutes its like 'hey wow, not bad', but as soon as u understand the game mechanics this game just become mindblowing, also it just looks stunning.  10/10 worth every penny
2917	1	a	The most fun I've had playing co-op in years. Solo challenges are fun but best with 2-3 friends running around the level causing havoc and rushing through and grabbing all the gold. Such a blast. Buy it and text me. I'll play it again and again.
1706	1	a	the only 2d bank heist game.
444	1	a	Solid twin shooter with the amazing artist Smiletron providing one of the best chip tunes sound tracks ever. Would buy again just for the music alone.
5077	0	a	Basically an abandoned early-access game, A Game of Dwarves had a lot of potential, but is left poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. Seemingly inspired by the much better 'Dwarf Fortress', A Game of Dwarves sought to improve upon it with better graphics, only to fall short in every other area. It can be fun to build in, or stripmine, as suits your moods, but there's no strategic depth and any of the levels can be beaten almost blindfolded (which is how your dwarves behave half the time). Overall, it can be fun to waste some time in, but I can't recommend you purchase it.
5109	1	a	Goofy, fun and at times challenging. Good fun!
2212	1	a	Absolutely must buy. The soundtrack is simply amazing, the layouts keep the challenge refreshing, and there is no reason anybody wouldn't like this game. It's simply that good.
169	1	a	This is a great puzzle game, joining coloured cubes together to make combo's. Personally I think its a brilliant game to unwind with. Kind of another take on Tetris.  There are also several game modes and you'll be suprised how as you rank up the levels intense it can get to match those combos to stop it all from exploding.
2747	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
2692	1	a	Best co-op games what I've ever played!
3176	1	a	Great Ball on Ball Action 10/10 Better Puzzle game then Portal
1835	1	a	Monaco is the first game Iâve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.
4620	0	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥. Ridiculously biased phisics. Dont buy waste of money.
4124	0	a	Please just don't waste your money on this game, the overall game play of it is horrid, there is no real functionality to this or anything.
4663	1	a	The problem is, author F. Scott Fitzgerald didn't see the Jazz Age as all about hip music and sparkly clothes. He associated the entire period with materialism ('I want things! Lots of things!') and immorality. For many of the post-World War I era's newly wealthy, materialism and immortality were the name of the game. The novel's star is Jay Gatsby, a young, rich man in love with a society girl from his past. A girl who, as it happens, is married to someone else.  And that's not the only reason why Gatsby still feels fresh today. The novel's very title has become a kind of buzzword for periods of excess and fake luxury. The economic collapse of 2008 brought back distant and unwelcome memories of the stock market crash of 1929, casting the boom times of the 1990s and early 2000s as the modern-day version of the Roaring Twenties.  In both cases, though, unsustainable boom times led to devastating crashes with profound cultural consequences. In the 1920s, it had been a bubble in stocks that brought easy prosperity, while in our own time the bubble had been in the housing market. In both times, easy money meant that many people could begin to dream of living out their days like Jay Gatsby, with life as just one grand party in a seersucker suit. But as that vision of easy luxury crashed and burned (in both 1929 and 2008), newfound hard times required a redefinition of the American Dream.  And while Gatsby is a work of fiction, Fitzgerald's real life contains some suspicious similarities. (Gulp.) Narrator Nick Carraway is both mesmerized and disgusted by Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle, just as Fitzgerald claimed to feel about the 'Jazz Age' excesses that he himself adopted. As an Ivy League educated, middle-class Midwesterner, Fitzgerald (like Nick) saw through the shallow materialism of the era. But (like Gatsby) Fitzgerald came back from World War I and fell in love with a wealthy southern socialite.
2896	1	a	You'll find yourself in hilariously chaotic situations when playing with friends, totally recommendable.
308	1	a	Okay, this is nothing short of amazing. It's a Williams game - Defender, Tempest, Robotron 2084. It's pure evil, and it wants to hurt you. Probably laugh while it's doing it, too.  Gorgeous graphics, an excellent selection of very different gameplay modes (an unexpected and very welcome touch!). This has one-more-go hard-wired into its DNA. It's brutally addictive.  The graphics, though lush and lovely, never get in the way of what's going on. The colours do trick you sometimes. You think you're heading for a green bomb pad, but no, it's a virus cluster of nearly the same shade.  Slo-mo helps, but is in short supply. The bomb mechanic takes some getting used to and doesn't always work. One time, the voice started saying 'Bomb ready', but the combo had dropped (and with it, the bomb) before she'd even said the two words.  I paid 79p for this game. Honestly, if that decimal place had been moved two places to the right, I still would have thought I got a brilliant bargain.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
5054	1	a	Hardcore Puzzle   Destroy The Brain  10/10
23	0	a	Repetitive... good for a mobile, got this game in a bundle so.. 6/10
4053	1	a	So bought this game years ago for a buck or something like that. I gotta say it's pretty sweet. I don't have any of the bugs other users reported, game is fluent and i can play for hours without a crash what so ever. It is only one table yeah, but you get to choose between four characters if you will and therefor you get some different objectives during the game.  For the price i bought it for it is defenitely a good game and like every good Pinball game a real timekiller.

5314	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is the exploration of a metroidvania distilled down into pure joy. Instead of being a pure puzzler like the first game, #2's challenge lies in learning how things interact, and then using that knowledge to keep moving forward.   Nearly all of the normal annoyances of this type of game are averted -  Rewind time to the last checkpoint at any time, don't even need to open a menu. Checkpoints are placed amazingly well. I have yet to have to walk more than a single screen to retry a puzzle. It teaches you one thing at a time, then twists it to make it interesting, then combines it with other things you've learned to make it challenging. It TEACHES, never TELLS. Nothing is worse than having to sit through 3 minutes of the game telling you all about the move or tool you just obtained. Toki Tori 2 hasn't done this to me.  Nothing is better in a metroidvania than coming back to an area and realizing that there's a puzzle you missed, but it was hidden in plain sight. Toki Tori 2 just keeps doing it to me, and it's wonderful.  I expected a simple timewaster and I got a very solid metroidvania.
980	0	a	Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye.
3869	1	a	This is a great little game.  You can finish it in 7 hours easily. 3 hours for the Grubbins on Ice add-on. This is not a con.  In fact this is proof that a great little game with lots of personality can be a good product. Not everything has to be a 50 million dollar epic 100 hour RPG! Don't let this fool you though, there are lots of cool things to find, collect and do as you play through the story.  This game has all the great traits of a Double Fine game. - well written - personality - good mechanics - highly enjoyable  It is the perfect length for the story and mood of the game. Any longer and the mechanics of the fighting would have been too repetitive.  This is good example of a smaller downloadable game executing really well. Check it out for some light hearted fun!
452	1	a	a fun little bullet-hell for you to enjoy, as always the game starts of simple at first but then evolves into something where every second counts and one wrong step could end that perfect score of yours
2487	1	a	A high octane, visually pleasing, pixel crime adventure. A game that is most enjoyed with groups of friends.
2273	1	a	If you like peforming daring heists while avoiding contact with night guards, Then Monaco is the game for you. Trying to stay hidden is challenging, and if you're a noob like me, you're going to get caught. But once you do, it ads a whole layer of intense fun to this game. I recomend this game to anyone who likes heists and keping quiet.
4323	1	a	The closest thing you will get to a Katamari game on PC that isn't emulated. It's really short but I'd say worth the money. It isn't as good as Katamari and only maybe two levels are really large.
430	1	a	Simple but the best game you can get with that amount of money.Very fun and it's basically a very good chill game.
538	1	a	This was an excellent game! I played the board game version for years before I played this game and it's a really fun way to play on the go!
620	1	a	I love the Europe map. It's the first one I played in real life and still gets played to this day!
146	1	a	Tetris/Columns, but in 3D with you having no control over the slowly rotating chunk of blocks - all you can do is decide where to place the next coloured cube adjacent to another cube's side. If 4+ cubes of the same colour connect, they pop.  The lack of control of the orbit is an absolutely fantastic mechanic - it reduces the frustrating navigation other 3D block matches have suffered and allows the player to focus purely on placement.  Did I mention powerups too?  Absolute gem of a puzzler!
2002	1	a	This is a good video game
2414	1	a	Its great because you can choose how you want to play: Do you want nobody to notice you? Do you want to finish the level as fast as Sanic? well you can... Infact you can be sanic and be stealthy.
511	0	a	I have played this game for ov er three years and love it. Then someone decided to make this game harder to play and even egt on to it if you have an older v ersion of software . I cannot get on tho the qame today when i click on play . Yesterday I must have lucked out and foun \d the right combinAtion after many tries. I have noticed that when i WAS PLAYINFG NO ONE LIKED THE NEW SET UP' I HAVE NOT WON A GAME ON IT YET BECAUSE I NEV ER KNEW HOW MANY OF THE COPORED TICKETY\S I HAD TO USE. THE ONLY WAY I GOT ON IT THE FIRST DAY WAS BECAUSW\E i HAD HELP FROM AN IT MAN. iT DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY IT SAYS BECVAUSE i HAVE cHROME , SO I HAVE DELETED CHROMWE AND IT STILL SAYS i HAVE CHROME . NOT A HAPPY PLAYER ANYMORE . hARD TO RECOMEND THIS GAME IN THE PRESENT STATE .
3222	0	a	Oh it's just Cut the Rope  man
4414	1	a	This is your typical Match 3 like Bejeweled. In each level, you match up 3 or more stones of the same color to reach your goal. There are also extra objectives on each level, like making a match with a certain color in a designated spot. There are different powers to get that you can charge up and use which make the game a little easier. Lots of secrets to unlock. As you progress, you get stones to help build a wonder.  The graphics are quite colorful. The music is non-offensive. No complaints about the controls.  Not a bad little match 3. These don't keep my interest for long, but this had enough going on for it that if I wanted to play something like that, I might as well pick it. Recommended if you like Match 3 puzzle games and are looking for more.  Grade: B-
4816	1	a	he's in a conundrum
3715	1	a	Fun game to pass the time just enough of a story for the battle system not to get old. Kind of nice concept of candy collection feels like the old school ps1-2 games of item collection to upgrade.
1912	1	a	The ending of this game is very possibly literally and clinically â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Otherwise, it's a fantastic and fun piece of work with a totally baller soundtrack.
112	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I don't want to have to think too hard, but still want to challenge myself. The controls are simple and easy to use even on a touch pad. This is one of my favorite mindless puzzle games to go to for relaxation. It is easy to get sucked in and just start a new game over and over again until you have spent hours on the game without realizing it.
3455	1	a	I have so much love for this game :D
2705	1	a	Great game! Very unique game style. I love the retro colorful graphics. Definitely a very fun experience! I wish more of my friends owned it so I could do co-op with them! haha
3018	1	a	It's a really fun game to play with friends, you don't have to be really good at games to get the hang of Monaco, you can find a person that fits your playstyle and stick with it and have fun.
3374	1	a	This is a very cute little game. Nothing special or brilliant, but definitely mindless entertainment. Very sweet.
5170	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is a mixed bag of fun and frustrating; quirky and buggy.   Drawing heavily from Dungeon Keeper, AGoD puts you in charge of a group of dwarves in a small mine. In each mission you expand your starting location by digging outwards and downwards, building new room types to supply your dwarves and advance your settlement.   As you explore further, uncovering new minerals that unlock new rooms and upgrades, you encounter increasingly deadly enemies. AGoD has you constantly juggling between exploration and training so that your military dwarves can always handle what's around the next tunnel bend.   Problems start with the interface. A substandard UI and poor camera controls are mentally taxing. This wouldn't be such a problem except that the campaign missions become obviously uninspired as time passes.   Campaign missions involve digging your way to Spot X, and then digging your way to Spot Y, but this can be frustrated with the way the developers 'walled-in' objectives with impenetrable rock. This often means digging around for a long time, juggling the poor camera controls, just to find the entrance.   Still, there is fun to be had, especially if you can let go of the campaign and focus on building and creativity.   In the end, I can only recommend AGoD to hardcore Dungeon Keeper fans and those who enjoy building epic projects in sandbox environments.   
3965	1	a	Fun game. .... Ok, fine, here's more about it. In this game, you pick either a brother or a sister. You fight enemys that stole your brother or sister. Transforming costumes are involved. Threads the line of silly and dramatic
3295	1	a	Great little physics puzzle game. Some mind buggling puzzles involving timing things just right that feel great when you finally nail them.
5303	1	a	This game surprised me. I basically bought it because it looked cute, and cute games don't terrify me, but it's all a lie. This is a game where you are forced to make characters eat each other in order to accomplish your goals, so it's not as cute as it looks. Anyway, I really enjoy it. It's very freeform, and it's fun to have to figure out what to do next instead of having a clearly defined mission. It's like life. This game has kept me entertained for a VERY long time, and it truly is addicting.
292	1	a	Can be played using WASD for movement and the mouse for aiming the firing solution but it may be better to use a control pad with dual analog sticks. The game is great if you like things like Geometry Wars. There is a mode where you don't run out of lives but instead try to score as much as you can in the time limit. The music is great.
2074	1	a	I walked through an entire manison for the goal to find the mysterious golden vase. We entered the building and spent 2 hours fighting through hundreds of enemies. We died so many times but we got up to finish the mission we came to do. We made it to the final boss and spent 30 minutes fighting him while crying everytime a team mate died. Once he fell over a gold vase came out of his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Inside the vase read-Kick me nudes 609-619-7348
684	1	a	As a fan of the board game, I knew what to expect from this version. I already have it on tablet format for casual play, but picked this version up in a Humble Bundle earlier this year. Suffice to say, the game plays well, although some of the fun of the physical board game is lost.  Ticket To Ride is one of those board games that has a perfect blanace of skill and luck, making it easy to pick up the mechanics of for newcomers, and full of tactical play style for dab hands. Do you play to complete your destinations, or to sabotage others from achieving theirs? The choice is yours. The varied expansions take the basic game and add new elements, and maps, to offer a different experience. When played against other human opponents, games can be unpredictable, and immense fun.  As a substitute to the board game, for casual play when no friends around to play with, the game does the trick. The interface is clear and well laid out, and the rules are easy to access. Whilst a physical copy will always be enjoyed more, this digital version is ideal for diversions when sat in front of the keyboard.
1523	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.  In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.  The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.
5306	1	a	Fun little game - often on special too for the whole bundle - see my video first impression here:          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  &nbsp;
2794	1	a	Best robbery game EVER! I love all the carecters and all there specile abillites. 1 thing i dislike is dat pick pocking allways allerts gaurds. 
1976	1	a	Whether a casual pick up and go gamer or a hardcore computer wizard, Monaco has something for everyone. With a gentle learning curve but a painfully difficult proficiency requirement near the end of the campaign coupled with the arcade feel and deceptively intricate classes, this game holds appeal for those both playing for fun and those looking to leave no coin behind.
3883	1	a	Now that I've beaten Costume Quest and the Grubbins on Ice DLC expansion I feel that I can review it properly. This game was fantastic! I don't beat many of my games because of time constraint, so it speaks a lot to a game when I actually finish it. This game was a fantastic nostalgic trip. Its an awesome adventure game by DoubleFine (those guys rock). In this game, whatever haloween costume you are wearing you transform into for battle. Great game! ~PR0XIDIAN
3141	1	a	By far the most fun stealth game I've played.  Loads of content bring lasting fun for new and experienced players alike. Perfect for solo, online, and couch play!
1489	1	a	Monaco is an excrutiatingly difficult 4-player co-op fast-paced stealth game played from a top-down perspective with many unique characters to play as.  While it starts simple, this game becomes progressively more complex and challenging, demanding your crew to have great spatial awareness, a lot of patience, wit, and most importantly, synchronization. Violence is only a countermeasure when there's no other way to solve a dangerous problem (like an alert) and supplies are very limited. Each crewmate can only hold one type of item and stocks of it are only generated by collecting many coins, forcing teams to prioritize coin collection to a certain individual depending on the item and the map being played.  Overall, a very fun and addicting game, completely recommended.
4763	1	a	Not quite as good as portal, but still a warm feel-good game, even if the dreaded first person platform element is more fiddly than it should be.

59	1	a	This game is fantastic! Fun puzzles and a fanciful animation style left me wanting more!
266	1	a	Back in the days when I just purchased this game, I wrote the following in my recommendation:  'Waves is rather funny, in fact. It's a good casual game to kill some minutes of your day, if you like shooting, running away from multiple enemies and dropping megabombs to make a rainbow of sparky explosions. It reminds me of old 2D games representing some spaceships rushing through hordes of aliens or asteroids with their Big, Terrible Guns. Also, after each game you will receive some witty remark from the devs; their sense of humour is... remarkable.'  There's not been really much to add since; I'd just say that buying the game gives you rather little advantages. The other music tracks that are not available in the demo are actually quite dull; as for the other game modes, they do add some difference and new experience to the gameplay, but generally the demo version of Waves fulfills its time-killer functions exactly as nicely as the paid one.
2856	1	a	Its a really fun game and great for a Inde game. However from time to time it can give you a couple issues (The Whole Screen is Issuey 
3522	1	a	A bit repetitive, but cute and fun for the short time it lasts.
4597	1	a	A novel take on tower defense. Your defenses are fixed in orbits, each of which can be separately rotated as needed. In each level you must balance resources, research, and defense. Feels pretty casual but can be challenging at times.

3787	1	a	This game captures the feeling of Halloween perfectly. It's also a great RPG where your costumes are your classes. Some of the attacks - such as Statue of Liberty's National Anthem - are hilariously over-the-top.
5506	1	a	Titan Attacks! is a blatant Space Invaders rip-off, but it's a really good one! The game has gorgeous, retro-themed graphics and effects, local and online leaderboards, controller support, upgrades, achievements and Steam trading cards... and all of this comes with a budget-title pricetag! Anyone who likes a good, ol'-fashioned arcade-style shooter should consider getting this game!
2098	1	a	CAN SOMEONE BUY THIS GAME FOR ME WHEN ITS ON SALE pwease pwease pwease with a cherry on TOPA
833	1	a	Love this - made my Mom rage quit!
5164	0	a	Horribale Never Get it I want MY $$$$ BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!
4032	1	a	 This is the best game I have ever played!
5370	1	a	This riff on Space Invaders is a cool mashup, adding in Galaga-style patterns and other classic arcade riffs. If you're on a roll the game can last, but it's also great as a quick adrenaline rush. Lots of fun!
2392	1	a	There is a hidden dinosaur following you.
4878	1	a	If you liked Portal, you'll LOVE this game. It doesn't have much of a storyline though, and the ending looks like it was thought up in two minutes. Maybe the DLCs will improve things.
1979	1	a	I want more characters!
1875	1	a	A very interesting, entertaining game. The devs are also awesome!
3322	1	a	Costume Quest is another great game made by Double Fine Productions. Set in a Halloween setting, this game brings forth both RPG elements and strategy, while not making the game too hard. This game isn't too long, but it isn't too short either, with the game duration being around 5-6 hours for the main story. The goal of the game is to rescue your sister from the clutches of an evil witch, and stop monsters from taking all the town's candy by trick-or-treating door to door. Along your way, you'll pick up allies and use many costumes with different abilities in and out of battle to progress through your journey. Completing side quests not only help you, but everyone else as well as you strive to finish your journey. Watch as your Halloween costumes come to life in Costume Quest.   Pros
1596	1	a	An extreamly well designed came, loads of fun in coop. Probably one of my favorite indie games on steam.
2155	1	a	This is a really fun co-op game. Think of it as a top down version of payday but it has more than just heists, with a pvp mode and a create your own level mode. It is definitely better with friends as the levels are exactly the same in singleplayer and co-op so singleplayer is very hard. Overall i think it is worth the price:)
1729	1	a	This game is amazing very challenging at points. I recommend to play with friends and it's a great price.
4008	1	a	Costume Quest and it's sequel are colorful rpgs, with the usual mechanics. Press - here and such. However, they also have a sense of humor (And as always humor is subjective) The games are generally fun to play, the writing is funny, but there are a few reundancies in the script, as well as some sloppy writing. But that will only bother you a little (Or not at all if you're not a person particularly attached to grammar, and spelling. (I didn't notice any spelling issues)) The designs of the costumes, and of the in-fight character designs are pretty cool, though out of battle the costumes' design is more cute than anything else. The control scheme is a little difficult compared to console versions, but not so much so that it ruins the game. (Unless you have bad arthritis, than get a controller.) I got these games for a two for one sale for a dollar ninety-nine. Frankly, I think that this is terrible. These games aren't bargain bin garbage, they truly are worth playing.  Mechanics: Pretty much the usual, costumes offer new methods of traversal. -+  Graphics: Cartoony, but generally this improves the game. +  Story: Written with humor, and generally enjoyable. Although, there were times where the script could've been refined, I quite enjoyed the story as a whole. +  Gameplay: It was quite fun to play, maybe a little tedious if you can't find all of the houses, but this didn't bother me. + (That said this is the second game I ever fully completed, more commonly phrased as one hundred percenting)  Controls: A little difficult to use, compared to console versions, but this doesn't ruin the game. And you could always get a controller. -  Miscellaneous: The game was cute. But not overly cutesy, so you would have to punch a bear to get your manhood back after playing it.
3385	1	a	This game has fun characters and a simple combat system that is appropriate for younger players. The humor is mild and the themes are Halloween-y but not scary. Some of the animations in combat can feel repetitive after awhile, but overall it provides a good experience.
3396	1	a	Adventure RPG about a halloween night where your sibling was kidnaped by evil monsters and you &amp; your friends have to trick-or-treat your way till the end.  - Simple &amp; easy turn-based battles with quicktime events - Casual story, funny dialogues &amp; quests - Different halloween costumes with special abilities which help you in and outside battle - Very childish graphics - Good variety on levels   The perfect game for your children =3 
2836	1	a	What a game. Super fun with other people. It's great how it has community made missions so the game will last for a long time. For the cheap price it is right now, I recommend getting it, especially the 4 pack. It's practically the price of your lunch.
1932	1	a	1v1 me in club penguin i'll hack into your webkinz account
1789	1	a	Stealing has never been so much fun!
753	1	a	Pros : * 80% strategy + 20% luck = 100% FUN * easy to learn, hard to master * one of the most popular boardgame * if you bought on steam, you can also play on their website for online gaming (same game, just little more simple UI)  Cons :  * Doesn't have Hot-Seat Feature (although there is hot-seat feature in iTunes Mac / iPad Version) * Poor UI in Game Setting (no Hint, just a picture that's is so small) * need little improvement on Lobby Online Game (like join game from our buddy list)  Score : 7/10
3948	1	a	Collect Costumes, Complete Quests and Engage Enemies in Battle using your newly acquired battle suits.
2128	1	a	Some of the best co-op I've ever played.
4854	1	a	Portal-like physics 3d puzzle. Think dimensions, or something like that. Nice graphics, kind of story and around-gaming humour included.
2461	1	a	Interesting heist game that is best played with friends. Multiple heist characters to choose from and stealth is essential in the game. You can't expect to run through and entire room without guards noticing you. Line of sight is especially important as you can lose your pursuers by hiding in a room or behind a pillar. It takes some time to get used to the top down view though, some stuff can get cluttered and new players i've noticed kept getting lost.  All in all its fun and i recommend you get it if you don't mind Bit-styled teamwork.
1791	1	a	Well designed game. Much fun solo but the real fun begins in multiplayer when it's getting chaotic. What really stands out are the visuals and the soundtrack.
5017	1	a	Sudoku, math, crosswords, art and so much more. This is a fun mix of educational activities. I believe there are 1000 activities in this game. Enough to keep you playing for many many days. At the right price, this is a worthy buy, especially for the youngens.
3036	1	a	great game. i cannot say more.
3580	1	a	Costume Quest is a kid's game that even adults would enjoy. The action battle sequences are visually impressive and fun with the different of attacks/costumes you can use. Good story, great visuals, creative characters, sound effects are top notch, and just generally enjoyable to play. This game is actually two games in one, you can choose the shorter quest from the main menu.
593	1	a	Really fun game~~~~
1027	1	a	A masturpecy in vidyagayms. A monolith of what humanitee reprezents. YES/10 wuld by many copies, kinda scary tho
4548	1	a	A silly tower defense game. Fortunately, I happen to like silly tower defense games. It offers a decent variety of towers and enemies, always a key ingredient. (Although I found some of the tower types more or less indispensable, and others pretty worthless.) You get money from killing enemies, but also from building generators, so there is that tension between investing and beefing up your defenses.   Lastly, the game brings us something new: orbiting towers. All your defenses must be placed at preset points in 2-4 rings surrounding your ship/station. These rings are fixed in distance from the center, and the build points are fixed in distance from each other, but the entire ring can be rotated. This lets you move your towers into position near the enemy's attack paths (highlighted by glowy dotted lines), or even follow a wave around to keep it in range longer. Since the levels are in space, with no real 'terrain', this is a good way of doing things.  One of the game's strongest points is actually not the system itself, but the whole aesthetic. The entire thing, down to the last detail, is done over to look like a cheesy, low-budget, 40s/50s sci-fi movie/TV show. The costumes in the live-action cutscenes, the flying saucer enemies, the robots that look like they were patched together from old car parts, the towers that look like they're made of cardboard and tinfoil, and the buttons &amp; iconography on the menus all appear just like you'd expect them to. I've never played a game that did something similar, and while I wouldn't want it to become a trend, it really works here.
877	0	a	each time I play this ww2 simulation game i play very good tactics but I continuously have horrible dice luck. Dice rolling is 90% of this game, if you are looking for a strategy game don't play this game, If you are looking for a random â¥â¥â¥ gambling game set in a WW2 environment, play this game you will have fun =)
4158	1	a	Good game. It's difficult to say what is so good about it, but I would say it combines the complexity of an RPG's combat and equipment with the interesting (and frustrating) battle mechanics of Bejewled.
1038	1	a	You can do wheelies with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pickup truck.
5199	1	a	its a good buy for just $10 
4087	1	a	Do you enjoy puzzle games, but also like action/adventure? If you have an eclectic taste like me, then this game is for you! Create your own fantasy character, then venture out into the world, battling monsters by matching-3-or-more to directly attack, gather gold and experience, or gain mana to cast different spells and abilites that can even change the boards and turn the tide of battle!
1809	1	a	Proboably one of my favorite games of all time...Fantastic art style and chaotic fun make it a fantastic arcade game.
4486	1	a	I think Some games published by Gamehouse deserve to be released in Steam, like: Rolling idols and Rolling idols: Lost city, Stoneloops! of Jurassica and some developed by Mumbo jumbo, like: Elements and Mad caps
1197	0	a	this game gave me a near death experience, god help me, my joints are hurting, call for help.
4807	1	a	Very Fun. Enjoy this work of art from the girl who helped make portal the maginicent game it also is
3654	1	a	Game is fun. Best part is humour and worst is repetitiveness. It plays very quick, puzzles are easy, boss fights are OK until you do QTE right(beat all of them+expansion at first try). Achievements are done almost right - beat game 100% you get =100% -1. No need for second play-through, but you have to fire game during Christmas period :( Overall I recommend it
4377	1	a	This game is suburb! It is quite fun in the sense that it is fast, challenging and full of suprises. The chevos are excellent too as they are just the right amount of challenge to make you want to get them all. It is a little buggy but nothing devistating just some awkward object interactions here and there. I much rather play with the gamepad then the keyboard because the nature of the game requires analog control. Worth every penny I might even buy a few copies for my friends. These guys have yet to disapoint!
181	1	a	Critical Mass is a fun, simple game.  Its low price and somewhat addictive gameplay make it worth trying out. If you enjoy playing puzzle games, you will enjoy this. 
771	1	a	It isa board game. The games go quickly so I can kill some time withou getting to invested in a session.
621	1	a	Pure awesome
838	1	a	Fun game, have the board game and picked up the PC version on sale. Lots of fun to play with friends. Doesnt get old with even the standard map, every game is different.
2363	1	a	Great fun, but like every game, better with friends.
35	1	a	Fun game, not to hard to 100% if you're into that. The game's style is cute and I would describe it as a Super Meat Boy for kiddies. Buy it if you have a boring weekend!
5241	1	a	That one is pretty nice. Pleasant 2D graphics, relatively nonlinear gameplay and lots of thinking required. If you liked Toki Tori 1... well, there's no guarantee you'll like Toki Tori 2, but it deserves a chance.  P.S. It claims to be a Metroidvania on the store page - what a load of excrement. Not that the game is bad, but Metroidvania - it is not.
2022	1	a	pretty fun in multiplayer.
3307	1	a	An unexpected style of game with a funny creative innovate. The combat is really fun and the costumes are amazing. Overall, the game fits together very well.  Game: 8.0/10 Graphic: 8.5/10   100% Achievement  : Easy |  Medium  | Hard | Very Hard
4148	1	a	If you like the match 3 games, and you like RPGs, you cant go wrong with this
4405	1	a	It's really cheap and really fun, what more do you want?
2637	1	a	this game is amazing, but dont buy this if you dont have friends
1543	1	a	4 person cooperative steal-'em-up this game would be tons of fun if you actually had friends
614	1	a	A very addictive little boardgame, one of those that you reinstall now and then when you fancy something simple but fun, like monopoly or solitare. I feel they are kinda milking it with all the downloadable maps though, but it's not as if you *have* to buy them.
3680	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
325	1	a	Lots of fun if you like shmups or twin stick shooters. Play survival, and don't use bombs! It's a whole new game, and a whole lot more fun.
2581	1	a	Thanks for the Linux port but you need to work on the keys as the feel stiffer than some of the homebrew games I've played.
1736	1	a	Is it trying to be a stealth 'em up or an action-me-do? I couldn't really tell. I had some decent fun with the game despite it being a bit muddled and directionless, until later on when the missions became ridiculous. The multiplayer is a laugh. Overall I'd recommend it but don't expect anything groundbreaking.
39	0	a	This game belongs on an iPhone, and it's a bad port for PC. The music is repetitive and the controls are floaty.
3581	1	a	Pretty cute yet simplistic turn based rpg centered around halloween and candy collecting. Not bad fwiw.
842	1	a	It's pretty good represantation of the board game
2629	1	a	Great fun with a group of friends!
4147	1	a	i have play this game before on my 3s as a dsi app and i enjoyed it to a point untill the music and sound got glitchly but over all i enjoy it on the 3ds so i was happy to see it on steam so i instanly jump to the chance and buy it.  And i am impress that the sound and music run perfectly! i love the way how the game forces you to think about what move you should play either for mana or gold like coin or purple star which gives out exp to make shure your mess up your oppents stragy
4648	1	a	My childhood is on steam BUY IT.
4784	1	a	Fantastic little puzzle game for anyone looking for light humorous fun. Innovative gameplay with fairly straightforward puzzles.
3301	1	a	What to say? This game is definitely a classic. You play as either the brother or the sister trying to save the other, who is kidnapped by monsters on Halloween as they try to invade this world. You use the power of various costumes along with the powers of friends you meet and have join your party as you progress along to the end. You also collect candy (money) and complete various quests for various people along the way.  It's arguably the cutest RPG out there and also happens to be a lot of fun. Although Double Fine has somewhat fallen from grace of late, this game remains a shining example of the sort of excellent games they are capable of producing. Definitely a game that shouldn't be missed or passed over by anybody. Make sure you play this on Halloween, and at least turn it on Christmas Day for a few minutes (you will know why if you do it).  A classic, one of the best games out there, and an easy 10/10.
390	1	a	Pretty cool, small little game. The basic idea is that you are ball that rolls around shooting other objects to get score. Had several game modes and all of them were decent.  Very colorful and easy to control, and if you get a combo of 10 hits quicky - you get a bomb to use to lose.... but I did wish that there was 'random' powerups - the bomb is the only power up.   You do level up, but I never noticed what leveling up does. Good little game, I played a little under an hour and got 16 achievements. If you love bullet hell style games, you might like this since the twist isn't bullets but instead so many enemies.
5169	0	a	This game sucks. Period.
644	1	a	Love it, great adaptation of the board game and a lot of fun to play with the wife.  Online play could use a few feature enhancements, like steam 'join game' integration but it works well enough to make password-protected games and join those.
5044	1	a	If you love puzzle games, this one is most likely for you!!!!
1172	1	a	cumboy tournament
382	1	a	This is the motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing shiznit.   That is, if you like Geometry Wars, otherwise you'll think it's balls.
1990	1	a	Whether a casual pick up and go gamer or a hardcore computer wizard, Monaco has something for everyone. With a gentle learning curve but a painfully difficult proficiency requirement near the end of the campaign coupled with the arcade feel and deceptively intricate classes, this game holds appeal for those both playing for fun and those looking to leave no coin behind.
5521	1	a	Nobody told me we needed a Space Invaders clone.
3642	1	a	I really liked Costume Quest. I liked that it met my till now unknown need for running around collecting things and RPG fights. It's not high on variety but it's nice in the sense that you hit an area and you know what to do and there are mini quests for variety.  I did think the final boss battle was a pretty steep curve, but that's me.
2656	1	a	Monaco is an interesting game. It's straight forward gameplay, and level design really sold it for me. Due to the fact that each player has different abilities, each player has a specific role to play. Working as a team takes practice and timing, but is really rewarding at the same time. Yet, you could also just run loose and have crazy missions which are equally as fun.  The only areas of the map that you'll see in color is your field of vision, so get use to black and grey layouts. While I haven't beaten this game 100% completely, it is still in my top 25 games.  The only problem I had with it is that finding a group to play with can be difficult at times, and if you lack any way to communicate, then you'll have to play the game by ear.  Overall I give it a 4/5.
298	1	a	Good old arcade style game with good music. If you liked Geomatry Wars, you wil like this. Just a shame that these type of games dont have levels or a goal to work towards other then high scores. But other then that, its very adictive.
438	1	a	Beautifully made game, enthralling and addictive.
2484	1	a	A humorous top-down 8-bit esque game involving hours of entertainment. The accents that the civilians and guards have is highly amusing and the gameplay is at first glance simple but becomes increasingly complex as each character plays in different ways and the complexity only goes up as you play with more people in different combinations trying to get the highest score. The gameplay can switch back and forth between frantic flight from the police to stealthy guard knockouts within less than a minute and at no point in the game will you not feel challenged. A good game for yourself, a great game for friends.
1474	1	a	Absolutely recommended. I originally got it with the Indie Mega Booth pack, since six games for $20 was a steal. I'd never heard of Monaco before that, and I fell in love almost right away. The soundtrack is great - all jazzy piano that changes intensity depending on if you're sneaking or being chased; the game itself is gorgeous, very colorful but not blinding; some levels can be difficult, but with persistence and planning you can get through it. 10/10 would recommend.
1424	0	a	This game is only enjoyable because I obtained it in a pack of six games for 1.50, had I payed more for this game I'd hate myself. If you can get it for next to nothing like I did then go for it. If not stay away.
4153	1	a	Great and addictive game. Started playing this on my DS when it first came out. Playing it all the way through again on the PC brings back memories. This game added an RPG style element to the bejeweled formula that made it much more fun. If you want to play to get into the story and craft every item, or just kill a few minutes this is a great game to pick up.
4138	1	a	Bejeweled plus D&amp;D style gameplay, while a very frustrating and sometimes difficult game, makes this a very fun game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or puzzle games.
3860	1	a	Great little turn based rpg. If you see it on sale, get it.
3678	1	a	.
4688	1	a	Pros: -Puzzle difficulty gets hard without feeling impossible -Whimsical look is neat -VO is entertaining -Death screens are funny  Cons: -Level design is very very very very very very(...) repetetive for the game's length. The sudden unique design of the final level would have been nice to introduce earlier. -Story is completely nonsensical and feels like an afterthought  Score: 6/10
633	1	a	If you love the board game, you should buy this. If you haven't played the board game, give it a try.
541	1	a	TTR has been one of my favorite games to play for a long time. The steam version is enjoyable and is true to the table top version.
2378	1	a	Fun with friends~
5390	1	a	Absolutely brilliant shoot 'em up with retro graphics and soundtrack and especially highly addictive gameplay.
294	1	a	This game just devours your time... who would thought?
5253	1	a	Yes. Yes buy this game. Buy this game right now it blows away almost everything I've ever seen.
1710	1	a	Frantic and fun, would recommend!
3867	1	a	This is a really fun turn based game. I love the story and the animation for the fight scenes.
2372	1	a	Monaco is a stealth heist game that has a fairly unique design. You go on missions with 1 of 8 specialists, with a simple objective of robbing Monoco's biggest stockpiles of cash. Each individual you may take on the mission impacts how the game works; with a listed big effect such as 'creates disguise for self' or 'Knocks out a guard on successful sneak', and a minor bonus like 'climbs into vents faster'. Most of these are very well designed and fit together surprizingly well. If the stealth elements fail, it's a problem, but doesn't kill the mission. You will eventually reset. Completing this with my group we often called that 'Crime Time!' Speaking of the group mechanic, get yourself some erliable, patient playmates for best results. This is a great game for cooperative multiplayer.  You can get through the whole first story without an impressive amount of patience or even mastery of mechanics. After that though, the game is going to kick you in the pants untill you learn the fundamental rules of stealth, for they are far more powerful than collected items and individual abilities.  The stories are very interesting. I found myslf wanting to keep going no matter how difficult because of the story. The sound track is fairly satisfying as well. All around reccomend.
3254	1	a	A fun little relaxing time-waster. Physics are great, puzzles range from quite easy to incredibly difficult (but never impossible). Good for when you're sick of playing high-octane FPS games and want a bit of a break that'll still challenge you. One of those puzzle games that's easy to learn but hard to master. 9.5/10
1397	1	a	Only had it running to get a badge that fits my username, it's a decent game though
3590	1	a	This game is adorable. Regardless of one's age or gaming genre preference, this one is worth checking out, especially when it's available for under a couple bucks.
4136	1	a	It can be a bit slow in progression at times but it's a very interesting twist on the match 3 genre, managing to fit in a lot of depth and options that are well worth checking out for puzzle fans.
286	1	a	A funny casual game with many options. Took me a time to get bored of it...
999	1	a	Snuggle Truck is life.   10/10
2642	1	a	Nice game. Love the style and gameplay.
3217	1	a	Very fun little game 
3967	1	a	    What better way to spend a few hours than pummeling monsters as a giant rainbow unicorn?      Costume Quest is a fun, youthful, and humorous adventure that utilizes overworld exploration, puzzle solving, and a simple turn-based combat system. I would recomend it to children, people looking for a not-scary halloween game, and anyone who would like to nostagically relearn some of the magic of halloween.  This game does a lot of things well and a few things not so well.    Good Stuff:
4095	1	a	Great mix of 'Match 3' game and RPG.
3335	1	a	sticks and stones may break my bones but NERDS will never hurt me
4734	1	a	Great game when your bored, have it mentioned its great? EITHER WAY ITS FUN, but boring once you beat it...
1144	1	a	It's not that bad....for $0.29. No, but this game is actually kind of fun. The controls take a bit to get used to and the levels ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly. I would recommend a controller, but the keyboard and mouse options are fine since the control scheme is pretty basic.
5124	1	a	Humorous and cute version of Dungeon Keeper. Only this time you'll be commanding bunch of lazy beardlings and digging muuch deeper.
1801	1	a	OMG so much fun! chat engine is a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥ though...
3561	0	a	This doesn't work on MAC. Don't buy it.
1621	1	a	Finally a game designed to encourage teamplay amongst friends. Get it for a group of buddies and you'll be having a grand old time in no time. The screw-ups are great for laughs all around and it gets challenging enough towards the end to give four brains working in unison a run for their money.   The story is intriguing and the music is quite nice. If you have a single friend in the world, then you will enjoy this game.
961	0	a	The things to be found are tiny. Very frustrating and makes you wonder throughout the game exactly what you're doing with your life. Very simple and short story. Very casual casual game.
1854	1	a	Awesome game, very fun with multiplayer. Tends to be either hit or kind of miss; there's still 20-40 hours of gameplay even if you aren't really into it. Multiplayer is definitely a better experience than single player, but single player is fun as well. (especially if you enjoy speedrunning)
1516	1	a	Adrenaline. Hilarity. French Accent.
2797	1	a	Awesome Game! I love it!!!
667	1	a	Great digital adaptation of a great board game.
3878	1	a	Not a bad game, but only get this if you have a joypad, else its unplayable at times! Seriously unplayable. You can do most stuff fine, but certain parts of the game are just too much cos you can't go diagnolly or other directions properly using keys, else this game would be pretty sweet.
843	1	a	It's fun game for an hour a day :) Purchase a bundle on sale.
3459	0	a	After going through 3 hours of the same, repetitive fights, missions, candy-collecting, and mini-games... I just can't get myself to launch the game again, although I'm the type of gamer that just has to see the ending at least once. Since I've regretfully spent money on buying this game, I just don't see the point of even spending my precious time on it.
2702	1	a	Monaco is an absoloute legend of a game in multiplayer although it lacks entertainment when you are in single player. I would recommend this game for it's superb game-style and although the plotline isn't that definite it is possibly one of the best mulitplayer games I've ever played.
4464	1	a	it is a really good game dont get me wrong, the idea of it and the way the game is played but itsa hell of a good job you dont get timed as the graphics arent that great and at times it is quite hard to see the object you have to find
3891	1	a	I've heard that the designers wanted to make this like playing through a Pixar movie, and it really shows. It's got a charming and whimsical atmosphere that makes you feel like a kid again, and while the barrage of timed hits can sort of be annoying, the game's forgiving enough that it rarely becomes problematic. Besides, who wouldn't want to be in a world where you can don a few cardboard boxes and turn into a rocket-punch-firing robot?
3582	1	a	So cute! So addictive! A must play! &lt;3 ^^
962	0	a	A good idea, but far too buggy and far too short. The writing was not the best, either. I'd give this a solid C.
4717	1	a	Game feels like Portal with different gaming mechanisms. So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it's difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you're doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that's a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous. Ultimately, getting it at a good discounted price (like 75%) is a good deal.
3308	0	a	Unfortunately, I really can't give this game a good review.  I tried to enjoy it, I really did, I mean its Double Fine right?  The gameplay is almost non-existent and all three of the chapters have the same bobbing for apples minigame over and over again. There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?  The variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.  The supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well. It also hurt that the dialogue is not voiced.  If you are looking for a cutesy little game for a young child who has 6 hours to burn, I say go for this as long as itâs under 10$. Otherwise unless you are a Double Fine fanboy (which is not necessarily a bad thing, they make good games) then just walk away.
3975	1	a	Not much to say other than âThis game is awesomely fun!â  If you love the classic turn based RPG's and comical adventures, then you will like this game. As the name implies, the game is about costumes. You and your sibbling start out Trick or Treating when these monsters kidnap one of you mistaking you for candy. You must go on a quest to recover your sibbling before the night is over.   The game works on two levels. The first is the main view (or town) where you solve simple puzzles and go door to door Trick or Treating. When you meat a monster you go to the battle level.  In the town you are in a cheaply made costume that looks like a kid made it. The streets have other kids walking around in various costumes and adults that have quests that need completing in order to pass by. Once you have visited all the houses, you are allowed to go to the next part of town.  In the battle section, your characters transform into whatever costume you had on. Each costume has normal attacks, special attacks, stat benefits, and/or a special ability outside combat.  The graphics for this game are in no way realistic. It was designed to look cartoonish. Not saying that the graphics are bad. On the contrary, for the style they went with, they look awesome. The backgrounds are highly detailed, the characters look smooth, the costumes really look like they were pieced together with cardboard and various things around the house.  The combat is probably the only place I would have any complaints with. When you begin, you can only do a normal attack unless you have a âbattle stampâ that allows a secondary attack. On your third turn you will be allowed a special move. You can use it then or save it for later. The problem is that you have to wait 3 turns to use it again. Additionally, when you go to do your normal attack you have to press the corect sequence or yo will do about 1/2 to 3/4 damage. This is also tru with defending. If you fail to hit the proper button on time you will receive full damage. âBattle Stampsâ will help with the combat but are limited to 1 per character. This is all there is to the fights. Granted there is a bit of strategy involved with the combat, this is very limiting.   All in all, this was a very fun game and the DLC was also fun. Neither are super long but are very fun to play...
1322	1	a	Got this for free somehow, 10/10. xD
1844	1	a	I love this game because of the many ways to play, beyond just the 8 characters. You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little 'tricks', such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain 'loot container' (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.
27	1	a	This is such a cute little awesome game, I highly recommend it!
4504	1	a	Very simple yet fun game to kill time for whatever reason if you are bored or waiting for something. The plants also grow when you're not playing but you can at anytime on the menu screen make time faster, slower, or pause it if you happen to be too busy to play or free, whice is a plus for me. If you are not into relaxing or simple games, then I wouldn't recommend it.
5195	1	a	Want to play Dwarf Fortress (the completely free and insanely convoluted game found here:  http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)  with comprehensible graphics, a user-friendly interface and something as blasphemously casual as a tutorial? Then this is for you. You slimey, no-good casual filth, you.
2985	1	a	Been playing it for the last two weeks. Brilliant attention to detail, both graphically and musically. It also taught me some French.
4455	1	a	Repetitive, difficult, and hella fun. Why? Well, the gameplay is repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ (repeating levels every 3 stages, only to shove another new one in your face), the game's difficulty curve is reminiscent of the slope of K2, and well, at first this game seems like nothing other then the normal marble shooter. However, it has this charm the wants you to see the ending sooooo bad, or to find out what that NEXT ADDED â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LEVEL is, only to get owned by balls rolling into your base. You just can't put this game down unless you've actually finished it. Of course, this game's sequels are far better (and easier) and you should play them, but this is not simply a game you can just ignore. 
100	1	a	In the ever-expanding gold mine of cheap yet insanely fun games on Steam, Lume is a dud. Beatenin less than an hour, the puzzles are simple and easy (with the exception of one very obscure solution). If I remember correctly, I got this game in a bundle with several others for around $6, which is actually the full price of this game now. I would advise to wait for a similar bundle or steam sale if this game really interests you.
1137	1	a	If you haven't tried this, I pity you. 10/10
4316	1	a	This game is a PC version of Katamari Damacy, almost exactly.  Basically, you start off small, and absorb things around you to grow, which allows you to aborb bigger things and explore more of the level. It's a fun concept that's fun to play, both in Katamari Damacy and in this game.  The main downsides are the length and the map sizes. The game is way too short, and it can easily be beaten 100% in a few hours, max. The maps are also a bit too small, and most of them can be fully explored in 2-3 minutes.  If you're not familiar with this type of game, it is absolutely worth trying. Get a Katamari title if you have the right platform for one of them, and if not, try this game. I got it for half price at $5, and it was worth it, barely. I had a lot of fun, but you don't get much playtime for your money.
445	1	a	One of my favorite time killers. Got it in a random bundle years ago and I still come back to it frequently.
1582	1	a	A simple yet really enjoyable game that can be played with your friends online. All the characters provide a different feel for a stage and the levels are quite unique
1973	1	a	Class game.
2493	1	a	Hints on map make this game easy to play even you're the first time. Every class has its own feature, but the balance still has room to improve Some of them is barely useful. (locksmith?) Love the music how it fits this game. And the pixel style characters, always classic.  I like to solo, it's challenging, but co-op with friends? It's fun! Look at these nuts running around and stomp every single alarm, lol...  Recommend! 8/10.    
1951	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.
861	0	a	Just sell me the game for say $20, keep the pay to play crap out of it. Very good in board game form which is worth buying, keep away from this 'free' to pay.
4167	1	a	This is a Great Game for you fantasy Fans and/or Puzzle Solvers. its got alittle something for you guys.
215	1	a	Waves is a fast-paced, funny shooter with lots of interesting features. If youâre looking for a fun pastime, this is highly recommended.
2202	1	a	Ingenious game reminiscent of the old breakin capers, complete with all the main prototype characters. It's like Ocean's Eleven without having to look at Brad Pitt and George Clooney all the time.
469	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. The graphics are great and the gameplay is very addictive. However, the best part of this game is deffinitely the soundtrack as it is just amazing.   10/10 would definitely recommend picking this game up.
2958	1	a	fun, good difficulty, not so hard you want to put your fist through your screen, but just enough to make it fun.
5450	1	a	I play this game off and on every so often. It's one of those fun little games that you can pick up and play at anytime. 
1216	1	a	I know this is a kids game, but you bring over your friends and you pull out the whiskey, this game becomes goty.
3667	1	a	Such a cute little halloween game. Only annoying thing is the lack of maps.
3392	1	a	'It had a concise story paired with inventive puzzle mechanics that challenged you to be creative' A quote from Charles Onyet's Portal 2 review on IGN.  Costume quest has nothing mentioned in the above quote, Portal 2 is far better.
1911	1	a	Neon, 2D, pixelated, heist game that's loads of fun. For those who like leaderboards, it can become a time trialing coin collecting runthrough. For us normal people it's just a great game with a great look
4748	1	a	Not a Mexican game but still pretty good. Might be somewhat influenced by Mexican mythology. We have lots of bags, amulets and murder in Mexico.   All in all, probably the best non-Mexican game I ever played.
315	1	a	What I like best about this game is that the laser weapon is not something to make the game easier but is something to give you a diiferent experience. The bullet gun uses spread fire to quickly &amp; efficiently take out enemies but can sometimes miss. The laser is able to quickly move across enemies eliminating most in quick sucsession, however it sometimes can not penetrate the entire enemy or moves too fast across it. So you see each weapon has advantages &amp; disadvantages. Not many top down shooters like this are that generous. Plus the graphics &amp; gameplay are fanatastic.
3806	1	a	I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.  The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.
2230	1	a	Chaotic fun  Monaco is a 2D-top down, stealth game developed by Pocketwatch game. The premise of the game is simple. You and a your team are need to rob the area of specific treasure, which is found in the later levels of the stage, and then escape. The problem you have to face however are gaurds, dogs, lazers, helicopters etc which are trying to stop you. There are eight characters that you can play as which each have a unique trait, for instance the gentleman can disguise himself to avoid detection, while the locksmith can unlockdoors and vents the quickest.  In single player, there are four campaigns which tells the story of a group of thieves and the variest heists they commit. Each campaign has various levels to choose from and you unlock new leves and campaigns as you complete the previous ones. When you get killed in singleplayer, you switch to one of the other seven characters. When all your characters have died, the mission ends and you have to restart the level. The levels are well designed, having plenty of places to hide in such as vents and bushes and various routes to reach the objective. You can also find items/weapons such as shotguns,machine guns (which have limited ammo) to help deal with the gaurds as well as diguises, smoke bomb and health kits. The sound is fantastic, playing quiet music when stealth and panicky music when your alrms ring and your being chased by gaurds. The weapons sound good as well. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.   The multiplayer is where the game truely shines. You can play the campaign mission with up to seven other players. Each player chooses one of the eight roles available. When one of the players dies, they need to be revived by another player to continue playing and progress to the next stage of the level. Things get pretty fun and hilarious when alarms ring and you or another player are running around like headless chooks trying to hide from the gaurds who are chasing you down.  I highly recommend this game to players you love team based stealth games. 
2955	1	a	Must collect... ALL TEH COINZ!!!
217	1	a	Simple and fun gameplay, with several game modes and leaderboards to keep you playing. A game where you can spend a few minutes for fun, or hours trying to beat your last high score. Could have used a few more background music tracks, there are only three tracks looping. Absolutely worth the money, if you want to kill some time before work or school.
1234	1	a	+ Hardcore first/third (you get both!) person shooter + Survival game where there's only you and other survivors left and you have to fight with them for fish and black gold + Hardcore skills needed to strafe and crunch from enemy snowballs + You can get your girlfriend into FPS because of this. At first, she'll love penguins and snowballs, and then you will miss the moment when penguins and snowballs will give way to monsters and rockets! Everyone starts somewhere! + Awesome avatar for your steam profile + Incredible levitating skills. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A PENGUIN CAN ACTUALLY FLY!!! BUY IT FOR YOUR PENGUIN NOW AND MAKE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE!!  - No RPG elements, you don't get new hats and bunny ears for drowning thousands of other penguins - Penguin racism - No play-for-orca mode
2486	1	a	Very good game, I recommend to play this game with a friend, holds up to 4 players AND has custom map support, for all your creative needs!
3545	1	a	Witty, dry, and full of good gameplay, Costume Quest portrays children as serious, intelligent creatures with a bit too much wisdom for their age. The turn-based combat is easy to learn, and the customization options work great. Combine this with a fantastic second, Chrismas-themed story (Grubbins on Ice) and the fact that it works flawlessly with a gamepad, and you get one very well polished and high quality game.
498	0	a	The game itself is fun, but the connectivity was never amazing, and it now doesn't work on OSX at all after a random update.
2492	1	a	Monaco gives the player two options how to complete the mission: 1. Run through the level and collect as much as you can Or 2. Try to be like a ninja and sneak your way through the level, collecting everything that isn't nailed down. One can try these tacticts alone, or with another players online in a co-op mode.   And the possible combinations in the co-op mode makes the players rethink their strategies, adapting them to a new team in every playthrough.  With an awesome co-op mode and levels that are easier to complete in co-op mode than in single player, Monaco makes even the most secular player try working together for a change.   Gr8 game m8, I'd r8 8/8
5281	1	a	Colorful and cute bird does sound great for children.
4267	1	a	Short but fun.
688	1	a	Just like the board game but without all the hassle of tidying up afterwards.
856	0	a	Not really free to play.
3133	1	a	Good game. Requires some patience and tactical skill which come with playing and knowing the classes and items. For classes and items there are good Workshop maps.
819	1	a	This is FUN FUN FUN! Just need one more round. I got this on my mobile devices as well.
3287	0	a	Physic based 2D platform puzzler. Gave me rage, not happy feels
782	1	a	Absolutely love this game and awesome implementation of the game on PC.
4938	1	a	Great puzzle game. definetely pick this up at its great price.
1833	1	a	Realy Fun Co-op Game. And Realy Good To Mess Around With.
4033	0	a	Get the uncut version on Adventure Gamers instead. Steam should tell people before they buy if their games are censored.
4195	1	a	I have not yet finished Puzzle Quest, and it's not for lack of trying. I think I've restarted this game at least thirteen times. The early game is so charming, and discovering the shiny equipment is exciting, and then one realizes the truth:  This is Battle Bejeweled, and you will be playing it forever.  Fortunately, as far as leveling up goes, it has all the trappings of an RPG, replete with sidequests and a rich story. Unfortunately, it has all the trappings of an RPG, and that includes a steady grind. The game can be frustrating to come back to after a time away, especially where the story is concerned.  But at its heart, Puzzle Quest is trying to be your friend. It's a casual puzzle game in an RPG's clothings, and they're worn well. When Candy Crush Saga's got you down, Puzzle Quest will be right here waiting with open arms. Give it a hug.
1312	1	a	iron man meets super smash brother, little miss pac and the pac attack will confirm. nigel is dumb, joe is dumb, i beat them so their intelligence is in question. nintendo, get it together, this is whats up. hats for days, got some hands, feet claws, what else do you need. seven other people are on my team for the world penguin arena national booty call, and there ya go. get the game, $200 is a steal
1891	1	a	me:do you have this game  you:no  me:what the hell get it right now it is so awesome  you : ok  that is what u say to people who dont have the game cause it is so god damn awesome
3924	1	a	Awesomely cute...
4403	1	a	Do you love Katimari? Do you wish there was a shorter low end graphic version of it? This is the game for you plus Achievements.
2222	1	a	A very entertaining game with many hilarious possibilities happening. In short, I love it.
2361	1	a	i think this game is good it fun and its a type of sneking game you need to hide much and not draw attention to youre self thats the best part of the game 
3415	1	a	It's adorable, hands down. It's pretty darn cute as well as being engaging and keeping you interested. Every time you have a new opponent or get a new costume, BAM you need to reconfigure your strategy, even if it's only to see 'what does this unicorn costume do?' Great even for younger kids.
2737	1	a	I personally find this game with just the right amount of challenge but not to the point where you get very frustrated with it. I also enjoyed this game much more than the splinter cells series mostly due to the four player co-op ability.
3258	1	a	Great puzzle solving fun for a night in with friends. The complexity of the puzzles grows as you progress but you will often find that there is more than one solve to any puzzle.
4344	0	a	It's ok, but go play Katamari instead; this game is inferior.
1642	1	a	Loving this game so much!
2183	1	a	GG (Great Game)
4518	0	a	This game is free from the developer's website, there is no Steam cloud saving, no cards, and no achievements. There is literally no reason to buy the Steam version, unless you like spending money.  If you need a link to the website, here it is.  http://www.ldw.com/fish_tycoon.php 
4066	0	a	Avoid this game, still has a lot of bugs some of which make the game unplayable. Company has gone out of business so don't expect any patches.  Feel free to flag this game as broken (click the icon near the Metacritic score)
1113	0	a	Pretty much a phone game to it's core, barely done any improvements on PC version if any at all. Resolution is upscaled pretty badly and the meniu is just eye mauling. However it's pretty good for little kids, it's a mobile game, but it's still blows mobile version on 24 inch monitor in their mind.   Either way would not recommend spending more than 1$ on this.
1488	1	a	This game is pretty simple, you just collect all the coins, but it's very addicting. When I bought it I thought it might be good fun for a bit, but it's really great. The characters all have strengths and play differently enough to make the choice matter. There's about 40-50 official maps, zombie mode and tons of custom maps. I got it on sale, but wouldn't have minded paying full price. If you think you might like it go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.
330	1	a	I love this game! It's the only game that i bought for 1 euro and i have played about 3-4 hours by the time i'm writing this review! It has about 9 modes which you are freely able to choose from which to play.It has nice effects and beautiful colours all over the screen! And an epic/motivating music which fits absolutely into the game!It's really a good game and i recommend it to everyone that wants to spend a euro/dollar or whatever currency you have!
603	0	a	Rubbish! Uninstalled.
2533	1	a	A top-down third person version of the Payday series, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play among friends. Relatively easy to learn as well and has a variety of game modes and community mods to ensure you neevr get bored.  The mechanics of the game are fairly simplistic and easy to understand and remain constant for most parts of the game.   The only thing that needs improvement would probably be the connection system. It took me 20 mins on my first try to create a room and start a game with friends. The gameplay afterwards made this mishap relatively forgiving though.  8/10, strongly recommended for groups of friends of all ages.
3671	1	a	Really fun game. Though the actual playthrough feels pretty short, this little RPG has a lot to offer to anyone missing a taste of older turn based RPGs. There are secrets to be found, Costumes to unlock, and Aliens to destroy. At $10, this game is worth it. On sale, it is a MUST.
1248	1	a	i don't know why but playing this makes me happy... reminds me of my good old ubuntu (linux) pc i had when i was a kid where there were hundreds of small fun games to download! -gameplay is simple and fun (even a 5 year old can understand how to play) -good diversity of maps and weapons -amazing soundtrack -even more awesome if you have friends to play with  -lacks online players (multiplayer is dead)
606	0	a	I very highly suggest you stay away from this title. Discovered game-breaking bugs - the worst of which literally made the game unplayable. Just buy the table-top version.
5379	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
5008	1	a	If you liked portal, you'll like this game.
2693	1	a	Monaco is a great looking game and is VERY fun to play with your friends. You'll find yourself and your friends messing up a couple levels constantly but it only adds to the fun. Usually gives you a good laugh whenever you do something wrong or read something funny in the game. The PvP mode is also very fun to play with your friends and strangers. Gets really intense when you end up having all the trophies. I would recomend this game to anyone who is willing to just have fun and not take a game seriously.  9/10
4188	1	a	Honestly one of my favourite games out there. I love this game.  There was a DLC for this they never released on pcbut I worked with a user named SirNinja to help get the console one on it, which surprisingly ported almost perfectly. Sadly there was a bug or two with it that broke a very very useful item in the DLC. Ignoring that you can pretty much get the full experience of it. Highly highly recommended.
1554	1	a	pretty fun. especially with friends. deffinitly reccomendddddd
3743	1	a	Cute game that will make you wish it was Fall any day of the year.
5330	1	a	A simple to understand but difficult to beat puzzle game that can often trick you with a simple solution. It has a metroidvania style design but teaches you how to solve puzzles through the environment as you play. This allows for forked paths that are blocked by your knowledge of the game at that point instead of an upgrade or item that you need to find somewhere else.  The game requires two playthroughs if you want all the achievements and that is about the only complaint I can think of, even if the second playthrough is much faster.
2690	1	a	Monaco: whats yours is mine is a fun single or multiplayer hiest game playing the game single player makes for a fun and challinging hiest game which at times can be very difficult but is still very fun. The multiplayer is when it gets insanly fun. Overall very fun game worth $15.00 9.8/10
5232	1	a	Fantastic game! I was put off originally thinking it was a platformer running around getting tokens, but it's a really well thought out puzzle game. Animations are great, some levels take a bit of thought to get past, but there are a lot of different routes you can take so can swap to a different area if you get too stuck.  Only thing I'd like is a bit more of a 'The End' - has a game ending, but world is open to run around indefinitely. And all I got was a lousy T-shirt ;)
4893	1	a	YOU GUYS OWE ME A NEW KEYBOARD
4324	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Katamari Damacy clone, not worth money sadly. Game lasted literally 2 hours and it manages to be linear with the 'genre'.
4643	1	a	This game is simpler and not as Rube Goldberg as I expected. It does take a lot of inquisition and ideas if you don't get the games concepts when it has a lack of clear explanation. Don't think that bad, you're supposed to experiment in the game. I found that once I conceptualized every aspect of the mechanics given that after I understood each one seperately I could breeze through most of the 'obstacle' like levels that have some funny yet odd goals. I mean, some of it is common sense, some of it can be luck, and sometimes you just know or have to figure it out. The game scared me by giving me a timer, I did get stalled once and it ran out, but ignore it, for NOTHING happens when your timer hits 0. It was just an average time for most people to finish the level, don't be discouraged, try your best and if you get stuck well work through it and keep having fun! Sadly I rate this game at a 6/10 - my lowest rating to date. Maybe I'm leniant, only 'bad' games will get below 5. If I didn't enjoy it, and it was a waste of time and money, I'll definitely let you know. Go get this game series!
2219	1	a	Incredible, just looking out for some more friends to play with!
1624	1	a	Great game. Couch Co-op rules!
3407	1	a	CQ is another great game from double fine.  The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt to save their little town from monsters at halloween. It is all told through the use of 'speech bubbles' around key characters.   The game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs.   I've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.  The 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the 'feel' of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.  The soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.  This game includes both CQ and it's DLC 'grubbins on ice'. GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.  CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.
1370	1	a	great. buy it
3443	1	a	  Trick or Treat! Done! 
4289	1	a	It's cute. I like the theme song, and it's an easy game as rolling around goes. Also there's a potato in the loading screen. &lt;3
552	1	a	love this game it super fun !
2931	1	a	It's great. Stealth gameplay done right, and it's co-op, including offline co-op if you plug in a game pad.
5404	1	a	Pleasantly surprised with the depth and variety in this angry, bomb-slamming space invaders game. A great companion to Ultratron (get that too). Pro tip: keep your eyes on the enemy, not on your ship and you'll hit 'em every time.
4692	1	a	fun puzzlegame where you play with the fuzzy dimension!
3099	1	a	AWESOME GOT IT FROM STEAM FAMLIY SHARING SOOOOOOOOO GOOD
2140	1	a	rly AWESOME game!!
569	1	a	I LIKE TRAINS!
4209	1	a	Awesome game as always - doesn't seem to change platform to platform, though, minus the graphics.. I would recommend it for on the go play, such as the DS version
1227	1	a	Club Penguin: Advanced Warfare
1094	0	a	I can't really say Snuggle Truck is worth playing on anything apart from a mobile device. There is no point to this game being on PC since it would be perfect on IOS.   The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of 'snugglies' in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.  The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it).   User created levels will add replayability here, but don't waste your time playing.
1866	1	a	Monaco: What's yours is mine , is one of those games I don't want to play, because I'm afraid I'll finish it. Luckily it has Steam workshop, so there's no fear of that anymore. :=)
2610	1	a	Sweet game with great graphics, reccomended to stealth/heist lovers or to destruction lovers, enjoy!
3472	1	a	Very Good game 7/10
3352	0	a	Double Fine is a bit like Pixar. They bring a certain magic and charm to all of their products. Most of their games are quite humorous and the stories are creative and unpredictable.  So if Double Fine is Pixar, Costume Quest is Double Fine's 'Cars.' It's not a bad game. The premise is nifty and the jokes will make you grin, but there are just better showings if you want the Double Fine experience.   Costume Quest takes place on Halloween, and you are a kid who has to rally some friends to trick-or-treat your way through town to save your sibling. It's colorful and delightful, like playing an old-school Nickelodeon cartoon. But after about an hour the old school Nickelodeon is overshadowed by the old school RPG game mechanics, which are repetitive and don't provide much actual decision-making or challenge. The story is divided into three beautiful set pieces, but again, the game play in each set piece is identical. Same main tasks, same exact sidequests, and the costumes you collect for monster fights aren't varied enough in their abilities to matter.  If you love Double Fine and you're very tolerant of JRPG-style gameplay, you'll probably have fun, but I wouldn't make this your first Double Fine game. Psychonauts is the one to go with.
3898	1	a	This game was really enjoyable and surprisingly challenging at times, I do have to say I had to retry the last battle a couple times in order to win. The story line was cute, you play as the brother or sister, and you have to save your twin who was taken by monsters who thought they were candy. The combat was interesting, using turn based events as well as quick time events. All the character designs were really adorable, but the costumes turned honestly badass during combat. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and can't wait to play the next one.
2944	1	a	Great multiplayer, you have to work as a team, if you dont everything gets screwed up and it all becomes crazy, running and freaking out. so much fun, deffently wotrth buying.
2248	1	a	Such a gorgeous, brilliantly unique game. I love it.  (As always, ignore my play time as I play offline too often.)
3775	1	a	Costume Quest is a lot of fun. The gameplay is pretty simple, yet it sucked me in. The Double Fine sense of humor makes me want to see what happens next in the story. I am happy to own this game.
3999	1	a	If you like Psychonauts, this is the game for you! Double Fine does a fantastic job creating a world that is funny, full of opportuinities of self-expression and is extremley addciting!
1935	1	a	Monaco is a unique take on the Heist genre and I applaud it.    Story
858	0	a	The game is fantastic, so adictive but its a pay to play game, I would pay 30 euros for it one time, but not 5 euros and 5 euros and 5 euros, pay once not endless!!!!!!.
81	1	a	Fun little puzzle game, certainly pretty and colorful. Very short though, short enough that it is disappointing because the game is over before it feels like it even starts.
1723	1	a	If there ever was a game this is the one. 
3669	1	a	super fun and very addictive. can't wait for the sequel this autumn!
4520	1	a	What an immersive game! Hour upon hour with what seems to be endless gameplay of pure fun. Whether you going for the big catch(no pun intended), or casually enjoying the company of the incredibly wide variety of fish, you are going to have a brilliant time - a must buy in the 21th century.
3434	1	a	        My Playthrough
1909	1	a	how to be a thief? then play this game...  8.5/10
1687	1	a	Great game to play with friends
2021	1	a	I thought gunpoint was a hard spy game. THIS is a HARD SPY GAME. YOU WILL DIE. (at least once)
3343	1	a	I had some good fun with this game. You can either play it casually or just dive into it and go full Costume Quest. I like the idea of the game and the different costumes that they used. With the first area you also get a very nice Halloween feeling.  The game looks pretty for the size of the game and the animations are nicely done. It obviously repeats very often and you might find that more variety would have been good but its not the case here.  The normal fights are not that hard and you should be able to win them with not much problems. Except if you are like me and forget to use stamps. The bosses can be tough without a strategy but are manageable.  All in all I liked playing this game and can recommend it.
497	1	a	I just recently discovered this wonderful Eurogame during Game Night at a friend's house - and was instantly hooked! The online version is every bit as good as the board game, especially since the solo play allows me to polish my skills and learn the ropes before taking on opponents online.
77	1	a	Loved this puzzle game. It was challenging and different. Just wish it was longer.
4023	1	a	One of the cutest and funniest games ever made! Keep 'em coming Double Fine!
2159	1	a	I really cannot recommend this game highly enough. The artwork is nothing short of beautiful, the story is intriguing, and the gameplay is perfectly paced to accommodate for both strategy and quick thinking. This game is perfect example to illustrate how amazing indie games can be.
5182	1	a	great game but causes my laptop to overheat
2625	1	a	Excellent game! Loving the missions so far. 10/10
301	1	a	I made it to 2nd place in the world on survival.
1486	1	a	Yes! I definitely recommend playing and trying out this game. Very challenging at first but once you get the hang of it it's truly a great game. Co-op is where this game truly excels at, though. You can find yourself putting lots of time playing this game with friends. 8/10
4210	1	a	Recommended for those who like match 3 games with some additions. It was an enjoyable way to pass time while I was doing something else - watching TV, or waiting for people, or flying somewhere. Some replayability with the different classes &amp; general randomness.
5049	1	a	Puzzler World 2 is yet another collection of random puzzles, similiar to Puzzler World. Just with more of same, but more variety too.  And well, it's still a good collection of way more types of puzzle than one person would like. The interface feels a bit more of smartphone-designed, just a very slightly more, and it's still not intuitive for PC game, giving you just many pages of randomly spread out puzzle selection.  On new offer is a change of reward system. Now it's not completely random and requires a bit more of errrrr skill. You have a roulette that you can roll with a given power. Trick here is to give it less than 100% of force.  It also added Master mode, a smaller selection of much harder variants for each puzzle types. Fun.  And yes, variety got improved. It can have more of puzzles you like. And more of puzzle types that don't fit for you. Too many more crossword-type puzzles for myself.  So yes. Good game if you just want a big collection of puzzles.  While I am still using it for only Link-A-Pix puzzles.
2426	1	a	This is an awesome game. The gameplay is challanging in many different ways and each level has a great degree of replayability. The different classes change the way of how to approach the given tasks. But not only the way how you play the game is unique, the aestetic is as well. The artstyle is great, the music and the rare voicesamples in french reminds the player of old heist films. Coop allows to finish the stages with friends or random players, the workshop support and the level-editor allows to create levels and share them or just play user created content. Everyone who is on the search for a nongeneric AAA-game should take a look at it, it's worth the price.  TLTR: Awesome game, buy it.
1323	1	a	Amazing, theres so much skill needed. You have to try and knock each other a ice berg while not trying to die yourself. Recommended.
2864	1	a	(Local) co-op is a lot of fun, the story is great. Once you've completed the game once, you can try and master all classes, get all trophies. Play online with a friendly community and see what strategies other people have come up with.
2327	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Monaco is about a bunch of crooks and thieves breaking out of jail and getting to safety. The art style is awesome and it gets even better when you have 3 friends to play with. You can also play 4 player local which i think is awesome!!!
2504	1	a	super awesome game of amazing-ness
1389	1	a	I do enjoy playing this game, but I received it free from a promotion. Unless the makers of the game add more features I would not pay much for this game - definitely not $15.
2328	1	a	~~~
2806	1	a	ahhh this game is so much fun!
4749	1	a	â¥
2664	1	a	this game is cool
2900	1	a	The world needs more games like Monaco.  Monaco is easy to learn, yet challenging enough to hold my interest. It has a nice polished finished and was given the care every game dev should give their games. Monaco is couch co-op, which is always a plus, and it has it's own unique enviroment and atmosphere which really immerses you in the game world. I even found the story to be compelling, despite that story only be a few lines of text between levels. I became attached to specific characters and their personas.   My only complaint is that the AI can seem simple at times. For example, if I am caught via alarm and then seen by a guard, but I manage to escape then all is well. I feel their should be an option for the AI to change behavior if an alarm is sounded or a player is seen. It would be neat if SWAT showed up when you set off the alarm at a casino.  9/10 - Only because the AI can isn't as dynamic as I would like it to be, but considering the type of game it is and the fact that nearly every other aspect of the game is amazing, I can overlook this flaw almost as quickly as I notice it.
4409	1	a	Finally, a game all about 2016!
510	0	a	It was better before the update. If there were setting to toggle some of the new 'features' it wouldn't be too bad.

1016	1	a	If you like games with cute graphics, catchy music and simple fun gameplay you could do much worse than this.   With only accelerate, decelerate and tilt as your controls, the objective is to take your truck through an obstacle course without allowing your cuddly toys to fall out.   I really like it. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes and then put down, and the upbeat music puts a nice big grin on my face.   What more can you ask for?
5438	1	a	Awesome litttle mini game based on the Space Invaders format. Might give you a headache after a few hours of playing though.
1461	0	a	Cannot recommend this game.
456	1	a	I have homework due tonight but i have time for one last game..
1903	1	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥in' awsome !
3342	1	a	it's addictive!
3853	1	a	Really fun.
3682	1	a	2 words : Simple, but charming. Very easy to beat. A very, very simplistic combat system. The RPG-style progression (if you can call it that) is extremely simplistic. ..... It's gameplay is *very* simplistic, I dont think I need to spell it out for you any more than this. Now, on to the aesthetic... It's quite charming, it's nothing high-tech, it's very simple (noticing a pattern here ?) but it fit in well with the game as a whole. Condensed : It's a charming story about kids being the heroes of Halloween on a quest to save a maiden in distress. Battle evil goblins, trolls and... birds?... and acquire oh-so-precious CANDYYYYY!!!,,, oh and there's also some witch-spanking (inapropirate?) and Bone bashing (you'll get it) battles... 2 of them (but enough for the lame jokes!). I'd definitely recommend (even harder if it's on sale).
5246	1	a	+ It's beautiful and cute. + Thanks to amazing game design, puzzles are never frustrating for long. The game is non-linear after the first 20%, so you can finish it taking the route you want (though a specific route is suggested to ensure a progressive difficulty curve). If you're stuck, you can still go to another place of the map, you may learn there a trick that will help you find the solution to your initial problem. You'll be sure not to waste time, since side tracks that aren't necessary to finish the game are always pretty short, and are filled with collectibles. + Not a single word outside the menus and the credits! You learn everything you need through puzzles. + The game is cuuute! + You won't have to inspect every square centimeter of the levels to find the secrets. The game gives you a tool to detect the collectibles, so your only problem will be how to get to them (via, you guessed it, a puzzle!). + Did I mention this game is cute? â(^3^)â  - Such cuteness seems to be pretty ressource-intensive, especially the litghting. In places where several lighting effects were taking place, the game often lagged despite my pretty good equipment. Never was a problem for the gameplay though.  ââ( âââ)ââ May the birds be with you! ââ( âââ)ââ  /|\( ;,; )/|\ Watch out for bats! /|\( ;,; )/|\
3639	1	a	Collect Costumes, Complete Quests and Engage Enemies in Battle using your newly acquired battle suits.
4022	1	a	Darla just needs a hug and you win the game.
3802	1	a	This game is great for those that are looking for a casual experience. Even better is that it's suitable for all ages, so don't let the name or theme fool you. I particularly liked the humor in this game. The variety of costumes and abilities however, is offset by the fact that soon after you get the basics of the game, battles become very tiresome. The game also offers a bit of strategy... no seriously, combining the correct costumes with the correct abilities (battle stamps), and choosing who attacks what and with what is pretty enjoyable, challanging, and evenrewarding once you reach the harder enemies.  All in all, this game is casual, so if you're looking for adventure or action, you've com to the wrong place.
1659	1	a	Story mode that can be played in co-op from the very start. Exciting to play in teams, and the more the merrier!
4499	1	a	anoyingly fun considering the game is just a bunch of simple sprites moving about a basic map. it is surprisingly in depth and addictive in the pursuit of carrying on the generations of your beloved sprites and remarkbly very few bugs.
3778	1	a	When buying this game I was unsure what exactly to expect, but I am very satisfied with the game. Every zone may seem repetitive, but with the new challenges and quests, it makes up the same act of going door to door to receive candy or engage in a battle with a monster. I would recommend this game as it provides hours of fun gameplay while still keeping it fun to play through.
4861	1	a	Eh. It was a good game. But honestly, I don't know how good. Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.  The one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.  Other issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.  On top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.  And to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.  The Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the 'surprise' in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.  I think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them. Worth a look if you want a casual puzzle experience and find it on sale, but don't expect too much out of it.
2807	1	a	Fun game, really picks up in the later levels. Best played with 4 people so everyone does stupid stuff .
5523	1	a	If you enjoyed Space Invaders back in the day, and would enjoy the added bonus of power-ups in such a game, then this game is for you. Simple, colorful, proper challenge-to-advancement ratio, and most importantly: Fun to play. For the type of game that it is, I would give this a 10/10. -70sG
3465	1	a	Very enjoyable small adventure game with a Halloween theme.
958	1	a	Beautiful but very short Hidden Object game in a steampunk setting.
1522	1	a	Great coop play, good couch game. Different play styles accommodated with different classes, challenging levels that make you work together.
2090	1	a	All my friends defriened me because i kept on smashing through walls and got them kiled.   11/10 would friends friends again.
1350	1	a	My favorite sonic game yet.
4278	1	a	It's the same 'on crack' feeling you get playing Katmari Damacy, just a little watered down...But it's still BAD-â¥â¥â¥!
1247	1	a	It's like Super Smash Bros Dodgeball
3720	1	a	Cute, cute, cute! Absolutely adore this game, from start to finish! Combat style is fun, even though it does get a bit repetitive getting closer to the end, but generally is very enjoyable. I actually kind of wish there were more bosses that were harder, like the end bosses. I'm very satisfied with this game, though I would really like to see Costume Quest 2!
4827	1	a	8/10
904	1	a	This is a great board game and a great PC game too. Nice job.
4048	0	a	A conspiracy theorist's wet dream. Your worst nightmare.  Charming debut vibe though.
2301	1	a	crazy insane co-op action, definately buy the four pack get some friends together and enjoy
4920	1	a	Amazing game. It's a unique and different physics game. Definately worth it, buy it now!
4610	0	a	Spend more time trying to get it to work on Windows 7 than trying to make the machines in the game work..
2339	1	a	I like the game and its mechanics, seriously. but all fans of the game will agree with me when I say they were expecting a better art style. the flashy neon colours are cool enough but all players appear to be fat, hunkering lumps. the games also a tad expensive. Still, a great game
534	1	a	Great adaptation for a board game classic!
5287	1	a	this is a bright and cheerful platformer wonderful game for relaxing
536	1	a	Great casual game to play with friends. Easy to pick up and fun to play. Can't wait till they add more of the board types. If they ever do that is.
2978	1	a	A game of hiesting,sneaking/killing,and funny missions where you can disquise or kill with an arsenal of weapons.Completing levels with the silent touch using smoke bombs and disquises or just use the gentlemen to make a duisquise while hidden,But you can always go in guns ablazing well after finding a gun first.
1363	1	a	This was the only game from the action indie pack that I actually enjoyed. Good thing I got it for 90% off. Please play this with friends.
4545	1	a	If you like puzzle games, this is a pretty good one. My only complaint is that there are not enough maps. Although there are player made maps, it just isn't the same.
3679	1	a	I am an achievement hunter and this game while having simple gameplay game me my fix!
356	1	a	Well, its not often you stumble across games such as this, a gem of an indie which is both gorgeous to look at and ridiculously addictive. The basic concept is a two stick arcade / high score / challenge type affair, guiding your ball across the 'waves' and defeating various enemies to achieve combo's and bombs. The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.  All in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!
2469	1	a	Got this on sale for 1.50, a LOT of content for such a seemingly simple game. Multiplayer is great fun but haven't played it alone.
2444	1	a	Fun with friends.
4583	1	a	Tower Defense with rotating orbits? Nice idea and perfect execution. Chalangable difficulty level, old sf movies background featuring real actors cutscenes and fine auio-video make this game interesting option for everyone looking for tower defense with some spices
1282	1	a	Fantastic game has a more competitive scene than CS:GO
1636	1	a	Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer. Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play. Playing with friends is where this excels. Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun. If you dont have this and see it on offer for under Â£2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.
3209	0	a	Obulis Review - Raymond K. Turcotte  Were do I start? My first impression of the game was ' Wow, a cheap rip off of Cut the Rope' but after really giving this game a chance, i relized how good the game really is. The music, soft mellody has a really good effect to the players and most likely makes them continue to play it. The Artwork also has a really good impact.  But, I don't recommend the Game. UNLESS, you like 'Cut the rope' type game, then this game is for you!
4119	1	a	Fun game, took me nearly 50 hours to complete my first run through, including side quests. Lots of replay value, as you can chose to be good or not so good. :P

1142	1	a	for the 19c VERY GOOOD
2779	1	a	This game looks simple but it is more than meets the eye. Its a clever concept with suprisingly difficult gameplay. the comination of cooperative online gameplay and story based campaign is totally unique.
3362	1	a	A game about the fantasy of children who can use 'special abilities' and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented. Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy. The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at. You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.
4369	0	a	PC-only gamers: this is your chance to play a bad version of Katamari Damacy.
5192	1	a	Really fun the building is very fun althought it would be nice to see some other sandbox options i havent really played the campagin as im more intressted in just building
2177	1	a	To be honest i have no clue whats going on but it is very enjoyable for some reason, maybe its all the colours **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR COLOUR BLIND PEOPLE**
1352	1	a	This, is the end, the only end.  The ground was melting, the food getting scarce , the war erupted. But with our food so reduced who were the ones who had the idea to use fishes as weapons? Was it a warrior from the stern Pinks or a fisher from the dumb Yellows ? Who started to lure the children with booby trapped fishes ? The angry Greens? All these weeks after, I still don't know . All I know is that it was us, the noble Blues who scorched the land with mines stolen to the humans.   All these fights, all this war, the endless labour, the running, the sliding, the teeth in the water, the brief moments of elation: soaring into the air , flying even, just to descend as the flipper of Sedna to angrily push our ennemies off the ground, to push them in the water, to the teeth waiting in the water.   The Blue became the avatars of death, fighting all the other tribes in the ambient chaos of mutual assassinations but in the end we prevailed. Like Sedna said, there could be only one tribe of penguins.  Now, only the Blues. The ground is melting still. The food is scarce again. The teeth in the water. The teeth, in the water.
5324	1	a	Great little puzzle game. Surprising complexity given the simple controls. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice challenge you don't have to drop dozens of hours into.
2840	1	a	Nice game. Extremely nice! For those who are wondering if Monaco will run on their Macbook: I can run it on my Macbook Pro 13' late 2011: CPU: i5 2.4GHz; GPU: Intel HD Graphics 3000 with about 300MB. Just have to switch graphics quality to low, but even then it still looks beautiful!
4819	1	a	Others will say 'if you like Portal, play this.' I'll be more specific. This is a game where you actively figure out the puzzle scenario placed in front of you using the tools you have. Your left hand will be busy (combining and alternating dimensions) compared to Portal's right-hand activity (of making portals). Timing is important, but split-second timing is not; planning is much more significant. The sense of humor tends to mad-science whimsy; John De Lancie brings his Star-Trek 'Q' personality to the player's uncle narrator. The game's plenty challenging in its short length (I spent about 6 hours with multiple quick retries in several sections). In short, I was so fond of this I bought it for others.
2332	1	a	Great game with awesome music and gameplay. Probably one of the best Indie-games I've played this year.
262	1	a	If you do not buy this game you do not enjoy things that are the best.
412	1	a	My hands hurt as I dodge right and swing down the screen, my gun swinging in the opposite direction as I take out the swarm of yellow at close range. In the clear but if I'm going to keep my multiplier I can't dawdle. I veer off towards a growing cluster of explosive death, hitting slow motion to dart between two oncoming enemies. Bomb ready, but if I just hold off for a few moments longer... oh crap.   At the heart of Waves is managing the risk-reward ratio. You can take the game at your own pace, but only by pushing yourself to your limits will you achieve your best scores. In doing so it manages to avoid the frustrating âbrick-wallâ that can hamper many other dual-stick shooters. Dying is more often a result of you misjudging your own skill, than it is the game throwing more at you than you can handle, and very rarely a result of anything âunfair.â While as the genre-name suggests Waves works much better with a gamepad, Iâve found it is easily playable with a keyboard and mouse, albeit at the expense of finer movement control.   The game provides six different game modes, which serve to shift the balance of different elements of the gameplay. Survival, Rush and Crunch Time alter the balance between the need for speed, power and survivability; Bombing Run and Chase require you to move quickly from one target on the arena to another, favouring those with manoeuvrability and path-finding skills. Finally challenge mode is all about accuracy, and conserving your shots for maximal efficiency.   Waves is the first dual stick shooter that has really managed to capture my attention, managing to deliver on âeasy to learn, hard to master,â without sticking a vertical cliff in the difficulty curve.
2720	1	a	Very good game would recommend it. Only downside is the pvp it gets either overly boring or 2 chaotic. 
2566	1	a	Buy. This. Game!
4084	1	a	One of my favorite puzzle games. Back when the PSP first came out, this is mainly all I played. Ridiculously hard at some points, but the colors are art will make you happy on the inside.
2037	1	a	this is a fun game to play with with friends, by yourself its not as fun
879	0	a	Board game turned video game. Waste of time basically, since you can only play a couple map configurations without paying cash. That how they GET YA!  Skip it!!!  4/12
5047	1	a	Hardcore Puzzle   Destroy The Brain  10/10
3086	1	a	Helped me successfully plan and execute an actual bank heist.  10/10
4490	1	a	Nice little relaxing casual game. The series is really fun and well thought-out. The art is amazing and I definitely recommend it if you want a break from shooting stuff all the time.
4710	1	a	Amazing! Very unique style of puzzle, never seen anything like it before :D Totally buy it :D
1670	1	a	Played the same pvp map until 3 in the morning 10/10
5471	1	a	very fun and addictive, the best space invader. 
4293	0	a	In short: This game is a cheap ripoff that learned nothing from the game design decision that made katamari damaci great. And while nearly every aspect of 'The wonderful end of the world' could be criticised, from the horrible graphic design, to the confusing UI and complete lack of charm, it's probably faster to note that there is no promise anywhere in this Indie game. The Developers sat down, though really hard about katamari, and instead of trying to improve or match that PS2-Gem, found that they had absolutely nothing to say about it. No reedemable factors mean nobody should waste his time buying this.
1159	1	a	Awesome game, the memories, the feels. 10/10
1096	0	a	Once upon a time I played a flash game where you drove a motorcyle over ugly blocky terrain and did tricks and stuff to get through increasingly difficult levels.  This game isn't half as engaging as that flash game was, so I got bored of it pretty quickly. The levels I played were all just straight drives from left to right with slightly modified landscape. Boring.
2094	1	a	I bought this when It came out and it was worth it. Updated every now and then, still in development and exactly why I like Indie devs way more than the big industry publishers. Great game, buy it nao.
1727	1	a	I didn't know what to expect when I first played Monaco, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it that it's fast, tense, and fun! It's interesting to play levels over and over by switching up your characters, and seeing what works out best, and while I'm not good enough to start doing speed-runs, it also adds even more replay value to the game.
4804	1	a	Couch surfing period.
2585	1	a	Even thought I just started this game, I find it quite entertaining even thought I didn't know what to do half of the time. But, once you get the concept of the game down, then it's super easy to play. Plus, if you get the right kind of weapon, then you are invinsible in this game. I'll keep playing this game, it passes the time away.
1815	1	a	A lotta fun with friends 8/10
3371	1	a	Funny and interesting game suitable for any age and short enough so you (or kids) are not bored... Combat is pretty easy, but that is to be expected, because it's pretty much aimed to be played by kids...  Recommended...
2583	1	a	Great fun, even tho confusing as fun and I would recommend getting your own friends to play it with.
3875	1	a	I am an achievement hunter and this game while having simple gameplay game me my fix!
806	0	a	While the game itself is quite nice and a faithful adaptation of the board game, the pricing policy for the additional maps is an outrage. For the price of two simple additional maps I could get all of 'The Witcher', for instance. All sense of proportion has been lost here. Go buy Mini Metro instead!
4294	0	a	Poorly done knockoff of the Katamari games. Clunky, buggy controls; poor collision detection; and none of the story, humor or charm of the original Katamari games. You can go through all the levels in about an hour. For the $10 you can buy the original Katamari Damacy.... go do that, it's infinitely better.
4875	1	a	Complicated but fun
703	1	a	I must say i shouldn't have bought this particular game, as i didn't like the tabletop game either... but it is a very well designed game which will fully satisfy Ticket to Ride lovers and will be a nice experience for anyone who wants to have some fun alone or with friends. It offers a multiplayer possibility that will eventually kill the tabletop game itself, and it is MUCH easier to get different maps with the DLCs (buying them in real life was a pain in the â¥â¥â¥)  only problem may be the fact that some rules are not clearly explained so i strongly recommend reading the whole rulebook before playing
3977	1	a	A bit short for my tastes - finished it in one night, both the main story and the DLC. But the reason for that is that it's a pretty fun game at the core. Collecting costume pieces to get the whole suit calls out to the collector in me.
3733	1	a	Fun, easy and laid back. Funny story and cool characters. Only problem with this little gem: no voice dialogue, it's all text bubbles. Good, qwirky, and Tim Burton esque Halloween game. 8/10
3710	1	a	This game was really enjoyable and surprisingly challenging at times, I do have to say I had to retry the last battle a couple times in order to win. The story line was cute, you play as the brother or sister, and you have to save your twin who was taken by monsters who thought they were candy. The combat was interesting, using turn based events as well as quick time events. All the character designs were really adorable, but the costumes turned honestly badass during combat. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and can't wait to play the next one.
5448	1	a	Space Invaders on Steroids  10/10
4042	1	a	This was a really fun and interesting game - the main character's naive dialogue and British accent makes the game. It was really fun. If you've played the Nancy Drew games from HER interactive - it's very similar to that, but it's third-person and takes place in a future. Save often and interact with your makeup kit when you're pressed for leads.  There were a few annoyances, however. -clunky gameplay. While your curser usually becomes a hand when hovering over interactive items, items sometime have a small soft spot so it's hard to tell what exactly you can and can't interact with. Also, when moving between screens, sometimes you aren't in the exact spot to move so you're effectively stuck on one screen until you can get your character to activate the next screen. -while on the topic, the graphics are reminiscent of older Tomb Raider games. If you can't handle older graphics, take a pass at this game. -confusing passage of time. The game itself will tell you your location and the current time when arriving at a new destination, but you don't have a clock or anything telling you how long you're at a location - sometimes you can visit three people in a day, other times you don't have enough time. But this was a minor inconvience - at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how long it takes you :) I ended up beating the game twenty days into the investigation.  -Sometimes it is hella confusing what you're supposed to be doing. There's no small map telling you where you can go, but your character is good at being like 'nope I don't want to go there.' Diary prompts can give you some idea of what to do. Definitely glance through a UPS-Hints walkthrough to give you a better idea of what to do. -Dialogue. When asking questions, a small prompt gives you a small glimpse of what your character will say, but it can be hard to steer the conversation where you want it to go.  All in all, it has a few annoyances, but a kick-butt female lead character who is charming in her own right makes the game totally worth it. I ended with a 93 HDI, Nix would be so envious ;)
2012	1	a	nice co-op game. recommended
719	1	a	Great board game. The IRL version can get mess I am sure so its nice to have a PC copy when you don't feel like setting up a game for 30 minutes.
293	1	a	I always start to play without the intention of going on too long. That never happens and I end up trying to beat my high score for quite longer than I expected. It has smooth controls, glitzy graphics and a pulsing soundtrack(with one really really great song on there).
4362	1	a	Decent little Katamari clone but definitely falls short in every way when compared to the original series it tries to copy. Iffy controls and a twitchy camera dont help, also I had to replay the Internet Cafe stage so many times because of getting stuck between the walls and objects causing me to losing valuable seconds on the clock. I don't remember buying Wonderful End of the World, likely got this one in a bundle and it probably cost a couple of Â£s. To be fair I might of got this game sooner if I had know it was made by Dejobaan Games since I really enjoyed the two AaaaaAAaaaAAA!!! games.
4940	1	a	The design for everything is like a Pixar film: bright, colourful and charming.  The gameplay is a lot like Portal: easy to come to terms with but requiring out-of-box thinking at times. The plot -- or rather, speech -- you're constantly berated with is like a bad culmination of both: unending one-liners, bad puns, non-sequiters and dissenting jabs at your ability(s).  You're treated to four different filters, or dimensions as they call it, that impact on the world around you: fluffy, heavy, slow and reverse. Naturally you can only use one at a time but require multiple in order to solve the puzzles before you. Transporting large objects, for example, requires that you make it light (fluffy), throw it, slow down time, run round obstacles, switch back to fluffy and catch it again. The ways the game has you using these different dimensions in unison may not be initially intuitive, but they certainly arent illogical.  Its got that same wonder and feel to it that the original Portal did. I dont think the gameplay elements are strictly original, but the way it handles and presents them (much like its pseudo-ancestor) provides much satisfaction that it makes a rather hard thing to dislike. It perhaps skirts a little heavy on Portals tailcoat, but it'd be a wholly different thing if it didnt.  You won't feel bad for playing it, but you may feel a little guilty for giggling at the portraits in the games when viewed from different dimensions.
3961	1	a	Mario &amp; Luigi rpg's meets Double Fine. Is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good mayne.
1092	0	a	It's not that Snuggle Truck is  bad  per say, it's just...not very good.  Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.  I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.
1541	1	a	Monaco. As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris &amp; Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not.  Monaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael 'Canned' Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the 'why' or 'how' of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scÃ¨ne denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg. Who's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, 'The Man with a Hat on his Head' will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.
3512	1	a	Got this in the Halloween Sale and loved every minute. Charming platform fun and ridiculous JRPG-style battles combined to keep me hooked.
501	1	a	I can not recommend this game enough. I loooove the board game version, and I am so happy that there is an online one that I can log in and play for hours. It's fun and almost feels like the real one ( I say almost cause nothing beats the face of a friend when you block them ). If you ever played and enjoyed the board game, you'll love this one too. And you can almost always find someone online to play with, wich is great. But even if you don't you can always practice with the offline version against the cpu. If you are new to the world of ticket to ride, give it a go and you will not regred it. It is really easy to learn and you can have fun for hours. Suddenly you'll find yourself trying to persuade some of your friends to tag along. If you still not sure, go rent from your local library and try it, then you'll definatelly get it. What are you waiting for? Do it...
2421	1	a	Great fun solo or co-op. Become a team of field experts and take it all. good story and level progression.
2245	1	a	Stealthy
704	1	a	Highly recommend to the strategy game peeps!
2718	1	a	This game is undoubtably a co-op game. It requires teamwork, and if you get the job/mission done nicely, you feel like a total badass. Pros : Cool, colorful graphics. Co-op fun. Easy to connect. Several different playable characters. Zonaco, a zombie version of the game which is interesting. A PvP aspect which is fun if played with friends. Very easy to fun. Never crashes. Cons : Not fun alone. Can be aggravating, but that's just a player preference kind of thing.
741	1	a	Great implementation of the board game! This is a game I wholeheartedly encourage everybody to play. You can learn to play it in five minutes, fantastic family game.
4971	1	a	A great game for fans of the Portal games.
1336	1	a	Holy crap , FUN. This is the next call of duty that is how good it is. But really no joke me a and my friend had hours of fun just playing. Recommended
1066	1	a	10/10 Will play again. 
1856	1	a	The only reason you could not like this game is if you have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ peakskills and if thats the case you just aren't good anyways.
3160	1	a	This game is awesome. I did some of the levels on my own but had to watch for a solution on the rest (I would have never solved them on my own otherwise). I like how there is more than 1 way to complete a level sometimes. For example there were 2 different ways to complete one level and I completed it in a 3rd way (mix of the other two). :D Not hard to 100% with the guides available. Recommend it to people that like puzzles and challenges.
5116	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ yo microtransactions! but i had a beer tree so GOTY 2281!
279	1	a	
1441	0	a	You probably should skip this one
2260	1	a	10/10 Wonderful game. Really great with friends (lot of screaming involved) and by yourself (slightly less screaming).  To the bush!
5020	1	a	A very good game for children in development, with a lot of different puzzles, it surely is the best puzzle game i ever saw, but the let down is the resolution, and the fact that it opens in windowed mode all the time.
1922	1	a	Very fun four player co-op. So many ways you can fail.
2911	1	a	Realy fun with 4 friends.
2511	1	a	AMAZING GAME!!!!   P.S. I hardly play it, dunno why tho :P
4040	1	a	Open-ended detective drama about a libertarian dystopia. Some of the puzzles are awful, but it's one of the most unique adventure games you'll ever find.
1529	1	a	Wow wow wow! Another very strong Indie game this year that is a must-buy! At its core, it KIND of feels like a really complex Pac-man. Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons. There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away. Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game! Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!
