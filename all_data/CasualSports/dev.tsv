1364	1	a	This game is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you'll ever play.   Graphics: Not that bad, seems like a game from the fawking mid '00s, but who cares? Saying COD has better graphics than this masterpiece is seriously debatable.  Gameplay: Awesome! Tired of those fake FPS games like Battlefield, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty? I'm sure this is the game for you. Droppin' bombs on innocent penguins all day every day. Conclusion: Although the game has its flaws, it's a must buy. Greatest game I ever played.  4/20. Would seriously consider smoking this.
4720	1	a	its a game like protal there is a story and some puzzels pretty nice to enjoy after a hard day school/work its not that hard but not very ez ez so yea for this price thumbs up
4907	1	a	I only bought it for John de Lancie, and even that is lacking.
547	1	a	Ticket to Ride is an adaptation of a popular board game, with the ability to play against AI, or local or online opponents. The board game has a pretty simple rule set that's easy to learn, and it has some good strategic complexity. I haven't been playing it for all that long, but I've definitely enjoyed what I've played so far.  I found the voice acting obnoxious and turned it off immediately. The music grates after a little while, but you can turn that off too. The game controls pretty well and shows a lot of useful information on screen. The menus are a bit clunky, and this actually makes it a little difficult to get in to the online game lobby.  But really, what matters is the gameplay, and Ticket to Ride has great gameplay. I had fun playing against AI and against humans, and there's tons of replay value. This game will definitely be worth it for board game enthusiasts at full price. I'd still recommend it to anyone that can appreciate a strategic, turn-based game. As for the DLC, it allows you to play on different maps, sometimes with different rules. If you like the base game, the expansions will add quite a bit.
1991	1	a	Stealth and Co-op!!?!? 10/10!
5126	1	a	Another beautiful and funny game from Paradox
3943	1	a	Much Costume   Such Quest Much Candy  10/10 IGN   So Halloween  Much kids    
144	1	a	Fun game. Like 3D tetris... Good game for the money.
5493	1	a	awesome game if you got some free time on your hands. plus its extremely addictive and fun for playing when you get bored and don't know what to play. so i hope you have a good time playing it.
777	1	a	I love this game. I enjoy playing against the computers and online with friends. One of my favorite games to play.
275	0	a	Launch at startup.  - Worked at first, but tabbed out to close other applications that I didn't need. - Tried to get back in the game, but was no longer responding and proccessing was at 0%. - Tried launching again, freezes at startup. - Tried guides by developer, or adding to ask the following questions because none of his methods was working, but obviously he declined. - I'm not smart with game developing, but this needs further development.   Also, my current res. is 1366x768  I want a refund for now.
4926	1	a	Its lagging very bad, is there anything i could do to make it not lag?
5022	1	a	The Sequel to Puzzler World is just a little expanded version. Some new gamemodes are added like Fit Word which is a drag and drop Crosswords , or one like a Crosswords reverse. There are also little graphical changes. Now you earn your hintpoints after a solved puzzle on a wheel of fortune. The biggest lack of this game is that it is only in english. Very hard for people outside the UK to solve some crosswords for example. Thats the reason I must invest lots of hint points into unknown expressions. But some of the old game modes and the mathematics riddles are still fun.
1980	1	a	Amazing game, very entertaining. It can get boring but only after a long time of play in one sitting. I especially like the controller support.
5464	1	a	Space invaders with upgrades.It's pretty good.
4683	1	a	This game is great, I found myself laughing thanks to the writing and John de Lancie's voice acting. :D
4716	1	a	I'm loving this game. John Delancie is a great VO, the puzzles are fun even if some will take a few goes. This game CAN run on XP, despite what the minimum reqs say. The DLC is just punishing BS though.
1924	1	a	  it's very fun multi / single player game :) 9/10
3722	1	a	Gameplay is a bit too easy, could probably be a bit better optimised for PC. However, the cutest graphics and characters and story!!! Not too long, it is definitely worth a look in!
5025	1	a	I never played the first installment, but I enjoy this one. The puzzles themselves are of middling difficulty (which I suppose means the game isn't for you, if you're looking for a challenge). If you, like me, aren't very good at sudoku or crosswords (or any of the other types of puzzles offered), it's possible to end up frustrated. The Link-a-pix needs a scroll feature, but that aside, I find the games soothing, and play this when I need to unwind.
3974	1	a	A great RPG made with the iconic style and humor of Double Fine. If you enjoyed Psychonauts and also have a soft spot for turn based battles, then this is the game for you.  For a more in-depth review, visit  http://fovgames.com/2015/11/08/costume-quest/ 
190	1	a	Excellent native 3D vision support. Thousands of colourful pixel are popping out of your screen.  Gameplay: easy to learn. Difficult to master.  Great shooter. I bought it for 2 EUR on sale. Totally worth it. Check out the demo to see yourself. I rate it with 7/10.
2866	1	a	Don't be so dramatic, Troy. The answer is simple: We just have to plan an elaborate heist!
2182	1	a	Amazing game. Whether you want to take it slowly on your own or hop online for some of the most chaotic and unpredictable heists - get the game. Go watch a gameplay vid if it helps - screenshots and trailers don't really do it justice.
4009	1	a	Love it! Childish, but fun. You have to defeat 'real' monsters using your halloween costumes.
467	1	a	8.9/10  I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Geometry Wars. The gameplay and graphics are very similar.  I would think they were made by the same team, but I'm too lazy to fact check that.  The music is great as well, and one of the few games i would consider purchasing the soundtrack for... but i didn't... because I'm a cheap â¥â¥â¥.   Solid twin stick shooter.
4005	1	a	This is very good, good plot, good gameplay, good everything. Overall i'd reccomend buying it
2867	1	a	Love this game. Best played with friends, but mostly oldschool arcade fun.
2451	1	a	'I AM THE MOLE.'
4381	1	a	The graphics are very basic, which I think is fine and even give it a little bit of a 'I'm back in adolescence and creating and it feels good' vibe. The gameplay is solid, and the controls are so good that I keep thinking I'm playing console Katamari and slowing myself down thinking that The Wonderful End of the World has the same limitations. It definitely fills the Katamari craving, and if it was longer and had a bit more to the content (like achievements, ability to see all the weird items you pick up, etc) could easily replace Katamari.
3849	1	a	Addictive and cute game from Double Fine. Turn Based RPG in a simple, fun package.
1953	1	a	Two words to describe this game... 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ it' 10/10
5100	1	a	good game but not as good as dungeon keeper 1-2
3000	1	a	its the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr i will bye the full vershon when it comes out  
4755	1	a	From the mind of Kim Swift, one of the creators of Portal, this little puzzler does not dissappoint. The puzzle mechanics are unique from Portal and just as satisfying. The difficulty isn't quite as high, but this game is worth any Portal fan's attention. Story is generic, the environments lack the polish of other titles, and platforming and timing are overused at times in puzzle solving, but even those flaws aren't enough to diminish the experience. A++
3360	1	a	Utterly charming. I grinned like an idiot throughout much of the entire, just-long-enough experience.  Broken down, you and your annoying sibling go off trick-or-treating until suddenly, MONSTERS! When your brother/sister is nabbed, you must retrieve them at all costs.  Set against the backdrop of a neighbourhood on Halloween, you travel across a town battling no-goodniks in a modified turn-based battle system. The powers you have in each fight are determined by the costume you're wearing. Costumes are acquired through standard adventure gameplay, but some cool ones are secret... can you find everything the game has to offer?
1797	1	a	Awesome game. Can meet lots of talented people on it too ^_^
1225	1	a	My sister saw me playing this and asked me if I was playing (in her words) 'a terrorist version of Club Penguin.'  If that is not an apt description of this game, I don't know what is.  --------  Pros:  - achievements (moderately easy to 100% this game)  - trading cards  - fun gameplay  - fun, upbeat soundtrack  - you can customize your penguin  Cons:  - I really can't think of any, other than the fact that you can't change your tribe's color (it's always blue).  ----  I award this game 10/10
1430	0	a	How the â¥â¥â¥â¥ can this game not work? This could run on a potato, let alone my somewhat decent PC. 1/10 Would catapult into the center of the Sun.
3978	1	a	Adorable, fun, AND addictive. What more could you want from a game?
3034	1	a	Fun. Good gameplay, ignored story.
3597	1	a	NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit  http://microfloppy.net/2014/08/12/costume-quest/   Costume Quest is an adventure game by Double Fine Productions. It takes place during Halloween and you are either a twin sister or a twin brother who has to save your sibling from evil trolls.  Unfortunately, when you start the game you can instantly tell that it's made for console. I gave it two minutes of wobbly movement using my arrow keys until I gave up and plugged in the Xbox-controller. You can also tell from the gameplay that this is a definite console game. One part of the game is basically to smash as many objects as possible and to solve easy quests to collect candy, the currency used in game. (And, for me, that becomes hopelessly monotonous.)  The other part is to fight enemies, which is done with a classic turn-based fighting system. There's quick-time events here and you have to be fast on your xyab-buttons to get bonuses when you fight. (Something that also enhances the feeling of this being a console game.)  In the end I can summarize the experience with saying that the graphics and the story gives some charm to the game, but that the gameplay becomes repetative. On the other hand, with an Xbox-controller, it would work great as some casual entertainment on a sickday or when you're a little hung over.  Costume Quest will also be great if you can't get enough of collecting stuff in games. There's a long list of quests, achievements, halloween clothes, trading cards, and stamps that you can try to collect.   4/10 candy corn 
2031	1	a	Amazing game, even better with friends... 11/10.
3728	1	a	Minimalistic, funny and weird, just the way I like it, a bit hard at the beginning it grows on you.
4425	0	a	The follow up to the original Luxor but hardly differs from it's predecessor.  In case you don't know about this game: Your goal is to shoot the right colored balls at the at the balls in the 'snake' (so for example Red on Red), before the 'snake' reaches the exit.   It's a fun game but there are several reasons not to buy this one.  First of all the game is over 11 years old and still has the same expensive price. The second reason is that it's currently unplayable for me because apparently it doesn't work on Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.  
2150	1	a	Hiding in Bushes Simulator 2015
4787	1	a	âââââ
2351	1	a	very simple 2d platformer. but yet very fun and quick for before work or school
4227	0	a	Enh... can be enjoyable, but the game is clunky, difficult to play in long settings, and seems designed to give you carpal tunnel syndrome.
4291	1	a	This game is loads of fun but you will probably not play it after completing it. I feel like I spent more than 2.2 hours but the timer reset after moving onto a new machine. Expect about 10 hours of gameplay.
2736	1	a	Well worth the price, this is a fast-paced and fun game. The look is unique and the co-op makes for a great evening of play.
551	1	a	Great as a board game, fun on the PC too. Just wish it had some better graphic settings for high resolution... and if you could slow the gameplay down to see what your opponents are drawing. Sometimes it can go too fast.
852	0	a	Same as all the others... love it and I'd buy it if it were a one time purchase. No way I'm going to keep paying over and over.
4302	1	a	It's a fun Katamari type game. Nothing all that original, but it was entertaining.
4353	1	a	You don't roll stuff up, but it covers that niche need in a good way. Nice little distraction.
4956	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
4876	1	a	Pros: +Interesting voice acting/characters +Well thought out puzzles  Cons -Not very well optimized  I suggest getting it on a sale if you're interested.
3987	1	a	WHY WOULDN'T YOU BUY THIS GAME  YOU CAN PLAY AS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY  MURRIKA
3033	1	a	Lots of thought put into gameplay and story and maps.  Good game.
3688	1	a	Little fun game, but the battle system could use some more complexity.
1151	1	a	dont waste your money even though its only 29 cents. dumbass game.
2347	1	a	Engaging storyline? Check.  Great gameplay? Check.  Fun as hell multiplayer? Check.  Having a monkey that steals loot for you? Check and mate.  Monaco is one of those games that I could probably go back to whenever I feel down. It's a game that offers an interesting approach to the classic bank heist genre. Highly recommended for anyone that loves the best Indie has to offer.
4217	1	a	A fun little matching game that adds just a bit of strategy to the seemingly random Bejeweled formula. You face off against a host of monsters using turn-based matching to collect color gems to use powers, to attack, etc. The story is a by-the-numbers fantasy plot that exists to simply move you from battle to battle. I'd recommend this as a great game to casually play while watching a stream.
5309	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ outdoes the previous game by doing the opposite of what Toki Tori 1 did. In the first game, you had lots of powers used to solve puzzles in single screen levels. Toki Tori 2 gives you only two interactions (a stomp and a chirp), but does away with the tradition level format in exchange for a huge world teeming with life. The challenge in the game comes from discovering how the creatures in the game react to your two moves and to each other. This makes the game world feel a bit deeper than most Metroidvania style games, as each section has it's own simplified ecosystem that make up the bulk of the game's puzzles.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platforming puzzles, exploration and discovery, or anyone looking for a Metroidvania game without any combat that still delivers a compeling experience.
3890	1	a	super fun and very addictive. can't wait for the sequel this autumn!
5503	1	a	Space Invaders for 2012! Well, it should be, but there's too much of a good thing going on here. As the game is full of unlocks, such as smart-bombs, extra cannons, firing rate increases, shields, etc - it can all get a little too chaotic.   The devs would do well to take a leaf out of Popcap's book here with their Bejeweled games and Zen Mode. Such modes are geared far more towards a casual and 'relaxing' play through of the game - than a hectic, luck riddled blast. Titan Attacks should have a pure, Space Invaders clone-type mode.  The biggest criticism of the game however, is the lack of save point as you progress. Rather than the game saving each mini campaign as you progress from the Earth, onto the Moon and onwards - once you die you have to redo the entire mini campaign again. It's massively draining and frustrating in equal measure and I very much doubt I'll see the game through because of it. The stress simply isn't justified to reach the end! 5.5/10
3822	1	a	Ever wanted a Mario &amp; Luigi-style RPG from the geniuses of humor at Double Fine Productions? Well, look no further. This game is definitely worth the 5-6 hours of your time that it will take to complete, and getting 100% isn't some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t like some other titles I know (looking at you, Assassin's Creed.) Also, Robot costume is the best costume.
1078	1	a	Extremely simple concept and controls which provide more silly fun than imaginable. Great for both adults and children, even extra emotionally sensitive types who might otherwise cringe and be disturbed by cute animals flying outta the back of a truck that's hurtling over all sort of wonderful hazards. Yes, they get run over. Yep, the truck can roll-over and land on the whole lot, but they're drawn to look like inert stuffed critters thereby making the whole deal grandly hilarious instead of traumatic.  Get from start to finish. Keep as many critters in the truck as you can. Catch a few falling extra if possible. Do it all as quick as you can for trophies. Each level has 5 trophies to be earned and many will be maddeningly difficult to obtain. As a bonus you can even come up with your own diabolical levels in the editor. What fun!   I highly recommend this game. Wait for a good sale for extra appeal!
3649	1	a	It's a fun game would and will play again.
5031	1	a	Decent time killer. Get it for cheap (&lt;50% off) and its worth the money.  Don't expect anything more than what is in Puzzler World 1 or the Phone App equivalents. Its the same stuff.  5/10
3557	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
4043	1	a	pros  - story is intriguing and well written. you re investigating a russian immigrant's murder and conspirancy behind it and you re also talking and get information from many interesting characters about victim. game s story very similar Demolition Man's (1993) story.  - characters have very realistic facial animation. developers did pretty good job.  - good puzzle variety. they are not so difficult or easy.  - realistic and sympathetic main and side characters. protagonist has a daily social life and close friend for gossip. she s not just a robotic game character.  - good sci fi atmosphere.  - it s an very long game (uncut version)   cons  - game's graphics dated  - gameplay turn out to be repetetive after a while. you re doing mostly goes around and talking to everyone about victim's private life.  - game s non linear. some people may think this is good but i found very confusing.  - voice acting hit or miss.  -controls and camera angles little bit clanky. you ll have trouble moving on the corridors while playing in door areas.  - ending that leaves a lot of questions unanswered about story.
2741	1	a	Is a very fun stealthesque experience. One of my favorite co-op in a while
3471	1	a	Play it on Halloween and Christmas (or October and December for festive reasons). Why not? Straightforward nothing-super-special-but-still-nice turn-based RPG.
3515	1	a	'Costume Quest' is a fun little RPG. It's not terribly complex or difficult, but that's fine with me, since the complex, difficult RPGs are the ones that have been collecting dust while I don't have time to get into them. It doesn't have quite as much humor as Psychonauts, but it does have some, including a number of sly references to other works of fiction. The costumes all have pretty cool battle animations, even some that I didn't expect. There aren't any bad costumes, either. They are all useful in one way or another. It took me about 8 hours to complete the main game, finding everything, and I still have the 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC to play. Highly recommended.
3845	1	a	I play through this game every year to practice trick or treating
1354	1	a	fun as heck 
3124	1	a	10/10 Killed a dog with a wrench and then stuffed its dead body into a bush to avoid being detected
1412	1	a	This game helped me heal my depression, tuberculosis, HPV and syphilis.
1132	1	a	This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!  UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything.   Pros: Kinda fun at times  Cons: Too easy Broken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join) Framerate drops  Just no  UPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!
5254	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is a wonderful continuation of the first game. As far as puzzle games go, it's incredibly cute and can be extremely challenging. 100% recommend.
4592	1	a	Unstoppable Gorg has a really simple mechanic, low learning curve (but is not easy), a really nice (and very fun) 50's years Aliens and Robots story, and, above of all, is fun.  The game is really challenger, if you love tower defenses, play in level medium, if not, go to easy. 10/10, I was lucky to buy that in Humble Bundle. It's worth every penny.
1426	0	a	Wtf is wrong with this game ?
2188	1	a	Bought it while it was on sale for $1.50. Best $1.50 I have ever spent.
4542	0	a	No. Just no. You can make food, make the people shower or make them pick up socks and wrappers.  There have been NO UPDATES, no new content, no improvements.  This game was thrown together for the devs to make a quick 10$.  Get the Sims.. at least its an actual game.
1452	0	a	Why did I even download this game.
2153	1	a	A game that teaches you how to get away with stealing. The end.
866	1	a	A lot of fun to play. Shame about the pay to play mechanic once you run out of complimentary tokens. WIsh you could buy the game, I certainly would. The devs could price it at $20 and it would be worth it.
1863	1	a	This is sincerely one of my favorite games of all time. It's simple to play, but has room for fantastic strategic thinking and co-op team play. My boyfriend and I have been playing this game fairly consistantly for years. I've spent most of my 35 years playing video games and I've probably never played anything as consistantly as this game. Seriously, cannot recommend it enough.
4657	1	a	Puzzle Chronicles is a puzzle roleplaying game developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Konami Digital Entertainment Inc. This is yet another title in Infinite Interactives growing stable of puzzle games. You are a hero on a quest through the savage lands of the Ashurin Empire in search of your tribesman who have been taken by slavers. Your hero will combat fierce beasts and battle hardened warriors during your travels as you attempt to rescue your people, raise an army and topple the Empire. This being a R.P.G., you have the ability to customize your character but sadly this time there are no character classes to choose from. As you do battle your hero will accquire experience points which will allow you to upgrade a set of skills to suit your particular playstyle and liking. There is also an abundance of gear to collect or craft ranging from mighty weapons, enchanted armor, amulets, etc. to further enhance your character.  One nice thing about Puzzle Chronicles that sets it apart from Infinite Interactives other games is that this title is not a match 3 game. The closest title that I can liken this to is some sort of sideways Tetris game. Stacks of colored gems instead of blocks enter the battlefield from the left side falling towards a wall that divides your area from your opponent's area. You can rotate the gem stacks and place them any way you choose to. Destroying these gems builds power also called 'rage' in this game for your weapons and companion warbeast's attacks. That's right...you can accquire a doge, known as a warbeast, to accompany you on your quest. As you battle, you and your opponent are in a constant tug of war over the wall dividing the battlefield between the two of you. The fight ends when one combatant has no more room to maneuver the gem stacks entering their area because the wall has been pushed too far across their part of the battlefield. The gameplay sounds simple enough but when that divider wall is steadily taking space from your half of the battlefield and the gem stacks just keep coming as your opponent attacks and attacks you really start to feel the intensity of this game. Did I forget to mention the cool little animated fight sequences of your character and your opponent that take place just above the gem battlefield? Besides the story driven battles there are also some mini-games that you can compete in to unlock items and provide even more enhanced abilities.  Graphically I like this game. It has a really nice looking artstyle to it as far as the cutscenes for the story goes and the animated fight sequences that occur as you puzzle battle are impressive and fun to watch. The musical score, like the scores in all Infinite Interactive games, is brilliant and does it job amply but none of the tracks really stand out of the pack to me. Most of the score has a middle-eastern sound to it and is executed quite well though. The sound effects, however, are very well done. Gem explosions and battle sounds are loud and crisp as they should be. The voice-overs in the cutscenes are excellent and do a great job of enhancing the story.  While not my favorite puzzle R.P.G., Puzzle Chronicles does have a nice story that I felt compelled to see through to the end and I also found the deviation from the typical match 3 gameplay to be quite refreshing as well. With that said, one thing about this game that really bothered me is something that I mentioned in another recent review for a match 3 puzzle title...the lack of a good tutorial. Puzzle Chronicles suffers horribly in this failing as you'll quickly find yourself lost after the 'so-called' tutorial ends. You'll have to search the internet for some fan written guides or just play the game and learn things by trial and error which can be quite frustrating. However, once you do learn how to play and what everything means then you can finally start to enjoy the game. This title definitely won't be everyones cup of tea but if you're looking for something a little different in the puzzle game genre then I suggest that you give this title a try.
4275	1	a	OK, so it's more than a little reminiscent of a certain popular series you know and enjoy. Doesn't matter. Game is a whole lot of fun. Wonderful soundtrack, great sense of humor, charming on pretty much every level. It's pretty easy, especially if you're familiar with other 'rolling stuff up' games, but it's worth a play.
1839	1	a	Its amazing! I love the music, style and story! :D
5107	0	a	Mediocre at best. Better to just replay Dungeon Keeper.
1696	1	a	When it comes to heist games, Monaco is King. It is also the king of both hilarity and frustration so to maximize your enjoyment and minimize the frustration do yourself a favor and grab at least one competent partner and one complete imbecile. Trust me, you'll thank me for it later.   Now go out there and get yourself some trophies and some cash... no no.... go out there and get yourself ALL the trophies and ALL the cash.
2247	1	a	A superb stealth game where half the fun is getting spotted and escaping your pursuers. Best played with friends in the same room so you can all yell at each other like lunatics  if  when everything gets chaotic!
1657	1	a	Game is too good. Would buy. Price well. Quality. 10/9 Would buying.
234	1	a	Was expecting a Geometry Wars clone.... got something with way more strategy and scoring satisfaction. I got it on sale for $0.99, so I came out ahead regardless :)
2409	1	a	Monaco will test your skill in timing, planning and hiding as fast as you can. Teamplay is highly encouraged as different classes bring variety to the gameplay. The campaign is plenty long and will not disappoint. And if you're one to collect every last coin, you will definitely be in for a challenge.
4265	1	a	This game is best played with a three drink minimum.
3628	1	a	My girlfriend likes it and it's better than watching Hocus Pocus again for Halloween.
3085	1	a	To state one thing clear: I have owned this game now for about 5 hours and have not seen every aspect of the game in its full depth, but from what I've seen so far I can say, that this game knows how coop functions and is with friends great fun. Its gameplay as well as the artstyle and sound are smooth, funny and simply beautiful.  Especially for the sale price really worth it.
4221	1	a	27th November 2016 I remember playing this years ago on the DS, it blew me away. Period. This isn't your average match 3 game, it has RPG elements and instead of just matching for the sake of a high score or fancy explosions like they do in Candy Crush... You match gems to be able to cast spells, and match skulls to deal damage to your opponent. It GIVES you a reason to match a specific gem type, rather than just matching the first one you see and thus offers strategy that compliments the gameplay well.   Personally I enjoy the music very much, it doesn't seem to loop, then again it might? I'm too fixated to realise. It's that great.   I will admit, the AI and board is often fixed in favour of the opponent, you will see them do many '4-of-a-kinds' in a row and their mana resources will max out in no time as a result of that. But this doesn't bother me, they're still beatable and it only challenges me more which overall enhances my experience. It get's slow around level 1-20, but once you've established a firm strategy or paradigm for your character and their particular set of skills, the game only gets better from there. I'm currently a level 31 Warlock, and in my early levels I thought this class was complete s**t but once i hit mid 20s... boy did I have fun.   BE SURE TO GRAB THE UNRELEASED DLC 'Revenge of the Plague Lord', it contains a lot of bonus equipment, enemies, quests and 4 additional classes (now 8 classes total). With the addition of these classes it adds more replayability and experimentation with other strategies.   I've been waiting for this game to go on sale for as long as I can remember, maybe almost a year? And until a few weeks ago I gave up the wait, I bought it for full price, my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner because this game is worth every cent!!!  Update: 15th December 2016 Level 50 Warlock Just finished the game, all main and side quests completed. With just over 400 battles done, I can say now that this game is truly worth my money. I plan on starting up a new class and going through another game. Warlock is definitely a very powerful class and I didn't realise this until I hit my 40s. Will always be on my favourites list of games. 10/10
3719	1	a	An absolutely FANTASTIC casual/action-adventure title, heavy on the adventure (with a bit of turn-based combat in there, to great effect). For the price, you'll get over 6 hours of universally-appealing gameplay for all ages out of just CQ, and even more from the included DLC.
4431	1	a	The best luxor game out of it's series. If you like games like luxor, don't pass up on this gem!
3095	1	a	fun &amp; runs well on (water-cooled) i5-4440 &amp; IGP, 4gb RAM w/ 1gb allocated to video, at 1080p/60hz/vsync
4891	1	a	Innovation at it's finest, merging physics and fun into one marvelous game. Thinking outside the box has never been this much fun.
3188	0	a	A physics puzzle game where even if you know the solution, you can still fail 10 times in getting it to work out the way you had intended.
2494	1	a	Pretty fun, Team work makes it even better.
3021	1	a	Monaco is original and exciting, but it also makes you think. Moreover, if you are similar to me, it will make you jump. A lot. There's not thrill greater than being chased through an international bank or a mental hospital by a security guard who is intent on beating you up. This game satisfies that need.
4765	1	a	I picked this up the day after playing the demo, and after reading a lot of reviews that make complaints about different parts of it. The demo is a good representation of the final product, with there being mostly just more of everything in it in the full game, including anything that annoys you.  Worst part: Whenever you are required to make very precise jumps, mostly because a lot of the objects you jump on are not simple shapes and can get in the way. Getting stuck on a sofa at a key moment and plummeting to your death is not fun.  Best part: Dimension shifting is awesome and unlike anything I've seen before and the way it alters the appearance of the entire environment adds to this. You owe it to yourself to at least try the demo.  Bonus: Take one of the batteries from Ike when in the slow motion dimension to hear him make a sound worthy of a true interdimensional beast.
4351	1	a	If you've always wanted to try Katamari Damacy but never had the opportunity, I consider this a suitable clone
103	1	a	Lume was an interesting but too short game, the puzzles took some thought to solve and weren't too frustrating to figure out. The most disappointing part of this game is how incredibly short it was, it felt unfinished and lacked any conclusion. I recommend this game as long as you go in with the knowledge that the game is easy to finish in 3 hours.
4211	1	a	Absolutely a classic puzzle game. Avoid the sequel, it has none of the virtues of this the polished first,  This is a must own.
3803	1	a	Quite a fun puzzle game with interesting mechanics. Definitely recommend for puzzle lovers.
1045	1	a	Its very good gaem plz buy
2635	1	a	Incredible, just looking out for some more friends to play with!
3178	1	a	This is one of those strategic casual games. Very challenging at times but very enjoyable figuring out the puzzles. I recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing game.
5209	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a one of a kind experience, an underrated gem that brings puzzle games into a new light.  While there are -no- tutorials, many mechanics are introduced discreetly throughout the game, exploiting the only two abilities the player has. (Stomp and chirp) A useful point to note about this: 'Side paths' often require an undiscovered method of using your abilities. These tricks are introduced in different places of the world map, and to avoid frustration, clear what seems easier and head back after exploring other parts of the world.  Some puzzles, often special areas, are extremely tedious. A slight mistake and the entire process starts over. Unfortunately, rewind mode doesn't exist.  *The main problem with the game is sustaining interest of the player during the first few hours. The vague context of the game takes a little away from the experience. (If it wasn't for google, I would still be clueless what the story was.) Tori's abilities feel extremely limited at the start. While you do learn about the environment and its interactions, it feels like Tori doesn't 'grow' for an extensive period of time. (A lack of reward) Moreover, the game is extremely unique and may feel uncomfortable to people who wants comfort in what they are used to. (Toki Tori 1 or most puzzle games) Chirping melodies also seem like a very important feature used to solve puzzles. (but it isn't, it's the interaction a chirp does)   Conclusion
595	1	a	Good chillout game :D prefer the board game tho
2144	1	a	Awesome game, well worth the money!
4318	0	a	This is a weird sort of katamari-damacy-clone. It's kind of cool to see all of the random â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the game, but once you play through it, you don't really want to go back. It's like looking at a painting that is amusing for the first time you see it, but not worth hanging on the wall to stare at or come back to.  Plenty of way better games out there, this one just comes accross as cheap and poorly made.
3735	1	a	Really adorable. Really fun. And has an interesting kind of combat system that is a mix between pokemon and quicktime events. The quicktime events can get tiresome but still the game is worth it when its on sale.
164	1	a	De you feel bored at work and want to relax? Do you have some time you don't know what to do? Are you waiting when your girlfriend will be ready to go out? Does 'Angry birds' bother you? This game is exactly what you need!  + requirement even for weak notebooks. Trust me, I know. + easy to play. You don't need even to pass tutorial!  + carry away for some hours and makes you a zombie in front of PC. + price. Accessible even for me - beggarly and lazy student.  Conclusion: must have.
5410	1	a	If you're looking for a classic arcade action similar to Space Invaders, this is it. Not much else to say, but it's a good coffee break game!
5057	1	a	Amazingly awful interface, inside the games and not. What other game assigns volume settings on a user-by-user basis? Some of the puzzles are fairly good, others are inscrutable unless you've found your way to the instructions. It's basically one of those thick volumes of assorted sudoku, crosswords, word searches and such made digital and fluorescent. Not bad if that's what you're looking for, and can get past the warts.
3677	1	a	A very fun and light hearted game with awesome soundtrack to motivate you to complete the game (:
5465	1	a	Addictive old-skool shoot-em-up with cool retro graphics and pumpin music. Ship upgrades add a nice level of depth and let you try different strategies.
4953	1	a	Great puzzle game in the same type of style as portal, but with different mechanics.
3464	1	a	A basic turn based rpg with a heaping dose of charm.
2510	1	a	really nice game I like it very much 
3212	0	a	Boring to death. Do not buy! (I got my copy in a bundle)
5501	1	a	Nothing much to say about this one. It's a Space Invaders clone, featuring new stuff that doesn't seem like Space Invaders on later levels, but a whole different bullet hell shooter game. The game has 5 worlds, and 100 enemy waves. You get to upgrade your gunpower, your shields, add Smartbombs, extra cannons (Plus a laser blaster and a rocket launcher.) and the amount of bullets in screen. You better start off upgrading the amount of bullets, cause accidentally shooting and waiting for it to go through the whole screen is really boring. And might get you killed depending on the situation. The soundtrack is good. You can use a keyboard, controller or even the mouse itself. Controls are so simple you can use a MOUSE.  tl;dr version: It's Space Invaders. With Upgrades. And more speed. And more gun. And it's good. Buy it. It's cheap.
395	1	a	Yes it may be very much like Geometry Wars but it certainly has refined it to a absurd degree in terms of gameplay and design, making it my go-to game for twin-stick shooter fun. The differnt game modes coupled with the numerous enemy types makes me always want to give it one-more-try. Definitely give this a try if you like shooters, puzzle, or twitch like gaming.
2369	1	a	Amazing heist game with high replayability value. Would totally buy.
4329	0	a	not stylish, not fun.
692	1	a	A geat table top game that never gets old and provides more fun with the more players you have.
4389	1	a	It was really fun and feels very much like a low budget Katamari game. Complete with picking up objects, growing bigger and simmilar level setup.  Only thing, it's really short (12 Smallish Levels) and has low replayability. I'd reccomend to NOT get this game at full price, wait until it's on sale for $5 or less.
4678	1	a	It's Portal.... that is, if Portal traded its dry and dark humor for a more light and laughable humor. IF it had to do with dimementions instead of portals, and if the narrator WASN'T the villan.       So the opposite of portal.
4047	0	a	It doesnt seem a bad game but, looks and feel really odd. Too odd for nowadays.
2810	1	a	Fun addictive game, great to play with other people.
4708	1	a	John De Lancie narration and Chris Ballew credits tune!   Also, there's a game in there. It's quite alright.  Some hard-to-read puzzles and other head-scratchers.  Worth a look if that sounds like your kinda thing, especially if you get it amazingly cheap or in a bundle.
111	1	a	This is a simple extension into the third dimension of a typical match-x game. You start with a vaguely cube shaped pile of blocks and then fire predetermined color blocks onto the mass attempting to connect at least four of a color, causing them to be removed. In it's base mode each fired block causes the mass to grow while matching blocks causes it to shrink. Take too long or fire too many blocks without clearing any and you'll reach critical mass and lose.  The interesting thing about this game is that at it's heart it seems to want to be a competitive game. In the base mode there are only 10 levels and they have to be completed in one sitting to get a final score and attempt to get on the leaderboard and this leaderboard seems to be what the developers hoped would keep you coming back. Personally I'm not really a fan of this type puzzle game and the competitive aspects are not a draw to me. If you enjoy doing something multiple times in an attempt to hone your skill then this will be well worth the price of entry. If, like me, you're looking for a more encapsulated experience then its probably best to move on.
2285	1	a	What's yours is mine and monaco is mine.
3401	1	a	Really cute game.  The aethestics and gameplay and simple and sweet.   Unfortunately, the gameplay is overly simplified. Press a button, then an attack happens.  The game is short enough that the simple gameplay and story kept my attention, but if you're looking for some deep and meaningful gameplay, you're in the wrong place. Like most of DoubleFine's games, this is short, stylized, and solid enough to hold up to this condensed experience.  Enjoy the experience! ... but don't dig too deep.
198	1	a	This is a good twin stick game, though not quite as polished as Geometry Wars 2 or 3. Looks wise it delivers for the most part and I like the short written verdict on your performance after each game, a nice touch.  The bomb dynamic is a refreshing and clever new twist on the GW format. I'm not totally convinced about the slow-mo ability which seems like an unavoidable fix for the inertia based player movement. Without it you simply cannot change direction quick enough to avoid some potentially impending deaths. With it I feel like I'm activating a cheat, albeit a metered one... The longer I've played it the more these two issues bug me but on the whole the gameplay is pretty good, maybe just not quite perfect for my own taste.  I would have liked the leader boards to show the total number of scores/players, this is a common annoyance also found in the GW games, it is hard to measure your standing without it.   It is good and I would definitely recommend it still, but not as much as when I first played it. Waves 2 is out in early access and I am tempted, while the slow-mo ability remains the player movement looks to be greatly improved...
1927	1	a	This gaym are not sucks its acsurly gud
375	1	a	This game is truly something magical. It has all the qualities of a 'geometry' shooter along with a beautifull ambient styled soundtrack that will mezmerize you everytime you click the Start Game button. If you've always enjoyed playing ambient shooters, definetly consider buying this one.
2229	1	a	great game i loved playing it a lot like payday and payday2
4562	1	a	This is everything right and wrong with gaming.  I lack the superlatives necessary to explain how great the aesthetic of the interstitials in this game are; Retro-â¥â¥â¥ 1950s tin-can science-fiction â¥â¥â¥â¥ with squeaky-voiced rubber aliens and spinning newsprint headlines so earnest in their zany â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t it is beyond all definitions of endearing.  ...the game is basically every tower defense game you've ever played.  Gaming, I wish I could feel fulfilled by you. I wish I could commit. But baby, you just ain't there for me the way I need you to be.
5289	1	a	Is actually a pretty good platform game, not something I would play, but still good. 
5392	1	a	Very addictive, nice looking 'Space Invaders-esque' shooting game with the ability to upgrade your arsenals to go against armies of alien crafts. 100 levels with checkpoints (saves) everytime you beat all stages on each of the 5 planets may make it sound like an easy game, but the game beyond first playthrough disable the checkpoint and you're left to beat the high-score while trying to stay alive... now that's HARDCORE and I LOVE IT!
1085	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game, much like Trials. You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.  The truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).  If Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.
3813	1	a	Short and Sweet. While the storyline isn't much more than a pleasant buzzing noise that filled the space between running around for quest objectives, Costume Quest pivots on a single charming idea and does it extremely well; what if little children could actually become the things they were dressed up as for halloween? The amount of enjoyment you will derive from this game is largely influenced by how much you'd like to have a ninja, a unicorn, and The Statue of Liberty form a ragtag tagteam against hoards of derpy looking demons.
3931	1	a	Costume Quest is a nostalgic rpg/adventure game hybrid with a great art style and aesthetic. The combat is similar to South Park: The Stick of Truth or any of the Super Mario RPGS (SNES/M&amp;L/Paper Mario), with timed button presses integrated into traditional JRPG mechanics. The costume system is fun, but the difference between certain costumes is minimal. Good fun, and with the DLC it will last you around 7-8 hours. I'd reccommend picking it up during the next sale.
4795	1	a	A good first person puzzler. Storyline may not be brilliant, but level designs are great. ---------------------- Portalã©ã¤ã¯ãªä¸äººç§°è¦ç¹ããºã«ãããã¯ã¨ãªã¢å¨ä½ã®éåãæä½ãã¦é²ãã§ããã¿ã¤ãããããã¯ä¸é¨ã´ãªæ¼ãå¯è½ã ã£ãããããæ¦ã­è¯ãã§ãã¦ãããè§£ããæã®éææãå¬ãããæ¥æ¬èªå­å¹ä»ãã ããããã¹ã©ã³ã°ããé¡æå­ããå¥½ãåæã«å¥ãã¦ãã¦ãå­ã¡ãã¾æãã²ã©ããã¹ã¯ã¨ãæ½°ããã
3829	1	a	Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage. It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads. Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.
4557	1	a	TL;DR summary: A tower-defense game with an interesting twist and a fun theme. Recommended if you can get it while it's on sale.  This one was a pleasant surprise. I think everyone is sick of tower-defense games by now, but this one has a pretty interesting mechanic. You place your defense sattelites on building spots on orbits. Each orbit can be freely rotated, but only the entirety of the orbit can be moved. So you can click and drag your towers to make them follow the critters, but you run the risk of moving other towers on the same ring *away* from enemy paths. Similarly, you might end up moving support towers near enemies where they have no business being. So it's a bit more involved than just placing towers and clicking 'go'. So that's fun! The difficulty seems alright, too. I can generally make 'Moderate' at first try. 'Hard' and 'Unstoppable', not so much. There are a few nuisances - like having to reassign Research Points at the start of *every* mission - but nothing too grating.  The writing is pretty nice. Obviously, a game like this isn't going to have astonishing Deus Ex-esque plot - actually, the fact that there's a plot at all surprised me. It's deliberately patterned after horrible old sci-fi movies, which is nice if you like it. (I very much do!) If you don't, well, you can skip the cutscenes and you won't lose anything.   So on the overall, I'd say this is well worth it, if you can get it for less than 10 dollars. A few things made me roll my eyes - really, you don't need to tell me five times about what enemies are vulnerable to - and obviously it's a bit rough around the edges, but nothing big. I could see this do nicely on mobile devices. How about an Android port?
361	1	a	Wow. This game is awesome. It looks amazing, is really fun, has cool music, and addicting. This game is totally worth the 2 dollers and I would reccomend it to anyone.
4918	1	a	Let's see...  1. This is a Portal knock-off...  2. ...developed by a former Portal team member...  3. ...with John de Lancie narrating...  4. ...and a level named after a Tenacious D song.  Oh, and it's a great game, too.
3031	1	a	Wonderful game, lots of fun to be had. I especially enjoy the disguises where you can move around undetected for a small amount of time. Thoroughly enjoyed this so far. Recommended!!!!!
1536	1	a	My favorite multiplayer game of the past several years. Pacman meets Keystone Cops meets The Pink Panther.
1484	1	a	well, 70% of my steam friends are from this game, that's how good the multiplayer community was back then. (can't say how it is for now cause haven't play it again in a while tho).  tl;dr : great sp game, fun(?) mp times.
3708	1	a	I get to be a robot.
2826	1	a	very fun game, relaxing and casual
3960	1	a	Sweet as candy!
3798	1	a	Double Fine magic. Short and sweet and not harmful to your teeth.
4065	1	a	The tables look great, but the ball physics are bizarre. The game seems to run fine, but the ball shakes ansd seems weightless.  Wouldn't even recommend to try even out of curiosity.
2161	1	a	two words to describe this best: tight and pimp
5409	1	a	- 7.5 / 10 -  Great adaptation of the classic Space Invaders. Retro / 80's style chunky pixels, yet nicely done with cool shader effects.   Another awesome wee gem by Puppy Games.
2759	1	a	Very fun for the amount of money you pay for it
5096	1	a	I never did quite get in to this game. Every time I tried maintaining a colony of dwarves, they would either become depressed, or as soon as I went to explore a dungeon, the enemies would teleport themselves past my defenses, slay my level 10 soldier dwarves with ease, and be free to kill the rest of my passive dwarves. The game is a lot of fun to play, but it seems to be one of those games you are supposed to devote a lot of time to, and not rush things. Being a hasty person myself, and wanting to get right into the thick of things, I fail to succeed at this game. You, however may be a different story. I recommend you grab this game and give it a go.
2666	1	a	This game is tonnes of fun, better when with friends but it is playable by yourself.  If you can get a few friends for PVP or Story it is very good.
954	1	a	My wife and I play this game together, she loves it and I love it because I found a game I can play with my wife. So recomened for a couples game.
107	1	a	A very cute game, although incredibly short; if you know what you are doing, it can take about 10 minutes. Aside fom the game play timing, I thought the puzzles were made (especially one lock puzzle) difficult simply because there was very little to go off of.  
965	0	a	 Charming HO game, but ultimately frustrating
4096	1	a	My absolute favorite puzzle game of all time. Deep, addictive, fun, absolute must buy.
3137	1	a	Makes you feel like a professional until the alarms go off, and then you panic like a tiny baby.  
5098	1	a	I love this game, the thrill of watching my dwarves hustle and bustle about as they tend plants, dig holes, and kill goblins is  exciting to me! it's fun because it's simple and easy. In custom game I always pimp out my stronghold to max pimp. This game is fun if you find watching your little minions doing stuff on there own and designing awesome fortresses to your hearts desire! If you're a call of duty fanboy who thinks everything needs to be fast paced this isn't the game for you. I personally enjoy this game for its slower pace and watching the hustle and bustle of my fortress as I pimp it to my hearts desire. If you're like me, I recommend it!
1682	1	a	Amazing, fun and simple. What more could you ask for? Get in.  Get the objective.  And get the hell out.  bit samey at times, therefore I give it 4/5
3398	0	a	I bought the Costume Quest 1 &amp;2 bundle on sale, the trailer made it seem like so much fun. However, it was just so repetetive I wasn't able to enjoy it very much. I like the concept and I found the sense of humor amusing at fist, but then it got a little over the top with repetition for my taste and the limitations of exploring made me feel bored after about 20 minutes. It's a matter of preferense, and this just wasn't for me. Haven't tried the 2nd one yet, and I don't think I will either. If you don't mind doing the same thing over and over again, then why not. I'd get it on sale, though.
4062	0	a	Game runs slow and choppy on my high end system. Total fail in my book. Give it a pass.
1531	1	a	I love this game, action, stealth and more! Epic to play with friends (online/offline)!
5042	0	a	I dont like this game, It's build for a kid!
4859	1	a	Basically, portal. but in a mansion and instead of portals its dimensions. Not to mention an evil uncle thats played by john de lancie.  If you like either the Stanley Parable or Portal, you will love this game.
4898	1	a	have you ever imagined yourself Portal without portals? [almost] Without A.I.`s, but with mysterious alien-looking organic beings? Without Cave jonson, but with fancy genius uncle? Wihout gel, but with mysterious colorful pills? Bet you haven`t. Well, SURPRRISE!
5083	1	a	not a bad game great for those who love mining. be forwarned that the game tends to get a bit glitchy when you OCD mine
5181	0	a	Why did I buy this game? Its boring and no fun at all. Do you want a good dungeon management game buy a game like Dungeons 2 (its not Dungeon Keeper but its fun) or War For The Overworld. Or buy Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2 the true classics!! But not this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3505	1	a	A very enjoyable little game to play around Halloween. I played this on the PS3 sometime ago and I LOVED it. This is one of those well made games by Tim Schafer that is endless fun.
244	1	a	I bought this on a whim because I wanted to play a shooter, but nothing in my library seemed appealing. Absolutely worth full price ($4.99 at time of writing). Ton of game modes, challenging without being cheap or frustrating, great soundtrack (if you like electronic/dubstep) and beautiful visuals. Easy to pick up and play for 5min or an hour.
2682	1	a	Monaco is an awesome game and i realy recomand it for people that like to kill, steal and find seacrets
4247	0	a	As much as I wan't to recommend this game, I can't. Whilst some players will see this as a game with an intriguing name, superb premise and an outstanding theme tune, anyone who has played the Katamari series will know that Dejobaan Games have made a substandard knockoff version of Namco's franchise.  Where is the King of Cosmos out of Ten?
622	1	a	trains with friends, great fun!
2170	1	a	Got this on sale for 1.50, a LOT of content for such a seemingly simple game. Multiplayer is great fun but haven't played it alone.
651	1	a	This game is easy to learn! I play it when I know my game time will be interupted by other things because it will wait for me.
4098	1	a	Probably the best entry in the Puzzle Quest series. This one also happens to be the first. I will also note, that at the time of this review I only have 5 hours of gameplay, however have played the first Puzzle Quest on numerous platforms.  I has been ported many times, and has not suffered at all from it.   The game blends classic RPG elements like leveling, stat building, parties, main and side quests, shops with items and more with a simple match-3 puzzle game concept. It executes it very well.   The colored gems represent mana, aside from the purple stars and stack of coins which yield experience and gold upon matching. There are also skulls to match that damage your enemy. In puzzle quest your objective is to damage your enemie's health down to zero by either matching skulls or using the mana gained through gems with offensive spells. There are also other types of spells, meant for healing or a form of crowd control so the pace and complexity rises there and can add some fun gameplay and combinations to your moves. There are also the mechanic where if you match more than 3 of anything in one move, you gain an extra turn. The combination of all these makes for exciting, strategic gameplay.  The cons are that the story is rather stale, but this is firstly a puzzle game before anything else and can easily become overlooked. That is the only negative thing I can really come up with. Clever game; good fun. Highly recommended.
4295	1	a	I see people complaining about this, but it's not like the Katamari games don't have any problems either.   It's not a perfect game and it's not as lovingly bizarre as Katamari, but The Wonderful End of the World is still a lot of fun and enjoyably strange.
553	1	a	All aboard!  Ticket to ride began as an award winning board game made by Days of Wonder along with, Shadows over Camelot, Memoirs, Mystery Express, SmallWorld 1&amp;2, and other titles. It is a casual turn-based strategy game, based upon the board game with the same name, and it is one of the best adaptations thus far.   Game play:  is just about identical to the board game. You have two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo such as black or pink, and destination cards which feature two city destinations, like Los Angeles and New York. Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them.   Each of the players are also dealt six train cards and with that, the game begins. Each player takes turns in either drawing two face down cards from the top of the deck, two trains from the lineup (Not including rainbow carts as they account for your two), or place trains on the map and claim routes to your complete your destination cards and gain points. You also lose points for each route you don't complete, same per the board game.  2 to 5 players can face off, either as a single player game vs. the AI or online against human opponents. AI bots can also be added to online games to bolster the number of players.   Graphics:  reflects the charming old feel of the board game quite true to form and really brings out the atmosphere of it as a whole. The maps in which you can play on are always really well defined, easy to read, see were you were at and where you were going. I do however feel that your trains and your opponents trains on the map could have been slightly better defined to make them stand out more.    Audio:  also holds well to the atmosphere and feel of the game, but after a while the same piano music track grates on your nerves and you tend to find yourself diving into the settings to shut it up and put some of your own music on.  This is where I delve into the biggest gripes I have with Ticket to Ride...   Gripes and Cons:  The layout of the menus are appalling. It honestly feels like they have taken a horrible old 90's layout and stuffed it in here. You have annoying and un-skippable voice acting as you go into every single menu and every cardboard cut-out of a character in the menus have something to say, which is the same infuriating audio each time you even so much put your cursor near them. This drove me insane.   Also, playing online with friends is made to be so obtuse, unclear and can be quite difficult to actually set up a game, because rather than being integrated with the steam interface, is goes through a backwards setup of making a profile on the Days of Wonder page to make your name easier to find, add the other person who has gone through the same process and try to let it ''find friends'' or if by some chance you can locate them yourself, adding them is just as tedious. This may just be me nitpicking, but it was something that bothered me intensely.   Final Conclusion:  Regardless of it's flaws, it is by far the best adaptation of the board game. Whether you have played it physically or not, it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a bit of strategy and board game adaptations.
2389	1	a	TURNS INTO SKELETON. Friends perform ground breaking surgery to bring me back alive in 5 secs. 5/7 would resurrect again
406	1	a	Twin Stick Arena Shooter. Lots and lots of fun, highscores against your friends and a really good soundtrack to get into it.  
3039	1	a	Four player Stealth/Shoot Them Up. fun.
3508	1	a	Adorable, actually decently challenging, simple to follow, great controller support, just the right amount of silliness, and just generally an incredibly fun game. I've played for hours now and the only reason I've stopped that I have to go to work. Highly recommended by this VERY picky gamer.
4879	1	a	Amazing game. It's a unique and different physics game. Definately worth it, buy it now!
1694	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time.   Well worth buying it.
3612	1	a	It's like Bioshock but with a better story
3665	1	a	I bought it because the graphics reminded me of Animal Crossing. The game itself is nothing like Animal Crossing, but it's a neat and fun game with adorable graphics.
3319	1	a	It's a cute game. It's fun. The art style is nice. The writing is funny. I will admit that the game is fairly repetitive, but I think it is worth playing. It's fun.
1906	1	a	Better than Payday
54	1	a	Very lovely visuals and mellow music, Lume produced interesting puzzles that created some challenges. The only feedback on what made it unsatifactory was that it was so short. But I look forward to playing it's sequal. I do not regret buying this game because I enjoyed the artwork and low level stress involved in playing it.
1526	1	a	A fun and frenetic stealth game that is a must play with friends. 8/10
2655	1	a	Do I recommend this game... HELL YA
1249	1	a	This game has the strategic depth of League of Legends and Starcraft combined, with the fast-paced first-person action of Quake. This game should be played in tournaments and have live broadcasts and streams, not any of those other games.  It also reminds me of Bomberman for some reason. And Club Penguin, for the obvious resemblence to Club Penguin. I give this game a 9.8 out of 10.  I took a 0.1 off the score because it could use more customization options for your penguin. I want him to have a neon green afro, but the stupid developers didn't even bother to think that players would want that. They totally missed out on pleasing the neon green afro demographic. Maybe that's why this game isn't so popular. But it should be, because you can use clown fish as a projectile weapon. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, Quake railgun; you're outclassed as â¥â¥â¥â¥ now.  I took another 0.1 off the score because the story sucks. Yeah, I know. The subtitle 'Sedna's World' is totally unnecessary. Sedna is just this penguin god that is in the intro video. The intro video that you can only see if you manually click to watch it from the main menu. And it's only like 20 seconds long, and not compelling in any way.  And it's just, like, the icebergs dried up from pollution and heat and â¥â¥â¥â¥, and the penguins didn't know what to do. And then Sedna the penguin god shows up and tells them some cryptic â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a grammar error at the end, saying really vague stuff that can be interpretted into anything. So the penguins interpretted it and apparently came to an actual conclusion. The caption afterward is like 'The penguins reflected on Sedna's words. They knew what to do now...'. Which is apparently kill the penguins that are a different color than you. Yup. Penguin racism. And they kill each other by throwing snow balls at the other penguins so hard that they fall off the iceberg. And they drown, I guess, because they get deaded when that happens. So that is the extended lore of Penguins Arena. As if a competitive multiplayer game about penguins knocking each other off icerbergs using snowballs needed any kind of backstory. Well, Penguins Arena gave it a shot. They missed that shot, but they gave it a shot. They tried. For 20-ish seconds, they tried. And that is admirable. Nonetheless, I, as an occasional professional amateur reviewer, feel that I must be objective about my critique and take 0.1 points off the score.  Penguins Arena, folks. A near-perfect game. Here's hoping for Penguins Arena 2: The Arctic Civil War: Rebellion: Resurrection Revelations: Judgment Day: The Return of Jafar.
2001	1	a	It is good
3232	1	a	Great puzzle based game which offers hours of entertainment. You've probably played games like this in the past, but they still offer a unique charm. Definitely worth the cost. If you want to casually game and unwind from a long day, this is a perfect game to do it.
1595	1	a	better than payday2
1802	1	a	Great story. Awesome characters and concept. TENNAWTATENN
4862	1	a	People will try to describe this as another Portal clone, but besides the fact they both consist of puzzles, they cannot be any more different.  Able to switch between four dimensions, the player needs to figure out how best to use them together to get out.   The four dimensions are  1) Fuzzy - All items become very plush and ten times lighter. A safe or couch can be carried around and thrown as if it was a baseball. 2) Heavy - All items become metal clad (maybe even more so) and weight 10 times as much. Toss a fuzzy item then, while it is midair, turn it heavy so it can then smash through glass walls or when you need something very heavy heading very fast in a certain direction. 3) Slow Time - All items and lasers fall and zap at a snail's pace. If you jump on an item travelling through the air, it will be solid to jump on. 4) Anti gravity - All items not tied down will float to the sky. Hopefully they float to something where they are needed  
1046	1	a	Buy this game for the fuzzies.
3565	0	a	Biggest waste of my time, makes me sick.  &gt;20 minute download time. &gt;3 minute to get into story mode. &gt;8 minutes watching the boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ intro.  All that to find out its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible turnbased game (after getting excited at the Cute characters turning into awesome â¥â¥â¥â¥ing robots, major let down). &gt;alt f4 took 2 seconds. &gt;uninstall took 10 seconds. Waste of 31:12 of my time.  Dont make the same mistake as me.
1183	0	a	Would be better if control is better.
474	1	a	The PC adaption (and iPad/iPhone versions too, for that matter) of Ticket to Ride is a very faithful recreation of the classic board game, where the only gameplay differences between it and the physical version are fast and accurate scoring and the fact that enraged board-flipping is no longer a possibility. (Not to mention the bonus of the game + DLC being cheaper than their physical counterparts, and is significantly easier to play with people on the other side of the world!) So, for people who have played the board game before, I think this should be a no-brainer.  However, I wrote this review for those who aren't aware of the greatness that is Ticket to Ride and are seeing this from a bystander's point of view. You might be thinking that this is just some boring train game played only by weird people who smell funny, as a diversion from their regular riveting pastime of watching grass grow. However, I can assure you that this is most certainly the opposite of the truth.  Ticket to Ride is, in actual fact, quite a tense game that can quite easily take you from absolute confidence in your position to having all your hopes and dreams shattered, as you realise that you didn't take that vital Los Angeles &gt; Las Vegas track yet due to over-confidence, that you had multiple 20+ point routes hinging on! Not to mention the level of back-stabbing and collaboration that can come into play (especially with the Steam overlay making this oh so easy), that can easily create bitter feuds between two rival rail barons, which can last across a series of games.  Overall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, classic example of a game that's easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's always a good game to play with friends, strangers or alone with bots, especially as each game tends to only go for 45 minutes at most. (Although you can quite easily find that time has flown, as you wind up having rematch after rematch, without noticing the time passing by!)
3657	1	a	Fairly easy game but it is rather fun to play if you like turn based RPG's. The game plus the DLC will probably take you only 7 hours to beat and 100%
3560	0	a	this game sucks its so bad all you do is get costumes and kill the same old enemies. you play as 2 little kids who have no idea wat they are doing. its a rlly bad game and u shld nvr buy it. flappy bird is better                                                                                                just kidding this game is awesome i love it!
1036	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different. That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do. None the less.  The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck. There isn't really much more to it than that. It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish. It gets boring if you play too much of it at once. I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.  Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border. See, learning can be fun!
3389	1	a	Firstly It's looks childish, but It's absolutely not what you think! This game is one of the best Adventure-quest game I ever played! It's so much fun and characters looks good, also the fights so enjoyable, and it's actually not that easy everywhere, but It's truly a Fantastic Adventure. Add the Dlc and you get +Adventure and Fun! 10/10 :)
4871	1	a	If you've ever wanted to pretend that you're trying to escape from being trapped in a twisted children's playground while Q jabbers at you incessantly, this is possibly the game for you. If you haven't - well, it's still pretty fun. A couple of the puzzles require some annoyingly precise timing and the ending is deeply, deeply disappointing compared to some similar games which I won't name ACOUGHCOUGHPORTALCOUGH but all in all it's quite enjoyable.
1129	0	a	Extremely amusing little game, but far too little content even for just $5. Fun lasted for about 30 minutes. There's only so many times you can drive along various bumpy trails and watch stuffed animals fly around before the comedy in it dies out.
3517	1	a	Fantastic double fine writing, great design and strategy. Do yourself a favour and buy the double fine humble bundle if it's still available!
448	1	a	Simple concept, great soundtrack, really fun to play when you're bored... Unfortunately the volume of music is not always consistent and listening to the voice tell you the explosives are armed every 10 seconds in Bombing Run can get a bit annoying. Otherwise very fun casual little game.   Also it enjoys reminding you of how bad you are at playing it
5092	1	a	'A Game of Dwarves' is a little gem, if you want to have a relaxed and jolly gamesession.   In this micro-management game, you take control of a group of dwarves, let them dig depper into the dungeons, find more resources and the most important: ensure that they do well.  That game might be not something special for everyone, but I had a great time with it!
5447	1	a	The Great Attacks
3484	0	a	Cute graphics. A game I can play with my kid and that she can play by herself (more or less) . Gameplay is repetitive, the battles are boring and the only real thing (other than graphics) saving the game is the battle stamps you can use to add effects.  I also ran into the game breaking bug in the fry quest where the solution from TS was to restart because they don't plan a fix. Well, it left a bad taste in my mouth that a major game breaking bug is known and nothing was attempted to fix it. I am not sure why anyone would want to replay this whole thing and risk running into the bug again.
2853	1	a	I recommend this game because itÂ´s not the usual type of game. It has a great multiplayer mode.
5431	1	a	This game is fun, challenging. It could get a little repetitive. I recommend this game only if its on sale. $10.00 seems pretty steep for this game. I will give it an 8/10.
2802	1	a	Really fun.
3376	1	a	A game about the fantasy of children who can use 'special abilities' and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented. Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy. The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at. You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.
5316	1	a	To be completely honest, the original on MSX2 and GBC are better than the sequel and remake. But i cant say this is a bad game. It has its charm and everything looks smooth and cute but at the same time its sometimes really hard to figure out what to do and when you finally do, you start feeling like the worlds biggest dunce. i give the game a 9,9/10
3118	1	a	'This isn't hotline miami, put down the gun you idiot' You and your idiot sidekick rob a bank. What can go wrong? - you say after reviving him over and over again.
5243	1	a	This is a fun, neat little game.
5210	1	a	When I first saw this I though it was just some cutesy kids game, it's actually a cleverly designed puzzle platformer. The interesting thing is they never explicitly explain how to do anything, you learn by observation and experimentation. You never get any more powerful, what increases is your knowledge of how things work. It has moments of frustration followed by moments of clarity when everything suddenly become obvious. It's those epiphanies which really make the experience satisfying, and make you feel smart. My only criticism is I would have liked a tiny amount of exposition just to say who I was and what I was doing.
3158	1	a	I bought this game in the indie puzzle bundle for 99 cents and have already gotten 10 hours of play time in it. While it was difficult at times, I never really had the feeling that I was stuck and after some trying I could always complete the level. The only negative thing about this game is that some levels rely on too precise rope-cutting: for example, you have to cut a rope in JUST the right timeframe, which is more annoying than anything else. Other than that I'd definitely recommend picking this little gem up in a sale.
5526	1	a	better than the original in every way endless things to kill
157	1	a	Wow... It was pretty difficult at first, but after a while I got the hang of it, A definite buy. I'll give it a 8/10
4114	1	a	Coloured quest of the puzzled gems. Brilliant as the second one.
604	1	a	How many times can a man listen to 'When the Saints Go Marching In'?
213	1	a	Polished twin-stick shooter with addicting gameplay, colorful presentation, and incredible soundtrack (seriously, I sometimes play the game just to hear the music). Although it comes with a handful of other modes, most of them are the same game with different objectives. Despite lack of content, the content it does offer is solid. Not mind-blowing, but will leave a smile on your face.  If you enjoyed Geometry Wars or enjoy topping high scores, this is the game for you. I wouldn't pay full price unless you dearly love the genre. I would highly recommend waiting for a sale of $1 or less and kill a few hours with it.
5063	1	a	works on windows 8.1, simple to learn the rules, fun!
2382	1	a	i can't get this game to run for me 0/10  edit: now that this game runs for me it's an okay game so 2/10
145	1	a	OK WTF! The achievements are really buggy!!!
3780	1	a	Bought Humble Double Fine Bundle as an impulse buy last week. I knew what to expect from Psyconaughts and Stacking, but did not have a clue was Costume Quest was even about. To my surpises it's a solid game with mixture of quests, collectables, and solid combat. Basically the combat is baby's first Final Fantasy, yet for a person that never really played a Finaly Fantasy I had a blast playing Costume Quest. The each costume changes your abilties idea is done well and loads of fun. Only sad thing is that the game is a tad short (9 hours with all achievement unlocked) but hopefully one day it gets a squeal. Would recommend and I give it a DEN OUTTA DEN!
2633	1	a	Amazing game. Most fun I've had in a long while. Buy it, especially if its on sale. Worth every penny. 10/10
716	1	a	Great board game and PC game. Only rival to Catan out there imo
2011	1	a	The best strategy/shouter game ever
200	1	a	Waves, where being a ball that spits out bullets becomes fun.   I think it's a shame waves always takes place in the same map, I wish there were more of them. I don't think it would too much effort. The graphics are avarage for an arcade game, (naturally) there is no story, the controls are very userfriendly and the gameplay is fast and satisfying. I love the local highscore feature. It's too bad waves only has like what, three soundtracks?  I personally like this game a lot, it's great to kill some time with (for example when you're facing a long loading screen), has user friendly gameplay and is fun to play with friends. I'll rate this game a 7 out of 10.
2010	1	a	Creative as hell. One of the best co-op games I've played on Steam.
1852	1	a	I would highly recommend Monaco, especially if you love stealth or heist based games. This game can be played with 1-4 players and even has its own level editor that allows you to design your own banks, houses, or whatever to steal from with friends and others!  Get it or you shall miss out!
1549	1	a	Destroys friendships. 10/10
3877	1	a	This game is short and simplistic. The RPG combat is kinda like Paper Mario, in that you do QTEs to deal more damage. However, you usually only have the option to do a basic attack until your special is charged up (always after 3 turns) or you have a special stamp equipped. There are about ten costumes in both the normal game and the DLC, and only about half of them are worth using in combat compared to the others.  Outside of combat, there are four enviroments to explore and solve puzzles in using costume abilities. You can hit basically anyone and anything with your candy pail, which is amusing. The dialogue isn't laugh out loud funny, but I smiled from time to time.  The game really shines graphically. The characters are cute, the environments are given a lot of detail, and the battles look amazing. It's all very colorful. Music is average, however.  All in all, playing this game is like playing a cartoon from Cartoon Network long ago. Worth buying if it's on sale.
33	1	a	If, like me, you dream of piloting a giant tea cup, through a hazardous land, collecting sugar cubes for ... tea, presumably. Then this is basically not to be missed. Even if you have at best an impartial attitude towards oversized tea cups and the collection of sugar cubes, it's hard not to recommend this one. I imagine the experience of playing this for such a person to be something of a spirtual awakening. The soundtrack alone is worth the money, infact if anybody knows where I can get a CD copy of it to play in my car please post below. I should mention though in this review it's probably not suitable for youngsters due to the obvious adult themes and content.
2009	1	a	This game is one of the most elegantly designed games I've played in years. The simplicity of all the ancilliary components (controls, graphics, UI) really belies the level of depth and just pure fun that you get in this game.
1580	1	a	Buy this game in a Steam Sale when it's 80% off. It's a fun game, however it gets tedious very quickly. One of those games you play once every while, but not any more often. And if not even that it will add to your game library, because heck.. it was 80% off!
4596	1	a	A very interesting take on the Tower Defense genre. I found the rotating rings to provide an action like quality to the game. It'll keep you on your toes until you perfected your builds for each challenge. Aside from that the game has a beautiful retro sci-fi aesthedic that carries from the in-game elements to some very well (bad? lol) done B-movies style cut scenes to propel the story forward.   This game is well worth a try!
872	1	a	Good game, but it stops working properly if you share it with family members, and both family members have it installed. It then sees the game as only other members game and doesn't let you play it together anymore. It's not possible to 're-buy' it or re-install it, it just stops working.
1042	1	a	One of the best games evahr!
3235	0	a	more than 70% of the puzzles are nearly impossible, + ONLY on the easy-no-brainer puzzles there is a hint button.
3863	1	a	It's a little slow at first but once you're used to the game (when you're in the mall) it's a lot better. It's a well balanced turn based fighter with an rpg adventure side, good visuals and well optimized. Plenty of humour too, shame there's no voice acting as it would be a very brilliant game if it had voices too.
4168	1	a	Edit: My husband wrote the original review. This is my review. I've actually played the game.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING!   First off, the MUSIC! The music just gets you right into that 'match things' mood. If you are kicking behind, it ramps up with your adrenaline and you push yourself to an epic win. If you are losing... well, let's just say you'll know that tune and when the announcer chimes in that your hero is near defeat it's totally okay to start sweating.  Next, the actual game play is so smooth! Some matching games can be kind of jerky or have a slower response time. Puzzle Quest does not! It is smooth and seemless. The battle load screens don't last too long and walking about in the RP world isn't cumbersome or annoying. You can even rapidly click through dialoge if you don't care and just want to fight!  Did I mention the music? Because this is seriously some of the best music.   Also worth a paragraph is the strategy aspect. If you play correctly and put some thought into it, this game can be as intense and engaging as a game of chess. I have logged my 600+ hours on almost exclusively my druid, who should be one of the wimpiest in the game. However, using tactics and planning, she can whoop any enemy. Pick your skills, items, spells, and mounts carefully. Know your enemy's weaknesses. Know the board mechanics. Manipulate everything to your will and you will surely master Puzzle Quest.  Of course, after 600+ hours you would think I would be bored with the game, right?  NOT AT ALL! I return to PQ faithfully on a regular basis when I want a respite from the world of MMOs, MOBAs, and RTSs.   So go on, what are you waiting for?   The original sucky review by my husband who has NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: It's like Bejeweled except you fight and the music is way more epic than it should be, but it's still a wonderful game.
5120	0	a	Unfinished Paracux game with clunky controls, extremely buggy and laggy. Yet, better at simulating strategic and tactical warfare than HOI3.
3795	1	a	It's a perfect little RPG with all the humor you'd expect of Tim Schaffear, but sadly few mechanics to make it stand out. This isn't Persona or even Final Fantasy, rather it's another twisted tale of Tim's that goes down with ease. A lovely little story with some fun in between, perfect for a present, but underwhelming as a game.
1415	0	a	There's literally zero people playing.   It's an online only game.   Do the math.
4131	0	a	This game has an absuletly great idea. Puzzle solving in a battle style an RPG elements. On top of that it uses the Warlords Franchise, with a graphical assetts and music. One would think this game would onvole a lot of grinding, but gaining lvls does not make that a huge difference, since it is extremely luck based. On top of that the AI cheats. In a very obvious kind of way, which leaves u speecheless. That pritty much sucked out the fun for me. I tried to play this game three times, this time I got the furthest but I cannot bring myself to finish this potentially good game, since I do not like to get cheated on.
3930	1	a	Very cute and super fun. If you want a cross between Nightmare Before Christmas and Invader Zim, you should play this!
3871	1	a	An RPG with combat similar to the paper mario series and some clever mechanics: your costume descides what class you are, and almost all of them have some out of combat ability. While it's not very hard or complicated, It makes up for this by being very cute and a lot of fun, with a very silly sense of humor.  Not much else to say really, If you want a nice, quick game to play to get in the mood for Halloween, this would be it.
5220	1	a	Hey, I like the scenery in this game
2391	1	a	Beautiful game. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who likes caual atmospheric games!
3681	1	a	Great game!
6	1	a	This game is a perfect game for kids. I played this with my 4 year old and my 8 year old and they loved it. It can be tough at times, but most of this game is forgiving. It's a typical platforming game with a cool floating/soaring gimmick attached to it. It takes a bit to get used to, but once you get the hang of it the game itself is pretty simple. The graphics aren't anything to really brag about, but they fit the gameplay. Overall, a great game to play with your kids. If you are an adult, you might lose interest from its simplicity. Even the achievements are simple.
5327	1	a	Fun to play. Excited puzzle
2280	1	a	It's a top down steath coop game. Something I would recommend for people who like steath and team work, rather then run and gun action.  each player can choose a class, all ahve their own special ability and running speed. you need to use their ability to get an advantage over obsticals. the game doesn't really allow you to to kill anyone unless you have a gun which you don't get much bullets in them and the only way to get more ammo for guns or anything you have equiped, you have to loot 10 things. Killing is not the objective, but stething and keeping the chaos at a minimum is the theme of the game. You want to be decreat is posible.  This game gets a 5 out of 5 for what it does. It does everything well

2956	1	a	Have owned since last summerand everyone seeing this sale on it NEEDS TO BUY IT. BEST CO-OP GAME EVAR.
5233	1	a	Very enjoyable platformer puzzle game. It is of a slower pace andit has some exploration elements. No tutorial but with only 2 abilities you can usually solve the puzzles with trial and error and feel lost. It really is amazing how much you can do with just 2 actions in a game.
291	1	a	really fun game soundtrack is amazing
3318	1	a	I'll admit I'm a sucker four Double Fine games since I first played Psychonauts nearly a decade ago. But this game definitely is worth a look. Their take on a JRPG but charming as hell. Loved it and so did my kids. Collecting costumes and utilizing their unique powers was possibly the best element of this game. Sprinkle in that Double Fine humor and you got yourself a winner.
1761	1	a	This game is super hilarious for me! I don't know why, but watching people struggle with gaurds is funny.  +Funny +Cooperative Gameplay 
4161	1	a	Game of The Year. Every year. Play this with a friend and you'll hate each other as much as any other Mario Party. Single player is pretty awesome, too.
5380	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
1590	1	a	Very fun game. You never feel like it's the game's fault when you lose, and the destructible levels offer a lot of replay value.
5157	1	a	Much like when I needed to seal some wood and bought Ronseal, I was not dissapointed by this game.
2162	1	a	Monaco is one of the best coop/multiplayer games out there.  Not recommended for people who does not like pixelated arts or for people who wants to play alone.  Must-buy: 10/10
87	1	a	Very good thinking game. Love the puzzles... But kind of frustrating too sometimes :D
660	1	a	Got complete edition on sale, with DLCs it provides variety of maps with slight differences in gameplay. Good and understandable rules (as an absolute beginner to TtR I got them on first try), quick and straight gameplay. Solo (never lost to AI in tens of matches, though) as well as on-line mode.
2207	1	a	amazing game and really fun with friends
3452	1	a	This one is truly a GEM, with it's intriging and brilliant storyline and its cartoonish grafics you can't go wrong with buying this game, and honestly it's original price is a steal for this game.  this is one of those games you can intreduce your kids to gaming with, thoiugh you propertly have to play with them and help them a littel do to the game being text based, but all in this game is good for any adult that have but the smallest part of child left in them, and any child that is 5+  The game takes around 7-9 hours to complete and if you buy the DLC you will get additional 2-3 more hours of gameplay.   I highly recommend this game!
1978	1	a	great stealth game. reccomend if you cant afford payday 2 :) 
1437	0	a	A thoroughly unremarkable casual Non-Violent Family-Friendly Holiday-Themed FPS piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.   It's not hideously bad and if you like jacking off to penguins then there's penguins to jack off to here.   Sort of has a 'Dreamcast FPS' vibe to it. Could possibly be fun with Friends &amp; Bros but pretty much everything is fun with Friends &amp; Bros and ahahahahahahaha at actually playing this online with randoms.   PS hope you like playing with bots because literally nobody actually plays this game.   PPS you can also teamblock / teamkill and I'm sure there were plenty of extremely â¥â¥â¥-raged tweens back in the day.
37	0	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this â¥â¥â¥â¥? yes 420/teapot   if you buy this game with real money re-evaluate your life
1717	1	a	Monaco is easily one of the most addicting and fun multiplayer games out there. The game mechanics are great, story is good, and a level builder to top it off. Great for casual gaming with friends. I recommend it to casual and pro gamers alike.
923	1	a	A match-3 game with RPG elements. Matching up the colors has the corresponding element use an attack, heal, etc. Sounds simple enough and it is, but the game has a good difficulty curve and a few interesting gameplay mechanics.   On the downside, the wind elemental seems a bit too important since he's the only character than can knock flying enemies to the ground, and it's necessary to do so to damage them. Felt like at least one of the other characters should have been able to do something similar. Makes the tactical aspect of fighting a bit repetitive since there are a lot of flying enemies in the game. If you ever find yourself wanting to do so, the game does let you respec your level-ups easily enough. The last boss is also stupid hard and I was one or two attempts from searching for a youtube clip of the ending. It's just an incredibly frustrating, long fight.  I don't play match-3 anything, so take this review of a match-3 game with a grain of salt. Picked it up on a whim and because the main character wears a leg brace and that seemed interesting enough. A solid, little puzzler, though the story/character aspects are extremely generic and disposable.
4794	1	a	This is one of the best games ive ever played, it had an great story, wasnt to short, and the puzzles were painfully amazing, i would give it 8.5/10
4984	1	a	What can I say? It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.  9/10 would science again.
3216	1	a	Try this.
940	1	a	A cute little puzzle game similar to Puzzle Fighter, for those of you who have played such titles. Legend of Fae includes a fantastic story, fun characters, and colorful art. A good game for those looking for down time, but don't want to get to wrapped up in mechanics.
2962	1	a	Great game, great fun...though I am a little less stealthy than required to play this game. :)
1550	1	a	A really fun game, kept me entertained for hours
1119	0	a	Punch yourself really hard if you actually paid money for this. No seriously. Do it. Then kick yourself in the balls as an encore.
565	1	a	Not much to say, it's the board game but then on your computer
2394	1	a	This game allows me to steal money and murder people, both legally.   If you've ever had terrible urges to do these things but don't fancy serving multiple sentences in prison, go ahead and buy Monaco.   Your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ will thank you later.
1482	1	a	Pretty amazing game all things considered. It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.  As you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision. Her secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.  There are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look.  Another frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.  As people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy.   Finally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale. It's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.  I continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)
2603	1	a	Just got this game and it really fun. you can choose many different classes and rob people with your friends. :)
4880	1	a	As brain-bendingly punishing as you can imagine. It's a bit more linear than Portal, but you get more toys to play and experiment with and the humor, combined with John De Lancie's amazing voiceover work, makes for a HELL of a lot of fun. Definitely a buy.
2920	1	a	WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half-â¥â¥â¥ review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess. It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck. Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must be something behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includes different amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats. Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine. *OPENS THE GAME* Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is. Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcade no that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing  the game you went like,â¥â¥â¥â¥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include  them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPC with the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll already be there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the place I just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero! Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half-â¥â¥â¥ now they were too  lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get. Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaÅ.Almost forgot,since the developers are too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy to get a minimap at the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understand how much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer. Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the â¥â¥â¥â¥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everything you wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked. WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from  freesounds.org?  Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining. By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either. That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  NO GOD! PLEASE NO!!! NOOOOOOOOOO&nbsp;
2258	1	a	Great heist/stealth game, even the single player is fantastic
3586	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
2413	1	a	This is a really great game. One of my favourite games of all time. It has Workshop and a big community, but sometimes there is hardly anyone online.
1405	1	a	how is this in my library?
4981	1	a	Fun little puzzle game but to easy.
3439	1	a	Costume Quest is a 'small' INDIE RPG Game with a  huge lovely atmosphere of Halloween .  The game is short  (you can enjoy it around 6~8 hours for both stories) but  the story and the quests  are so  well made  that you don't mind the shortness. Only the battles are boring after playing awhile, but for a INDIE RPG game they are still enjoyable - and you can press the animations away if you have seen it a 100th time.   So if this game goes on  STEAM Sale 75%  you  must buy  it! Even for the full price (8,99â¬ at this time) it's worth of its money.  Best INDIE RPG Game I've played so far
4830	1	a	Quantum Conundrum came out of left field and smacked me right in the face with it's surprisingly clever setting, multidimensional puzzles and classy humor. While none of the puzzles are mind-bogglingly hard, they're still fun and give you a solid feeling of accomplishment.
1688	1	a	This game surprised me by how good it was, given that I'm not usually a fan of this kind of game. It's fast-paced and hectic, especially when you start playing co-op. Each character has a different playstyle, so the game has a lot of replay value.
3053	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games I've played. Especially with four players the game will become quite intense and chaotic experience with laughter assured. There are many details that make the game fun - atmosphere, music, sound effects and general feel of light hearted fun. Recommended!
230	1	a	Very beutiful and relaxing game, for me at least. Reminds me alot of Super Stardust and Geomtry Wars. I love these kind of games and I can play them for years as a stress reliever. The worls needs simple games like this for when you're just tired of everything else. Oh and the soundtrack, bravo.
2742	1	a	Definitely a fun game, 4 players who know what they are doing is a blast even going solo is possible on every level and can be just as fun. If you fail a mission just a click away and your trying it again. missions are quite short so you can blow through them (literally for a few of them). Had trouble getting groups of 4 but when they were together they were great. Groups of 3 or 2 are much more common and just as intense.
4346	0	a	I was reasonably optimistic that today was going to be a good day. really. It went well, overall. I was feeling good. ...It's ruined. Ruined forever. Because of this game. I abhor that I allowed it to occupy my attention, hard drive and senses. It's a shameless rip-off of Katamari, and lacks all the charm. ...it also involves a random, otherwise uninvolved furry character. That's pandering. That's pandering.
1703	1	a	It's easy to speedrun a level, because then you won't even have to sneak. But if you'd like to collect all the loot, it might be a bit challenging doing that alone.
1161	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTzCOC1VcpE 
3672	1	a	This game was really cute! I picked it up because it was a Halloween-themed game, but only just recently started playing it.
4912	1	a	A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.   Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.   The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.   Good stuff.
3478	0	a	One guy turned into a giant robot and that was kind of cool. But for reasons I cannot articulate, I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this game.
4382	1	a	A very simple game that is easy to pick up with the intention of playing a quick round and then realising you've been playing for ages.
1496	1	a	Fun and simple game. Much more enjoyable with other players, however.
3929	1	a	Simple yet great RPG to spend two evenings on (if you have the DLC). Controls are fairly good on DInput controller, but setting them up is a bit more difficult (only left thumbstick is set by default). Storyline is nice, nothing complicated, just kids playing and fighting. Graphics are also good, but video settings are poor. In some ways, CQ is simmilar to South Park: The Stick of Truth. Not in the use of profanity, but in an all round feel when playing.
5328	1	a	so cute graphic
51	1	a	This was one of the first games I bought here, and I don't regret it. This game is very short - only a Part 1 in what I assume is an impending series - but a fun point-and-click adventure with some pleasing riddles and puzzles to solve. Not to mention that 'gorgeous' doesn't describe the way the game's set looks; I'm likely to replay it just to watch the camerawork, motion and scenery in action.  As mentioned above, it is definitely a Part 1; the game is extremely short, and that should be taken under consideration upon purchase. However it's sequel, Lumino City, is out now. I look forward to grabbing it and adding my review to this one.
776	1	a	Five minutes to learn, ten minutes to understand, but a lifetime of playing' game
5444	1	a	This is an excellent modernized version of Space Invaders. If that's what you're looking for, this is definitely worth picking up. If you're like me, however, you won't get a lot of replayability out of it. I beat the game on my second attempt, got 33rd on the online leaderboard on my third attempt and only have achievements that require more repetitive playtime left. So if you're decent at this type of game, you'll probably get 3 hours or so out of it before losing interest, unless you are really into chasing high-scores. Regardless, this is a great take on Space Invaders and might be worth picking up on sale.
1201	0	a	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3304	1	a	 A very fun and cute RPG
2238	1	a	the mole is just too good :P
3741	1	a	An absolutely FANTASTIC casual/action-adventure title, heavy on the adventure (with a bit of turn-based combat in there, to great effect). For the price, you'll get over 6 hours of universally-appealing gameplay for all ages out of just CQ, and even more from the included DLC.
1555	1	a	A simple yet really enjoyable game that can be played with your friends online. All the characters provide a different feel for a stage and the levels are quite unique
4686	1	a	A very good but short game. I'd totally play Quantum conundrum 2 if it ever came out. The puzzles where inventive, new and fresh.
2135	1	a	A simple top-down, 2D Heist game. Amazingly fun, especially with friends.
5230	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is, rather obviously, the sequel to Toki Tori. It's evolved from being a pure puzzle game, with limited use of items, to a more fluid platformer puzzle. While the original was pretty unforgiving, and often required surgically precise steps to solving the puzzles, TT2 isn't quite as strict. Most puzzles can be re-attempted without a reset or winding back time.  In TT2, you return as Toki Tori, and you only have two (unlimited) abilities at your disposal : a whistle, and a ground stomp. There are many other creatures and elements in the game, and they will respond to one, oftentimes both, of these actions. Puzzles are solved by using your abiltiies to manipulate your surroundings. It sounds very simple, but there are many, many different creatures in the game, and the trickier puzzles will require chaining their reactions together. The 'core' puzzles that you need to solve to progress through the game are fairly straightforward, but the side area ones are much tougher, and it always feels very satisfying to finally solve them and hear the bonus area background chime.  There are several good points to this game that I want to highlight.  1) It doesn't try to babysit you. The game provides subtle hints to guide you along, but it lets you learn it without butting in obstrusively. The game itself starts off without any kind of narration, and you're left to make your way through the levels. In fact, the only help text I ever remembered seeing, was the hint to sing the Reset song, and even that only appears after you fail to follow the non textual clue. The effect of this is that it increases the immersion of the game, and makes solving the levels so much more rewarding.  2) No need to constantly run to an ingame menu. Instead, Toki Tori can whistle a certain combination of notes to perform certain actions (e.g. reset to last checkpoint or go to the world map). It's a very nice touch.  3) You don't get any new abilities as you progress (with the exception of the songs, but those don't factor into the puzzzles). This means there's no grinding involved. All puzzles are solvable right from the beginning of the game, but on your first try you won't know how. You'll learn several tips and tricks as you go along, and when you backtrack to the earlier to fulfill your masochistic desire to collect all the score items, it will suddenly strike you that you can get one frog to float another frog up.  4) Graphics and music. The art style is very minimalistic, clean and ridiculously cute, and the music fits the game very well. For the most part, it's a relaxing experience, in spite of all the puzzle solving.  As with most platformers, it plays much better with a controller.  Highly recommended.
4522	1	a	I remember playing this when I was 6 or so. This game was my entire childhood. I remember the first game I made, I over fed my fish. This game is the best. Its exactly the way I rememeer it. Im happy I convinced my mom to buy it for me. Very worth it!
2648	1	a	Good gameplay but it costs too much for this game
1510	1	a	This is the greatest game of all time, buy it because I told you to. Do you like fun? You'll love this game.  Verdict: BUY
3541	1	a	Odd, yet strangely addictive. The art/graphics design reminds me of the game Fat Princess. Don't go looking on Steam for the game because it's not there. I saw you about to do it.
4380	1	a	I'm really glad Dejobaan Games exists; their bizarre alt-history meta-narrative is hilarious, and has talked me into buying a number of their products. Trouble is, the actual games they make aren't usually all that good... The Wonderful End of the World is the only offering they've provided so far that I've enjoyed enough to really keep at. A blatant Katamari Damacy clone, they've stripped out the giddy LSD-inspired galactic deity and replaced His Royal Codpiece with a nihilistic, Fiddle-While-Rome-Burns heroine seeking to loot the planet (through... ghost magic? I have no idea what's actually going on here.) as best she can before Earth just crumbles and dies. Possibly due to your actions. They're never all that clear on that point. It's stylish and fun in a low-budget sorta way that makes you ignore the fact that you've already done this hundreds of times through a wider variety of levels and gameplay modes and with better controls. Pick it up cheap and enjoy a wonderful afternoon before setting it aside forever.
1926	1	a	Extremly fun to play!
3145	1	a	this game just keeps getting better and better. Works flawlessly with the steam link and steam controller
1910	1	a	wie Payday nur aus der Topdown sicht aber mit weniger ballern just like Payday but with less shooting
3759	1	a	Everything I wish Halloween Was rolled into one game and its Fun One of Double fines Great games its humorus, Adventurous and FUN
3353	1	a	A cute Halloween-themed RPG game with a good story, turn-based combat, a mixture of painted and cel-shaded graphics, and good music (and sound effects in general). Kept me entertained for hours. Well worth the price.
4493	1	a	I thought Iâd be nice and let a 72 year old villager retire, so instead of constantly working he could do what he wanted.  Here's me thinking he'll relax, go swimming and admire the flower beds like all the other villagers do between work. I took a break from the game for a bit and came back to check the villagers before I went to sleep...  ...HE IMPREGNANTED TWELVE OF THE WOMEN, THREE OF WHICH HAD TWINS. I came back onto the game and caught him trying to 'embrace' yet another woman. NOW THERE'LL BE A FOOD SHORTAGE, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, SOLE? YOU GINGER DEMON.  This is my first attempt at this game and it was going pretty well until Sole went and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up everything. Literally.  For some reason I just had a real urge to play some kind of sim game recently. I didn't want anything overly complicated and I remembered these games. I used to watch my sister play them when I was a bit younger and always thought they looked fun. It's a little nostalgic playing this myself now, I'm hoping I can solve all the puzzles, get all the upgrades and build up a fairly good village before I lose.  I think itâs pretty fun for something to check on every now and then and try and figure out all the puzzles. The Puzzles and survival element being the majority of the game. You raise a village by giving villagers jobs, making them breed and using your newly trained villagers to make discoveries. There are 16 puzzles to solve, all of which are discoveries you can lead your villagers to.   The game is made a bit harder by ârandom eventsâ that happen, which usually gives you a choice and you can either benefit from it or something bad can happen. Itâs possible to gain/lose part of your food supply, your research and even be hit by disease.  Iâve been playing this in-between the main games Iâm trying to complete and once I have done everything here, there are a few sequels I can move onto for more puzzles and such! I look forward to trying the others out as well.   All in all itâs a fun little game/franchise. Itâs nothing amazing but it kills time in a fun way I would say.   TL;DR : A fun little sim game. Itâs not the best game in the world but itâs a good time killer between other things.  
3097	1	a	it's all mine
1149	0	a	please dont buy this game, there are troll reviews etc and i knew they were fake but at 14p i bought it anyway. the money wasted isnt what bothers me... it is 6 mins of my life
4523	1	a	Restarted game until I got double the first magic fish you can have, bred them, sold them for high prices, got them their own tank, forgot to feed them, and raged. GREAT GAME THOUGH!
3164	1	a	Nice game, controls are using mouse, no joypad support.
1800	1	a	Buy it and be impressed.
4515	1	a	By far the best game on steam after farming simulator. God damn what a game this is, you gotta plant the plants and you have to sell them and you have to catch the bugs well you do not have to do it but you can to have fun and it is a really addictive and fun game watching and waiting for the plants to grow you can masterdebate if you know what I say haha
5422	1	a	Not as great as Ultratron, but still a good take on the Space Invaders formula.
2442	1	a	Got this game as a gift from my friend during the winter sale. Played it together and I must say it was very fun. The first few levels are quite easy, but it gets harder pretty fast (or me and my friends just suck at coordinating). Have only played a few hours so far, but will probably spend many hours playing this with my friends.
533	1	a	Plays just like the board game. If you enjoyed playing this game with family and friends, but have moved or are otherwise prevented from gathering around the physical board game, this is a great way to hang out and relive those days.
3954	1	a	Easy to play, made me laugh, and helped me to introduce a friend to the RPG genre!
399	1	a	This is one of the nicer dual-stick arcade shooters I've played. It has a relaxed vibe despite all the chaos on-screen, and the many different modes ensure that you'll find at least one way to play that suits you. The concept and execution are great; it's only a shame that due to engine licensing, this game didn't see a release on GNU/Linux. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Beat Hazard or Geometry Wars.
4910	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
2746	1	a	i love this game
515	0	a	It was fun until the latest update...
3624	1	a	One of the few really good Halloween themed games.
5052	1	a	This game is not the hardest or the best game in the world, but it is a solid time waster. If you're looking for something to kill time with that will go a ways towards numing your brain, this will do the trick.
4481	1	a	Edit: Because I have been asked and the shop description isn't really telling much:  If you haven't ever played any Luxor game before and do not know what the game is about
104	1	a	The most impressive aspect of Lume is the visual presentation. That's not to denigrate the other aspects of the game, but the visual style is what makes this game unique. The world and main character are made of card board cut-outs and and and are flawlessly animated. The other aspects of the game are well done, too. The puzzles are tough and many considering the game only takes a little more than an hour to finish. The puzzles fit well into the story and environmental message theme of the game. Thankfully, the politics of this game aren't very preachy and instead offers a reasonably upbeat attitude towards making earth more ecologically sound. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.
4762	1	a	A pretty decent game. A bit short though.
736	1	a	I got the TTR Europe and USA 1910 DLC as a part of a Humble Bundle, which included copies of the game on Android in addition to Steam.  If you've played the board game, there are absolutely no surprises here. As a game, it is well designed, but fairly dependent on random chance e.g. your missions, the colors of trains you get (there should be a rule where you have to brag every time you draw two locomotives). Regardless, it's an entertaining game, but it will most definitely ruin friendships if you play with people you know. The game for PC and Mac have pass-and-play local multiplayer, but it's a little iffy, since your hand of cards is supposed to be hidden.  The electronic edition is nice, because you don't have to keep track of pieces and points by hand, and you don't have to clean up or set up either. Additionally, you can play with other people online, making getting stressed out by board games even easier. However, I think that half the fun of playing a board game is having a physical copy. With the electronic version, you miss out on nervously fumbling around while placing down cars, accidentally knocking over other people's cars, proclaiming your masculinity by taking a route with eight locomotives, trying to figure out where the hell your cities are, trying to figure out where the hell your friends' cities are, pleading for mercy from your friends, yelling at your friends, getting yelled at by your friends, putting your friends in headlocks for blocking your long mission, and overturning the board in rage.  Don't have any friends? I'd pass on this game then.
3779	1	a	I love the concept of this game.
2033	1	a	'loved this game, that is all and i think you will too, yes you there this shirt buy this game now'
939	1	a	This charming puzzle game works much like the Puzzle Quest series of games, which in turn were derived from Bejeweled. But as you match gems actions are carried out about you in real time as the characters story moves on fighting monsters, gathering mana, finding items, etc. Plus the art style really touched me.
2405	1	a	It's a brilliant game when all your teammates just follow the plan and go steatlh. But sometimes situation goes FUBAR and game feels absolutely fantastic: colourful mess, total chaos and desperate attempts to get your s**t together. I hate co-op games but this gem is totally worth to buy 
3265	1	a	This is a pretty fun physics puzzle game that will provide you with about 11 hours of content if you choose to complete everything. The later levels can require some very precise timing and quick reactions, so keep that in mind if that's not something you wan't to put up with. The ambient music does a fairly good job of setting the mood, but it does become repetitive. All in all definitely worth it, especially at a sale price.
796	1	a	The game Ticket to Ride is simple to play for addictive as you try to complete rail routes across the USA. The game length is ideal too as it will take approximately 20 minutes to play a single game.
4992	1	a	Fun Puzzle game. Levels are fun and challenging to think through.  Although the ending was a bit underwelming.
4892	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
4487	1	a	I felt like it's kinda easier than the 'Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena'. Especially because of the scanner option change. Now when you click on the name of the item, the scanner shows you not only the shape of it, but it also changes the color to red once you are close to find the item (like a hide and seek, hot and cold child play). I still like the game. Story is very nice and the graphics put a big smile on my face. I must say that in this game you need to be more precise where to click (I got frustrated few times cause I was clicking right at the object and still the game told me that I'm wrong...and my scanner was breaking way more often than in the previous game), so it takes more time to play this game (I don't mind to play it long). You have way more dialogues in this game, you are solving more puzzles and some of them are harder than the ones in 'Hidden Roses of Athena' (especially the Zodiac puzzle, where you have to be very precise). But overall, like I said at the beginning, I felt like it's bit easier game. I totally recommend this game. You don't have to play 'Hidden Roses of Athena' first to understand this one. :) Combo of those two is really nice though. :)
3542	0	a	Tedious, repetitive combat system with very little innovation. Got tired of fighting the same battle over and over, sitting through the same unskippable attack animations again and again. Would be more tolerable if it could be sped up.  Sequel should probably be avoided too.
5085	0	a	FRUSTRATED.  This game looks interesting, but have just spent 2 hours trying to:  a) understand the clunky controls b) make sense of the 'levels' its too easy to get 'lost' between levels - therefore you spend more time clicking buttons and getting annoyed than playing c) get the dwarves to follow commands! the dwarves to seem to follow commands all that well, it is intermittent.  I can't actually say I 'played' the game.  I dont recommend the game unless you like clunky management and functions..  2/10  AVOID
4180	1	a	Peaceful, addictive, great, good game. Just buy it, play and relax. Totally worth price.
3700	1	a	For some one who doesent really like the RPG genre it's weird that i would put COSTUME QUEST in my top 20 games of all time. But it's True it's a masterpiece i love the halloween setting the quirky humour and characters everything about this game is charming and magical, i have still yet to play through the sequel i need to
964	0	a	Valve, please. Just give us one more option besides a 'yes' or a 'no'. A half-hearted 'mneh' or a a shrug icon or even a thumb pointing sideways.  Because that's how I feel about The Clockwork Man. Not angry or frustrated enough to condemn this hidden object game, but not impressed enough to turn my thumbs upwards either.  There're certainly some aspects to praise about the game. It comes with a fairly unique hint system, built into the game's clockwork sidekick. It uses charges to help the player find more difficult objects, and recharges slowly over time so it doesn't make the game too easy all at once. The art is nice at least, and the game is mildly spiced up with other kinds of puzzles in-between hidden-object-finding sessions.  On the other hand, there just isn't much else to the game. I finished in about two hours, with some help from the hint system. The puzzles are nice, but they're also obvious (and overdone) to the seasoned puzzler. Upon completion, The Clockwork Man offers a freeplay mode, but those are for Hidden Object maps that you've already played by then.  The biggest disappointment had to be the setting. It promised an alternate-history steampowered Victorian world, and it delivered that in the first few moments. But then you're sent to an under-developed tropical island where little to none of that ever comes into play. Your 'global' adventure only consists of a few moments in your Victorian home and the rest of it on a single generic tropical mystery-island. The only steampowered clockwork wonders you'll experience are your sidekick Sprocket and   what you discover during the short finale  .  Hidden Object game enthusiasts will like this more, but they'd be better off with The Clockwork Man Bundle, which consists of this game and its sequel (which appears to at least have more Victorian steampunk elements). For everyone else though, whatever the second game is like, I can definitely say that The Clockwork Man is underwhelming and not worth a full-price purchase.
1168	0	a	if you like this you're either a baby or an iphone gamer
2133	1	a	Do you like games where stealth matters? Where you start of really well, don't alert anyone and then half way through, fail totally at staying undetected, pull out a shotgun and finish the level by murdering everyone (following the hitman mentality: nobody will notice of there's nobody to notice)?  If so this game is totally for you.
562	1	a	A great way to get the board game experience when you are forever alone. My only complaint is making games for your friends is kind of convoluted. Still a classic
3157	1	a	Obulis is a puzzle game that relies on physics, momentum and gravity. There are colored balls hanging in chains and using various items obtained in the map, the player has to guide those balls to the respective colored pots.  It is a great game, beginning with simple levels and gradually progressing on to harder and complex levels as the game progresses.  Some levels are actually easier than the others, even though they award higher stars of completion than other tougher levels. But this is just me, difficulty actually will vary from player to player. Some levels are constrained by your timing - it just has to be perfect or you lose. You definitely will be wanting to tear your head off at some of the tougher levels.  Obulis being one of the oldest games in genre, may seem lacking in advanced features but nowhere will the gameplay dull out. All levels occur at different loactions, each with its' own set of objects that can be utilized to help the player accomplish his goal.  All being said, this is a great game, containing upto 10 hours of fun gameplay.
2066	1	a	its fun if you have friends to play with
1150	0	a	I don't believe that this game was worth the quarter I paid for it.
848	0	a	Would I recommend this game? Yes IF it was the actual board game. Because you pay once and you can play everyday forever. This digital version is great because it has most of the expansions included, easy to play BUT after a short period you have to start paying actual money to play - continually. That's just plain stupid. IF this game where a one time pay and you own it for life, like say 19.99 (which I think is fair) I'd buy it in a heart beat. But this game ending up being a pay-to-play is really the only reason it's got a bad rap. Do yourself a favor and try this digital version to see if you like the general overall play and game mechanics. THEN when you run out of your gift coins...DELETE and buy the actual board game!!
994	1	a	A fun hidden object game if you want to play one with a story interlinked. It is short, but nicely made for a intermediate gamer!
2762	1	a	Fantastic game to play with friends. Co-op with your friends to find the best ways to clear the stages and brainstorm new and interesting strategies. Not nearly as good solo however.
4531	1	a	this game is pretty relaxing but you have to know what to do to get the food coming it's an enjoyable game if you like to play as god I guess also I wish the other Virtual Villager would be on steam too
5046	1	a	Whenever I'm bored I just play a few mini-games from Puzzler World 2, and then I'm surprised at how much fun I'm getting from such a cheap game. It's really good, and quite addictive. There are easily hundreds of hours of content ahead of you, don't hesitate to get this game! :)
2114	1	a	A co-op stealth game, no fun alone but great with friends.
1755	1	a	Frantic and challenging. You'll be left arms-in-the-air-cheering when you've finally cleared that difficult level on your 9th attempt.
236	1	a	Beautiful graphics, good controls and an amazing soundtrack! Would I pay full price (9,99â¬) for it? Maybe. If it's on sale for half then certainly!
1433	0	a	Club Penguin is better....
5185	1	a	10 out of 10
4205	1	a	Played this before? If not, its certainly worth it. Much like bejeweled, this game features gameplay elements that are addictive and at times challenging. Although audio could do with a face-lift, this is one well-rounded game, definately not to be missed!
1241	1	a	This game is quite competitive, I would like to see a new game or like version 2 of it with more maps and mods.
1398	1	a	most life-changing game i've ever played
76	1	a	Fun little puzzle game, certainly pretty and colorful. Very short though, short enough that it is disappointing because the game is over before it feels like it even starts.
4038	1	a	At first glance it is just an ugly adventure game from some unknown Turkish developer. So why is it in my recomendation? Because of that world, which is presented. This isn't game for kids. In fact, it's really grim game full of politics and distopian visions and if you give it a chance, it can definitely surprise you...
2055	1	a	The new standard for stealth games
5451	1	a	Awesome Space Invaders-style shooter. Lot of variety between levels.
3457	1	a	Somewhat of a children's game but I had fun anyway.
3252	1	a	Think, cut and... SWEAR as you missed by a degree. â¯Â°â¡Â°â¯ â»ââ»  Great one! Something tells me I'll cut quite a few nights for this one ;]
3655	1	a	Fun Halloween game how it works.  Your kids trick or treating, You sometimes run into goblins when you do. You will enter a timed based combat that is a staple of old RPG style. But what the cool part your character you are is whatever costume you and your party is wearing.  So it gives you some minigames and exploring to do to find pieces to make new costumes while you race around to find your captured sibling.  Fun Halloween Game.
588	1	a	Sheldon Cooper loves trains. I love trains. Everybody loves trains!
2561	1	a	A really great stealth co-op game to play with friends. This game isn't the greatest to play with strangers or by yourself but if you can, always group up with friends.
2385	1	a	Someone bought this for me during a sale and I have to say that I didn't expect to enjoy it. But I did. The game itself is great; I love the art style and the way that the whole thing feels. But the thing that made it for me is the soundtrack. This Ragtime-French-Criminal style of music fits so well with every level and I adored every note of it. Fantastic.
2976	1	a	6/10-A great experience but get it in a sale
4559	1	a	Lots of fun, what a blast and I loved the retro serial style clips.
768	1	a	great port of the board game. love this for playing with my friends :)
1077	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4416	1	a	You must know that 7 Wonders II is not the best puzzle game out on Steam. There are better ones, maybe even cheaper, but you also need to know that this isn't so bad. Almost 10 hours that i have spent playing this game is enough to say 'yup, it wasn't waste of money'. If you enjoy 3-match puzzle games then think about getting 7 Wonders II. Maybe not for full price, but on sale - why not.   Keep in mind that it may not work on modern operation systems - i'm still on Windows XP so i haven't got any problems, but if you are using Windows Vista/7/8 then you can have extra trouble getting to run this.  Remember to always check system requirements to avoid any problems.  
227	1	a	Exciting and challenging, on my list of essential Steam games.
4951	1	a	This game is super uber fun with cool-tastic and funny commentary by the uncle while you do stuff. It's kinda short, which is why it's only $15, but it is $15 well-spent. Similar to portal, but the types, mechanics, and logic behind the puzzles are different. A bit easier than portal. If you like to pick up things and throw them with physics like I do, that'll give you another reason to like this game. Buy it, damn it.
4509	1	a	This game is very relaxing and fun. You breed+sell plants, catch bugs, and upgrade your equipment. I had it a few years ago and put countless hours into it; now that it's on steam, I expect to put many, many more.   If you like games that you can run in the background and check in on every once in a while, you'll like this game. If you want to sit there and be doing things constantly, than it might not be for you. It takes real time for your plants to grow and finding all the magic plants takes a lot of patience.
258	1	a	best pac man clone ever !!
1115	0	a	Snuggle Truck is physics-based vehicle game where you need to keep you cargo in your truck. It's ported from mobile platforms. These kind of games used to be flash games on the pc and you probably have a flash game somewhere on the internet that is the same. But the absolute worst thing about this game is that it has a brony mode.
1170	1	a	Very fun game. Its fun. Cool sounds! +
2875	1	a	6/10  Was OK, not really my style. Liked how you have the option to complete each mission in different ways.
58	1	a	An adorable little point and click game where all the scenery was actually made in papercraft.
2113	1	a	Monaco is a blast of a game. So far I have really enjoyed playing it in single player or in multiplayer, as the gameplay, the story, and the music and graphics are all well-done. The only complaint I have is that its hard to find multiplayer matches sometimes and getting a full game is pretty hard, and unless your teammates know what their doing, multiplayer missions can go south pretty quickly, but even then it can still be pretty fun.
946	1	a	For all that it just looks like another Bejeweled clone, the art and music is gorgeous and the plot both sweet and depressing. It was set up quite nicely for a sequel. I'll be buying that sequel it when it comes out!
2617	1	a	I read loads of peoples comments about this game saying it was class but it plays best with people you know, I was put off paying Â£12 for it because of graphics but when it was in one of the bundles at  www.humblebundle.com  I grabbed it &amp; i can say now after playing that it wort tenner &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't always need fancy graphics and blood to make a great game !
4125	0	a	i can't get this game to install or launch anymore so you probably shouldn't buy it.
2519	1	a	This game is a lot of fun! the campaign is vast, the levels well made, and the experence just gets better with friends.
18	0	a	Quite boring.
2335	1	a	This is a really good game, it's basic, has basic controls, has interesting levels and charactors, and has a solid goal for each level. Honestly, I can't find anything about this game that is bad.   My cousin introduced it to me to Monaco and I'm glad he did. Over all, it's a great game and fun to play with friends. I think Monaco is great for anyone and will enjoy this game.
1372	1	a	Good game, and it get better playing multi-player, but theres the problem, the community its dead. 84/10
3707	1	a	Charming casual game with Double Fine's signature humour.
155	1	a	Well, something to have at hand when you don't know what to play and jsut want to  have some casual fun...... good little game
3886	1	a	If you crazy kids like Halloween and RPG games, then this would be a great game to pick up and play in a breeze! You can't go wrong with Double Fine either, since they're the indie company behind Psychonauts. This is also a good game to play if you want to experience what an RPG is like upon a smooth and easy-to-play surface for all ages!
1477	1	a	This game is very fun if you play it with friends. It is just slowly getting harder but in the end it is like the good old party games you played with your friends, full of laughter, fun and calling them bad names ;) This game makes you feel like the good old mario cart + super smash bros melee evenings you all are missing.
2812	1	a	Cool !!
1481	1	a	AMAZING GAME!!! The best ever timekiller of a game. Screw MetaScore... I do not see a 99 there... i'm not satisfied. This game is amazing with some of the best gameplay i've ever played. This should be on the steam MUST-HAVE pack. For such a fun indie game I wouldn't be surprised if we saw this title on ios sometime soon. I do not know about IPod but IPad will be in the APP store soon.    - 9.63/10

3927	1	a	It's about a 5 hour game and it's fun to play. I found my self beating it in one sitting.
4687	1	a	It's kinda like portal, except without portals, and longer.
5003	1	a	Fun little game, lots of interesting puzzles to solve and I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoyed the humour and puzzle solving of portal as this is in a similar style.
5231	1	a	i had a blue bird now it's did
1885	1	a	Very fun and addictive 8-bit heist simulator with your friends.
2059	1	a	1. Start Game. 2. Sneak up on someone. 3. Make them sleep. 4. Make them sleep again. 4. Rage because they wake up and you have to make the sleep again. 4. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  11/10
295	1	a	Elegant simplicity, comfy soundtrack. Would recommend.
4634	0	a	
3403	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&amp;2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!
4806	1	a	A couple of missteps, but all in all an entertaining game.
4857	1	a	Had as much as if not more fun in this than Portal 1 and 2. Great game, not that hard but has a lot of fun eastereggs and details that made it look and sound good. Having 4 seperate filters that you can apply is really exciting
2891	1	a	You probably won't even be stealthy in co-op and do everything yourself.
5313	1	a	1. Slow Paste 2. Intresting Puzzle Game 3. Intresting Concept 4. Can Get Very Boring  6.5/10
4116	0	a	The game has some nice music and artworks, a lot of content. Really it could be a really nice puzzle game. It could be. It isn't because the AI: - It cheats in such an obvious way that you'll feel like playing a game with your 3 years old brother. It could be fine if at least it was subtle but it's nowhere near subtle. - It will gimp itself only to ensure that you won't get the mana related to your class.  To keep it short it seems it has been designed with the sole purpose of ruining the fun. Sadly ruining the fun does not increase the difficulty it only ruins the fun.
2568	1	a	Uniquely superb in both its design and plot. Captures one of the best experiences for a co-op, heist game.
952	1	a	Just finished The Clockwork-man. Just under two hours total gameplay, fairly easy if you are fluent in english, a bit harder if you are not. I would say that this suits children aged 6-12 who are fluent in english.  The gameplay consists of levels where you have to point and click on objects to collect or use in the level. When I say level, it is a scene, either a 'picture' or a zoomable picture, and you have a list of objects to find, for instance a vase, 7 gears,3 bracelets, a clay ink pot and so on. There is not really any system to what you need. The coffegrinder you see in one scene does nothing, but two scenes later you have to pick it up. Had some troubles, what is a chamoise, and what does an magnifying glass look like (not a handle with a round glass disk at least), but was able to reason most of these out, and the game also has a help-function in you mechanic friend.  All in all, I'll recommend this to children I think, the difficulty mainly lies in clicking in the right spot. There is no time, the help function is too powerful, as it details more and more as you click for help, and the story is not very deep and is without any big twists.
2485	1	a	If you want good co-op game this is your choice for 100%
5280	1	a	this is a fun game for little kid with a little bit of adult help at times
903	1	a	the actual board game is better.
3563	0	a	The whole game concept/idea with the different halloween costumes and the fluid turn based combat system is great, nevertheless, this game fails in many other aspects.  Short game, beat it in 5.5 hours with all quests completed. Very easy battles. Missions are very repetitive. The story is lame and boring. The atmosphere is quite sad and dead, not much is going on around the different levels. Music and sound effects are poor.  I had higher expectations from this game.
1407	1	a	Such a cute penguin throwing snowballs, wait is that a bomb?
2110	1	a	A friend of mine bought the 4-pack for the small group of us that he plays with on Steam. It was a blast and we have so much more to complete. I would totally recommend this for anyone who can play through it with friends.
4625	1	a	All of the Crazy Machine games are great fun. Completing Rube Goldberg machines make excellent, practical, and hilarious good times.
2713	1	a	Simple but astonishingly entertaining game. It makes a very complex idea simple and fun.
5403	1	a	Amazing game! Although I suck, it's great especially for the sale price!
65	1	a	This is a great game so far- the beautiful environment and music really makes it a unique and breathtaking experience. My main complaint however, is that this flash game is in such a small window. It is almost like a mobile game, since the maxiumum window size is so small. It would be much better if it was in HD and I could full-screen it. Also, the clicking doesn't feel too natural. The way that you explore the environment around you could be improved.
4514	1	a	Very nice if you're looking to just relax and watch plants grow.
2683	1	a	Its a fun game.I got the week version...So i dident play it enough.But i hate the idiots that dont know what to do 
4824	1	a	Great game, definitely worth playing! The puzzles are hard enough to ake you think a bit, but easy enough so that you still have a general idea of what you need to do to solve it. There is a lot of humor in the dialogue and surrounding environment. The animation style is cartoony, similar to Despicable Me.
3102	1	a	Great art style.  Game would be more fun if you have friends to co-op with you.  Single player is cool too, sort of reminds me of the early metal gear games. Controller supported.  9/10 Game has a lot of personality and charm.  Not really my cup of tea, but I think it deserves a nice review, the development team seems to have put a lot of heart and effort into making this a cool game.
814	1	a	As much as I love the boardgame, the PC game implementation is really bad. The graphics are ugly, the installation process is bad and the music.... THE MUSIC... is extremely unnerving. But overall still worth playing ;)
1834	1	a	This game taught me a valuable life lesson: Never rob a bank with my friends. We will all scramble like idiots and quickly die. 11/10
3344	1	a	Costume Quest is a really wonderful and fun adventure for kids and adults, who still remember how it's - be a kid. It's simple, funny, touching, it's make you laugh a little and smile a lot and there aren't many things, that can do so, so I appreceate the experience. You should know though that the game is very repetitive: rob some shop, fight with monsters, do it again and again. Still, it doesn't mean that Costume Quest aren't enjoyable - quite the opposite actually, but I just give you warning. Now for the main part: it's a Halloween adventure and we have two siblings, who want to celebrate and take all sweets for themselves. They are boy and girl, it's your choice who you want to play with (hint: the choice happens, when your mother decide who will be in charge). But quite quickly events become much more difficult - the big green monster steals your sibling and now you HAVE to find him\her. Or take the wrath of your mother. Monsters just don't look so scary now, come to think of it... Gameplay is very simple: you must take sweets from shops and homes, you must fight monsters that come your way and take some side quests and exploration if you like. It may sounds boring, but actually it's pretty fun because of battle system, story and dialogs. Battle system looks like a Dream world, where your nice costume (i didn't mention this? Come on, the game has a 'costume' in title!) becomes a powerful weapon. Like, robot costume transforms into actual fabulous robot. There are also ninja, Statue of Liberty, Space warrior, magic unicorn... and french fries. Where else you can fight with your enemies, using your french fries powers?! Okay, to actual battles. Little warning: you need some reaction for this, because you will need to quickly press some buttons while you attacking or defending to make better results. And yeah, each costume have it's own special powers for battle. Like, healing allies or making a powerful attack, or shielding the ally or yourself. It's your choice what combination to prefer (hint: you aren't all alone, there will be friends, some from the very beginning, some later). As for the story, I just don't want to spoil it for you, but it's wery fun and enjoyable with all jokes, references for popular culture, dantists's twist plots... You'll see many absurd situations and many exapmles of wonderful wrinting. Seroiusly, it's good and not only for child's taste. I highly recommend to complete every quest and talk with everyone - dialogs are pretty hilarious here, really, you will have a good time.  So, if you are kid in your heart or at least can be, try the Costume Quest. Despite all its humorous self, it tells a story about siblings, about people, who may fight and tell a pretty bad things, but they're still family. They still love each other, even if it take a monster invasion to understand such a simple fact.  And if you still wondering: of course adults don't help children to fight monsters. When they ever did? *sigh* Adults.  P. S. If you encounter sudden perfomance problems (characters move very-very slow), try to reboot your computer. Strange advice, but it helps me.
3797	1	a	I wish I'd waited a week - this was 11.49 when I got it and now its 5.74. But, didn't know it was going to happen. In relation to the game itself, its probably worth more like the 5.74. The characters are adorable, the premise is clever, but the gameplay is bad. I appreciate that this was done during studio downtime to waste some time but knowing how awesome Double Fine are, it surpised me just how bad the gameplay was. I got it because I love Tim, I love Double Fine, and I ADORE Halloween. But this is pretty painful. I can't tolerate it anymore and I am afriad that I have wasted 12 quid. Shame. Maybe nearer to Halloween I can give it another go but I doubt it.

4791	1	a	The problem was totally visible. It wasn't quantum at all.
1238	1	a	you can do 360s and drink mt dew 64-69 would throw snow ball agin and if you think this is funny you should go to ace get a 10 foot rope and a small stole and some notebook paper i was 3 when i wrote this
670	1	a	A pretty good recreation of the board game if you imagine the ruthlessly and relentlessly cheating AI are your family and that you're too nice to call them out.
1853	1	a	A great pixel game. It has a rich gameplay, where you need to plan every movement and try to get the best out of each character. Playing a multiplayer game may be very funny (even more when cooperation falls down, and everyone runs for their own lives). The history is great and funny, also.  Recommended  9/10
4151	1	a	4/5. 'Match 3' with RPG elements and a good story. 
745	1	a	Based on the tabletop boardgame of the same name, Ticket To Ride is a really fun and casual game that is easy to learn and can be played in 20-30 minutes. The starting board is pretty easy and not too hard to win if you're cautious and reasonable. Other boards add new rules and quirks that help keep things from getting stale. It's a very enjoyable game that you can break out when you have a little time and want to play something, but don't have enough time for something more involved. My only issue, and it's a minor one, is that there are no achievements which would encourage different strategies and oft-unseen routes being used.
2609	1	a	its great u should buy it
26	0	a	The simplest and least-adorned iOS/Android 'worthy' side-scroller that I've finished on Steam. An appropriate challenge level and presentation for young children, who are probably much much better than me at video games. But hey, at least it ran on my impossibly unhappy video card!
10	1	a	Decent platformer, worth getting in a sale/bundle.
585	1	a	She's got a ticket to ride! She's got a ticket to riiii--iii---iiide! She's got a ticket to ride! But she don't have enough green colored wagons to finish her line!
4588	1	a	This is a great fun tower defence game. The 1950's setting and music really add to making the SP worthwhile.
2757	1	a	Nice Gameplay, Awesome sound It's nice and very good games
2964	1	a	I love this game! 10/10
943	1	a	A fun 2D puzzle game with a combat element. Great art!
2531	1	a	Buy this game if you: Ever had urges to steal money, Learn french, Like sneaking around, Dont like COD, Killing your friends, Playing custom maps, Killing your friends, Like indie games, Like co-op games, Like indie Co-op games, and Dont like COD :PPPP
3812	1	a	Bought this for my daughter- ended up playing it myself to completion. Awesome title that I didn't know anything about until I picked it up on sale. 9/10
453	1	a	Well designed wave based shooter.
1947	1	a	Yeah me and my friends spent ages on this game i reccommend it so much cause its fun and like we get moneyz
3006	1	a	this game is great even more fun with friends. if you dont like this something is wrong with you 
3186	0	a	A puzzler that fails at being a puzzler. The difficulty here comes from fighting with the badly implemented controls of the game and the stupidity of the physics. It looks unpolished, sounds worse, and horrendously lacks in configuration.
4358	0	a	A poor Katamari clone. Controls badly, looks poor, and uninspired levels. Do yourself a favor and dust off the ol' PS2 and play Katamari instead.
3409	1	a	A cute, fun little RPG. Not too complex, and a bit repetative, but its only 6-7 hours long to complete everything so it doesn't hit you too hard. Fun story, some interesting mechanics, but if you are looking for something challenging or deep look elsewhere. A good RPG for kids, and a simple fun game otherwise.  Very simple, bit repetative, not much to it. But fun and interesting and silly. Pick it up on sale, or in a double fine bundle.
5084	0	a	I somewhat enjoyed this game but, to be entirely honest, for somebody who does not love designing their own underground fortresses A Game of Dwarves is simply a game that is sorely lacking in any form of real challenge. To add to that, even if you do enjoy designing said fortresses you are probably better off buying a game that actually has building and managing a community as its main focus. This combination only leaves a very specific group of those people who want to build a decent looking underground dwarven home without anything else going on as people whom I think should buy it.
14	0	a	I really dont reccommend this game, it was a waste of money when i bought it, very repetitive gameplay, one whole music track thats just 20 seconds of music looped, and just in general an extremely boring game:/
2420	1	a	Monaco is best played as a co-op stealth get-as-much-loot-as-you-can game, but could also be played Solo.  It is one of those games where it is easy to learn, but very difficult to master and compete for the top score, but that doesn't matter as long as you get your loot and survive; and more importantly, have fun for yourself.  Playing as one of the 8 characters, each with their own specialty to either assist themselves or their co-op buddies navigate the security-enforced levels. Each character will have their own traits that will be particularly useful in each level or your allies. Up to you how you want to plan your mission.  It's rather slow at the start, and rather easy (you could just break in and alert everything without a problem). However, in the later levels, the security is amped rather heavily and the loot is protected even more.  I would highly recommend it if you have a few buddies looking for some insanity in the later levels where it takes either patience and planning, or 'balls-deep run-n-gun get-out-of-my-way crime-time we-out' kind of style.   If you're looking for a solo-game; then it may or may not be your cup of tea.
2189	1	a	Charming and stylish co-op stealth game. Be one with your inner Pink Panther. It also has an arbitrary Zombie mode...which I guess one of you asked for? 8/10 So far...
2180	1	a	This game I bought blind, only knew that it was about stealing, one of the best games I bought this year, Id Highly recommend it, its just super really fun, And I want to learn to make my own maps on it!
5158	0	a	A very bad Dwarf Fortress clone.
4866	1	a	Exxxxcelllent Muhha ha *cough* *cough* ha! Twist your mind around this portal like puzzler! More engageing than said other game.. Damn game drove me sane. Loooollloolllb boooff llaaa laa! 
5258	1	a	Beautiful Game. Buy it! Toki Tori is &lt;3
1454	0	a	Not as good as Bad Rats.
3907	1	a	wrapped myself in toilet paper and called it a mummy to play this cult of a classic video game guess thats just good old fasioned imersion kickin in
5159	1	a	Extremely good story,Sandbox is fun.Before I got it I watched people play it for hours. The people that didnt like it are (1) Didnt get what they expected.(2) Didnt have a good enough computer.(3)Are horrible at games and lost everytime.
409	1	a	Addictive as hell. I always end up playing longer than I meant to. 10/10
136	1	a	I dont have much to say about this game... It's not bad. 6/10
2138	1	a	Awesome game, cool music, guards have amazing AI  10/10
647	1	a	I love the board game. This play faster and now I can play with someone when my wife can't.
2096	1	a	Don't believe the hype. The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible, or it would be if i got to play it on the throne. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ pile is funnier than gilbert godâ¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ his own â¥â¥â¥â¥-cunt. Trust me there's no bowing you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, only monday morning memes and a mass dose of aids. â¥â¥â¥â¥ u dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who talk about this show all the time, ned stark died â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Also Monaco is kinda cool.
544	1	a	Quite a fun game and what makes it really cool as that you can use the PC version to play against android and apple users.
2652	1	a	This is pretty fun I guess.
3462	1	a	A short, but very enjoyable game that is perfect to play around the Halloween season.
2740	1	a	Fun co-op game. Great gameplay; good music to set the tone; lots of missions to do (even a PVP mode). Definitely worth the price if it's on sale! Check the Humble Bundle store or Steam Sales!
4978	1	a	Great game, definitely worth playing! The puzzles are hard enough to ake you think a bit, but easy enough so that you still have a general idea of what you need to do to solve it. There is a lot of humor in the dialogue and surrounding environment. The animation style is cartoony, similar to Despicable Me.
1498	1	a	Great gameplay, awesome storyline, and cool characters. 10/10
1602	1	a	One of the most fun coop games I have played. Monaco is a top down heist game that supports 4 players with half a dozen different classes that each bring something different to the table. Get your friends together and rob some casinos and blow some stuff up.
669	1	a	Become a railroad magnate and learn to hate all of your friends for blocking your routes.  10 out of 10  Would screw over each and every one of my friends again.
1528	1	a	I used to resist this game...i failed utterly
3870	1	a	Fun times RPG with whimsical adventure!
849	0	a	A free to play game that literally cost money to play? No thanks.
2530	1	a	Monaco: The city of opportunity, and the game like no other. Every class feels important, and every situation I was in I could solve with every character in one way or another. In co-op this game shines like you wouldn't believe. I have no regrets picking this game up, or recommending it.
4685	1	a	I really liked it. but It is really really hard! at some point you  will  want to hit your computer with a hammer  but I would buy it again.  also I recommend playing this game with a controller
2468	1	a	Such game Much enjoy Very Monaco Omg Wow.
532	1	a	Curator Review:  The basic premise is simple: Get destination tickets, play trains to connect cities, and count up points at the end! Don't finish a ticket? Too bad! Looks like you are losing points instead.   https://youtu.be/pYC09LBTMmw?list=PLNgi8N_NMkfgtvdIvd-cSHlnkGJM713cH 
2087	1	a	grant me badges steam
1256	1	a	omfg this game...... this is the best game i ever had ':O its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheap totaly worth it    BUY IT NOW! ;O (but i have to say: 'you can get a indie pack with more then 5 games voor the same price and it also haves this game wtf) i am so smart :3
5412	1	a	This game is well worth the price on sale. The game is well polished, easy to pick up and fun to play. The game is quick to finish, I've managed to 100% the game in 7.7 hours and after that there is not much left to do.
2081	1	a	It's good.
4599	0	a	UNPLAYABLE!!! I have windows 7 and a Radeon 270. Upon installation, an error message came up saying that I have a newer version of Microsoft C++ installed and my system is incompatible. The game loads up fine. The START button in the tutorial crashes the game. In career mode the START button does nothing. I got the game in a bundle a while back so it's no big deal. Don't bother with this unless your PC is ancient!!!! I had to 'play' for at least 5 minutes before I could even write a review!
2548	1	a	I like the game but i can,t play it for â¥â¥â¥â¥ but deing sly as a fox to get stuff and steal stuff and save people for ther death i guess its alright
17	0	a	It's... really bloody basic. It looks kinda cool, but the gameplay is just way too simple. So... just like every other iOS game!
4144	1	a	Unfairly good formula. Makes bejeweled even more addictive.
801	1	a	If you like the boardgame this is a no-brainer buy
1138	1	a	Quite addicting.
2386	1	a	It's fun, just a bit tricky.
916	1	a	If you like Memoir '44 the board game, and Days of Wonder as a publisher, then you will have no complaints about this PC adaptation - unless you hate the freemium model. Honestly the only complaint I have about this game is that you have to pay to play once you burn through the initial coins you receive for signing up, unless you merely play on the 2-3 free maps. I know it takes money to run servers/develop games, but still.
3492	1	a	Simple RPG, with a simple but yet well implemented plot and combat mechanics. Greate humor. I completly recomend.  8/10
1778	1	a	Monaco is easily one of the most addicting and fun multiplayer games out there. The game mechanics are great, story is good, and a level builder to top it off. Great for casual gaming with friends. I recommend it to casual and pro gamers alike.
4181	1	a	Addictive game, most of the game focus on match 3 of a kind mechanic, which could become repetitive. However, roleplaying elements (i.e. special powers and leveling up) add a lot. Moreover there are some variations to the basic mechanic which add a welcome diversity. The story also add something more than in the average puzzle.
4075	1	a	I played hundreds of hours of that game on DS. It's one of these games that people generally looked at and passed on, but kept influencing other games until it was recognized as the classic it really is.  If you like match-3 games, this one is the only real choice. It's beautiful, incredibly deep and lasts for ever. A true gem.
752	1	a	The strategy is simple, the tension is palpable, and the victory is refreshing. It is the board game in an exact duplicate without error. And no more knocking the pieces around. I play this more than any game on Steam.
3305	1	a	A great game in all aspects. It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :)   What's to Like ?    1. Good story, involving for both young and old. 2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests. 3. Relaxing style of open world gameplay, with exciting battles. 4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily. 5. Addon 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game) 6. Great cartoonish graphics remniscent of old games such as XIII. 7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.  What's not that exciting ?  1. A little more length of the game would have been nice. 2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievments for some more of them too. 3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.  What's to hate ?  Nothing :) No major flaws.   Costume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3.   Though this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the addon DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that cany you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.  The game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game.   In all, a recommended buy. Do not hesitate if you get it on sale.
4786	1	a	Also neat.
3831	1	a	Worth your time. Decent game, however it becomes rather boring after a while as the game mechanics don't evolve.
3784	1	a	the game is actually pretty good don't let the style and childish look deceive you .
3525	1	a	Cute little game which does not take it self to seriously. Really enjoyed playing it, except battle becomes a little to repetitive.
5015	1	a	Better than the first one by a mile, the addition of awards made this so much better. Highly recommended to all puzzle fans.
4502	0	a	
283	0	a	It's really just a time waster. It looks nice, but there's literally no point.
4822	1	a	It's like Portal...but not
5417	1	a	If you're looking for a classic arcade action similar to Space Invaders, this is it. Not much else to say, but it's a good coffee break game!
960	0	a	The difficulty level of the Hidden Object parts are LEGENDARY only for the bravest of brave to attempt. The images on the store page for this game look widescreen, but clicking the video shows the game is 4:3. This is normally not a big deal in puzzle games, but in this game its a HUGE deal due to how tiny the objects that need to be found. Playing on a widescreen you may literally need a magnifying glass to find objects, doesnt help that some areas have multiple areas with no indicator as to which scenes contain what objects. Even worse is that some objects are literally a few pixels in size due to its older ratio where that might not have been a problem for widescreen users combined with many objects being very low resolution this game will pose obstacle of herculean proportions. Items also spawn randomly, so go ahead and stare all day for a missing item, it may not even be on the screen, or it may have spawned behind another object since its random. This leads to reloading the game alot to reset objects to random positions hoping the objects spawn in an area that is visibly clickable. Even completely visible objects are hard to click due to them having such a teeny tiny clickable area that may have you clicking all over even though you feel your clicking right on the object itself.   The puzzles are at just the right difficulty not to impossible but challenging enough that finishing them feels rewarding. Oddly though many of these cant be skipped, there is no guide in the game like other games to help you so players may end up stuck unable to ever continue the game. Worse is that with some puzzles the pieces may be missing. Meaning the pieces spawned off screen, so you may need to reload the game many times to finish a puzzle to reset the locations of pieces.  The story is awesome with very good voice acting, this saves the game from being a total disaster, but the gameplay elements are so buggy their almost broken making it a very tedious and exhausting gameplay experience. Pretty sure the game like the title screen hasnt been updated since 2012 so guessing what bugs are there will be there forever sadly.  Rating: 2/10 Value: $0.99
3683	1	a	I saw this game on PSN Store like 3 years ago and always wanted it since, it is great for its time period and i love the story line and idea of the halloween selection. The cons of it is glitchy rollerblades (Top lel m8) and â¥â¥â¥â¥ voice overs, like terrible, hopefully you can read subtitles. 7/10 -IGN
2784	1	a	Awesome game, well worth the money!
1918	1	a	Best Co-Op game I have played in a while. Very fun to play with friends and local Co-Op. Great game I do reccomend!
4446	1	a	by far the best matching game on steam :)
3558	0	a	I bought this because a game based on trick or treating sounded really great. However, trick or treating has never been so lame. The game gets off to a good start and is plenty of fun, but there's nothing to keep it interesting. Going door to door collecting candy even got horribly boring after a while. The combat system was easy but it was also a snore. It was so over done that I started just avoiding enemies. The whole thing is so tedious and repetitive, performing the same actions again and again (trick or treating and fighting enemies), that by the time I got to what would be considered the first boss, I was sick of this game and thoroughly done with it.
4629	1	a	Puzzles based on Physics, with a test button and a level reset button. Addictive for casual times
5463	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
1209	0	a	This game sucks â¥â¥â¥. Like what the â¥â¥â¥â¥. Why did i waste 200 MB and then 25secs of my life â¥â¥â¥â¥ing downloading this â¥â¥â¥â¥? And my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 29 cent. Like holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ what the â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Arret... [Stop in french]  I bet the french made this becuase this sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ and so do the frenchies
2239	1	a	Most entertaining game in my library. Get some friends and play.
2869	1	a	It's a neat game with some interresting mechanics, and I can tell that this is one of the few games where 'more the merrier' will apply. Especially if you have a crew of friends where you can voice-chat the hilarity.  And if you find the game to have freakishly slow FPS, try uninstalling the game then re-installing it *ON THE C DRIVE' -- Or perhaps just moving the game from an external hard-drive to the C drive may fix it.  Previous Review: It looked exciting, and like it had some great humor to it My PC is quite over-qualified to run this game, and yet this game is practically unplayable. There is extreme input lag, and general sluggishness that gives a 'chug..... chug.... chug chug.... ch..... chuuuuuuuugggggg' feel to the game.  If it weren't for that, I could give a better, and more informative, review on the game.
3019	1	a	dear devs BEST GAME EVOR and i luve the sound track plz make it a dlc that i can buy 
451	1	a	Fun as hell, trippy and colorful, kick â¥â¥â¥ music. What more could you ask for?
1876	1	a	I love the fact that I can go all Jihad and suicide bomb the guards in this game. That's probably my favorite part. This game is one of if not my favorite game I've played. It is hilarious. There is much entertainment value in it, you can play with friends, you can build your own maps, and the replay value is phenomenal. They have two separate campaigns (I guess it's sort of like the same campaign only the level gets bigger and more difficult). The different characters you can play are very diverse (not the bad, politically correct way) and have different skills. The NPCs are friggin' HILARIOUS in their interactions with you and the bush in which you are hiding (but they, of course KNOW you could not possibly be hiding there) and it's just an all around well balanced and fun as hell game. I give this game an 11/10 (because that's possible).
3060	1	a	A great local multiplayer game, me and my friends have had hours of fun playing this in the past.
2982	1	a	A brilliant game.  Hard to do be yourself, hillarious with others.  You will find yourself in a level with 3 other people, being stealthy, robbing people blind without them knowing. Then suddenly...

360	1	a	Waves is similar to Geometry Wars in the sense that it's a strictly one-arena twinstick shooter. There are no 'natural obstacles' in the arena, just enemies to shoot.  One notable difference is that the sphere the player controls in Waves has momentum, so it won't switch movement directions on a dime. There's also several different game modes.  The enemy cavalcade isn't all that impressive, though, based on what I've seen so far.  The game has plenty of challenge, mind you, for a semi-casual twinstick shooter fan like me, and it also has online scoreboards.  Waves is one of the better twinstick shooters I've played. It's too bad its follow-up failed at Kickstarter.
4870	1	a	Great concept, nice art design, good humor, John de Lancie as a voice actor and heavily based on 3D platforming in first person. The last one isn't exactly a positive. Also, a bit on the easy side as far as puzzles go.
2897	1	a	Multiplayer, top-down, stelth thief game. Sort of team reliant but can be really fun with friends. 9/10
2607	1	a	It's an amazing tiny game, I even never play this kind of the game. attracting my desire.
671	1	a	just like board game, though AI is not very difficult :P but still fun
5343	1	a	Nice Arcade Shmup game with minimalistic but yet enough graphic effects. Game reminds of warblade but more advanced and less hectical. Beware of achievements though, most of them have to be made in a single run that means without saving the game.   
1185	0	a	wow coudlnt play with friends 0/10
3988	1	a	This game was a lot of fun. Very clever, pretty funny.
3292	1	a	I could not recommend Obulis enough to anyone who's a fan of the puzzle and/or strategy genre... and to say that some of these levels require intense strategy and forethought is no understatement.  Each of the game's 151 maps have unique puzzles, no two being exactly alike, and the scenery of each stage combined with the tranquil music will surely create an experience you won't soon forget. However, if you're looking to complete the game 100% on your own, you will be spending  far  more than the eleven hours I spent with it. The eponymous 'Ultra' levels will have you tearing your hair out if you're not ready to look at them from every conceivable direction, and each of the 'Inner Sanctum' stages leaves you with a feeling of unease as it subverts many of your expectations and turns every lesson you've learned up to that point onto its head. The best part is that you can use what mechanics were introduced in older levels and re-implement them in harder stages, which is almost mandatory at some points... and the ending I received when I got to Dungeon XII and finally collected the Onyx Medallion was simple yet so heart-warming in the end. ( My one regret is that I didn't screenshot it for posterity, but... as simple as it was, it's worth earning and seeing for yourself. A 'credits' option once you have a completed save file would've been greatly appreciated just for the ability to revisit it at any time. )  My single complaint with this game, if I had any, is that some levels have events that cannot be replicated perfectly despite being played the same way twice. I would say this pertains most to levels like 'Dark Forest III Ultra' where the pendulous swinging of one of the balls can affect the entire pace of the rest of the levelâtoo fast or too slow, and the final ball won't reach the cannon or will simply bounce right past it. The same could be said for 'Pond XIII' where single frames can decide if you dropped a large grey ball in just the precise manner to spur a chain of events that will let you finish the level or not. Precise timing is paramount... but thankfully, the stages are so short that even the longest of them won't take you more than a minute at the absolute most, even though with all of the retries you'll rack up, it'll feel more like hours before you discover the solution on your own.  For its low price, you definitely get hours of entertainment that you likely won't find elsewhere; besides the puzzles themselves, the scenery in each stage will be a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack will absolutely entrance you.
162	1	a	Combines 3d tangrams with tetris. Good for the price, but possibly too frustrating for most people. I like all the pretty colors, but I get confused what color is next sometimes.
278	0	a	Make an ok bullet hell shooter... ....and set a max score reaching which literally terminates the game  FOR WHAT PURPOSE
4681	1	a	It may be because I'm a huge puzzle platformer fan. It may be because of the similarities to Portal. It may be because of my love for the concept of alternate dimensions. BUT THIS GAME IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MASTERPIECE. The fluid and original gameplay mixed with the hilarious script and decent graphics create an experiene that I must say I've never experienced with any game since Portal 2. Sometimes the puzzles can be so complex that they make you want to tear your hair out, but that just reflexes the game's incredibly complex gameplay. I have to say, this game is, without a doubt, better than Portal.  Not better than Portal 2, but hey, what is?
20	1	a	This game gives me nightmares
15	1	a	If you like mobile games, but wish they were less mobile, then this game is for you, I guess.
5051	1	a	works on windows 8.1, simple to learn the rules, fun!
5452	1	a	You know, at first glimpse this game seemed to be overpriced but as you get into the game it is thorougly enjoyable and fun. 10/10 would tank again! I know this may be a bit of a knock off of space invaders but seriously I dont give a poop its just so fun to play, you can even upgrade your tank! OOOOOOHH
4500	1	a	The second of the series and it is fun, I'd say a little better as there seems to be more flushed out. Great to come back to as it is in real time so you can just check back every now and then. A Great game for killl/passing time.
4390	1	a	Great indie game. Basically Katamari Damashi but without the panda buttsex. Really needs some new levels though.
2078	1	a	
4060	0	a	A very poor table.
4370	0	a	Poor man's Katamari Damacy without the humor or charm. It's ok for what it is but if you have the option, pick up the above mentioned game as there's just not much here.  If you can't though and need to scratch the magnet-ball (or I guess in this case, magnet-man) itch, this game is usually on sale at an already low price and will scratch that itch to an extent.
4231	1	a	Quite fun when you are bored and relaxing music on the title screen.
3608	1	a	A very charming turn-based RPG that reaches out to most. Probably more geared toward a younger audience with it's simplicity, but as a gamer that grew up on turn-based RPGs, I can still respect the game for what the devs pulled off. I loved the concept of the costume battles, and it was very well executed.  If you're a hardcore RPG gamer, don't go into this one with high expectations of challenging combat or a deep skill tree. Definitely a great 'intro to RPG' game for the youngins :P
34	1	a	Not quite worth the money it is, but it's a fun little game!
5504	1	a	Lots of fun. Has a great sound track to it as well.
3636	1	a	It brings out the inner child in us. Very short, but fun. The bright colours during the battles hurt my eyes over time. Play it in the dark or at night for better ambiance. B-
1982	1	a	THE best stealth game ever, and awesome multiplayer. Get it!
3638	1	a	one of the best game's i've ever played. and i don't know why.
4082	1	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   Your grades will suffer. Your friends will disappear. You'll forget to eat, then ultimately DIE.  If you're willing to risk the above then go ahead, GET THIS GAME!
1035	1	a	Would snuggle again - 10/10
2104	1	a	I remember my Nintendo and Sega Genesis games - 90% of them had the option to play co-op (Player 2 PRESS START!!!). Now, if you want a co-op game, you have to search - and that's very sad.  So, if you're looking for a co-op game - you can easily grab this. It will soothe all your co-op needs.
2512	1	a	monaco is a game were you control a thief.
1867	1	a	i bought this game so i could write this review   10/10 game reminds me of the first half of my name
3312	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute game where you are the brother or sister (Depending on whom you picked) and during trick or treating your sibling gets taken by a troll monster thinggy. So, in all great games you must go rescue them! It isn't easy but not hard, I was running about for about 20 minutes a little lost ;D But other wise epiccc graphics! It also had a pokemonish styled battle thing which I actually dislike. It's a fun game where you can just go trick or treating, you ever get sweets or you have to battle! :Poverall, a very cute and detailed game. I would buy it for the halloween season / if its on sale!
3832	1	a	As expected it is easy but there are plenty of fun costumes to play around with as well as exploring for collectables. Worth buying purely for the humour and charm which is even found in the background characters.
1207	1	a	â â â â â
3811	1	a	An awesome RPG from Double Fine.
4006	1	a	Around Halloween I am always incredibly nostalgic. Every year I go back and watch the most childish of Halloween programs to relive some of the feelings. Costume Quest brings those emotions up! It's a fun, little game that will instantly take you back to being a kid on Halloween night.   It is a short and childish game; however, I think it's a solid,little adventure RPG. If you like having feelings of nostalgia or you want something to share with young Halloween fans in your home, this game is a treat. (And that's no trick.)
1831	1	a	it great play it nowwwwww
953	1	a	The Clockwork Man is an engaging and beautiful steam-punk puzzle game. Great for casual and serious gamers alike.
500	0	a	The update has ruined the game. The server crashes all of the time! I like the new graphics but am considering not playing for awhile until the bugs are worked out.
3895	1	a	Great to play around Halloween. An entertaining halloween action-rpg of sorts. Very fun and halloween-spirited.
2205	1	a	A brilliant game of theft and teamwork, except when your entire team screws up and gets you caught by guards. Even then, each class's unique skills are invaluable to the effort, and overall, this makes a great co-op experience.
1199	0	a	no..Just NO
4093	1	a	Incredibly tough at times, but as interesting as it is intense. To those who want some casual fun, stay away, but to those who want a challenge and are willing to be patient, it's addictive fun.
3981	1	a	I was hesitant to buy this game since it looks like a childs game. When it went on sale I bought it on a whim and started playing it. This game has since become awesome in my opinion! It takes the passion and the creativity of a childs mind and personifies it. As a child when we dressed up for halloween we really made ourselves be that character! This is what this game brings in a awesome turn based combat rpg!
3905	1	a	-finishing Grubbins on Ice -wonders about corner over there -falls out of world into the void of uncoded -finds bad guys just being there along -nearly laughs to pure death  9001/10 would IGN again (not realy in IGN)
245	1	a	Nice looking and great game overall from music to mechanics.
5125	0	a	Total crap. Poorly implemented, oversimplified dwarf fortress wannabe. Paradox will never get another dime from me.
3009	1	a	The main menu is pretty fantastic. And the shotguns have sound effects. 10/10
202	1	a	Pure crystallization of thousands of explosions! 9/10
5076	1	a	Best viewed as a sim dungeon, dwarven style. There's a campaign mode where dwarves seek to reclaim their land from evil magi, but it's pretty rudimentary (I like the Dwarves-Elves angle in the story though!). It does structure gameplay a bit on each level with preset elements and gives some bonus incentive to continue playing, however it's still rather sandboxy experience, in the end not differing all that much from actual 'custom mode', which is pure sandbox without the preset storyline elements.  Otherwise, if you want to treat it as a strategy game (real time with pause), you're going to be dissapointed. It's as if creators were aiming to make something like Dungeon Keeper but in full 3D (multiple levels of dungeon not just one), changing the tone from dark lord to sort of supposedly benevolent dwarves, perhaps being inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but in the end they realized they won't make it and dialed down difficulty a lot. It's very basic, no AI to speak of, no challenge, you can do everything at your own pace without being forced to discover (always marked) rooms with enemies until you feel ready. No enemies respawn or surprise you unless you dig your own grave unprepared. Many things feel unbalanced and purely aesthetic in nature (although aesthetics do have gameplay implications of keeping dwarves happy - the more you dig, the more decorative stuff you need for dwarves to feel at home). Early game on a new level is rather slow in terms of trying to push story forward/discover random enemy rooms, because you are too weak. And then, after a bit of building up, you're totally overpowered. Especially once you realize your ability to move stuff anywhere you want by your godly player powers is overpowered on its own.  So yeah, as a sort of sandboxy doll house, err- dwarven dungeon, it can work pretty well. You dig around, gather resources, set up farm for food and wood (ultimate renewable resource that buys you everything), and possibly some shrooms for happiness (yeah.. but I usually just stick to wood for cash and get happiness otherwise :P), build some cozy place for your guys to live, occasionally fight baddies who won't be a problem at all after a bit of building up, push story forward. Can be somewhat slow, and there surely are better sim games, but the overall tone and setting here is pretty unique for such genre I think.  Doesn't work at all as a strategy game, though. And if you want to be picky, animations are bit off, but otherwise looks are sort of cute.  Bonus points for spelling 'dwarves' properly (not 'dwarfs'). Malus points for broken achievements (one mission is broken and doesn't give you full influence, required for cheevos).  Also take note there are silly in-game cosmetic microtransactions, but many are free and you can easily ignore the rest (of which only Ales DLC is separate on Steam and only gives you ale tree and kegs to increase dwarven happiness). Bigger DLC is Space Dwarves, which changes medieval tone to futuristic, but it only works in pure sandbox (aka custom) mode, not in the campaign mode. No idea about the Pets DLC.  In the end, this title isn't very strong overall, but I still recommend it for its setting, however only to people who like to mess around sandbox/dollhouse style and maybe have some TV series to watch at the same time for slower moments or something xD
2320	1	a	Better than I expected.
2112	1	a	This little gem was well worth the price for hours of co-op mayhem. Great stealth action with lots of tactical choices to make when played with others. The solo experience is severely lacking. Do not judge the game if you've only played it alone. The more players involved the more complex the plans you can hatch.
4237	1	a	As many others have mentioned, this game is basically Katamari Damacy on PC... except it is not as good as the real thing. Not that it's a bad game either, actually I had a lot of fun playing it, it's just that it's very short and has a few gameplay issues. To those not familiar with the Katamari games, the gameplay basically consist of moving around picking up any object/animal/person smaller than you. As you pick up stuff you grow in size and thus are able to absorb bigger stuff. Levels are timed and the goal is to absorb as many objects as possible within the time limit. The main difference is that in the Katamari games you roll a ball around while in The Wonderful End of the World you control a walking humanoid made out of spheres. Now lets get on with the review:   THE GOOD:  - It's Katamari Damacy on PC! The gameplay is the same and, to the best of my knowledge, it's the only Katamari clone in existence, so lets be grateful for having it on PC.  - The music is good for the most part, with some tracks bearing a style very reminiscent of Katamari Damacy (although I found the track from the Word Forge level very annoying).   - Levels are varied in design, there's indoor and outdoor locations and a few themed levels (e.g. Arcadia, Word Forge).  - As you beat levels you can unlock two other gameplay modes: time attack and free exploration. The latter is a blessing for OCD completionists like me ;-)  - Controls are responsive and you can configure the mouse sensitivity. BTW mouse-look provides you with more spatial awareness in comparison with the dual stick controls of Katamari Damacy.   THE BAD:  - Levels are too short and there's too few of them. You have 12 levels clocking around 3-5 minutes each. This means you easily go through the whole game in 2-3 hours if you don't aim for all the achievements, and half of that time will be spent in replaying the levels to get the A grade required to unlock the final level. As reference, I got 100% achievement after 5 hours of gameplay.  - Level design could have been better. All levels are square areas (no around-the-world levels) and there's only a couple of them that deserve to be called big. There's nothing compared to the massive Katamari levels where you can end up engulfing cities, continents, planets and stars.  - Graphics are very simple and rough but get the job done. However, most of the objects are pretty plain, e.g. furniture, dogs, fruits, tools, average people, etc. Half the fun in Katamari was the charm and personality transmitted by the quirky characters and scenes you could find around the levels, they felt truly alive. TBEOTW levels feel more static.  - There's not enough challenge, most levels can be beaten with an A grade in one or two tries. However there's one notable exception: the Internet Cafe is a PITA, I ragequit several times when aiming for the A and A+ grades.  - The sound effects are just meh, I found the standard sound for when you pick up something lame, overused and, eventually, a little bit annoying. There's only a few objects with specific sound effects, (e.g. dogs bark, phones ring).  - There's little replay value. The alternate gameplay modes get old real fast since the levels are very short to begin with, there's not a lot to see. The main use for the free exploration mode will be to tackle a couple of achievements but beyond that there's no secrets or collectibles.   THE UGLY:  - Playing as a walking humanoid is not as intuitive as rolling a Katamari ball: it's difficult to judge your size and contact points with objects. Considering It's a time based game, it's VERY annoying and frustrating when your character gets stuck in a pass that at first glance seems wide enough to get through. Also, as you grow in size it becomes more and more difficult to pick up small objects even though you walk right on top of them, because the walking animation doesn't provide a consistent contact area with the ground.  - Unlike Katamari, in this game it's not size that matters, it's the number of objects you have absorbed what determines which objects you can pick up (eg. the object counter must reach X number for you to be able to pick up Y object). This means that sometimes you can't pick up objects that look small enough and, conversely, sometimes you can pick up objects a tad bigger than you'd expect. So you can't always trust your eyes to plan your pickup routes, you'll be forced to rely in trial and error.  - When you walk against an obstacle you just stop, but sometimes when you walk against a narrow pass you get repelled back a considerable distance. This is annoying as sometimes you get thrown against other obstacles or outside the boundaries of the level, losing many precious seconds as you scramble to get back on track.   CONCLUSION:  The Wonderful End of the World feels like a poor man's Katamari Damacy that conforms with providing the same basic gameplay experience. It plays exactly the same but lacks its charm and challenge. That said, it's a decently fun game, albeit very short and rough around the edges. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you're like me and need to scratch your Katamari itch, I think it's worth getting during a sale.
1573	1	a	I had fun with friends, but it doesn't have that much replayability. It does have workshop support but the missions are still sorta lame. Another thing is they have a new game + mode after you beat the first story. Its just kinda useless, I wish they wouldve made a second storyline or something more interesting. Im not saying this is a bad game but I would get it if it was on a good sale.
2404	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
1855	1	a	this game is good if you just want to casualy play shumshin... seriously you guys.get it
4721	1	a	Fun original first person puzzle game, go for it.
2137	1	a	Dunno wut the game is about
700	1	a	This boardgame is wo awesome. Simple but fun and competative! For the low pirce the Complete pack has this is a given buy. Every single boardgame copy will set you back about $30/25â¬. Here you gett all of them. With that said, you should pick up the original Tabletop game also ;)
138	1	a	Fun game. Like 3D tetris... Good game for the money.
3005	1	a	I just couldnât get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâs not a bad game at all, just wasnât for me.   Iâd consider Monaco a stealth puzzle game. You have several different characters each with a special ability. Itâs played in a top down view with the trick being you can only see where you are looking and the other areas are blank.   This limited view leads to a lot of enemy and trap surprises which was a real turn off. There is a character to alleviate this problem but it felt unfair to me overall.   The game is based around sneaking and not being seen but many times I completed levels just by running through collecting the coins and then escaping the enemyâs line of site. Basically, I didnât care enough to sneak around when running around produced passable results  Bottom line: The story and mechanics are there but I just couldnât get into it. I only played about 11 missions before calling it quits as my frustration level was getting up there at that point. I ultimately felt like the characters I could play as didnât allow me to complete the levels efficiently and how I want to do it.   It includes a level editor and an easy way to play user created levels so that is a big bonus for replay value and fresh content.   Even though I didn't do co-op play I wanted to mention it may be more fun and engaging with a friend.   I feel that I didnât play this game enough to give it a pros and cons list so Iâll leave that part out of my review. Same goes with a final score.
4356	0	a	The Wonderful End of the World is basicly your Pc version of the Hit Playstation game Katamari. This is probably something you will play but not play again after a couple of days (if you dont care about the achievements). I actully find this game between boring and ok but i dont think you guys would want this. I got this game because it included with the potato sack so yea i decided to give this a try but it didnt work out so well. This game features: Sucking the world, Poor graphic quality, and not so good music. Dont get this game if you dont care about the achievements, if you do care then its your decision to get it but i would say no on it. Cost: $10 Rating: 35/100 Lame
3686	1	a	Pretty repetitive and can kind of drag but if it's the halloween season and you're feeling festive you'll enjoy it.  A good, safe, game to give your kids.
5193	1	a	Honestly one of the best dungeon keeper type games I've played in a while. The art style is charming and the gameplay is simple to learn.
1712	1	a	Wow! What can I say about this game? If you have EVER wanted to be in a heist movie, this is the game to get. It's pure joy! I cannot recommend this one enough!
336	1	a	Got it on sale for 0.99â¬. Very nice game and not boring at all. Recommended.
550	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends or people on the internet!
2888	1	a	eh it was ok not amazing but pretty good
1351	1	a	quite alot of fun, more so then i was expecting i suspect this game would shine in a LAN, the bots AI isnt to bad and its got a scaled difficulty level few different modes and ER MAH GAWD customise your penguin! totally had a space pengiun then a cowboy!
4037	1	a	This is a pretty good futuristic adventure game. While I did play it with a general walkthrough you could definitely finish it without one. The thing I liked most about it is that unlike the old-school adventure games (King's Quest, Space Quest, etc.) you can't really bork your game by not picking something up that you will need 5 hours later. Definitely one that I would recommend to adventure fans, and depending on your patience, a pretty good one for others as well.
133	1	a	My mass was rock hard critical after I played this game. Seriously though, it's a lot of fun
4074	1	a	A true classic game that has never really been improved upon though many games have tried. A very good blending of genre. Its getting pretty old but holds up to the test of time very well do to the solid gameplay and mechanics. A 10/10
4821	1	a	Plays like a cartooney version of Portal.
3474	0	a	Just a very boring game. It lack any real depth. Combat gets stale very very quickly. Story is just mediocre, tried-and-true.   Items, a staple in any RPG, for whatever reason is omitted, where Double Fine could have added some 'tongue-in-cheek' elements. The only faint sense of utility or customizations is from the 'Battle Stamps', which are 'added bonuses' like an extra skill or stats, which seemed meaningless other than the counter-strike or stun skill -- the only one which would give me a chance in battle.  The costumes did not offer any stat changes other than the obvious battle mechanic changes. Personally, I was expecting the 'knight' to have a more 'tank-like' role in addition to the 'shield' ability like More HP and lower attack. I'm expecting some differences.   You can find yourself very easily overwhelmed in a 2v3 battle with no 'usual' / 'crutch' mechanic to swing the battle in your favor like Items or some OP one-time use ability. Instead you are greeted with persistent in battle costumes (which could have been changed like that of FFX-2 dynamic) and 1 every three turns 'super-skill' that aligns with the costume chosen. Oh, and the battles consist of you pressing a button to do more dmg or take less damage.  I got as far as the mall and just couldnt careless. The story is unique-ish, but the gameplay is just boring and rather... lame.
167	1	a	Interestign little puzzle game.  try it out and see, fun for thoses in to puzzles. 
4775	1	a	A physics puzzle-platformer with ties to the Portal series both in theme and production (it was directed by Kim Swift, who worked as lead designer on Portal) and though the puzzles in QC are (subjectively) better than Portal's, it lacks any of the latter's charm or personality.  The level design is templated similarly to Portal, with the main character (here a 12-year old boy) moving from room to room in a massive mansion repurposed into a research facility (that is, a mansion repurposed to look like Aperature) with the hero's amnesiac mad scientist uncle playing the part of GLaDOS, instructing him (ie, the main character) through the facility espousing hints, quips, and barbs. Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.  And though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y. I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.  All in all, I'd give it a B  If you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.
50	1	a	A nice designed adventure puzzle, indie game. With an interesting variety of puzzles to solve. Simple story, cute characters, nice colors, I really loved the idea of making the environment look like made of paper. The music is in loop, so if you start feeling frustrated by it, you can turn the sound off, however there are some music-puzzles to solve in some places.  The price is low enough to make this game worth buying. A very nice way to spend some time on, recommended for kids too, pretty sure they will love it!  The game is under development, so this atm incloudes only the 1st part of the story. Can't wait for the rest!
797	1	a	Its a digital version of the board game.  If you like the board game, you will like this. Has all of the variations of the board game available as DLC too. And on one system you can play via a hot seat game mode.   All in all great adaptation of a great game.
854	0	a	The board game is a good game, and the way it is implemented here generally works.  I give this software product a negative review for non-'game' reasons: the particular F2P model involved is ridiculous, and the game does not appear to handle network disconnects in a clearly explained or reliable way.   
918	1	a	Great match-three game with pretty graphics and a nice story. The end is hellishly difficult though. Valdis Story, the next game from Endless Fluff Games is also awesome (metroidvania).
486	1	a	If you love the game, buy this. DLC are ongoing, but they can be found on sale regularly.  Or wait for the rare bundle.
3989	1	a	Costume Quest is a fun, cute game about trick-or-treating and is short in length.   My full review  [mygamebacklogprogress.com] 
5255	1	a	my favorite part is the cards
4754	1	a	Fantastic little puzzle game for anyone looking for light humorous fun. Innovative gameplay with fairly straightforward puzzles.
2560	1	a	Such steal, Very sneak, Much mistakes 10/10
1179	1	a	Best game ive ever played in my life
1823	1	a	I recomend this game for everyone.
4874	1	a	Absolutely great puzzle game-platformer, some puzzles are sor hard they will make you cry. 10/10 would puzzle-cry again
1439	0	a	Simple little dodgeball game not that great might be fun for a lan.
4440	0	a	This game looked good for my kids aged 3-6, but you need good reading skills to play (practically no other way to work out how to play or what things mean), which rules out the younger kids, and it isn't that easy to follow what's going on. I would say it might be good for kids around age 8+  It is not good for younger kids than that.
540	1	a	Being new to board games on PC i wasn't sure what to expect, but the simplicity of the game is great, without prior knowledge of the game it can pretty much be played straight away with minimal referal to the rules and then picked up more in-depth as you go along, enjoyable to play, and the computer bot seems to adjust its tactics which is fun but difficult at times!! overall a fun way to spend a couple of hours
1887	1	a	attempting progression during unorganized revelry
4274	1	a	I have played this game. I think I liked it.
5115	0	a	Hugely disappointing. Having hyped this game as a simplified 3D Dwarf Fortress, the developers either had no time to polish and add game functions, or they simply didn't have the skill to execute a game of this scale. Game mechanics are often hidden or pointless, navigation and moving the camera can be very confusing, AI struggles to accomplish simple tasks often doing it the most inefficient way leading to unnecessary deaths, animations and graphics that make me crave for Dwarf Fortress ASCII art, and a gameplay that does not infuse excitement or challenge with a dash of poor attempt at comedy. Paradox have a lot to learn when it comes to making games!
5491	1	a	This game is a very fun take on Space Invaders and is a very fun casual game that will keep you entertained while you play it. Keep in mind that it is NOT meant to be played for long periods of time each time you sit down and play it. Most likely, you'll only play it for 30 minutes to 2 hours every time you decide to play it, but over all the times you play it, you should easily get your moneys' worth with this game.  The game itself is very fun and exciting to play, and when you get really far, you feel really accomplished because this game is not that easy by any shade of the imagination! You have to be GOOD at this game if you want to win :)  The achievements are a nice touch as well :)  Overall, if you like Space Invaders, you'll love this game, and it is definitely worth it, although maybe not at full price. Wait until it is on sale and then get it :)

3272	1	a	good game but need update more
1212	1	a	I didn't even buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gifted it to me. Don't buy it if you respect yourself
321	1	a	1000x Better than Super Hexagon! So addictive and very beutiful graphics! Love the concept behind the defending yourself from computer viruses! Overall great game and if you dont grab it while its $0.99 you are going to be missing out!
3058	1	a	Monaco is the best strategy indie game out there especially playing co-op! Love the different characters/classes to play as. Not really worth $15 so best buy it when it's on sale. Overall, can't really say anything bad about it!
4078	1	a	You like bejeweled? That's it, with a story, and a grinding approach. But MAN is it long! Never reached the end so far, after tens of hours! I wonder when I will start the second one... It is a nice little game, nothing more. Smartphone game like. Do recommend.
2536	1	a	Definitely a fun game, 4 players who know what they are doing is a blast even going solo is possible on every level and can be just as fun. If you fail a mission just a click away and your trying it again. missions are quite short so you can blow through them (literally for a few of them). Had trouble getting groups of 4 but when they were together they were great. Groups of 3 or 2 are much more common and just as intense.
798	1	a	Love the game. Although there's a lot of room for improvement. Perhaps other locations, other option, and of course for the Achievements to actually be unlocked D:
1290	1	a	this game is like the best club penguin DLC eva.  IGN gave it a 10/10 for GOTY  I'm not having a jiggle, when i step in that game i feel like Iron Penguin shooting snow balls at people.  would recommend to anyone who is amazing like my m8 Matt Dowd who thinks hes Matt Dowd.  100000000/10 would play again best game ever Peng/Peng
2349	1	a	So much fun when playing with 4 player local koop!!!!  Use controllers.
4633	0	a	Do not waste money on this game !
1992	1	a	Simple game but very good. I recommend it to everyone
723	1	a	Great adaptation of the board game, with out the hassle of setup and tear down. Moves quickly!
329	1	a	This game is pure Awesome! The mecanics (I think I spelled that wrong...) are solid! The music is great! The challenge is real, and I love the comments when done with a round! Just Brilliant! 11/12 though, because I have a pretty good cpu, but still lags quite a bit, especially with 'hold' mode. But that doesn't bother to much!
4996	1	a	I bought this game on sale for about $4, and I would have gladly paid $15. It is a very solid puzzle platformer with a (somewhat hit or miss) sense of humor. The puzzles feel clever and require a bit of trial and error, but no puzzle really felt like a wall. The difficulty curve felt fair. Expect about 6 hours of content if you are familiar with puzzle/platformers of its ilk. This game is not overly ambitious, but it does deliver excellently on small, iterative puzzles that manage to make you feel smart for solving them. If you go in expecting that, you will be happy with your purchase. 8/10
1557	1	a	Buythisgame  This game is the best multiplayer co-op game I've ever played. You and three friends will experience the rush of breaking into museums, banks and hospitals all in the hopes of scoring some loot, as well as some unexpected characters. Don't skip the story, it deserves the time to read!  Have fun and don't get caught!
1181	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS. BOUGHT IT FOR A REALLY CHEAP PRICE BUT IT'S STILL NOT WORTH IT COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. REALLY SUCKS.
2602	1	a	Amazing deal this weekend at 3.74
5149	1	a	Amazing game, reminds me of Dungeon Keeper with a fun factor added.  Kinda amazing what you can develop in the absolutely customizable chunk of rock given to you.  *Be sure to read all father-son dialogues since they are so mucn fun!
4164	1	a	A surprise gem for puzzle lovers. It's a must buy title.  Skip all the spin-off titles and even Puzzle Quest 2. They aren't as good as the first one. At least start from this particular one. I insist!
1771	1	a	This game is the most fun i have had in along time. The only down side is that there isnt a lot of people playing it now. Never the less the single player and multiplayer are some of the best.
89	1	a	Disappointing. Although the puzzles are enjoyable the game is very short and I wouldn't say the puzzles were challenging enough to warrent the game being worth much with the lack of a good story. I'd like to hope the next game has more in it but I don't feel safe in saying it will. It might be more other people's thing though, don't write it off without trying it yourself. I enjoyed myself a little, just not nearly as much as I had hoped.
1845	1	a	By far the most fun co-op game I've ever played. The soundtrack and graphics are both amazing, and the characters are all pretty balanced. 10/10 would go to jail again
2403	1	a	Very neat design highly recommended
789	1	a	Do you like the board game? Do you want to be able to play it when there is on one else around to play against? If you answered yes to both of these then buy this game. As to whether I would recommend this to someone who is not familiar with the game, that is a more difficult question. I do think it is a good game but it is very much a computerised board game so it does not have the fast paced action you would get from a normal video game. I would play the board game first as I think it would be easier to learn the rules that way. Then if you like it buy this as well.
4706	1	a	Wonderful game. Realy makes you think outside the parrallelogram. Any fan of the Portal series will love this game.
4659	1	a	A somewhat predictable RPG, Puzzle Chronicles suffers from some mildly bad voice acting and fairly repetitive battles - once you learn how to play it's Tetris-esque combat and mini-games, it's pretty much just rinse, repeat, get better gear. The story has some amusing moments, but do not be fooled: you need to disengage your brain to play this game. I think the Puzzle Quest series does a better job of engaging you with its story, and has similar mechanics to progress with.  That being said, it's nice to play a puzzle that isn't 'match 3' and while the combat is repetitive (and despite what some think, you  can  make a comeback from some very bad looking situations), it's different and interesting enough that while you're progressing the story and facing off against different enemies, it doesn't get tedious. It's worth a play, and will keep you engaged if you're after something light.  I think the only unfortunate thing for me is that there is little incentive to play and get the final achievement (it's just grinding), and not enough of a community to really get anything going for the multiplayer since it's a little older now.
1332	1	a	Meh. Only buy it on sale. I wouldn't put it as a priority either.
1813	1	a	I cannot say enough praise for this game. Not only do I enjoy it, I recommend it to everyone I know. Most games get boring after you beat them, but Monaco just stays fun by allowing you to try it different ways, with different characters, making it a game you can play multiple times. And multiplayer is great (assuming no one lags too badly) since you can have more fun, knowing that someone's got your back. Even the story is great, as I was truly enthralled in it. As of right now, I'm working on the achievments, which have never felt more rewarding. I cannot recommend this enough.
2268	1	a	Monaco is the best Co-op expirience i have ever played. The singleplayer is all right and there is random online games, but to really get your money's worth, get some extra controllers, invite over your friends, and have a grand ol' time! Even if you don't have anyone to play with i would still recommend it, since it's definitely worth its price tag, but trust me, to truly expirience how great this old-fashioned heist-movie game is, you NEED to play with some friends by your side. 6/10 if you're alone, but an 8/10 with friends.
5310	1	a	Best platform game ever! -- no UI to in the way of the beautiful graphics. simple controls that have surprising depth. Fun and beautiful
1681	1	a	A fun 2d birds eye view 'Stealth game'. Despite being fun, it is infinitely more fun if you play with 4 people in a skype chat.
1594	1	a	Fun game. Nice to play whith your friends even though you might not understand something. Cool story
2206	1	a	This game was really fun to play with friends!
2269	1	a	Great, fun party game. If you want some awesome stealth and heist-themed gameplay but not the crazy, fast-paced, teamwork-is-essential gameplay like the Payday series, give this game a try.  Story: Main story is short, however there are other side missions that take place after the main game is completed, as well as custom missions you can find, adding replayability.  Gameplay: Emphasizes on stealth a lot, but not always required, so pick the character based on your play style and go to town. Enemies can overwhelm you rapidly but if you know what you're doing, you can get away reasonably quick.  Controls: Absolutely simple, with the theme of 'within reach.' Moving with WASD and using gadgets with the Spacebar or Left Mouse button? Couldn't get easier.  In all, very fun game that's easy to get into, with easy achievements for the new guy, to the hard ones for the hunter who wants it all.
2948	1	a	Monaco doesn't have great graphics, and if you're Chaide and you suck, the music isn't great either. However, Monaco offers a wonderful multiplayer experience. It's a simple game, the rules for most of the missions being to get in, get something, and get out. The way you handle doing that is entirely up to you, and they provide you a good sized selection of characters to accomplish your goal*  While it is 'entirely up to you', there's really only two things you're doing; you're either sneaking around, or you're running around all crazy because you didn't do the sneaking thing right. Still, a very fun experience that has you trying to plan ahead all your moves.  There's quite a lot of missions, too. Definitely takes a while to get through this game.  I think my biggest complaint may be the difficulty curve. Once you acquire all of the characters, the missions get hard fast. I recommend getting more players to assist, or get ready to have a very slow mission.  But at the end of it, it's a game I recommend because it's unique. It's hard to compare it to anything else, but it doesn't fail in what it was trying to accomplish. If you're into zany heists with friends, give this a shot if you aren't too turned off by the rudimentary sprites.  *I'm going to make an exception here for the pickpocket, who only seems to help with...your Time, I guess? Whatever money you miss picking up on the mission when you get out adds a lot of penalty to your final time, which is only really for bragging rights on leaderboards I guess. Pickpocket's pet monkey can sweep areas for money to assist with that, and ammo for your weapons. Overall though, you'd probably do better with some other character if you're focused on just the objective.
3949	1	a	-finishing Grubbins on Ice -wonders about corner over there -falls out of world into the void of uncoded -finds bad guys just being there along -nearly laughs to pure death  9001/10 would IGN again (not realy in IGN)
3653	1	a	Going back through this game with my son before playing the sequel. Forgot how much fun this game is and the little man absolutely loves it!
3435	0	a	I didn't ejoy too much this game for some aspects of it. First of all, this game is the same always, turn-based battles, looking for sweets, but battles are always the same. i haven't completed the whole game but I'm quite sure that if in 4 hours it doesn't change, it will not change after that... Also for me is frustrating that sometimes even thought you do everything well in a battle you cannot win in any way because enemies are too high level. Apart from that, I loved how this game is designed, graphics are beautiful, costumes look great and abilities and powers from these are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend this game just because I felt so frustrated playing it and i quited. Maybe some day i will finish it but i think i will not do it at the moment...
567	0	a	Can't get any of the achievements without the DLC :(
240	1	a	It's a lot of fun esp. for .99 when its on sale
2994	1	a	Monaco is original and exciting, but it also makes you think. Moreover, if you are similar to me, it will make you jump. A lot. There's not thrill greater than being chased through an international bank or a mental hospital by a security guard who is intent on beating you up. This game satisfies that need.
5385	1	a	Great casual game. I find myself putting a few minutes of game time on this one almost daily. Something to consider when one remembers paying a quarter(Dollar now?) at the arcade for a couple of minutes of fun at best.
5019	1	a	Puzzler World 2 is, unsurprisingly, a framework for several different types of puzzles.  The Sudoku works, and lets you take basic notes, but it's not the best Sudoku game out there. The Crosswords are very difficult, because this is very obviously a UK-made game, and you would need a lot of UK-specific knowledge to solve them. Link-A-Pix puzzles are pretty neat, and the big ones get very challenging. The rest are too simple for an experienced puzzle solver, even at their hardest.  The interface isn't very good, but it works well enough. The puzzle instructions are insufficient, but most puzzles aren't that hard. The bonus puzzle/hint system is enjoyable, and necessary if you're not an expert at UK crosswords. Master Mode lets you cut right to the toughest challenges. There are definitely enough puzzles to keep you busy for a while.  This is definitely for puzzle fans only, but caters to beginners, casuals, and experts.
4675	1	a	Another great puzzle game, themed heavily on Portal. You change physics around you to solve the puzzles. I've heard it described as 'baby's first Portal' and that is a decent summary of it. The puzzles are a bit easy, though that doesn't take away from the fun. The doctor is very clearly based on GLaDOS, but John DeLancie does a wonderful job of voicing, and the script pulls it off pretty well.  If you like puzzles, physics, or Portal, it's worth picking up, especially on sale.
4166	1	a	Bejeweled with RPG elements, an attempt at a story and a surprising amount of things to do. Actually a pretty decent game, but prepare for the AI to cheat... a lot.
516	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun game. It involves a little strategy and a little competition. I like playing both the board game and the video game. The video game is nice when I don't have time or space to set up the board game.
423	1	a	Strategy + Sarcasm + Shapes = Waves
1466	0	a	is a dead multiplayer only game (4 player peek a day). It has some value in fighting against bot on online server
1822	1	a	A definitely recommendable game, with a very good concept, art style and humor. However, playing with friends is almost a must, especially in the later levels, and constitutes most of the fun. This is sadly a little bit hampered by the awkward private game creation system (x on the level for list of games, from there create, from there set to private, then send invites...). Perhaps the option for friendly A.I.s and a more streamlined private game with friends system would be of help.
4276	1	a	Imagine Katamari Damacy made for a cell phone and then ported to the PC with haste. Its buggy and the game didn't size properly on my screen. But if you look past that, you have a decent game here.  Pros: I had fun with this game. It really is an enjoyable game. It truly is the Katamari experience. While it is not the same humor and as fluent as it's predecessor. It really does capture the garbage ball concept.  Cons: It feels cheaply made. Not many levels to offer. Once you finished it, you are done. I wouldn't buy it if I was you but would play it if you got the chance. Humble Bundles are nice.
251	1	a	Superlative arena based twin stick shooter ala Geometry Wars but uniquely utilizing a combo based use em or lose bomb acquisition system. Employs slow motion techniques for extended scoring but usage or buffer depletion lessens recoverability in tight situations so as the great Johnny Cash would say  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-OrzG3id_8) . Allows for zen like mastery where you perpetuate in a zone and keep extending time (Rush mode). Multiple game modes. Supports the Xbox 360 controller. Without being overly dramatic, where did this come from? It's awesome.
4015	1	a	A simple turn based RPG that has barely any depth, except there is a charm to the game that keeps you playing.
5524	1	a	Titan Attacks! really works as a retro style space shooter. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything looks and plays great. Who wouldn't have fun blowing up alien invaders with a super-powered and fully upgradable tank? This game reminds me of the classic arcade sh*t. And that's a good thing.
3826	1	a	Addictingly fun and easy to play RPG. 9/10.
4433	1	a	Obviously not much has changed since the first three Luxor games (Luxor 1, 2 &amp; Amung Rising). The graphics are slightly better and it's still a lot of fun to kill some time.   Is it worth it to buy this casual game for 10 bucks (normal price) ? Hell No! But I will still recommend this game IF being sold for a much lower price.
3047	1	a	Great game fun solo better with friends. Not for people interested in story it's all about gameplay with a choice of just rushing it or being a stealthy ninja.
528	1	a	Great board game, even better PC game. It is impossible to stop after one game.
3245	1	a	Highly Recommended! 10/10  This is a fabulous little overlooked gem! Great graphics, fun gameplay, peaceful scenes and music, and a great simplistic style overall. The music is very good, and actually varies by environment.   I'm actually so impressed with this game, that I think it's worth the full price, if you're considering it. It's not terribly long, perhaps, but it does have 150+ levels, so there's a decent amount of gameplay to it. 
1626	1	a	Sometimes, i get question from my friends about game i can recommending. For FUN, ACTION, bit PUZZLE, yet SIMPLE, also AMAZING, and can have blast with FRIENDS. well, i dont have any good answer, till i fin MONACO!  YES! THIS GAME DEFINITELY MUST BUY!!! CANNOT GO WRONG with THIS! XD
4257	1	a	Neat Little Katamari Style game where you go through levels collecting as many objects as possible which increases your size allowing you to pick up even larger objects and the levels expand as you get bigger and able to reach new places due to your increased size. There a demo for it so if your not sure give it a try and that should tell you if its a game you would like.
2676	1	a	Have owned since last summerand everyone seeing this sale on it NEEDS TO BUY IT. BEST CO-OP GAME EVAR.
4391	0	a	It is like cheating on Katamari Damacy with its ugly sister.
834	1	a	Outstanding Game. Allows you to play solo against multiple computer players or go online and group. Solo game play keeps you second guessing the computer all the time. If you should ever get tired of the US map there are additional map packs to pick up.  Play with friends and rack up the achievements
3015	1	a	Fun to play with a friend.Nice style.Nice Gameplay.Story is nothing special but the concept is cool.  7/10
3256	0	a	Well, for starters, this game feels like it should be on an touchscreen, not a mouse and keyboard. I like the physics aspect of Obulis, but the controls offset me. I would be waaay more inclined to play this game if the controls were better.
1155	0	a	Probably the worst game I've bought. I was glad to have gotten it for only $0.50 on sale. Right now I can run crysis 2 on high with DX11 on at full fps but this game lags like a benchmark running on a potato. I'm not the only person to complain about this. Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.
578	1	a	Oh, I really enjoy playing this game! I originally played it in board format with my family, but the online version is sooooooo much better as you save so much time not having to set up and put back a million pieces! Also--the online version comes with many different versions (USA, Europe, Asia). Thanks for the online version!!!!
4243	1	a	A game where you get to walk around maps and consume everything. It is simple and fun for all ages. However it takes less than 1 hour to complete all 12 levels. More than that if you want to get all achievements which will require playing the game twice.
2711	1	a	Monaco is a pretty fun way to let out your inner thief without those pesky moral values stoping you.
4511	1	a	I love this game! Requires a lot of patience but it is very entertaining :)
1178	1	a	Best game ive ever played in my life
1908	1	a	It's fun.
1775	1	a	Way too much fun...
4853	1	a	If you enjoy Portal you will love Quantum Conundrum as it features alot of the same physics type puzzles and also if you are a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation you will instantly recognize the voice of Q John de Lancie who plays your mad scientist uncle.
4747	1	a	Great puzzle game that is comparable to portal just with a more positive story line.
4815	1	a	I really like this game. It's a fun puzzle/platformer with a similar feel to Portal. It's not all that difficult but it also isn't too easy. The DLC is where the real challenging levels where for me. It has great physics, which is really important, because all the puzzles are physics based. Really the only thing else I want from this game, is for someone to make a mod adding Vive support,
1708	1	a	I've played a ton of this on Xbox, and picked it up on Steam summer sale. Well worth it. Monaco is linear. It is repetitive but it is also damn fun and outstandingly exciting when you pull a win out of your a$$. This IS a co-op game. Single player is less mayhem and challenge. Half the fun is your friends tripping alarms or gunmen and you having to figure out wtf do we do now? Haven't made it to community maps or level editor yet, but that plus more content is what brought me from Xbox to Steam.   Bottom Line: get some friends, get some copies and enjoy this great co-op indie title
2450	1	a	If you like old school graphics, and a cat/mouse type game, then this is for you. Id say 7/10 ... Not bad, can be a bit hectic.
2352	1	a	Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic. The multiplayer is where it especially excels. The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level. All of this with an excellent musical backing. Watch some co-op here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oTlS5wQG0cuqhlYsE7mY0z 
576	1	a	trains are cool and fast in this game you make railroads connect the country  a haiku for you.
2507	1	a	I absolutely adore the stealth mechanics in this game, I haven't this much fun being a sneaky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a long time.
4532	1	a	These games can get a little addicting, but you definitely need a lot of tips online to continue it in some parts, most things are well hidden and are confusing at best so I found I needed quite a bit of help. Good game but not my favorite in the genre.
2727	1	a	This game is a blast to go through with friends! Seriously, why haven't you bought it yet?
3825	1	a	Tim, I love you, man, but this got real old, real, real fast.
2211	1	a	Great game, realy fun to play with friends!
2323	1	a	I love this game. The game is about being a thief. There are multiple types of characters each with their own playing style. Soooo much fun. The music adds to the gameplay. Definetly playing this with family. It is one of the few games on PC with local multiplayer. Personally, 10/10.
3632	1	a	I actually at first wasn't that interested to play this. I got this as a part of humblebundle, which bought cause of Brutal Legends. But Brutal Legends disappointed me( that is a different story). So I tried out this game.  And to my suprise, the game turned out to be quite fun that I completed it in the same day. The game is cute and fun to play. Although I think there isn't much replayablity in this game, unless you want to unlock full achivements.  However to make long story short. This game is quite enjoyable.
5194	1	a	Good game , like Dungeon Keeper &amp; Dwarf Fortress . Only con so far is Dwarfs get tired and hungry quick so you have to litter your dungeon with beds and food tables to get any work done . Besides that I like it .
828	1	a	One of those casual games that you can keep playing. You can also play it online. Definitely worth the money.
5270	1	a	Bloated Frog:) I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1494	1	a	A surprisingly complex game stems from a very simple goal: steal all the goods in the building and don't get caught. The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.
2540	1	a	Manic, multiplayer madness, the maelstrom of mania is pretty damn fun.
2126	1	a	Great game , worth every penny
1996	1	a	highly entertaining with friends
3662	1	a	Costume Quest is one of the best games I've ever played. While it may look childish and corny... Well it is those things, but in such pure awesomeness it becomes a must own in my book. Anyone who likes classic turn based RPGs and/or loves all things that involve Halloween, like myself. I give this game a 10/10 5stars what have you.
2837	1	a	So much fun with friends! Takes time to figure out how to work everything but once you get the hang of it it's awesome.
3521	1	a	Refreshing, original and completely Schaferian. 5/5!
2306	1	a	Great game
2534	1	a	I just picked it up on  HumbleBundle.com , and i do not regret it, great co-op game.
1297	1	a	It's actually quite fun, too bad there's no one playing
921	1	a	For the most part, I like this game. I thought it was original in its design. It has rpg, puzzle, and strategy game elements at the very least. The story and battle mechanics are very interesting. At first, you think the game is going to be easy, but it can also surprise you at how challenging it can get. It definitely makes you think on your feet and try to plan ahead.   Probably, the one thing that I did not like about the game is that whenever an enemy casts a spell, it interrupts what you are doing to tell you about it. I understand it is to help draw your awareness, but usually I am concentrating on what I need to do next and it is very jarring to be suddenly pulled away from what I'm doing. Enemys cast a variety of spells, such as barriers and holds on your abilities. I do not need to be pulled away every, single time. However, in light of the whole, this is just a small annoyence. Overall, the game is very fun and interesting.
1663	1	a	I ran around, shot everyone in the level with a shotgun. WIN
4174	1	a	The only thing missing is customizable textures. If only it had that...
4626	0	a	Does NOT work on Windows 7 machines. Wasted money.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267678404 
2164	1	a	The best and most approachable cooperative game experience I've ever had, hands down. Don't bother purchasing it for yourself - grab the 4-pack and spread the joy!
3637	1	a	Costume Quest is an extremely charming Halloween-themed turn-based battle adventure. You collect candy, fight monsters and complete quests and it is really a joy to play. While the world you travel through is quite varied, the gameplay mechanics are not. Especially the fighting can become tedious. The saving feature here are the costumes that make your characters use different attacks. If you switch the costumes around a bit before entering new battles you can make it a little more interesting. Each character just has one basic and one special attack and you can only alter the damage you do a little by successfully pressing a certain button or button combination, in short: a quick-time event. I enjoyed it nevertheless.
1122	0	a	A game about balancing the contents of your truck as you go over terrain on a 2D plane. It's simple and difficult. But it couldn't hold my attention. It felt like I was playing an old flash game from the 90s. Something that you'd play around with on a lunch period at school.   They also try to push the stuffed animal thing a bit to far like it's some hilarious joke and I just wasn't on board.
4248	0	a	Katamari Damacy-lite that might have been enjoyable if not for all the bad collision detection bugs it has.
4127	0	a	Kicks me out and forced my computer to restart.
92	1	a	Ok.... DO NOT pay full price for this game, you WILL regret it. I bought this as part of an indie royale bundle and I'm glad i did. This game took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to beat, and now that I know all the solutions. it should take no longer than 25 minutes. This game is part of some sort of series, consider this to be chapter one. It is nowhere near as satisfying as a point and click like machinarium. That being said, it's a nice little adventure game, with only a few unclear puzzles. The puzzles were logical, but some had a poor setup or were too difficult to connect if they were multi-room puzzles. The animation and transitional animations were great, and so were the short cinematics.  Do buy if it is part of a bundle or has a very low price. But just like 'trauma' it is way too short to pay full price for. But unlike trauma, you've most likely played a game like lume before.
4216	1	a	It's pretty good.
3128	1	a	By far the most fun stealth game I've played.  Loads of content bring lasting fun for new and experienced players alike. Perfect for solo, online, and couch play!
4284	0	a	this game has more bugs than a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing field of bee hives that has a migration of dragon-flies swooping over-head with ants hitching on their backs.
1842	1	a	Fantastic game, especially if you can team up with your friends, it gets even more hillarous when you're on teamspeak or something. Amazing soundtrack that changes according to the current situation and has a great heist feel. The visuals are good, colours are nice but when things get hectic, it's pretty hard to see and usually things get a bit clutterd. But who cares about that in a game like this? It's dirt cheap on sales too. I wouldn't reccomend buying it full price thoguh, becasue it doesn't seem like a game you'd play a lot.
5488	1	a	This game take the old invaders games to a whole new level. Super fun and addictive.........BUY IT NOW!
3532	0	a	I like the idea for costume quest. The visional style fits very well with the game. The game has some fun characters too.  What I don't like with the game is that it is extremely repetitive. The first area you are in was pretty fun. But it feels like the game might as well has ended there. Because you then get to another area where you have basically the same quests again, just at a different location. The quests aren't very fun either. The combat is very repetitive because only have one normal attack and a special attack that you get after two attacks. So every fight is: regular attack which follows with a quick time event to get the maximum damage out of your attack, do this for every character. Then quick time event to reduce damage from the enemy. Then repeat this to get special attack, do special attack. if the enemy isn't dead do it again.   The concept for the game is very good. It could have been an awesome game. But sadly it's too repetitive and it kind of falls flat. Even though the game is very short is feels far to long for what the actual content of the game. It feels like they made the game longer by just using the same quest again with a new background texture.
4654	1	a	Fun little puzzle game, can be a bit of a challenge, but I'd say get it on sale or with a bundle package if possible.
3726	1	a	An annual Halloween season staple. I play this every year
582	1	a	Good old Ticket to ride, haven't played it much on steam since i played it on the 360 alot.
677	1	a	An excellent adaptation of the board game. For that it gets a thumbs up. That said.. it is not a good board game. It is more like train solitaire.
2406	1	a	It's a great game especially for the price Friends I have two copies if you want. Only downside is you have to play with other people. You're supposed to have 4 but 3 would do.
2754	1	a	This game is hillarious, so much fun when playing with friends, definitely worth the money!!
1597	1	a	You know these types of games where you have to take something and then escape? But there's like lots of these things you can't resist taking even if it means going through â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fire but it gives no real reward besides a marking that you did so?  This is pretty much that again, and it's amazing.  11/10 gotyay buy it already seriously buy it I need more friends to play this with  Not sold yet? You can â¥â¥â¥â¥ into the toilet while standing behind the toilet. Through a wall you just broke.
4843	1	a	A new way of thinking out of the box! Shift through the dimensions to manipulate almost every object that you come across!
1023	1	a	This shaz is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bees knees yo. I'm snugglin my truck all the way to the godamn bank homie, shieeeeet.
350	1	a	A great game to just play and relax.
1501	1	a	At first I thought this game was all smoke and mirrors when it came to the game play and graphics, but up until I took the time to actually play this game then I realized the potential it has playing yourself or playing online with others.    The games premise is to rob places without being detected, which seems simple right? The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.   The unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.    I would recommend buying it on sale.   Indie Rating : 8/10  RATING : 7.2/10        Gameplay   B     Story / Campaign   B-     Visuals / User Interface   B-     Sounds / Music   B-     Replay-ability   B-     Overall    B-       ScreenShots :
3391	1	a	It'll definitely put you in the mood for Halloween. However, it's fun to play regardless, even if it isn't near the holiday. It's a weird, yet funny little game.
5172	1	a	I was able to have fun through the game design flaws maybe you can too.
924	0	a	The good news is that the light RPG elements are actually pretty entertaining and kept me playing for a few hours. There isn't a ton of depth to them, but they're thought out well enough to give some focus and direction to what you're doing on the puzzle side of the game and break it up a bit. The story is nothing to write home about, but it moves the game along.  I might've kept playing it on and off despite some annoyances (e.g. fighting multiple enemies at once that spam status effects effectively forcing you down an upgrade path that gives you an easy way to clear things like blind/poison), but my inability to see what was going on really started to get in the way after a while. This is one of the few games where my partial color blindness has been a significant problem (especially with the blue/purple gems), and it could've been avoided without even adding a color blind mode. Just making the different gems different shapes would've made an enormous difference. It also really, really doesn't help that things like the poison symbol cover up most of the colored area of the gems, which makes it a lot harder at a glance to tell what you need to match them with to clear them.
639	1	a	Really like this game. My only request would be that the option to make the bots more realistic be included. When I have to play off line the bots are annoying.
2029	1	a	Eh, this game is alright. I enjoyed it mostly. Although this seems like a game that's better suited for consoles. I wouldn't get this game unless it is on sale.
2726	1	a	Playing alone, it's probably a 6/10. Playing with friends with open mic chat? 10/10. Hilarious.
4780	1	a	Only needed a walkthrough twice. 9/10
254	1	a	If you like twin-stick shooters (keyboard+mouse is actually more fun) and/or score attack, this is a definite recommendation. I like neither. ... I likeD neither. Then I got Waves. ^^  Upsides: - Launches quickly without forcing you to sit through endless logos. (Two skippables, and if you rename the video files, you get undelayed launch.) - Many different game modes that all utilize, hone and broaden the basic skillset of the player. - Good music. - Some peculiar, moderate humor that is almost like a sports coach at times. - Plenty of achievement goals.  Generally very motivating. Many details I cannot put into words. The whole package just is a lot of fun. And, hell, it has a demo! You can check for yourself! Yay!  Downsides: - You can't choose which music plays. - Maybe some minor obstacles when using a game controller for menu navigation. - Leaderboard display tediously slow.
2954	1	a	it s fun to play ,great strategy game
630	1	a	A faithful recreation of the board game, and also on tablet too. Great fun
2883	1	a	Cooles Coop Game
5496	1	a	A walk through the history of top-down shooters starting with Space Invaders and progressing through Galaga and Centepede with some Asteroids thrown in for good measure. Well put together both visually and aurally, it's only weakness is in its simplicity. Overall worth checking out for the fan of old-school stand up arcade games.
1447	0	a	boring and pointless, not much multiplayer, grindy achievements, no campaign
1824	1	a	packed full of stresfull, intense, badass, ect. moments, and a variaty of carictors and their storys. definitly a game to get!
2953	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
5460	1	a	As the last surviving tank commander on Earth, single-handedly turn back the evil invading alien army, drive back the Titans across the Solar System, and defeat them on their homeworld...  Titan Attacks has the same easy-to-learn and addictive gameplay of the classic arcade shoot 'em up, but is packed full of extras - new features, new strategies, and stylish neo-retro visuals.  Battle swarms of alien fighters, bombers and giant boss motherships, over 5 unique worlds and 100 levels of frantic action. Earn bounty money and upgrade your ship with extra cannon, rockets and lasers. Destroy falling wrecks, dodge hurtling asteroids and capture escaping aliens - or blast them from the skies! Win prizes in sharp-shooter challenge stages and compete on the online Hi-Scores table!
3702	1	a	This is a funny and adorable story, its a must play on Halloween, the game is simple but fun to play.  10/10
5360	1	a	Who did this?! Who made this game so addicting?! What kind of person would do this to others? This is a sick world we're living in.  Great game though. 10/10
2064	1	a	Very unique idea for a stealth co op game. Just brilliant !
4598	1	a	Even though I havn't played this game very long on steam, I was actualy introduced to a vertion after it came up for free on Amazon. My daughter and I played this game off and on for weeks until there were no more puzzles left. No, Crazy Machines isn't nessarily *FOR* adults but the game is enjoyable enough so that adults could get into it. Those of you who are having technical problems try this link  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-695153.html  . We got Crazy Machines 2 working on our windows 8 laptop by installing the nvidia PhysX driver.
1627	1	a	It's a good game. Maybe I'll write a review when I'm not lazy.
1167	1	a	Obviously you must realise the art work that lies deep inside the game. It's deep inside the subconscious of a young child in pre industrial America where you are forced to thrive off of others in a anarchy like goverment, yet being deep in the past the gumboys predict the future with movements and smiles. What lies in the cores of gumboys is something that is deep and dark that is covered up with looks of pleasuring happiness...you must find this out on your own. Only you can learn the secret art of the gumboy. Find it...  
5321	1	a	I initially hated this game. A lot. I had loved the first Toki Tori, but found this one frustrating and confusing.  However, after having put it on the shelf for a year and coming back, I decided to give the game a real shot. And after some initial frustration, I really started enjoying it. The puzzles are really, really well thought out. And only a few of them were what I'd call 'unfair' and required levels of perception I seem to lack.  But given lots of patience and time, it was very rewarding to figure out the puzzles, and finish a level.  What I *do* ding the game for though is its lack of focus, and overall confusing storyline. Nothing really made any sense whatsoever, and I never felt like I knew what I was doing, beyond just solving puzzles. This game lacked a lot of the charm of the original, even though, as I mentioned, the puzzle design was freaking fantastic.  I'm giving this a thumbs up, if you love puzzle games, and can ignore the confusing storyline.
4244	1	a	I immediately got this game when I saw it. I have always loved the Katamari Series and I don't see why Namco Bandai just doesn't port Katamari Forever to the PC.  So this game is very much a Kamatari Clone. You pick up items sprawled around the ground by running into them and grow by picking up more items, which in turn allows you to pick up even more, bigger items. The visuals are very simple and the music is fun, just as in the Katamari series.  I payed 1,99â¬ for the game and finished it in 1 1/2 hours, but those 90 minutes passed without me even noticing. You could get more out of it by trying to rank A+ in each of the 12 levels, but that would be very hard. The game definitely is a lot of fun if you like different experiences. So decide for yourself if it's worth it.  One thing you should keep in mind is the technical limitations of this game. The resolution locked at 1024x768 and there's no anti-aliasing without a way to change it. It doesn't look amazing streched up to 1920x1080, but it didn't bother me after 5 minutes. The game also works fine with a Xbox360 controller, but only for moving your character. All the menus have to be controlled with your mouse and keyboard.
1666	1	a	Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was 'The Perfect Game' but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10
461	1	a	Waves has a bit of a learning curveyou wouldn't expect from a twin stick shooter but is a very, very, very addictive game. Does it have a story? No. But it makes up for it with really pretty explosions, an interesting slow-mo mechanic and a killer soundtrack.
3029	1	a	Oh my god. Monaco is possibly one of my favorite games to just pick up and play. The early levels are usually 5-10 minutes, with most levels being about 20 minutes, and maybe 30 minutes on the later levels. The game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ in solo. Don't buy it to play alone. If you're going to buy this game, make sure some friends have it too. Each character has a special skill, all of which are useful for the current situation. (Except the Pickpocket and Locksmith, they're only good for a speedrun)  There are 4 chapters, each told by a different character, and each one escalating in difficulty from the last. Notably, there are 3 versions of every level- Monaco 2013 has the original levels before updates were made, and Zonaco replaces all NPCs with zombies. The entire game is orchestrated by Austin Wintory's fantastic soundtrack(Discotheque Rouge is the best), and let's be honest, how many games feature ragtime in their soundtrack?
2272	1	a	this game is great in my opinion i think that the graphics and style are great 
1820	1	a	Fun and a bit challenging worth it if you can get it on sale. 
525	1	a	It is exactly like the board game. In some ways it is better than the board game, it goes a lot faster and it highlights your ticket routes saving a lot of time. I was pleasantly suprised when ALL the versions of the board game were available in this. Lots of fun, although, the game is kind of buggy somtimes.
3400	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&amp;2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!
2865	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
4535	1	a	still love it but it seems to take a lot longer for things to happen tech point and building percentage wise
2163	1	a	One of the most challenging and fun games that I've played. Leads to some frustrations but rewarding to complete. Definitely play online with friends as having multiple characters helps.
3296	1	a	Really cute and fun little game. Itâs pretty short as rpg, but youâll have a fun time playing it. Itâs simple and pretty easy. You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad. When the fight starts youâre being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesnât need to be different. Seriously go and buy it, itâs really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)
2663	1	a	I got this game during Free Weekend and can't play again. Anyway this game is AWESOME. Love the characters, like the sounds.
1757	1	a	Nice game! overall 8/10
3075	1	a	I sat down to play this game for a minute or two to just get a feel for it because I didn't have much time before I had to go out. Three hours later, I'm still enjoying this game. It's a weird feeling playing this game. My mind makes this into a 'caper' or 'heist' style flick, exept it's more like resevoir dogs where everything goes south really fast. I long to play this game over lan. A setting where my friends and I are in the same room but looking at different things. Communication can become really interesting on more difficult levels. Either way, it's a wonderful game.
2591	1	a	You can kill things
3567	0	a	Couldn't stomach it past the intro.
1840	1	a	The real gem in my game library. Monaco is a co-op heist game with 4 players just like PAYDAY (btw there're some PAYDAY maps available to play in the workshop). Like I said, my favorite part in the game is Community made levels (my favorite is PAYDAY maps). Sure the original campaign is good, but the community made maps have a lot of detailed hand crafted game mechanism. So why aren't you buying this?! go ahead buy the game without hestitate!
1242	1	a	Cute first-person ish shooter game of sorts that is best played with a group of friends.
1617	1	a	This game is great- it's not too simple, not too complicated- the stories are pretty hilarious, and there's just enough humor to balance what could be potentially frustrating challenges.. There's also a built in editor so you can make your own levels! Tons of fun to play with friends- especially in zombie mode!!  I can't say enough about it- I hope they keep making new stories! Try it- chances are good that you'll love it :)
380	1	a	Waves is basically the best twin-stick shooter in existence. It is so good that I love it even though I donât as a rule like twin-stick shooter. Addictive as hell, with multiple fun modes, and ridiculously polished; its only downside is that I now dream of geometric shapes and my thumbs hurt.
1807	1	a	best played with friends, a fun little stealth coop expirience has given me so many frantic and fun moments, would wait for it to go on sale though, not sure if it's worth the Â£12
4903	1	a	Great game, definitely a lot of fun and gives a good tug at your brain strings. I do wish the humor was more in the vein of Portal/Portal2 however, because it seems like it's trying to be funny and often falls flat--the narrator at least. Fluffy Ike is adorable and gives me some laughs.  Either way, very enjoyable.   8.6/10
1301	1	a	ok ok ok i play this game a long time a go I LOVE IS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1605	1	a	This game is basically Benny Hill: The Heist. Buy if you have friends, or you will be alone and sad.
386	1	a	A fantastic Astroids-esque game. If you've ever played Geometry Wars then this is very similar - in fact, a lot of the game modes are almost identical (with slight twists like bomb pads instead of gates like in Geometry Wars) . That being said, if you're looking for a game to compete against yourself and friends this is it. I've found myself saying 'just one more game' over and over with this one.   My favorite thing about this game is that the duration of play time is totally up to you. If you only have 5 minutes to play, you will still easily be able to play a full round. Likewise... If you have 5 hours to kill, prepare to get mad at yourself and have a blast doing it.  Pros: Great visuals and music, addicting gameplay Cons: Limited selection of game types, leaderboards are implemented poorly and are slow to browse  7/10
1057	1	a	Got this game in a indiegala bundle for 2 dollars with other 9 games. Not regreted it ever since.
1937	1	a	A great 8 bit hiest game with great colors. Its hard though, BEWARE  7.5/10
549	1	a	Fun to play with your Girlfriend!
4937	1	a	An alright puzzler sort of like Portal though the story is almost non-existant.
4450	1	a	This game is freakin intense!
2814	1	a	Got this game as a gift from my friend during the winter sale. Played it together and I must say it was very fun. The first few levels are quite easy, but it gets harder pretty fast (or me and my friends just suck at coordinating). Have only played a few hours so far, but will probably spend many hours playing this with my friends.
4718	1	a	Pretty good, not 5 stars, but 4 and a half and a quarter, VERY close, but I kinda got bored after a while, still though, great game, and I love the story. :)
2077	1	a	11/11
5136	1	a	Much like when I needed to seal some wood and bought Ronseal, I was not dissapointed by this game.
910	1	a	'you will be offered the opportunity to purchase' Suck my â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4900	1	a	this game is just amazing. truly. i finished it and all dlc, don't worry about the steam time...no joke, this is even better than portal
2503	1	a	Suprising. I usually don't like indies so much but this one is kinda funny!
1692	1	a	If you want a nice over-the-top stealth game that has a lot of variety and challenge, then Monaco will satisfy your desire. The stealth mechanics are well implemented and the different Thieves all have different playstyles and abilities. The stock story is really fun and even more when playing with friends. You can get a solid 30 hours out of the stock story without going for all trophies. After the regular story, you can play in zombie mode, where stealth isn't as big of a factor as on-the-fly decision making. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I would recommend this game to you.
2388	1	a	I love this game! 10/10
1704	1	a	Great game with amazing art and concept.  This game will surely bring all your friends together as you will work toegther as one cohesive unit. This game relies on the skills of each and every character. You can beat this game on your own, but it will be hard. Playing single player often gets me thinking 'Having a breacher here would be great.' or 'Man, a lookout stationed here would be really helpful' which is why playing online is the only way to go.  The music, is another plus point in this game. The music has a lot of pace, picking up extremely fast as you get spotted by a guard, or managed to take the prized loot. During sneaking mode, the music provides a spy-ish sort of music.  Overall this game is guaranteed to give you a whole lot of fun and a unique experience, be it bad or good totally depends on your teamwork, when working in a team.  My rating: 8.5/10
5142	1	a	I think its a good game when you get into it but it can get very repetative at points.But it does easily make up for it.
956	1	a	This was a fun game with good graphics. I really enjoy the Steampunk genre, but this game barely fit into that category. The story was pretty miserable and irrelevant. If you enjoy I-spy search and finds then this game is worth a try. The game is only a total of about 3 hours long but you can replay with different I-spy puzzles. It was $6 when I bought it, but that was too high a price for what you get. If it is between $2-$3 then consider checking it out!
1471	1	a	BEST GAME EVER. I FEEL LIKE A LESS DOUCHY BRAD PITT IN OCEANS 11
3760	1	a	This is a very cute and charming game. I'm finding I like games from this company I have fully played two of them now (this one and Stacking) and I love them both. I used the older bratty sister, so I may play this again as the younger brother. The art style is cartoonish, but that works for this game. I like the idea of these kids dressed up in broken down boxes and pretending to have superpowers. It's not overly long, but I enjoyed it. I even found some of the fights hard at times.
2677	1	a	fun, good difficulty, not so hard you want to put your fist through your screen, but just enough to make it fun.
1836	1	a	Fantastic game, especially if you can team up with your friends, it gets even more hillarous when you're on teamspeak or something. Amazing soundtrack that changes according to the current situation and has a great heist feel. The visuals are good, colours are nice but when things get hectic, it's pretty hard to see and usually things get a bit clutterd. But who cares about that in a game like this? It's dirt cheap on sales too. I wouldn't reccomend buying it full price thoguh, becasue it doesn't seem like a game you'd play a lot.
3007	1	a	Very fun game that is best played co-op.
1744	1	a	Excellent game to play with friends.
1746	1	a	10/10 best new stealth
436	1	a	you shoot things its fun and cheap give it a try
744	1	a	really fun game and easy to understand, hours of fun !
3757	1	a	Great game. Tons of fun. The included Grubbins on Ice expansion is great fun as well.
4437	1	a	Very funny and kind of addictive matching puzzle game. It's easy to play and you'll learn very fast.  Little Farm have 20 levels, which one with 4 rounds to beat. You have to take care of your farm and earn money to buy improvements - each one that grants you a new tool or building - to better manage your crops, trucks and water, and deal with bugs, rabbits, crows and raining clouds. You get short comics, bonus levels and oil searching between that levels too.  The game reminds me Triple Town but with different mechanics, and a little of Plants vs. Zombies, because of the progression and shop/upgrade systems. This is very well done in this game too, you'll want to continue to play to buy that improvements and see them working. But at the very ending it gets boring, because you have to finish the last 5 levels or so, just collecting money but not being able to buy anything more. The only thing that keeps pushing me until the end was the Harvest Mode, unlockable just after finish the entire story mode.
5242	1	a	Cute, not as easy as it looks like... What else do you want? The most obvious difference to Toki Tori is, that this time you don't create bridges, blocks etc. but instead manipulate other creatures by tweeting and stomping. 
973	0	a	Find the object game. Massive shortage on actual puzzles, half of which I had to skip due to bugs.   Dull but (thankfully) short.
2771	1	a	Fantastic game. Best played in co-op. Chaotic arcade-y action when things go south, but cool rush of stealth game when things are going 'well'. Things tend to go south often, though, and it's a blast when they do.
3578	1	a	Fun little RPG with a great atmosphere. Combat is a bit shallow but fun nonetheless. Like getting better damage or less received damage on button press. Give it a try.
2525	1	a	This is an amazingly fun game! the single player experiance is really well designed, but the game really shines when when it comes to the multiplayer! it's great fun to get a few friends together an play some local co-op. My friends an I would play together for hours on end, working out strategies and creating our terms things, while stealing everything we can!
2995	1	a	Regular heist games are tense, they make you feel like every move you make could ruin the whole operation. Regular heist games have a specific play style in which you must be stealthy to gain each objective while avoiding numerous guards and alarms. You could play this game like that, buy when you play this games with three of your friends and run around the level with a train of guards around you setting off every alarm just so that you can get to those coins you so desperatly need and then finding that your friends have similar trains and you converge them into one super train from which two of you will die and then, when the only two players left alive reach the stairwell and realise that the others must be saved to progress, only then do you realise how ridiculously amazing this game is. Also speaking the voices, Quoi?
4526	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. Worth every penny...all 100 of them.
310	1	a	A very basic twin-stick shooter with absolutely nothing new to bring to the table. But I can't give thumbs down since there isn't anything especially wrong with it.
391	1	a	Waves is a game very much in the same mold as Geometry Wars: you control a little abstract gun platform and you move and shoot in twin stick fashion with the left stick moving and right stick aiming and shooting. Like most games of this ilk the fun is in the relentless and frenetic action of the unceasing hordes that home in on you and the satisfaction comes from the 'dodging raindrops' finesse you acquire when 'in the zone'. There's even a charging bullet time effect to help you out in a pinch.   As a bonus there's some extra game modes available, but the primary action is the best. There's a trippy electronica soundtrack and a lot of glitzy effects to go with the excellent color palette choices.  My only beef is that there's not an escalating sense of your own lethality which means the climb in intensity levels off and you just continue fending off the frenzy, which while fun can lead to weariness if you're able to pull off a long survival streak. Other than that it's a delight!
3821	1	a	A great turn-based strategy RPG that has the soul of a point-and-click adventure. The costume mechanic is particularly fun.
3893	1	a	i love the atmosphere of this game. story telling is charming. i like the shell shaded art direction. i love the dialogue sometimes, its so witty. i love the world this game is placed in, its a short game, and i wish this game was longer. on the other hand the game battle system is TOO repetitive. VERY simple battle mechanics which is like a double edged sword. every battle in the game is very similar and it gets dull after awhile. dodging attacks is dead simple. as long as you get the timing right, that's all that matters. that is way too simple. but once you get the hang of the battle mechanics, the battles flow in and out of the world map very quickly which i likecontrols on the kb and mouse plain SUCKS, use an xbox controller.the last boss final phase is horribly over powered, they could have designed his moves better instead of a cheap 'wipe out the whole team' move. with all that said, this game was still loads of fun you should chekc it out!
2287	1	a	Great multiplayer game and loads of fun. Really easy to pick up on immediately and the characters personality makes the game shine in terms of story. Wouldn't pay $15 for it, but a total steal for $1.34
2886	1	a	It's a top down steath coop game. Something I would recommend for people who like steath and team work, rather then run and gun action.  each player can choose a class, all ahve their own special ability and running speed. you need to use their ability to get an advantage over obsticals. the game doesn't really allow you to to kill anyone unless you have a gun which you don't get much bullets in them and the only way to get more ammo for guns or anything you have equiped, you have to loot 10 things. Killing is not the objective, but stething and keeping the chaos at a minimum is the theme of the game. You want to be decreat is posible.  This game gets a 5 out of 5 for what it does. It does everything well
1411	1	a	Hey Thats Pretty Go.... Kill Yourself 
3872	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
288	1	a	This game is awesome. It's cheap and so worth it. The game is trippy so don't buy this if you can't handle it. I'm sure I've seizured a few times while playing but I'm so into the game that I don't care. It's a great game and I can't suggest it more if you're looking for a cheap trippy experience.
5240	1	a	This game is too intense for me. Will have to shelve for now.
989	1	a	Same as the first part, this is of the nicer and more interesting hidden objects games out there.
664	1	a	I might like this game too much. I only wish that all of the maps available for the table top version were also available digitally!
69	1	a	Really really nice, though I must confess it is quite short. If you donÂ´t want to feel a bit ripped off buy the sequel LuminoCity instead which takes much longer to play through. Okay for reduced price though :)
1033	1	a	hilarious game similar to happy wheels except you deliver stuffed animals.... the ones that dont fall out of your truck anyway
4171	1	a	This scratches too many itches to list.
1793	1	a	Tons of fun with four people. Good controls, good AI and just a great game overall.
4325	1	a	Pretty fun game - buy it if it's on sale. Like now.
896	0	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am I playing?
1615	1	a	SOMEONE GET THIS GAME SO I CAN PLAY WITH YOU  -coughs R3D and Pie and Mio-
4189	1	a	Great puzzle, maybe my favourite, always return to it, but there's a problem with multiplayer.
5007	1	a	Funny, challenging, compelling. An extremely worthy successor to Portal!
4313	1	a	This game is just weird. You are some weird thing that obsorb things smaller than you such that you can grow bigger and obsorb even bigger objects. It's a shame the game is so extreme short (2-3 to ace all levels) since it's actually a decent fun game.
617	1	a	Thanks to Will Wheaton's 'Tabletop' I found out about this game about a month before it was available online. It looked like fun but I was a bit skeptical at first. Turns out this little thing is oodles of fun and then some! All the twists and turns, risking taking on new destinations or playing it safe and just trying for the longest route. It's a great game to play with friends, even more so, I think, onlne, because you can scream at the screen, make faces, and nobody will really know how â¥â¥â¥â¥ your hand is or if you're plotting to block somebody's way :)
767	1	a	I like that the game is strategic but has an element of chance.
4941	1	a	Jumping from one dimension to another to exploit the laws of physics has never been so fun. The mad professor Q (voiced by the same guys as Star Trek's Q) is no match for GLaDOS and Wheatley, but adds much fun to the whole experience anyway.
3984	1	a	I am new to gaming, and I kind of suck at it. I received South Park SoT for PC as a gift, and really enjoyed it, and am now hooked on games. What awesome stress release! I needed a game that was fun to play and attainable for a newbie. This one does the trick. I was able to beat the game and had fun with it too, plus, it helped me gain controller skills. It would be a great game for a kid who is starting into games, or even an adult (of which I am one). I really enjoyed the turn-based combat style that is like South Park, but it wasn't TOO easy. The bosses are challenging, but not impossible. I purchased this game as a package with the 2nd game, and have moved on to that one now. Highly recommend!
755	1	a	Pretty snazzy version of the board game. Only beef with it is no local multiplayer, but given the hiding-your-hand mechanic I can see why not. The map DLC is also still cheaper than buying actual tabletop Ticket to Ride expansions, so unless you would be making your own new boards (which I don't think can happen in this version) you're still probably saving a bit of scratch.  I like the pink train the best. Matches my skin tone better'n any other.
950	1	a	As far as HOG games go, this one is alright.  I was pleasantly surprised with the âzoomable and/or scrollable screenâ that you can get in some scenes, I thought it was something I don't find very often in this game type, it definitely makes the game a bit more challenging, and the scenes really are cram packed so it takes a good looking around. There are some HOG games you just glance at the list, glance at the scene and find things straight away because itâs been poorly edited into the picture or is just plain obvious, this definitely isn't like that, the scenes look decent. Only fault in that department I would say is when you scroll along, edited items skip and jitter a bit so itâs easier to find objects put into the photo. The music is alright; itâs not repetitive and mind numbing like some soundtracks i have heard alongside a game like this. also, all different HOG games have different waysâ¦ or âexcusesâ rather as to why you are searching around in a cluttered room âcleaning upâ, and this game really is quite cheesy with that, a popular one as most fans of this genre would know is that you are doing âdetective workâ, in this, you quite literally are just everyoneâs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, âI'm a lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥ hotel owner, clean up for me will yaâ kind of thing, I found that a bit of 'utter cheese' to be honest. Alongside that the story is really short, at first it took me a while to get into it, I wasnât too bothered, then it started picking up, I became interested in what was going on and it just ended. Although it did end on a âto be continuedâ¦â it wasnât all that satisfying in terms of length and storyline. I would say itâs decent, it may be worth a go if you are bored and missing the genre which was the case for me when I started it. Unless you are planning to play the next one straight after it, (which I havenât played yet) just be prepared for a short game.
2707	1	a	Ridiclously fun! 10/10
1683	1	a	Brilliant fun to play in coop with a friend and seems like there's a lot of content in the game. The various different characters make it very interesting and add some replayability. The music is great and adds up to the atmosphere. It's also great how you can choose your play style; be it stealth, guns blazin' or something in between.
1229	1	a	This game is simple and to the point, you're a penguin throwing snowballs at other penguins in the attempt to knock them off the ice. While simple, it's quite fun and I could imagine kids would find some enjoyment in playing it. I bought it with 4 other games in a pack for Â£1.09, I can't really fault it at that price.
1942	1	a	This game is so good I became a thief.
681	1	a	In the words of a friend, it's like Mario Party with trains.  MARIO PARTY. WITH TRAINS.
309	1	a	Totally scratches that twin stick, top down shooter itch on PC. Highly addictive. Great soundtrack.
3689	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those rare games that you get out of a $1 bundle and just kind of forget about. It's one of those surprise delights that you didn't know you had in your library. Such is Double Fine's track record with game's. But it's Halloween and nothing gets you in the mood for Halloween better then some good ole fashioned trick or treating.  Costume Quest is very under-rated in my opinion. At first glance it's a childrens game. A simple, brainless game created for the young one's. That's where you're missing out. The game is incredibly fun. You get to go door to door trick-or-treating, collect candy, collect costumes and it doesn't matter what costume you wear, it's up to you! You want to be a pirate? Sure! You want to be a ninja? Why not? Throw in the statue of liberty and you got yourself a team! All while completing quests, collecting cards and finding yourself oddly intrigued in a somewhat predictable story.   If you like games like South Park: The Stick of Truth and don't mind a much more toned down sense of humor, give this game a try. You won't regret it.
1745	1	a	Find yourself a handful of wired x-box controllers, and this thing is a blast. We'll get 4 roommates together on the same PC, grab some gold, blow away the guards, run, yell at each other, and generally have a good time. Honestly, the more people you have to play with, the better the game gets.   A good time to be had by all.
178	1	a	This is a game I bought in conjunction with Super Hexagon, try see that critic one. Nevermind that, though. This game, actually, just really, like a game where you just do it without any storyline to come up, arcade games, of course. Upon trying, I can't really think if I write a critic, it would be Recommend or not. But suddenly today, day I write striked me up with recommend. One thing is due to its brain usage, where you can keep playing all other days when you think you're good enough. Maybe you could be good enough to not die. Try it yourself.
4010	1	a	This is one of my favourite games since joining steam.
3658	1	a	Wonderfully charming and addictive. A pleasant game for completionists too.
2876	1	a	great game, really fun, but especially in multiplayer. Recommended!!
3888	1	a	Just an afterthought when I bought the Double Fine bundle, but turned out to be an awesome game. Simple, not that difficult, but is just plain fun. Kind of makes you want to be a kid again when all you needed was an imagination.
3551	0	a	Here is another beauty that I got thanks to that Double Fine humble bundle. Every time I start thinking of going back to console gaming these bundles and steam sales just drag me right back in the glorious world of PC gaming and the silly and serious experiences it has to offer.  Costume Quest is a game that I read and saw a decent amount of before I played it from the various videogame news sites that I follow. As a result I went into the game with a certain amount of expectations which were not entirely met if I am being honest.  Costume Quest is a pretty mediocre game. Its definitely not bad, but its not that good either. If you are hoping to find a game that can be used as an eight to ten hour distraction then you should be fine getting Costume Quest. If you want something that is more than a distraction then you need to look elsewhere. Because while this game has a lot of charm, its very superficial in some major parts of its design leaving the experience of playing this game feeling boring and repetitive in more than one instance. This is something I feel pretty strongly about, to that point that I'm not looking forward to the sequel that Double Fine recently announced. Unless there are some major changes being made to the gameplay aspect of the game which I don't think is going to happen to be honest.  If you feel like reading a more detailed review you can find it here:  http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/costume-quest.html .
1572	1	a	This is a really good and addictive game
1349	1	a	Highly recommended
201	1	a	If you like twin stick shooters this game is a must buy. It's my favorite TSS (I use KB &amp; Mouse) that I've played. I enjoyed it more than the PS3's Super Stardust. It's very addicting! Get it!
4961	1	a	Cute gameâfor a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
5004	1	a	Its kind of like Portal but not. Anyway its good.
3397	1	a	The Paradox's review on:  Costume Quest   NOTICE: Verdict on bottom of this review.   My quick notes to the devs  Where to start... first, I must say that I got this game by a coupon and stumbled apon it quite randomly.   I MUST   say that this game is   AMAZING!
4564	1	a	Cool Game for many hours of Fun !!!
172	1	a	I found the game very intriging, after a couple of minutes I had to stop playing as I became a bit addicted. I don't recomend this game for people whom are easily addicted to games and have things to do, but if you don't have anything to do and you have anything to do, then by all means do it.
1507	1	a	Monaco - 'It's pretty good'
1898	1	a	Great and fun co-op game.
2221	1	a	I am gonna start by saying that I love heist games and this happens to be a 2D heist game. It has some advanced scripting, multiplayer is flawless and simple, and the controls are easy. The AI is not bad, it was challenging sneaking around guards and it gives you options on how to perform the heists you do. The graphics get a 5/5 (for 2D graphics), the gameplay is a solid 4/5, and the story is a 3.5/5. Overall this game is good and I recommend it and especially for the price that got it at. (Which was about $1.50)
3873	1	a	Trick or treating is now at your fingertips year round in Costume Quest! This absolutely adorable games leads you on an adventure to save your sibling from monsters. Collect gross treats, buy powerups with candy, and change out your team's costumes for special abilities.   However, there are faults. The game does get tediously repetitive after about an hour in. With about four different areas, you are performing the same side quests every time and battling similar monsters in a different arena. With the amount of constant battling, I wish combat would be a bit more interesting but unfortunately it just got painfully boring after a while and became a chore. The only redeeming factor of battles is the cutscenes when performing a special ability relative to the costumes your team is wearing. The design of costumes in battle was really well done and unique. Gaining new costumes to see in game was the only thing keeping me going after about 5 battles.   All the faults and boredom aside, it's still a cute and fun game that's definitely worth the sale price! I wouldn't buy it at its full price but it is festive fun nonetheless for all ages.
2134	1	a	Really fun co-op  
3963	1	a	I loved the game. A bit repetetive but really well made and funny :)
5238	1	a	An avian puzzle platformer with a fierce dedication to minimalism, Toki Tori 2 is the quest to save your island home from corruption and make it safe for all chickenkind. It's filled to the brim with puzzles that run from satisfyingly simple to mindbendingly complex, all wrapped in a saccharinely-sweet exterior that will charm you as it absorbs you for many hours. Go anywhere and discover the game's challenges in any order you choose as you sing and stomp your way through a tightly designed journey of bubble riding, photo taking and frog crushing.
2457	1	a	Its good fun with friends for the price you pay
4104	0	a	I give this game a 5 out of 10. It is a good game, fun, interesting, etc. HOWEVER, it would be a great game if the AI did not cheat so much.  It cheats....BLATANTLY... and it is very annoying. So much so that I am almost ready to just not play it again. I understand that some players need the AI to cheat because it is the only way to challenge them.  I don't play for a challenge, I play games to relax and unwind. I DO NOT LIKE TO BE FRUSTRATED OR ANGRY FROM THE GAME.  However, this game cheats so much, so often, and in such obvious ways it really makes you upset when you are playing the game.  Get it on sale, do not pay more than $2 for this game. It is fun, but it is broken.
388	1	a	A lightshow of a twinstick shooter, set within a round arena, The game typically plays like Geometry Wars, but takes the best from all the Geometry Wars clones over the years and even the bomb chainreaction gameplay from Every Extend and multipliers when you destroy multiple enemies with one shot. There's also a slow mo feature which you have to keep full to use, again, by destroying more enemies in sucession.   The game has it's own flashy 3D style, a very short soundtrack and multiple game modes. There isn't any real incentive to play this game but beating scores and no real level progression, just one arena until you lose all lives/time, unless you play the other modes.  A pretty damn good twinstick shooter. Squid in a box is one to look out for.
1160	0	a	Its a horibol game not fun game play so just buy a better game
2915	1	a	Get during flash sale. Play with friends.
2529	1	a	'Oops, the guard saw me.' 'Uh I may have just ran through a laser.' 'Someone revive me, dammit.'   Play this game with friends you will get so mad at them, you'll love it.
3071	1	a	High quality fun
911	1	a	A great implementation of the Memoir '44 boardgame; great tactical wargaming and controls. Lots of fun and a good community of players. Two drawbacks: 1) I'm in two minds about how frustrating the touch move implementation for some actions can be. 2) The pay to play model is a bit limiting and although I'm planning to buy some credits beyond the free allocation some form of monthly stipend or one or two more free maps would be nice.
1691	1	a	Great game with amazing stealth mechanics
1730	1	a	A joy to play alone and ONE OF THE BEST MULTIPLAYER GAMES!!  Really nice and original! 8/10
3126	1	a	I recommend this game for everyone it's a funny game and multiplayer one to so i hope most of you start to play this game ninja out
3627	1	a	The only game I have ever played that is Pure Halloween so it was Made for me ^.^ Best holiday ever!! Played the game and beat it, it is a Great game and I can't wait till Costume Quest 2, it has a lot of re-play for me, I mean who doesn't adore Halloween? (If you don't you are soul-less!) I gotta give this a 9.8/10 cause it was to short but other then that it was GREAT! &lt;3 Costume Quest
1051	1	a	I click on the Tab 'MORE' and all was for FREE :D
4640	1	a	This is an excellent physics/puzzle game, but not as fun as the first one or the 'elements' one. For me, two dlc don't work and a few other levels are bugged and the devs don't seem to care. But it's still worth the price (i bought the complete pack in discount and played for more than 92 hours with all these crazy machines games)
1320	1	a	I don't know what this game is, or how I came to own it, or why it was installed on my harddrive. I found another friend who also owned it without any memory of purchasing it, and from this I can assume that it is an ancient and horrible curse, spread through the digital platform known as Steam. What initially appears to be a cuddly FPS version of the snowball battling minigame from Mario Party is actually a creation hiding a terrible evil.

2834	1	a	If you can find three friends, or even one, this game can be a perfect match for you! its just one of those games that is fun for everyone!
2901	1	a	A fun little stealth game. Horrible with singleplayer, but amazing with friends. It's entertaining to say the least.
4088	1	a	awesome mix of puzzle and RPG. storyline is good. reccomend if u like games like candy crush and final fantasy, this is a best of both worlds.
239	1	a	Nice Cool and Awesome Game looks just like Sci-Fi :D
3697	1	a	10/10 GOTY. The campaign plays out simmilar to that of a classic Final Fantasy game but better, with dank unlockable costumes like the Statue of Liberty and Robots. With the turn based battle system Its great to get people interested in bigger turnbased stratergy gaming.
1631	1	a	Sneak is for the weak. 9/11 would blast through the level with rocket launchers again
4393	1	a	Think katamari, but the controls are usable and make sense.
794	1	a	A great adaptation of a fun board game to computer, and which comes with the added benefit of being decent fun when you don't have anyone to play it with.  Most of the pluses of course come from the well designed nature of the underlying board game it is based off. Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.  From this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?
376	1	a	this game is cool :3
5163	0	a	Horribale Never Get it I want MY $$$$ BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!
2209	1	a	This game I bought blind, only knew that it was about stealing, one of the best games I bought this year, Id Highly recommend it, its just super really fun, And I want to learn to make my own maps on it!
4676	1	a	It is a very fun puzzle game. TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT!
774	1	a	Pretty fun game.   I figured 'eh, i'll try one game.' Surprisingly, it pulled me back in for 2 more.   Surprisingly enjoyable.
3830	1	a	Surprisingly Fun! It has a paper mario turn base feel for the battle, and a different feel than your average game!
1945	1	a	You can actually pee in toilets.  11/10.
1399	1	a	10/10 best penguin shooter out there
3936	1	a	A fun halloween tradition.  Costume Quest is a short RPG that is a bit over 5 hours. Its fun and interesting. I highly recomend giving it a playthrough during the halloween season. &lt;3
1629	1	a	It's a good game when you have smart friends
4782	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a fantastic puzzle game with equally fantastic writing and humor. If you enjoy the Portal series or other similar puzzle games, I would strongly encourage you to give this game a shot.
3695	1	a	
2203	1	a	If you like heist and 2d downview killing fun then this is the game for you basically payday 2 meets hotline miami!
1460	0	a	i was so excited to play this game  waited days to get a steam card  the day came  i purchased this beautiful game  no one was playing it  my life is ruined 
3490	1	a	A fun game to play around Halloween, or if you're in a Halloween mood. It's an RPG of sorts, but much simpler and straight-forward than most others.  This is one of those games that I got from the Humble Double Fine Bundle a while back, which is still one of my favorite Humble Bundles that I've purchased.  7.8/10 Try it out if you'd like; it's a fun RPG.
3061	1	a	AWESOME GOT IT FROM STEAM FAMLIY SHARING SOOOOOOOOO GOOD

2604	1	a	Yes it is fun to the max
542	1	a	Amazing fun game with friends. Would definately recommend, and would say that you'll get hours of fun out of it!
7	0	a	I genuinely feel bad about this review. I don't recommend this game, and yet, I do. I did not particularly love my time with this game, but I have family members who would. Its charms were fairly lost on me, but I have no problem imagining that others would be completely absorbed.  The reason for my conflicting emotions is that this game does not have any specific failings. It is enormously adorable, has a great visual style, pretty tight controls (including controller support), a charmingly cute soundtrack, and simple level design / gameplay.  The only real problem is that it is not captivating at all. It is spectacularly simple, and fairly repetitive. I could have kept playing without really forcing myself, but I also would have been just as happy to stop playing and turn on an old rerun of Top Gear.  So, I'm torn. Do I review a game for how I could see others taking its charms? Or, rather, do I review a game with my own personal opinion of it? I tend to lean more towards the personal aspect of reviews, so that's why I chose not to recommend it.  It's not that I think it's stupid. It is cute, it is easy to play, and it is incredibly cheap. If you have a young child in the house, they will probably love this game. In fact, I will be recommending this to my father, since he loves buying games for my nephews to play when they visit. I tend to like my sidescrollers with a bit more substance, however. Give me Cave Story+, Chasm, Guacamelee, or any 2D Castlevania any day of the week.  Take this all with a grain of salt, of course. If the video in the game store looks interesting to you, give it a try. You have only $5 to lose, and you can barely buy a burrito for that much any more.
4266	1	a	Let's get this part out of the way - The Wonderful End of the World is a blatant copy of Katamari Damacy, and not a great copy at that. The items of the world are low-res and wildly different in style from each other, as though someone just cleaned out a free directory of 3D models and jammed them all into a game together. That being said, it's hard to do Katamari Damacy wrong, and this game is a lot of fun for the two hours it will take you to master it and get every achievement.
746	1	a	This game is amazing. There needs to be more games on here like this for all systems.
4112	1	a	Great oldschool RPG Puzzle game. Time waster
177	1	a	An excellent game. It doesn't do much but what it does, it does right. It's a great time waster and for 2â¬, i'd say it's a very fair deal.
2432	1	a	6/10-A great experience but get it in a sale
3079	1	a	Great co-op and strategy game! Doing the levels on your own is equally rewarding, but harder. Best to play with friends you're in the same room with. &lt;3
305	1	a	'Connection lost!' has become one of my least favorite phrases! Great game though...tons of different play modes. Easy to learn, hard to master. Challenging and addicting, for me anyway. Enjoy!
4109	1	a	This will ruin Bejeweled for you forever.
1330	1	a	Most MLG Club Penguin Simulator I've ever played.  10/10 GOTY
2293	1	a	Man do I love this game. Like a murderous French femme fatale/magnificent scoundrel stealth version of Pac-man, with pixelated guns and guts, seduction and betrayal (i.e. co-op play). Gameplay is fun and even full-blown team wipe losses are entertaining. The more advanced levels suffer from elite multiplayer syndrome--forget about finishing with random teammates without coordination.  Someday I'll know the levels well enough to respectably finish the higher levels. Future Retired Me will have time to learn all the guard walking patterns, by which point I hope to still have the vision, reflexes, and backwards compatibility to play the game. You younguns should take advantage of the Matrix and play it now!
3755	1	a	I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.  The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.  Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!
3088	1	a	Played for a few hours and its already pretty fun! When I get more time definitely gonna put more hours in!
2578	1	a	This is pretty fun on multiplayer!
1495	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made ever. I prefer to play it naked.  I've replayed this game multiple times. Each time more naked than the last.
3251	1	a	This is fun and small brain puzzle game. if you like brain puzzles with simple idea this is for you.
4630	0	a	It's bad.
3469	1	a	Ooh ooh We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand    
1416	0	a	Some grotesque wormquestish penguin game, fun excluded.
1098	0	a	Just another port from a free mobile game. Way too simple to enjoy for longer than 20 minutes. It used to have an offensive gimmick when it was called Smuggle Truck, and you were smuggling Mexicans. Now it's even worse.
737	1	a	Nice game, although I like the board game better.
3827	1	a	If you crazy kids like Halloween and RPG games, then this would be a great game to pick up and play in a breeze! You can't go wrong with Double Fine either, since they're the indie company behind Psychonauts. This is also a good game to play if you want to experience what an RPG is like upon a smooth and easy-to-play surface for all ages!
519	0	a	Used to be a good game. Then they revamped, added more DLC, and added pop-up ads in the game. Are you serious?
3127	1	a	IS COOL AMAZING MUSIC OMG
3309	0	a	Costume Quest isn't a bad game. But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.  The thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.  Apart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.  But it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.  The game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.  [After a bunch of 'unhelpful' ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]
5530	1	a	Mix space invaders and galaga with moderna graphics (pixelated, yes, but watch closely) and playability and you get this addictive game
396	1	a	One of the best Twin-stick shooters I've ever played. Slow-mo, decent visuals and effects and a pumping soundtrack makes this a must-have for fans of the genre!
170	1	a	This game is really fun. I enjoy the music and the way the game is played. Challenging yet chill puzzle game. Worth every penny.
695	1	a	Well, if you've ever played the board game, then you will certainly enjoy this game. This game is a nice relaxing way to pass time. Even though you don't need to be an expert to do well, the more you play, the better your strategy will become.
5483	1	a	Really takes people back to the days where you would go to an arcade and play games like Space invaders. really awsome game.
5485	1	a	Lovely game, What a lovely game! :)
2735	1	a	A great co-op game that is a lot of fun. Also has great music
4108	0	a	In the beginning, the game feels like a rather fresh and interesting take on a simple puzzle game, inserting RPG systems and a story into it. You might have fun with that. But then it keeps going. And going. And going.  Then the game tells you to collect a dozen mcGuffins to progress further in its story, probably getting a laugh out of you because you think the developers are joking, and a character will reveal that they've already collected most of them.  They are not. And they won't.  Even if you decide to play this game, drop it and don't force yourself to finish it once it becomes repetitive.
941	1	a	This is bejeweled meets Final Fantasy style, semi turn-based combat. It starts off casual enough, but a few levels later the surprisingly deep and innovative combat system begins to shine. Add the delightful graphics and animation into the mix, this game is well worth the price.
1328	1	a	I have no idea why I even have this game. It's just so stupid.
4516	1	a	Simple yet so fun! Only downside is that there should be an...'proactive' mode, where the plants grow super super fast.
4456	0	a	This is probably the worse Luxor game out of the seven Luxor games available on steam. The Egyptian theme is very well done, but everything else feels very unoriginal and bland. I find the power-ups that do drop in Luxor to be very unsatisfactory and lacking in excitement. The map design appears to be rehashed continuously throughout the estimated ~8 hour play through. The music also doesnât change; I just end up muting the game completely and listen to my own music collection while playing Luxor. If you are a hardcore Zuma fan you may find some redeeming qualities in this game, but to be quite honest I would much rather play Zuma or the superior Luxor known as Luxor Evolved. For everyone else that is not really a fan of this genre and game type; just go buy Luxor Evolved and Zuma.
2294	1	a	This is easily one of the best games I've played. And, I've played lots!  There really is something magical about it.  Don't hesitate to give this your money and your time.
1847	1	a	It's definitely something that you can play, be challenged by, but also feel like you're clever enough to beat it. Thankfully online multiplayer is friendly and cooperative, though maybe that's because you can't complete the levels unless everyone is alive. Definitely fun when playing with friends, but also rewarding when playing alone, either in the normal mode or zombie mode. Worth the money at any price.
5261	1	a	This game is as good as pie shoved down my throat into my stomach. 0/7.
5226	1	a	Great little game, not much to say. I recommend
4194	1	a	What an amazing title! After playing this I want it for my PSP and 3DS. I was blown away by what this is. I recommend looking up a lets play or something like that if you are curious. It is basically a cross of a match 3 game, anime/manga, and an rpg. It is fun as hell and I completely reccomend it. ~PR0XIDIAN
2984	1	a	Fantastic both when it comes to graphic style and sound. Very interesting and demanding gamplay which requires strict cooperation. Highly recommending it to everyone!
4831	1	a	Not as stellar as Portal, but fun and worth the price. Great soundtrack!
1497	1	a	  Hours of multiplayer fun
5305	1	a	This game is refreshingly different. It's nostalgic in its style and platform difficulty.
2761	1	a	Game built perfectly for co-op leading to some really fun situations as carefully made plans fall apart. Fantastic audio and visuals.
2455	1	a	This game is insanely fun as, especially when playing with friends, as you try to escape Monaco with all the money trophism and without being seen (hopefully).  Overall, Monaco offers a great experience!
1261	1	a	Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is an action packed first person shooter that deals tastefully with a lot of complex social issues, namely climate change. Don't let the deep mechanics and thrilling combat system distract you from the intelligence of this masterpiece; this game's maticulous crafting and stunning beauty, evident in its mesemerising map design and sound design, makes the roof of the Sistine chapel look like one of Ringo Starr's MS Paint drawings. This game was also far ahead of its time, and despite its age it has grown with grace and is still as relevant and impressive as it was when it was first released. For these reasons, I heartily recommend Penguins Arena: Sedna's World as it is unarguably one of the best games to be released this decade.
4236	1	a	WEOTW is a very simple game at the core but the above average presentation (the music overall is great) plus the pure arcade goodness of the gameplay shine through and make it a fine diversion for a few hours if you got some spare change in the old steam wallet.  I would have been disappointed paying full price but as part of the dejobaan package or itself on sale itâs a nice acquisition if the idea of accumulating mass by absorbing items until you eat up the whole level itself sounds fun.   There are 2 levels that are troublesome due to collision issues but once you get the hang of them there are optimal routes you can take so thatâs not an issue (you can get stuck between tables or if you go under a surface you can end up getting stuck due to increasing your size while under it for example).  The levels are diverse and some are quite clever. It's a simple fun romp while it lasts.
4165	1	a	Unfairly good formula. Makes bejeweled even more addictive.
411	1	a	Pretty and manic, it's essentially Geometry Wars with a slow-motion button, but that's not a bad thing.
655	1	a	What Make me like it????????????The trains because i think I moved to a place in US by train! LOL
915	1	a	Re-write history to stop Fegelein from taking over the Reich.
2038	1	a	Its bloody expensive I had to freaking sell my house to but this crap ...omg please don't buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ ...I beg you don't make the mistake I made...but I recommed it
5208	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ isn't just one of the cutest games, but also an expertly crafted puzzle game. The satisfaction of discovering its secrets is immense. I've seen it mentioned as a metroidvania, but you could call it that only in the slightest sense. Central to the game is a beautifully rendered island in which you manipulate creatures and your environment in order to progress through puzzles that don't look like puzzles. The latter really makes it feel more like a beautiful exploration platformer, with an art-style and -direction that tell you that this game was a labor of love.
1646	1	a	This game is fun and interesting
4331	0	a	'Hey, this game is just like Katamari Damacy! I'ma buy it!'  Yeah..... No it isn't.  It plays like Katamari Damacy, but it lacks so many of the essential game mechanics that makes K.D. a good game.  Lack luster gameplay: Check Dissapointing level design: Check Very small levels: Check Very short levels: Check The length of an actual game: Nope...  Do not buy this game...  Period.
1589	1	a	4/5 More fun than a boat full of criminals.  Monaco is a hide and stealth type heist game. There are 8 characters to choose from, all with their own skills. You spend your time sneaking around guards, hacking computers, opening vaults and stealing assets.  Fun story, Lots of levels! you can even make your own and upload them for others to play.  Single player is challanging and fun. Multi-player can range from 'Epic' to 'All hell has broken loose'. If you buy the game, you have to try multi-player at least once. It is so much fun, and has a great voice chat system. There is a Zombie mode as well...  Monaco is one of those games I would buy for all of my friends to enjoy.
672	1	a	Board game without the tons and tons of parts. Awesome! Also, great game in general. Get it.
3712	1	a	Costume Quest: 7/10  Whilst it feels like a chore, CQ can be enjoyable if you have the patience for it's repetition and 20fps.  DLC: 2/10  Literally nothing new and a really unintuitive end battle (insta-kill attacks much?).
1487	1	a	 Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine Review
5418	1	a	Perfect time waster, old mechanics injected with new content. Very well executed.
3080	1	a	Great game! Just turn off the stressful piano music and play your own instead, and the experience will be loads better.
539	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a faithul adaptation of the award-winning german-style board game of the same name. It's very easy to learn and matches last just the right time. The presentation is a bit lacking though and some of the social experience is lost on translation from tabletop to computer screen but still it's one of those games I believe anyone should try. Get the DLC boards too, they add a nice measure of variety.
4328	1	a	Lets be honest. It's a Katamari Damancy knock-off. And the voice acting's not that good. And it's not as good at Katamari. However, it's chaper than Katamari, and if you're out of new Katamari games to play, Wonderful End of the World can help sate your appetite.
5429	1	a	Surprised me a lot, fun as hell and the music is very nice too. +1
811	1	a	this is an awsome game
5252	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Toki Tori 2+. Although admittedly it took a little bit to start appreciating the game. This is primarily due to the lack of instructions or direction provided by the game. There are no tutorials, no dialog, nothing. What the game does do to help the player is provide subtle hints, that I personally missed at first. For example, always pay attention to the little white bird. He will show you how to get to certain areas and even show you song melodies that you can play to do certain things (e.g. fast travel, restart, point out collectibles). Although this lack of direction made starting out a little tough, I ended up appreciating it later on.  What I really enjoyed about the game is how it takes such a simple concept and is able to make complex puzzles. Throughout the entire game, you can only move (not jump), stomp the ground, and make tweeting sounds. You must use these abilities to interact with different animals and objects in order to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the game, you have the ability to get to any area. The only thing you might be lacking is the knowledge of how to get past certain points. Again, the game does not tell you how to do things with dialog boxes, instead it subtly shows you, through gameplay, how to use your stomping and tweeting to progress through the level.  I strongly suggest checking out this  video walkthrough  for when you get stuck, and you most certainly will. You may have to hunt through the videos to find where he covers the section you are stuck on, but it is definitely worth it as he shows how to unlock all of the achievements and shows some stuff that I would not have been able to figure out on my own.  Another helpful tip is that the rewind song, which is:   (tweet these notes) short short long long  , can be played multiple times to jump back to previous checkpoints.
5413	1	a	Space Invaders as it should be. Great design. Mindless, emjoyable. Well done.
3165	1	a	Not a bad physics game, I put 2 hours into it, but never finished it. You put the colored balls into the colored pots using gravity, traps, and physics.  Later the game becomes more difficult and requires a good chunk of luck. At some point I moved on and played other games.  I could however see that someone could totally dig this game. What I did play was quite fun, but also upsetting.
355	1	a	This shoot 'em up game offers a few different modes to keep you entertained and techno music to keep your mood u. Can I just say I LOVE the smell of exploding geometry?
272	1	a	amazing :) this is a must have game
2123	1	a	Cute. Never finished. Probably needed multiplayer to fully appreciate it.
3323	1	a	A charming and cartoony JRPG about kids saving Halloween, bogged down by a a battle system where the best three costumes are the first three you get, and where combat boils down to everyone attacking normally for two rounds, suing their special ability on the third, and repeating until the fight's over. There's no real reason to use any of the other costumes because none of them have as good stats or as good special ability as an all area hitting massive nuke with follow up DoT damage, a powerful shield capable of turning hits into 1 or 2 damage, or the only heal in the game that doesn't require the target to be dead first to revive them. The combat system is incredibly repetitive, although active due to needing to do timed button presses. Ultimately, though, literally every fight becomes attack -&gt; attack -&gt; special -&gt; repeat. Battle Stamps, the game's only equipment, don't alleviate this issue at all - some of the stamps offer side abilities that Stun or Slow enemies, but you're still doing the same attack/attack/spell trio the entire game.  I'm giving the game a positive recommendation because the repetitive and dull combat system ultimately wasn't enough to dissuade me from completing the (relatively short: 4-6 hours) game. It's still fun running around, collecting candy, and trick or treating, and seeing what the costumes look like in fights. If the game was any longer, the combat system would start to do real damage, but thanks to how short it is, it's not that big a deal.
482	1	a	Played about 3 hours of this game, girlfriend played the other 208.  Lot of free time! 10/10
1874	1	a	Monaco: What's yours is mine , is one of those games I don't want to play, because I'm afraid I'll finish it. Luckily it has Steam workshop, so there's no fear of that anymore. :=)
2599	1	a	it is a fun game
184	1	a	Very neat casual game, good for mindlessly passing the time, if you are like me.  Only thing I've had wrong is that the game is a bit buggy. It has crashed on me a couple times and constantly goes offline for some reason. And the other thing is that the cube is difficult to control - I have misplaced blocks many times which is annoying, but I guess it's okay since the game is so random anyway.
1650	1	a	100% Worth the money
1355	1	a	This is great game!!!!
1220	1	a	Being Penguins split up in up to four groups, throwing snowballs and Fish at each other trying to push the other Penguins off the island, is what this arena battle game is about. If you like cute looking games, Winter and Penguins, this game is made for you. And it's fun!  You get to play on different stages, some more unique than others. One stage even have environmental changes like the latest Battlefield games, and the game's graphics are on the same level as the latest Call of Duty games. Penguin's Arena got powerups, making you invinsible for seconds, making you stick to the ground, throwing Fish dynamite and throwing Fish, that can be thrown faster than the default snowballs.  You can customize your Penguins as you like them, giving them a silly hat and pretty clothing to wear. It's really cute. Who doesn't want a Penguin with Bunny ears wearing a ballerina skirt? Right, no one!  I have fun playing this game. But sadly it's currently bundled with other games, making it pretty expensive to buy. But if you see it cheap, that's the way you want to get this game.
4991	1	a	A phew hours well spent.
1751	1	a	Siz geme is so funny.
3913	1	a	Short, fun little RPG. pretty similar to Mario RPG. Though the last boss is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ compared to the entire game up to that point.
3208	1	a	I really recommend it. I liked it so much, not the game what i play every day. But still worth it's price. Completely
4877	1	a	I love physics games and I love puzzle games. Quantum Conundrum achieves both of these areas spectacularly with beautifully created graphics and a comedic storyline. Add to this a pretty awesome soundtrack and you get one of my dream games  Basically, it's a fantastic game and if you're at all a fan of physics games or puzzle games you really should try this out
2933	1	a	Honestly, this game is worth buying. even though it may appear simple, its complexity grows as you progress through the game, and when teaming up with friends, heists become a lot more interesting and interactive. probably one of the best indie-games in my opinion and is quite a refreshing casual game.   10/10
109	1	a	Too many puzzle games rely on complexity--Critical Mass addicts you with absolute simplicity. If you've exercised you hand-eye coordination with FPSs and have a good mind for 3D objects, you'll love this game.
5215	1	a	THIS GAME IS DOPEEEEEE.
656	1	a	Stays in the favorites section of my library and I keep going back to it in favor of the daunting backlog.
1436	0	a	BEST GAME NA. The combat in this game is perfect, its really is the apex of what next gen has to offer. The graphics make bf4 look likes its being run on a toaster using the DayZ engine. The mechanics are 100% polished and make the ARMA II UI like clean. The particle effects of this game even Rival 'Call of Duty: Ghouls '6GB RAM Edition'' and it even trumps the fish AI too. Overall this game is so good, I would reccomend not buying and instead stabbing youself in the eyes a few times and breaking your hands, as you are not worthy of playing it. On a final note the only issue with this is game is it would not uninstall fast enough.
2393	1	a	Fun and cheap, lots of game modes and local coop - what else could you ask for?
1989	1	a	Stealth and Co-op!!?!? 10/10!
2224	1	a	Such game. Many prison break. Very burglar. Wow.
1456	0	a	Cute little game, unfortunately not much here. Its an online game with only 2 total servers, so you'll be lucky to play with 1-2 other ppl. Mechanics are finnicky. Sometimes you'll hit someone and they'll barely move, either times they'll go flying. You'll hit right next to someone with an explosive item and they won't move at all. Sometimes you'll hit someone way off the ice and they'll be able to just fly back down to it. Other times you'll barely go off and you won't be able to go back. Every level is pretty similar and you use the same 2-3 guns with the same 2 powerups. Can get repetitive and take forever.   5/10.
2454	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Super fun heist-y game. Fun to play with friends. The different people that you can play as keeps it interesting. Highly recommend.
3595	1	a	This game is short and sweet, much like my attention span!
5223	1	a	This game is really awesome. It truly has a metroidvania style, with a map connecting all the puzzles. And the controls are simple, since Toki Tori only has 3 actions: movement, chirp and stomp. So, how can this simplicity lead to challenging puzzles? The answer is the environment. There are a lot of creatures and other mechanisms, and each one has unique abilities. You must figure out how to use and combine them to advance. And here lies the beauty of exploring this game. In metro-style games, you advance the map and find blocked areas, because you don't have the gadget or ability yet. Then you keep exploring, find them and backtrack. Here, those zones are always acessible. But you may not know how to progress, so you keep playing and discovering new ways to interact with the environment. And then you backtrack and solve those zones, knowing that it was possible to go there from the beginning. The map may not be huge, but there are lots to do. To beat the story, you need to find 5 special frogs. You can collect all wings to uncover new secrets. And there are hidden zones and achievements. Oh, and the art is amazing too. And the game doesn't feel like some puzzles connected to each other by a map. Here, the total is more than the sum of it's parts. And that makes this game truly special and rewarding to explore.
108	1	a	10-minutes is all that it took for me to get hooked on this game. If you have played Curse of the Monkey Island, you might want to take a look at this. The graphics are surreal. The texture and colour palette, lighting and shadow, and the whole story of how a young protagonist who started off by visiting her grandfather's house spins off into a puzzle game like none other.  It doesn't require a high-end graphics card. It only requires an open mind.
183	1	a	Critical Mass is a fun, simple game.  Its low price and somewhat addictive gameplay make it worth trying out. If you enjoy playing puzzle games, you will enjoy this. 
1954	1	a	A fantastic and fun co-op experience that can lead to absolute hilarity when it all goes wrong. That said, when it all goes right and you get the loot and get out its an immensely satisfying experience, especially as the difficulty ramps up in the later levels.
2435	1	a	Really addicting!
2827	1	a	Excellent game to play with your friends. Definitely worth the buy.
1661	1	a	I was lead to believe this was the sequel to the really great game The Ship due to the picture but it wasn't. Currently exchanging letters with Mr. Newell over a refund.
2502	1	a	At first this game feels very redundant, but you'll feel glad that it is. Each level is absolutely stunning and presents their own challenges. I &lt;3 Hacker
2988	1	a	this game is worth IGN:10/10 i love it so mutch
1166	0	a	'Game of the Year 2006!' - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game  twice , I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a 'game'.
3957	1	a	  Excellent little game had a lot of fun playing it most enjoyable.
3955	1	a	very cute and enjoyable game. exactly the type of quirky fun I've come to expect from double fine. The combat is simple and satisfying, the art style / atmosphere are excellent. There's plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the game that reminds you what it's like to be a kid again and just go trick-or-treating.  and for anyone concerned, i used an xbox controller and the game fully detects / supports it as far as i can tell, i played through the entire game + DLC without a single issue.
2050	1	a	*Pees in a prison toilet* Me: Screw the mission, I'm busy in here m8ts. *Gets kicked*   10/10
3425	1	a	When I first bought this game I'll be honest, I didn't think it was going to be too good. Just bought it on sale beacause it was cheap. However I ended up getting really into the game. It's fun and quirky and really great to play plus I ended up making my personal mission to discover what each costume does.   Nice causal play.
4044	1	a	After finishing my first playthrough, I wanted more! Would've definitely played the sequel if there was one (for real, what a bummer it was to find out the follow up just died in production).  The game has many good points, as long as your expectations are reasonable. The setting and story might seem a little lack-luster, but that's only because it was supposed to be something of a introduction into this world. Still, the plot is juicy enough to keep you invested, and the characters within quite enjoyable. Sometimes you want to interact 'incorrectly' with them just to hear what they say next.  Another plus for me was the difficulty level of the puzzles. Some of them were quite tricky, and I admit to looking up a few pointers online, but not frustrating enough to make me stop playing. There was a genuine sense of satisfaction that I got when figuring things out that triggers even more interesting facts and possible scenarios in the game. Being a detective in this quirky but cool Sci-Fi world is actually fun! Who knew?
4383	1	a	A fun little simple game. It's basically a rip off of Katamari, but with so many 1st person shooter rip offs, its nice to see someone at least try things with this genre. You simply roll up small things, grow bigger, and continue to roll up smaller things. While this game lacks the charm of Katamari, one of my favorite games, it still brings something special. Cheap and fun.
1950	1	a	Fun game, fast action, bright graphics. Classes and abilities aren't explained well, but community guides make up for that.
4281	1	a	It's Katamari Damacy, except the level design isn't as good.
1070	1	a	Literally the first level and they drop the see me rollin' bomb. They got balls, I'll tell you that.
1458	0	a	Oh man... This game is so bad, I guess most of the positive reviews are fakes or trolls. First game, game crashed. Second game, I spawned 'dead' so I couldn't do anything but watch. Third game I finally got to play, and it sucked. There was 2 people in whole world playing this game same time as I, and it only has multiplayer, so it's worthless... Stay away!
3149	1	a	A great game that I would recommend to anyone
575	1	a	If you like board game, then try this game. it's more fun if you play with your friend.
1502	1	a	Extremely satisfying heist game.   It's not exactly a fully stealth game, getting found is not the end of the world, you just need to escape and hide. The gameplay alternates between trying to be stealthy and purposefuly or mistakenly getting discovered while accomplishing some objective.   The coop experience is vastly different than the solo experience. The ideal is to have a group of 4 friends and play together.
4895	1	a	So much win; like being FP in a Saturday morning cartoon. Levels are spacious rooms that make you feel like the kid you're supposed to be playing as, which is a neat touch. Like others have posted, jumping can be a bit off-putting and touchy to time right but there's a rhythm to most of it that's not frustrating to master. A great way to while away a rainy afternoon or two.
3267	1	a	Hey, remember that flash game where you cut the rope to get balls into containers? It's that. It's 150 levels of that. You don't need me to tell you if you want that or not.
3140	1	a	A perfect mix between aracde-style shooting and stealth, Monoco feels like pulling off a master-heist every time.
1296	1	a	I would rate this game.
1923	1	a	very fun, pixelated, fun for online multiplayer or single player. I enjoy this game. There is not many acheivments. It does not take up that much space. It will most likely run on any computer. You do not need friends for this game because you can play alone. there are good discounts for this game so hurry up n get it.   
3108	1	a	  clean out a mission. feel like a boss.
1047	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game that I recommend because: - is only 4 euro - is a method to banish boredom - is a simply game - have trading cards  Enjoy!
3935	1	a	Cute and charming game. Reminds me of Earthbound, Paper Mario, and American holiday-movies. There are some technical issues of framerate-drops and stuttering, but they seem to pass. Also, it's forgivable when the game is such a delight.
2930	1	a	Most fun with friends, awesome game!
43	1	a	Short and sweet. The handmade 'graphics' are beautiful. The puzzles feel fresh. Only significant critique is that it is too short.
773	1	a	Very easy to pick up, not quite as good as say Empire Builder or Rail Baron, but plays much faster, and the AI is good enough to pose a challenge each game.
2319	1	a	Don't try playing this on your own. You need friends to revive you (a lot) and show you where to run (all the time) and save your butt from guards, dogs, lasers and knockout darts (heaps). On the downside they usually insult you as you're struggling to remember which way to run next. I mean the friends insult you, not the guards, the dogs, the lasers or the knockout darts.
4430	1	a	It's ok
3666	1	a	Costume Quest is a pretty damn good game. It has some amazing scenes, the story is pretty nice, and the overall mechanics of the game are really enjoyable. The charactereres are really well designed some can give you a really good laugh the first time you see them. But now we get to the worst part, the gameplay. I was really into the storyline of the game but a part of me didnt want to end it because of the repetitive mechanics it has. The game is pretty much divided in 3 parts and the overall missions of each one are basicaly the same. i only did half of the things i did because i really had to do them in order to complete the story. Overall a good game if you like repetitive games and games were you need to explore every single place in order to get everything but expect a gameplay of around 5/6 hours to fully complete it. And dont forget you can only do one of the achievs on christmas.
5105	1	a	While the game is extremely fun, it appears to be extremely buggy as well. Bugs aside, the game claimed to be completely randomized. The truth of the matter is that the maps are only semi-randomized. Maps are predefined, but clusters of blocks which most can be dug through are randomized.  As far as the bugs are concerned, I have run into 2 that bother me. The first being that pausing the game, actually isn't a full pause; the game will actually progress even when paused, but at a much, much slower rate. The second would be a bug where buildable objects will drop below an item that has been moved just for the purpose of repositioning it (even when paused), right into the same place of the item you just repositioned, making the block where the item dropped from no longer buildable on that wall; this has been enough to make me have to keep restarting the game.
2584	1	a	A fun game that requires some planning and foresight, as one slip up may not necessarily cause justice to be served, but will cause a lot of chaos and take time to get the mission back underway.
4538	1	a	Cute, simple, and entertaining. Not bad if you're looking for something casual or laid back with a small amount of management. I recommend buying it during a sale or just playing the app for free through Googleplay. At the current price, I would say you're probably overpaying. It could use some improvement, but overall I like it and find it mildy amusing; enough to keep revisiting it in my library.
4253	1	a	If you can't play any of the Katamari games then this one will suffice.
3382	1	a	A fun and cute turn-based RPG. The battle system is simple yet effective and fun. So it's the story. It's not very deep ir long, but fun nonetheless.
1	1	a	A great little game that'll be of great joy to anyone who played old-school rail shooters. You're a stalwart human space hero fighting against the evil Skurgian aliens. Blow up enemy spaceships and enjoy alien warlords shaking their fist at the 'pathetic human scum'. Have I made my point yet? Great little game, takes about 45 minutes across nine levels, highly recommend.
358	1	a	great 2 stick shooter
1267	1	a	good decent game but im not recieving my trading cards
3264	1	a	Pleasantly surprised. It sort of like Cut the Rope without the kids graphics. There are lots of puzzles and many are not that easy. Thumbs up!!!
4572	1	a	As a tower defense fan, this is unique and well executed. Only warning is that it's not an easy game. I like it!
1658	1	a	Find yourself a handful of wired x-box controllers, and this thing is a blast. We'll get 4 roommates together on the same PC, grab some gold, blow away the guards, run, yell at each other, and generally have a good time. Honestly, the more people you have to play with, the better the game gets.   A good time to be had by all.
1697	1	a	Crime through teamwork. The only way to do it efficiently and successfully is to work together and use your abilities. Committing crime has never been so much fun (and safe) as it is in Monaco! Unless you die and then you have to be revived by a teammate if that's possible at the time. Nevertheless, this game is definitely worth it and playing online with others as you craft a strategy is even more enjoyable. Monaco FTW! 
2422	1	a	This is an amazing game - the retro feel makes it that much enjoyable with the wide array of characters. Whether playing with friends, or solo, it's a great game all around.
1223	1	a	It's like skyrim with penguins
426	1	a	Very addictive,you really should play this game.
2877	1	a	I've really enjoyed playing Monaco, both with my friends and solo. The diversity of characters and level-dynamics keep levels interesting, and gives the game a fair amount of replay value. This is not a shoot-em-up game. While some characters and items give you the ability to go head to head with guards, Monaco rewards patience and precision as a whole, so be prepared to wait things out and to spend a little bit of time hiding in stairwells and in the ducts. If sneaking, vibrant styling, and quirky character dynamics appeal to you, grab a couple of friends and play a few rounds. You won't be disappointed.
5160	1	a	Dungeon keeper eat your heart out, you cant say it much plainer than that
3699	1	a	A too-easy RPG themed around Halloween. It's very cute and quite short. Fun to play at Halloween time for sure!
4200	1	a	This game has been keeping me entertained for years, and will likely continue for years to come. Think Bejeweled + Combat / RPG elements and a questing system, and you've got a fair idea of what to expect. It is highly addictive and always entertaining.
1892	1	a	8/10
2708	1	a	Requires an amazing amount of teamwork and is challenging ,Worth a try
900	0	a	Can't earn any achievements when playing solo.
3880	1	a	This game is adorable, and if you've got kids, they'd probably love it. The combat isn't very difficult, and the stat building isn't too very important, but significant enough to give you a boost if you pay attention to it. It's a great intro to turn-based combat, and fun enough to hold your interest, even if you're a seasoned vet.
4858	1	a	If you liked Portal and Portal 2, if you like to challenge your physics brain and give yourself the most wonderful headaches. This is the game for you. Puzzles that feel like you have to break the system to get through are commonplace, and I frequently felt like I must be doing it wrong, only to find that it was exactly what was needed to advance. I bought this game for some first person puzzle action, and boy did I get it. Worth it/10
3602	1	a	SO cute and fun to play. I love this game!
4796	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
476	1	a	Very nice board game to play between 2 and 4 people, also supports cross-platform (windows and android).
2341	1	a	Initially I put off playing this one because I figured I knew what it was already. And while my guess wasn't too far off, it didn't account for just how much fun it would be. You get to play as one of a number of different criminal roles (locksmith, mole, lookout, etc.) as you attempt heists, prison breakouts, etc. In a way, it almost feels like a multiplayer version of Bonanza Bros, which not a whole lot of people probably remember. Definitely fun and way more fun when playing multiplayer.
3202	0	a	I got Bluestacks. I play COC and Cut The Rope. No Problem. I buy this game. Install it. When it open. The screen goes white. only hear the music only. K Lucky i spend only around 0.4USD for this game
5118	1	a	This game is great!!!
82	1	a	The first few puzzles are... difficult, but doable. One near the end is 100% grade-A crazypants. Don't feel bad about cheating to get under the sink. :-P
1123	0	a	A simplistic mobile game with awful controls.   PROS: -Graphics are amusing  CONS: -Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...) -Mobile game -Awkward, exaggerated physics  The game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck.   Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The 'Easy' levels were enough for me.
5517	1	a	The game defaults to windowed, but allows your mouse to stray out of the window. This is super annoying. Rest of the game is good, though. Will play again.
2191	1	a	One of the most enjoyable multi-player experience I've had in a long time. The game is unique, fun, and challenging. I would recommend picking it up with a friend and playing through the campaign at least once.
942	1	a	If you like Bejeweled-esque games, and elemental matchup games (water beats fire, but is beaten by air...), this game might be for you! My only reservations in recommending it are the bizarrely sharp difficulty jump from level 49 to level 50, and the really, really poor copyediting. If you're willing to overlook a lot of grammar and spelling errors, though, this game is definitely worth a try!
4798	1	a	This is a fantastic and unique puzzle game. It's challenging, fun, and pretty. It does have some similarities to Portal, but hey, you have to expect that when on of the lead directors of Portal worked on this game. A lot of pop-culture references too.  Overall, a fantastic game. I reccomend it to any lovers of puzzle games, fans of Portal, or anyone just looking for a good, cheap game. (And the TF2 items aren't that bad either, heh heh.)
4245	1	a	Like a slightly worse Katamari Damacy.  ---Pros: Sucking up objects is super fun and satisfying, three modes for each level (including a notime limit mode), lots of unique sets, a nice array of music with variety and generally pretty good.  ---Cons: Gamepad support is implemented badly (using a steam controller fixes it), no graphical objects, noticeably framerate drops, and a camera that is just a little too touchy, resulting in jerky movement.  Overall, the only real problems I have with this game are the technical ones, but just sucking up everything in an enviornment is really fun and enjoyable. It's decent and if you think from the trailer that it looks fun, you should get it on sale.
4835	1	a	Just, awesome. Fun with physics! Throw a safe through the wall, bounce around, fly on a couch. The dimensional shifting is the point, and good part of the game. Amazingly inventive. Also, the commentary. All in all, thumbs up. 11/10.
2079	1	a	What are you doing? Grab three friends and go loot! Some of the most fun I've had in awhile.
2286	1	a	Cool game to play with your friends
1799	1	a	Thrown into a game with no guidance or form of instruction, with up to 4 player co-op this is one of my favorite games for multiplayer shenanigans. Every character is fun and the whole team will benefit from whichever you choose, inventive and original gameplay not seen since the likes of the original Payday. 8/10.
5235	1	a	Very fun games, i bought this game when my girlfriend ask me to buy this game after she watch someone on YouTube play this game!
2318	1	a	Pretty fun if you know what your doing but not if u don't.I like how u can hide and be super sneaky and alot of other crap that would take me a while to list.
2311	1	a	I CANT EVEN TELL WHAT IM LOOKING AT WHILE I PLAY  THIS GAME IS EYE STRAIN SIMULATOR â¥â¥â¥â¥  fun tho
5480	1	a	Great retro game. A hommage to the classic Space Invaders
443	1	a	Disco Just Won't Cut It This Time!!!!!!!!!!
3115	1	a	Great co-op game play, we can't put the controller down to stop playing. The game keeps you interested with increding diffulty and completity. Highly recomend!
185	1	a	I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Geometry Wars. The gameplay and graphics are very similar.  The scoring and combo system took me a while to get used to, but once I did, it was pretty fun.  Perhaps some more effective tutorials would help ease players into the mechanics.  My only real complaint is that gameplay sessions lasted a bit too long. Geometry Wars was fun because the sessions were short, and you always wanted to play 'one more time!'. Here you get a bit too many lives.  But still, a fun experience overall.
1346	1	a	Why have people stoped playing this game???
4738	1	a	A severely underated game that is a ton of fun. It is a relatively short game, but you will treasure every moment of it.
3591	1	a	Warning: contains one of the most precious, adorable sights in the known and unknown space/time and alternate dimensions.
180	1	a	Got some time to kill? Don't want to play something involved? Chill with this game.
3507	1	a	'Costume Quest' is a fun little RPG. It's not terribly complex or difficult, but that's fine with me, since the complex, difficult RPGs are the ones that have been collecting dust while I don't have time to get into them. It doesn't have quite as much humor as Psychonauts, but it does have some, including a number of sly references to other works of fiction. The costumes all have pretty cool battle animations, even some that I didn't expect. There aren't any bad costumes, either. They are all useful in one way or another. It took me about 8 hours to complete the main game, finding everything, and I still have the 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC to play. Highly recommended.
3427	1	a	When I first bought this game I'll be honest, I didn't think it was going to be too good. Just bought it on sale beacause it was cheap. However I ended up getting really into the game. It's fun and quirky and really great to play plus I ended up making my personal mission to discover what each costume does.   Nice causal play.
3604	1	a	I love this game, give it a try, you won't regret it!
2399	1	a	Great game to play with friends
5267	1	a	cute as frick
1342	1	a	A war fuelled solely from racism alone pits up to 4 different colours of penguins against eachother in a fight for dominance over an iceberg that varies from map to map. Not a bad game.
2801	1	a	Simple, effective multiplayer gameplay. The different character types are fun, and working with a friend through some of the more frantic situations can get pretty funny. It also has an awesome piano score to go with your heists. Totally worth the price tag, but on sale it is a steal.
4722	1	a	Funny puzzle game like Portal, but a little bit different :)
3995	1	a	One word to describe the whole game : CUTE  Just finished literally a few minutes ago and I LOVED every second of it. Costume Quest is an adorable game about kids on adventure in their Halloween costumes which give them super powers. This is the dream of every little kid (and grown ups) that ever played make-believe.   Plot : really straight-forward. Team up with the neighborhood kids to save your sibling. A classic good vs evil in a comedic way. Grubbin on Ice is like a mini-sequel or a spin-off and it's highly recommended to play it AFTER the main CQ.  Gameplay : I highly recommend using a controller. I can't imagine the battle sequences using a keyboard and mouse, but if you're comfortable with them then maybe it'll work for you. The walking around was a bit tiresome, but worth it.  Quests : all the quests are really well-thought, and a good way to grind, though   you can't get past level 10 for the main CQ and not past level 14 for GOI  .   Puzzles : it's not as frustrating, as long as you're EXTREMELY thorough in searching and walking around.  Graphic : I love the character designs, the monsters, the battle sequences.. The backgorunds are pretty smooth. I didn't enjoy the dark areas, but I generally don't like dark areas in game anyway so I guess it's a matter of preference.  Sound : it's fun and adds up to the atmosphere of going on an adventure.  Characters : I really like how all the characters have names, even the NPCs (though not the monsters). The enemies are not EVIL evil, and as lovable as the protagonists.  I give this as 10/10. Just need one more achievement to fill but that'll have to wait.. literally..  MOVING ON TO CQ2 !!!
3226	0	a	Game Was 150% and im still waiting for my $2.49
4608	0	a	Quick review:    Short Verdict  : WORKS FINE ON WINDOWS 7 (just download and play it)! Nice gadgets, but physics part falls short. Frustration ends up being so high that this game can't quite let you enjoy all the potential it has.    Pros  :    Interesting set of gadgets to work with    Online community for potentially extended play    A LOT of levels     Cons  :    Physics mechanics suck    No 'retry' button, forcing you to replay a level from scratch if you missed the golden gear objetive by literally misplacing an object by an inch. And will you remember /exactly/ where everything was? No.    Annoying tutorial Einstein    Slightly ugly and not very easy to look and immeadiately understand what's going on. 2D would have been much nicer    Almost no active community  
4724	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. This game in my eyes is just as good as Portal 2. It has great puzzles and a great storyline you will not regreat buying this. 9/10
368	1	a	Twinstick Shootery Fun!
1174	1	a	i like because its a tourtament game.
2968	1	a	Awesome coop game. Gather your friends and steal the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the places. What to say more. Enjoy! ;)
4273	1	a	This game artfully disguises the normal 'apocalyptic' chaos and terror usually associated with the end of the world and transforms it into a cute and fun experience for all ages. Running around various worlds and locations you absorb nearby objects, increasing your scale, and thus allowing you to absorb even bigger objects, and so on. The music is fun and catchy, the graphics are decent but I care far more about gameplay then photorealistic visuals. The gameplay in this game is FANTASTIC. The unique mechanic of abosrbing objects leads to fun running about and seeing more and more of the world unfold before you. Each level is a journey, a very fun and playful journey. If the world were to end, I'd very much like it to end this way. Buy it, buy it now!
4285	1	a	Fun and unique little game to spend a couple hours on. Only a small handful of levels, but they are challenging enough to warrant maybe 4-6 hours of gameplay if you are an achievement hunter. Wouldn't advise anyone to purchase it at full price. Definitely no more than $5, but that's just me. Expect to 'finish' the game in 1-2 hours. At least it will be a relaxing 1-2 hours. :)
1865	1	a	Love it!
4083	1	a	OK, so this one is a true story. When I was younger, I had an affair with a married woman. She was late forties, and I was not yet twenty, and oh, man, was she hot. She made Mrs Robinson look like a hippo and made Marie Curie look like a dowdy housewife. She taught me so much, not just about sex, you understand, but about EVERYTHING. She had such verve, and she wanted it all - nothing stood in her way, and if she wanted something, she just took it. That wasn't even her best feature, that was her insatable curiousity. Once she got into something, she got into it and didn't rest until she worked everything out about it. 'Course I realised I wouldn't have her for long, but that was just about the best time of my life   One thing'll always remind me of her. And yes, it's a sex story. Well she liked to live a little dangerously, let's say. She rarely wore knickers, like, ever and nowhere was too risky for a quick one, shall we say. Anyway, we were shagging in her family home, and her husband was due home in about 10 minutes. Needless to say, we went a bit 'overtime' and we were barely finished when in walks her husband. I was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself of course, but she just purred - and she really purred - 'Doesn't matter, keep going'. Well, what could I do? I kept going.  When we finished I was really wary about how to make a dignifed exit. Turns out, I didn't need to worry. I should have expected it, but her husband was a beaten man. His expression was blank and empty, and his whole posture just seemed to say oh, another affair? Well, I shoulda guessed a perfect tigress like his wife wouldn't settle with just me. I mean, I don't have self-esteem issues, but she was just something else. So as I walked out, head held high thinking I was just really amazing, like I just invested sex and all, and brimming with afterglow and he said some words to me. Words I'll never forget.  He said 'Puzzle Quest is a pretty amazing mash-up of match 3 and RPG, shame we never got the DLC the consoles did though'. And you know what? He was right. But I had just banged his wife, so, y'know, I win.
3915	1	a	If I could title this review, it would be titled 'Fun Sized Fun' You and your twin are trick-or-treating on Halloween when a bunch of goblin-like creatures take your sibling because they can't tell between real candy and a kid wearing a costume. You have to trick or treat to get more candy and fight the creatures. The trick is that when you enter combat, whatever costume you're wearing gives you crazy powers. This isn't a particularly difficult game. I only died a couple of times throughout and that was because I made some boneheaded mistakes. The difficulty doesn't matter though: this is a clever, simple, fun bite-sized RPG that has a chewy nugget of heart at its center. It's a wonderful treat for the Halloween season (and the Holiday season with the included 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC).
3912	1	a	A fun halloween tradition.  Costume Quest is a short RPG that is a bit over 5 hours. Its fun and interesting. I highly recomend giving it a playthrough during the halloween season. &lt;3
3814	1	a	The most hardcore murder simulator out there. Not recommended for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es.
2257	1	a	Even Better than payday
439	1	a	Your basic twin-shooter, well polished. Worth having in your library for when you just want to play something short and fun. Watch the Lets play vid:  https://youtu.be/cu0RUB2iWIA 
1049	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing. It has an indepth story line, amazing graphics, well done sound effects, and an immersive feel. This game is probably the greatest thing that has come to the gaming world since Duke Nukem: Forever. And the price is reasonable, I only had to put one mortgage on my house! Everyone should own this game.
3291	1	a	Fun puzzle game to burn off steam after raging from CSGO
2725	1	a	Ridiculously fun, and a perfect balance of strategic pacing and anxiety.
1552	1	a	A cracking game.  A top-down heist 'em up with old-skool graphics. It might not look the part (though I find the graphics charming) but it more than makes up for it with fiendish level design and fun. The plot might be difficult to follow at times but the payoff is well worth it.  Absolutely recommended as a co-op experience where it varies between good teamwork with flawless execution of plans and full on panic mode if one of the guards stumbles across your operation...  Special mention to the characters and some of their abilities to basically rewrite some subtle game rules.
1111	0	a	Too childish. I can't play such a game. Maybe if you want this for kids, it might do.
1198	0	a	I would definetly recommend this deep storyline and charecter set to my 6 inch â¥â¥â¥â¥
758	1	a	Ticket to Ride Is simply a PC version of the famous board game of the same name. It has all of the features you would expect of this kind of game, and the multiplayer is filled with friendly players. Good fun.
1329	1	a	I actually enjoyed this game LOL
5476	1	a	Fun Arcade game to play on and off
3859	1	a	I love the way this game looks and the theme works so well. I really enjoyed the storyline and fully got lost in the game. At times I didn't know what I was supposed to do and it was a little frustrating but overall the game was totally worth it. I'm so excited that there is a second one!
3785	1	a	Brilliant, albeit short. Highly recommended.
5260	1	a	If you like cutesie puzzle platform type games then this is certainly the game for you! It makes use of some interesting game mechanics. You can't jump, but you can 'tweet' up to 5 notes, each of which can be either short or long, and you can pound on the ground. During the game you learn different sequences of notes that cause different magical effects (sort of like a bird casting magic spells by tweeting the right way). So rather than the usual platformer type stuff of killing things with weapons or Mario-style by landing on them, or getting around by jumping, you have to use tweeting and ground pounding to manipulate your environment in order to progress. And there's even a level editor for the thing.  This style of game isn't really my main area of interest, but this game is extremely well designed and is quite unique. If this is your type of game, then this one would be in the must get category.
3714	1	a	I was expecting much less about Costume Quest... When I first saw it, I thought it'd be something childish, but I gave it a try, so I bought the CQ1&amp;2 Bundle for a low price. I couldn't have been more wrong... Costume Quest was  awesome ! When I realized it, I was extremely immersed in the story and the gameplay... Though I thought some maps and objectives were a little repetitive, but no harm done. One of the things that made me really like this game was the costume system, the need-to-get-that-costume feeling is really engaging! This game is really good for those who want a not-so-difficult but fun and good RPG experience. The achievements are very easy to get, too.  Extremely recommend it.
694	1	a	Faithful to the original. Improved my skills when playing with my friends as an added bonus.
3063	1	a	I just couldnât get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâs not a bad game at all, just wasnât for me.   Iâd consider Monaco a stealth puzzle game. You have several different characters each with a special ability. Itâs played in a top down view with the trick being you can only see where you are looking and the other areas are blank.   This limited view leads to a lot of enemy and trap surprises which was a real turn off. There is a character to alleviate this problem but it felt unfair to me overall.   The game is based around sneaking and not being seen but many times I completed levels just by running through collecting the coins and then escaping the enemyâs line of site. Basically, I didnât care enough to sneak around when running around produced passable results  Bottom line: The story and mechanics are there but I just couldnât get into it. I only played about 11 missions before calling it quits as my frustration level was getting up there at that point. I ultimately felt like the characters I could play as didnât allow me to complete the levels efficiently and how I want to do it.   It includes a level editor and an easy way to play user created levels so that is a big bonus for replay value and fresh content.   Even though I didn't do co-op play I wanted to mention it may be more fun and engaging with a friend.   I feel that I didnât play this game enough to give it a pros and cons list so Iâll leave that part out of my review. Same goes with a final score.
3366	1	a	Firstly It's looks childish, but It's absolutely not what you think! This game is one of the best Adventure-quest game I ever played! It's so much fun and characters looks good, also the fights so enjoyable, and it's actually not that easy everywhere, but It's truly a Fantastic Adventure. Add the Dlc and you get +Adventure and Fun! 10/10 :)
1343	1	a	  Somehow this game can be very funny...
2430	1	a	Awesome coop game. Gather your friends and steal the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the places. What to say more. Enjoy! ;)
2124	1	a	I liked Monaco, but my co-op partner did not get it. I suppose it isn't a game for everyone, but I appreciated the well-crafted levels and thuroughly developed gameplay in single player enough to recommend it.
3121	1	a	This is an awesome game. The gameplay is challanging in many different ways and each level has a great degree of replayability. The different classes change the way of how to approach the given tasks. But not only the way how you play the game is unique, the aestetic is as well. The artstyle is great, the music and the rare voicesamples in french reminds the player of old heist films. Coop allows to finish the stages with friends or random players, the workshop support and the level-editor allows to create levels and share them or just play user created content. Everyone who is on the search for a nongeneric AAA-game should take a look at it, it's worth the price.  TLTR: Awesome game, buy it.
2601	1	a	The action is frantic but the game is better if you play with friends. 
1189	0	a	Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can 'appreciate' an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.
5191	0	a	A cute, stupid, Dwarf-Fortress-meets-Minecraft-meets-Fetal-Alcohol-Syndrome type of game. I kinda regret getting it.
2767	1	a	Monaco is a well done game that is just plain fun.
3098	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
3528	1	a	Fun and hilarious, yet the actual gameplay gets fairly repetitive after a while of mash keys and occasionally hit Q, get it on a sale
784	1	a	Ticket to Ride for the PC is just like the board game. This is a great fun game to play with friends.
5186	1	a	I was considering giving this a thumbs down because it's a paid game with DLC and IAP's. I enjoyed the gameplay enough to consider it a recommendation though.
4768	1	a	Good to dip in and out of, can get a bit repetative.
1153	1	a	This game is a true work of art. You know you're getting quality when the person running the server sets your framerate. 9/10 because there is no 10 pack available
2910	1	a	Despite the simple graphics and gameplay, this game have a lot of potential and will be one of my good game in my library.
1920	1	a	Bought this for 3 others and myself. Start up a multiplayer game, all hell breaks loose. On a scale of Pineapple, I would rate this game 7 egg custards out of 4 Eggs.
3835	1	a	This game to many RPG buffs would probably be considered a casual game, but that being said it's actually really fun. I enjoyed the light-hearted story paired with an intuitive and amusing battle system revolving around collecting a variety of Halloween costumes with different abilities. The writing for this game is excellent as well. I found myself chuckling a number of times at things the little kids around town say. Recommended if you're looking for a fun little adventure without too much of a challenge.
119	1	a	not a bad game, awesome music
2541	1	a	A few guys I run a gaming comminuty with convinced me to pick this up one night. We had about 3 people playing it and we had a blast running through most of the first quest chain. The graphics, story, and music are absolutely awesome in this game! I have not played it by myself yet, but I believe fully that this game is meant to be played with friends. Most of the time we could not stop laughing. The game is quite enjoyable.
2563	1	a	MICS OPEN RADIOS CLEAR ITS TIME FOR A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ HEIST TOM HANKS LEO DECAP COMMING AT YA REAL HARD IN THIS HIGH ACTION RIPPING RARING THRILLER. STEAL.MURDER.PICKLOCK.MINING.LEVELUPS.HEADSHOTS.NUTSHOTS.SIMS2.SIMS3.CLOUDSTRIFE. THIS GAME-HAS-EVERYTHING  4/10 only buy it when its not on sales caio
2535	1	a	Although it starts simply, Monaco delivers a wonderfully varied set of environments and challenges. The Pac-man reminiscent graphics lend wonderfully to the panic when you inevitably mess up and have to flee from guards. My recommendation: play it with friends and play it often.
2889	1	a	Get during flash sale. Play with friends.
3574	1	a	I loved it, a simple and charming RPG. I could say this game is made for kids but no matter your age you will probably enjoy your experience remembering the good old times. The only bad thing on this game is that it is short, i completed it in 7 hours with no help but still worthed my money. 8/10
4072	1	a	I was planning to do stuff this weekend, but apparently I played 22 hours of Puzzle Quest in two days.  ...okay okay fine, I'll write about the actual game.  There are 4 classes, each have their different set of default spells, and you learn spells as you level up. This is an RPG after all, albeit a linear one - with quite a lot of sidequests and the main quest is lengthy, my game play time at the moment is pretty much an indicator of a single playthrough, which was ~36 hours.  So what's the quirk of this game? The battle system. The battle system is based on Bejeweled, and as you match pieces, you get mana, gold, exp or deal direct damage. With mana, you can cast spells. And if you put 4 in a row or stun the enemy or the like, you can get extra turns and it can get quite crazy if you have a Frozen Rod, have 1% chance of stun for each of your blue mana (so with 41 blue mana you have 41% chance of stun on every instance of dealing damage), and some other stuff. As you can tell, there are items that manipulate the gameplay on both your side and the enemy's.  You can also capture monsters and use them as a mount (and gain an extra stat based on their level and get an extra skill to use in combat), or you can research their spells. You can also craft your own items with runes you can collect. Each of these uses a system that is a variation on the base battle system.  VERDICT: If you like strategic gameplay and you're oddly addicted to Match-3 puzzle games, and enjoy a decent (even if not the most unique nor the most complicated) story, and decent music, then this is definitely a good game. It really depends on whether you enjoy the combat or not: because you'll do a LOT of it in this game. But hey, I enjoyed it.
5087	0	a	It can kill some time but there's little replay value. If there was just a little more action or random events, or something to do besides diggy diggy hole.
3468	1	a	Costume quest is a fun game to play and has a interesting ambient to it.  Pros: Cool story, funny characters and fun rpg fighting (to some point)  Cons: extremely repetitive at some points
4810	1	a	This game is a litte more straightforward than I thought it would be, and the storytelling and exploration was a little subpar; but switching between the dimensions was super cool, and I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game with a unique game mechanic.
3162	1	a	Obulis is a very simplistic puzzle game - break the links and use physics to your advantage, to get colored balls in their respective goals. Progression is granted through achieving 'stars' - each level has a certain number of stars it awards, which you can use to unlock levels. The hand painted backgrounds are gorgeous, and keep me surprised: they're a part of the game, interactive and useable as props to bounce your balls off (get your mind out of the gutter).  There is a lack of punishment to 'failing' a level, which in and of itself is both a boon and a blessing: on one hand, levels become less about skill and more about retrying until Lady Luck is on your side. On the other, being punished for levels that you will repeat upwards of ten times would quickly wear a player out, and make this game a bargain bin discount.  And really, that's what Obulis is: a game that's a fun in it's own right, but you'd never pay full price for it. Pick it up on a sale if you enjoy games akin to Fantastic Contraption, Cut the Rope and World of Goo.
4306	0	a	This game is basically Katamari Damacy if you removed all the parts that make it fun.
4656	1	a	This is my childhood. I went back and played it, and it taught me much. Then the power went out and the time came to put my new skills to the test. I burned my house down.   10/10 would burn my house down again.
2395	1	a	Great game fun solo better with friends. Not for people interested in story it's all about gameplay with a choice of just rushing it or being a stealthy ninja.
47	1	a	A short little game with a few puzzles and beautiful art. The puzzles are quite challenging, but the relaxing piano music will help you solve them :)
1337	1	a	10/10 would bang this game. did cry.
3928	1	a	at first it was hard and then it was too easy. enemies couldn't make even one attack before death. but it's cite game for 1-2 evenings.
3918	1	a	I was genuinely shocked at how good this game is. The combat is Final Fantasy style, line up in a row and take turns poking each other, the dialog is goofy, and the situation absurd. That being said, the game is actually a hell of a lot of fun and has some memorable moments that even a jaded and cynical gamer like myself found reason to smile at. Worth the price of admission - and if you don't like it know that you are helping Tim Schafer afford to make more games.
3315	0	a	This game tries to give you an insight on the kidsâ imagination at best time possible: Halloween trickâorâtreating, with all the costumes and funny games (until someone loses an eye, and oh boy they do!). And it is designed just right to do so. Game also offers a solid amount of exploration, a few side quests and some level-upping to do. All of those would make me definitely recommend the game, and for those qualities I do, but the repetitive and unnecessarily combats make me not. Because there plenty of repetitive unnecessary combats, and I cannot recommend only half a game.
1915	1	a	This is a very good game has classic and everything i recommend this
3159	1	a	Highly recommend, puzzles are very fun and quite tricky in parts but well balanced and some aren't as obvious as they look. For 34p its a steal.
1340	1	a	This game its awesome
1740	1	a	Loving this game so much!
3271	1	a	One of my favorite games I've ever bought on Steam. I own over 300 titles. This is like $5 @ FULL PRICE and $1 when on sale. Absolutely great value at either price. Over 150 physics puzzles to play &amp; trust me there are easy ones to get ya' started and then you move into VERY FRUSTRATING FUN. Some puzzles require PERFECT TIMING. A simple 'path' to victory may require 30 PERFECTLY TIMED 'mouse clicks or instructions' so a single puzzle could take 1000 tries if you JUST CAN'T TIME IT RIGHT.  Overall this is just SO DANG FUN but then again I love puzzles and the physics part of it makes it a blast.
3618	1	a	An adventure through the eyes of a child. Great story, good writing, decent enough interface and controls to get the job done, and a lot of overall fun. A tad short, but sweet.
862	0	a	The game itself is good and addictive. This is very nice version of the board game. I cannot recommend the game, because of the 'pay to play' system. Too bad, really.
3196	0	a	So- so puzzle game....purchased it in a bundle so wasn't expecting a huge wow factor....def wouldn't pay full price for this.
4417	0	a	a good match puzzle game. cant recommend cause this one does not have achievments.
592	1	a	Do not play this game with a sneaky, mischievous mother like mine. Instead of completing her route, she blocked all mine and won with that strategy of hers.  In general, this is a game based on a really good casual board game. It is extremely simple to understand all the rules and even a rookie can win a match in this game.  Usually a player's destination tickets are hidden to other players in the actual board game but if you play the hot seat mode on one computer (I believe it is called Pass and Play), you can be aware of the routes others are trying to make which can slightly decrease the quality and the element of surprise of the game (at the beginning of a game, always block someone who has the Vancouver-Montreal card!)  ...what dafuq Steam, no rating?! Well I give this game 8.5/10 with a seal of approval from the Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good.
156	1	a	Dangerously addictive 3D Tetris-esque; requires decent graphics acceleration for good experience.
1669	1	a	It's OK
3461	0	a	Ugh I didn't pay much money for this game but even that wasn't worth it. I thought this game would be good and at stages it is but I don't like it too much I had to use a tutorial for the first area because it was so confusing. The combat is okay but I was expecting Final Fantasy style fighting not button pressing fighting. This game dissapointed me and I kinda wish I didn't buy it or this game was free.
3280	1	a	Fun and Challenging. Worth the money if you like puzzle games.
5150	1	a	Great little game, the reason i like this game so much is because i was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper games back in the day and this is basicly that but with Dwarf's. The building of your actually base is pretty impresive with the amount of options availible.  7/10
1540	1	a	It is payday pixilation in this handful of heists! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is all about knowing how to get all of that loot out, while staying in one piece. If you like puzzles with a shot of adreneline, this game is for you! Pick locks and pilfer loots in this amazing thrill of a game!
3441	1	a	There was no DLC for new costumes so not really a good game for the stupid gamers
2974	1	a	I just couldnât get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâs not a bad game at all, just wasnât for me.   Iâd consider Monaco a stealth puzzle game. You have several different characters each with a special ability. Itâs played in a top down view with the trick being you can only see where you are looking and the other areas are blank.

I feel that I didnât play this game enough to give it a pros and cons list so Iâll leave that part out of my review. Same goes with a final score.
3762	1	a	This game is really fun, as soon as I started playing it, I could not put it down until I had completed it. For the small cost of the game you get hours of fun, I would recommend that you buy this game.
2365	1	a	very nice game... creative design and story
5121	0	a	This game is NOT worth any of your money. A Game of Dwarves is a base-builder where you end up leading a small pack of dwarves and have them extend their empire deeper into the caverns, yet as you dare do so you begin to uncover caverns containing monsters and possible treasures. That is the only thing that makes you keep on playing until you realize how dreadful the game actually is. First, the game has no to little updates. You will find the game to be always the same bland pointless base-builder. Second, the game enertains you for a few hours until you simply realize you do the same thing over and over again throughout the entire game. Dig down. Discover Cavern. Kill monsters. Rinse and repeat until you discover every cavern in the entire game or slaughter every monster. Lastly, the game is simply not enertaining and does not give you that thrill every time you discover a cavern. You end up finding it actually boring upon discovering caverns as your dwarves just wave in and loot the place or kill the monster. There is no all powerful artifact or enchanted weapons in these caverns. Only gold or monsters along with some furinture! I reccomend buying another game that is worthy of your money.
277	1	a	Great twin stick shooter
4240	1	a	It's not original or even very well implementedâ¦ but damn the core gameplay concept is fun nonetheless. There's only a handful of hours of play here, so the 9.99 price is a bit galling. If you can buy it on sale, it's a quick and easy game to get 100% achievements.
722	1	a	thats not duluth
1429	0	a	I PLAYED THIS AND NOW I WANT TO KILL MYSELF TO NOT PLAY EVEN IF YOU GOT IT IN A GIVEAWAY LIKE I DID IT LOOKS LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ PLAYS LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND HAS NO PLAYERS WHATSOEVER!
936	1	a	This is a really addictive match 3 game with a lot of depth, challenge and interesting story that kept me tied up in a classic 'just one more stage' cycle. When you think you've got a good handle on the gameplay and it starts to get easy, they throw in a new gameplay element or enemy type that really changes the dynamic and steps up the difficulty nicely. If you're a fan of the genre, be warned it can get really tough and hectic later on.  Beyond the nice story and gorgeous art, the world itself also has a lot of thought put into and you'll find yourself wanting to learn more about it and its denizens. My only problem with the game is how tough it can be to unlock the bonus lore since it requires you to keep an eye on the action above while you hunt for matches below. I'd rather have had upgrades work like that with book pages unlocked through performance, but six of one, half dozen of the other, I suppose.
3633	1	a	Really fun.
4611	1	a	I've never played The Impossible Machine, but this game just strikes me as a lot of fun!  Well, a fair amount of fun. Not the most fun I've had in a puzzle game, but still certainly worth playing!
2973	1	a	what an awesome game!!!!!!!
765	1	a	Just like the boardgame, meaning a very good game. Easy to learn, hard to master.
5034	1	a	If you played and enjoyed the first instalment, I'm sure you will like this one even more. While it is still very basic looking, this version is much more polished. Better transition, control and variety make this easier on the eye and mouse. Scrolling is replaced with click and drag, more like tablet touch controls.  New puzzles styles, better depth in the difficulty, in game and Steam achievements kept my interest for longer. Though I have 100% in Steam achievements and will put it to the side for now (while I tackle my backlog of shame), I can see myself coming back to finish the rest.
3460	1	a	A basic turn based rpg with a heaping dose of charm.
2918	1	a	You can pee in toilets.  10/10
410	1	a	Nice brainless twinstick shooter with extremely flashy visuals. I had no idea I was into chiptunes.
4477	1	a	100% pure casual match-3 game. Good presentation, graphics and not too annoying music and sound effects.  A nice touch, compared to other match-3 games, is the fact that you can turn the board, which also is necessary when, after you have cleard all the tiles, you need to guide a special block down a path from A to B and through portals.  Great game for what it is.
347	1	a	Very classic casual game. worth the penny especially when it's on sale.
1276	1	a	10/10 Definetly the best FPS games I've ever played, probably the best one on the market!
2927	1	a	Fun with friends.
371	1	a	Arcade-indie game, I bought it when it had a discount, but totally worth the price it has now!
4651	1	a	If you were a fan of the old game 'The Incredible Machine', then you'll find this spiritual successor a wonderful addition to your collection. While it may not have the same charms as the old TIM series (such as the wonderful music selection and many whimsical elements), its selection of puzzles to solve and gadgets to build will surely bring some form of entertainment to you and your friends and family. Rated 7.5 out of 10 stars!
3386	1	a	This fun little RPG is worth a few good laughs and an interesting world to explore and play through, although it may seem like nothing this obscre gem is sure to keep you captivated in its small time with you.
1685	1	a	Amazing, fun and simple. What more could you ask for? Get in.  Get the objective.  And get the hell out.  bit samey at times, therefore I give it 4/5
3050	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
3084	1	a	Very fun, great with friends, downsides are the workshop and how dead it is.
3073	1	a	its a great stealth game,with friends.
4617	1	a	Great Game! But isn't working in newer Windows 7 / 8 Physics and machines doesn't work. Unplayable! Needs urgently a support upgrade!!!
4338	0	a	So you're telling me that for the low, low price of ten bucks, instead of buying a used copy of We Love Katamari, I can play this cheap copy of Katamari Damacy that runs in fullscreen at 640x480, has the world's twitchiest camera that I can't even fully manipulate with my mouse, does not have a nearly as catchy and unique and awesome soundtrack, has a much uglier and less polished aesthetic, completely lacks any of the same charm, has much less in the way of content, and generally feels like it should be a free unity game?  Dejobaan games, you have earned yourself a customer for life.
4704	1	a	John de lancie reprises his role as 'The Borg' in this thrilling indie produced RPG sequel to Portal 2. When a terrible dimensional incident renders a future incompatible from the right to choose burgers made Your Way, it's a conundrum of the highest order that only YOU can solve.
5433	1	a	It's space invaders.  Kind of fun though.
2721	1	a	This game is really good i really love heists game!
5376	1	a	A really enjoyable take on the Space Invaders format, this time with upgrades and particles everywhere!   Despite playing it for a while I've yet to complete it, like a lot of these arcade format games their simplicity hides some really brutal difficulty but at very few points does it ever really feel unfair (bombs trapping you in a corner being the only notable annoyance).  Very good fun for when you want a quick, self contained game. Heartily recommended.
222	1	a	This game is truly amazing, if you like Super Stardust and retro shooters, this game is for you. The graphics are nice and even on my slow pc it runs smoothly. The music is amazing, too. Stop reading this and buy the game!
2364	1	a	Stylish heist-planning game with a lot of replay-ability. BEST PLAYED WITH YOUR FRIENDS!
4307	1	a	A wonderful little game that although tiny, provides an excellent homage to the Katamari series, through both visuals and mechanics.   Visuals: Nothing amazing, nothing bad though. Bright colours, simple models, a nice cheerful atmosphere. A nice effort has been put into giving each world a theme. After playing though, I can't help feel more direction could have been given to the art. Perhaps even a stylised Borderlands-like approach could have differed it a little more from Katamari.  Gameplay: Smooth with some minor hiccups. Sometimes the character can get a little stuck-ish between objects (because of the way it grows). The actual mechanics of the game work smoothly, being almost a clone of katamari. One thing I notice is its time restraints aren't nearly as strict as Katamari, so the experience is more relaxing. I did however, find it annoying that I had to pass 11 levels in order to unlock a new game mode.   Additional: Music is top notch.   Overall: A nice, small, relaxing game that's been carefully crafted. I don't think of this as a duplicate of Katamari, it's more of a game that just provides more Katamari-like gameplay that we all know and love. Not the most amazing game out there, but a solid experience none the less and well worth the purchase if you have a bit of time to waste.
504	1	a	Played this as a board game. It's fun no matter how played.
880	0	a	Horrible. AI will have a 99% chance of winning, and it costs in game credits to play. So it pretty much is useless.
1632	1	a	Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer.   Think of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.  First of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way.   Also, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.  The single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).  Now, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with a group of friends.  This little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely.  Make sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.  [Rating: 80/100]
4476	1	a	Basically this is a pretty decent time waster if one has time to waste. I have to say though..it's pretty easy and not very challanging for me at all. The basic concept is matching gems and breaking blocks then when the blocks are cleared you have to move a master block into its slot by matching the gems and rotating the screen. With that being said I completed the game fully and just really wrote this review so I could knock it off my list of games I have played through.
1235	1	a	For only $6, you can have an epic snowball fight on an iceberg with penguins. Do I need to say more?  Pros:  -Wonderful penguin models  -Wonderful gameplay -Wonderful animation -Wonderful environment  Cons:  -Its too awesome 
2653	1	a	i love it i love the controls and the graphics its just a blast
487	0	a	This was a great game, perfect in its simplicity, but as others have said, the latest update is terrible. The mobile version has also stopped working for several of my friends, who purchased the game separate of their PC versions. I thought of doing the same, but I'm glad I didn't. If you're going to charge people for both the PC and mobile version, it's a bit of a jerk move to suddenly change the framework of the game so that it doesn't work for mobile users.
2411	1	a	So ggod, needs more people though
5397	1	a	I only bought this game because I got a coupon for it. And now I have to say that I'm very glad about that coupon. This game is quite fun and you can spend a lot of time wth it. ItÃs especially good if you maybe just have little time and want to shoot something.
5424	1	a	Space invaders! Its a great game to have on the side but you probably wont put endless hours into it. It does have upgrades but its not very strategic, you would probably pick the most obvious ones. This game is already cheap but would be a great deal onsale
5016	1	a	5.5/10 - More puzzles than you'd ever care to play!  The puzzles themselves are pretty middle of the road. Randomly generated; crossword, Sudoku, word find and about 15 other puzzle types. It reminds me of buying one of those cheap puzzle books in the grocery checkout line.  There are 560 puzzles plus bonus challenges on each; the total number of puzzles is said to exceed 1200! I'll never find out though; after a few hours I'm pretty bored of taxing my brain playing games I can find in the newspaper. This game is great for someone who just loves working crosswords and various puzzles though.  Worth the $5! With over 1200 puzzles you can't lose with this one.     Accidently Reviewed
2914	1	a	Fun game; can get tricky with more than 3 people
1961	1	a	I really like the gameplay and the well done roles. The neon artstyle is fitting and is pleasing to the eye. The stealth system is well designed and the game is a lot of fun with friends.  But the whole playerbase is pretty much 7 years old so prepare yourself for a lot of screaming on online play.
3380	1	a	A Halloween adventure that combines classic RPG elements with silly humor and turn-based fighting. Costume Quest is a fun, short, humor-full adventure, where you journey to collect different costumes (with different skills and abilities) while unfolding a halloween vibe anyone can enjoy.    +  Fun and charming costumes and abilities to collect  +  Puzzle-like storyline and missions  +  Easy Achievements   +  Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)  -  Very simple fighting/exploring mechanisms  -  Repetitive mechanics to some extent     Personal Ranking:   6/10 
859	0	a	really fun, really great game. not recommended only because you are basically paying a subscription to play it. not worth it for that.
2464	1	a	Simple game but great to play with friends.
2080	1	a	10/7
4528	1	a	Tedious, time-consuming, but always get drawn back to playing.
1369	1	a	This game is ok. There are some features which I love, and some which I don't. Here are the features I love: 1.Cute Penguins 2.Fun Competitive Multiplayer 3.When you die, you can come back. Features I hate: 1.Only one gamemode 2.Typos and bad spelling 3.No one is ever online I reccomend this game, because when you get it, you also get a bunch of other games. If this game was sold by itself, I think it would be worth $5 a copy.
1702	1	a	it's so much fun when you play it with your friends :D
5394	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
5301	1	a	Good game for relax
899	0	a	found the tutorial tedious, couldn't sit through it to learn how to properply play. Has a steep learning curve for the ADD gamer IMO. Would pass unless you like things like collecting stamps, sodoku and sitting through Ken Burns documentaries.
1305	1	a	ok ok ok i play this game a long time a go I LOVE IS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
370	1	a	lots of fun, easy game play. Quick pick up and play, can be played inbetween waiting for the rest of your team in a different game, or can be played for hours on its own.
4498	1	a	land on an island, and keep the little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s alive, thats about it, all the virtual villagers are the same, fun games but kinda slow going
5275	1	a	If Rayman Origins was a puzzle game, that game would be called Toki Tori 2. This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment. The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well.
2831	1	a	Everyone should play this game! It is wonderful &lt;3
2538	1	a	Largely multi-player co-op based. Really fun to play with friends, especially with the enhanced missions.
5145	1	a	While not for everyone, A game of Dwarves does scratch the sand box builder game itch. Or it could just be crabs. But anyway, great game for a great price.
4309	1	a	It's pretty cool, but I finished the whole game in 54 minutes
1588	1	a	There aren't many servers out there but it shouldn't be a problem if you play with friends. It requires coordination with your team mates since punishment can be dealt out of spite because of one player. Overall, I think it's a game that pushes you to be versatile in many situation since a veteran has the same risk of dying as a new player. It's a great game.
4375	1	a	I love this game. now, first off I should warn you to get this during a sale. it's good, but it's a game you'll 100% in couple hours anyway, this game is basically katamari damacy without the strange storyline. it's a quick game that you'll find yourself coming back to replaying every one and a while. If you like the whole 'absorb things to grow huge' style of game, this'll be a welcome addition. if not, you'll probaly find this boring.
3043	1	a	Chaotic fun  Monaco is a 2D-top down, stealth game developed by Pocketwatch game. The premise of the game is simple. You and a your team are need to rob the area of specific treasure, which is found in the later levels of the stage, and then escape. The problem you have to face however are gaurds, dogs, lazers, helicopters etc which are trying to stop you. There are eight characters that you can play as which each have a unique trait, for instance the gentleman can disguise himself to avoid detection, while the locksmith can unlockdoors and vents the quickest.  In single player, there are four campaigns which tells the story of a group of thieves and the variest heists they commit. Each campaign has various levels to choose from and you unlock new leves and campaigns as you complete the previous ones. When you get killed in singleplayer, you switch to one of the other seven characters. When all your characters have died, the mission ends and you have to restart the level. The levels are well designed, having plenty of places to hide in such as vents and bushes and various routes to reach the objective. You can also find items/weapons such as shotguns,machine guns (which have limited ammo) to help deal with the gaurds as well as diguises, smoke bomb and health kits. The sound is fantastic, playing quiet music when stealth and panicky music when your alrms ring and your being chased by gaurds. The weapons sound good as well. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.   The multiplayer is where the game truely shines. You can play the campaign mission with up to seven other players. Each player chooses one of the eight roles available. When one of the players dies, they need to be revived by another player to continue playing and progress to the next stage of the level. Things get pretty fun and hilarious when alarms ring and you or another player are running around like headless chooks trying to hide from the gaurds who are chasing you down.  I highly recommend this game to players you love team based stealth games. 
2848	1	a	It is like like Legend of Zleda 4 swords. You need a friend to play it with to get the full experience and the public matchmaking is terrible.
4287	1	a	One of my childhood fav's! Worth getting
611	1	a	Amazing turn-based strategy and luck-of-the-draw train building game. So amazing to see the entire collection of expansions digitized and available on Steam. Just be forewarned that there are trolls in the online game who will stall or intentionally block routes even when you specify it's not allowed.
2305	1	a	I approve. I love the tiny download sizes. I love talking to people and telling them not to screw it up. I love the chaos they create when they ignore it. And you can p*** in the toilets.
4479	1	a	An extremely addicting puzzle game and kept me going when I had no internet for a whole month! Gets progressively harder overall, this is a shallow incline, but during an actual challenge to build the wonder its gets increasingly difficult. I've never run out of time, actually i've never passed even halfway before on the timer but it can get quite tricky and fustrating at times ;) Definitely recommened a purchase and play if its going cheap!
4594	1	a	update to include trading cards
24	0	a	This was the most painful 92 minutes of my life. It is not only locked at 30fps, but it makes no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sense. Why is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a teacup? What is the premise of this game? Why is he so slick? But most importantly, why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ would anyone pay $5 for this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I am physically sore from the stres this game has put me through. I am fairly sure that i have lost %50 of my hair. I need compensation for this, but mostly, i need answers. 
194	1	a	Fantastic twin-stick shooter similar to Geometry Wars but with lots of it's unique gameplay devices. Great soundtrack and acid fuelled graphics.  In conclusion if you like fun, instantly gratifying arcade shooters buy this game, it's well worth the price.
3750	1	a	A great little game with adorable characters and an endearing Halloween-themed story. The combat gets a bit competitive once you figure out what works for you, but fun nonetheless and the different costumes provide a solid amount of different combinations to play around with. Definitely going to play through it again!
2446	1	a	Monaco is a whismical, colorfully violent game. It boasts an intriguing story, one-of-a-kind art direction and soundtrack, and the kind of cooperative gameplay and mechanics we haven't seen since Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. It improves on that formula in almost every aspect, bringing true cooperation to the modern era outside of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Every character has their own distincy personality, color and playstyle, and it's super fun to figure out which one would be best for each encounter. A single round can turn from meticulous planning to outright chaos in seconds, and no matter how you play, it's just a blast. And what's even cooler, is that the community is the most civil I've ever seen. Perhaps it's the lack of a competitive element, or how it's impossible to do well solo, but people just love this game, and are super cool about who plays as who.   TL;DR: BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME.
5436	1	a	Brutally augmented Space Invaders.
993	0	a	Managed to make it through the first episode :o( because had to have that to install this one. Not bothering to complete this game too frustrating. Again I am looking for tiny objects and the hint/help button doesn't work just makes a noise with no results it just goes to reload for the next time. Don't bother with next time the other indicator says they is no help for this location. Have to go online to use a walkthrough if I want to complete it. Too many object searches with not actual travelling through cities, buildings with hallways etc. just leaping from single places and rooms over maps with no roads or paths, adventure lost. Into the my krap file it goes.
1943	1	a	Screw the mole so hard
4035	1	a	'The best adventure since Blade Runner for me.' Gotta agree with this guy. This game is amazing. Great story (based on a book, if I recall correctly), nice characters, interesting puzzles, multiple endings (based on our choices). World Union (where the game takes place) reminds me a lot of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.   As for the graphics, for a game that old I don't even think they're bad. Just a warning: see those black bars on the screenshots? Game doesn't run in widescreen. But the story is so amazing that, believe me, you won't even remember that after playing it for 30 minutes  If you're a fan of adventure games and a good, solid sci-fi story, give this game a chance. I don't think you'll regret it  For those wondering about those merely 4.4 hour of gameplay on my profile, Steam version is cut (it lacks a few sex scenes, like Fahrenheit), so I grabbed the full version elsewhere, and that's the one I've been playing
3	1	a	running windows 7 w/a 360 controller and game runs perfect. Fast, colorful on rails shooter. Old school fun.
5527	1	a	Cute and fun Space Invaders ripoff.
4214	1	a	Beautiful art, interesting story and gameplay. Fun and creative.
4707	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a first person puzzler / platformer that is based on changing the physics of your environment. My only major issue with this game is that the story was left unfinished and there is no known sequel on the horizon. Though not quite revolutionary, Quantun Conundrum knows what it is and executes excellently.   If you like games such as Portal and don't mind some additional platforming elements, you'll appreciate Quantum Conundrum.
981	1	a	This is a review for both 'Clockwork Man' and 'Clockwork Man: The Hidden World' since I played them back to back and they share the same lead character. Actually, I've played both these games many times on a different PC before I got into Steam. So my playtimes you see for each will probably be less than a normal playthrough since I can whiz through the games by now. We'll start with game #1:  Pros:  - Nice graphics and good character designs. The main girl, Miranda (YAY, she has my name!), is quite lovely.  - The voice acting is also good, for the most part. I really like who they chose for Miranda. Some of the others can be a bit cheesy but it is amusing rather than irritating.  - Interesting story.  - Both games have a very neat hidden object feature. Scrolling and zooming. Not every scene but many allow you to move around the area. Some items are sneakily hidden behind others but just one click to the left or right will reveal them.  - Both games also have an interesting hint system. You travel around with a little robot man and he'll help you locate those tough to find objects. He starts out with the ability to just tell you where a random something is. Then a little into the story, he learns how to give you an item's silhouette (which is the hint I prefer if I'm stuck). Further in the story, he gets other abilities. Like briefly highlighting each metal object on your HO list.  - In both games, the music isn't spectacular but it's pleasant to listen to. Actually, in #2 there are a couple places with very lovely melodies.  - When you beat each game, Freeplay opens up. This gives you random hidden object areas. Good for if you're in that 'I have a craving to find stuff' mood.  Cons:  - Neither game is connected to Steam while you're playing. So you won't be able to chat with friends or take steam screenshots.  - Unfortunately, both games have issues when it comes to clicking on items. You'll find you need to be very precise and occasionally you'll need to click more than once or try clicking on a different part of the object. It doesn't happen TOO often or else I wouldn't be able to recommend these games.  - Both games are short. Boo.   Now I'll list the differences in Clockwork Man: The Hidden World:   - The length is longer. Because of the higher difficulty, possibly much longer.  - This game has a journal where Miranda records her adventures and anything of note. You WILL need to use this journal to solve quite a few puzzles.  - There are many more puzzles in #2 and some of them are downright devious. There are no skip options either. Also, it's easy to miss things that you need in some scenes so you might get stuck for awhile. I love this game but it IS a bit aggravating sometimes. Those who enjoy a challenge will have fun. :D  - The story has no tie-ins with the first game. The Hidden World's plot is much more involved than #1 and, in my opinion, fascinating.  - The voice acting, again in my opinion, is better than the first game. (Miranda is still the same, which is good!)  - Maybe it's my imagination but it seems the graphics are better in #2, though I'm pretty sure they used the same game engine.   - When you finish the game, you can rewatch any of the cutscenes.    So in closing, I really enjoy both these games so I'm definitely recommending them to hidden object and puzzle fans. But, because of their short length, you should wait and grab them when they're on sale.   Important Note! The games might not load up for you, which is an issue I had. Right click on the Clockwork Man title, click on Properties, click on Local Files, click on Browse Local Files (which will bring up your program files for the games), right click on the Clockwork Man title again, click on Troubleshoot Compatibility, and finally click on Try recommended settings. I did that for each game and then they worked just fine.
3130	1	a	Top down Payday 2
1888	1	a	**
1304	1	a	just pure awesomeness!
4897	1	a	The game is often compared to the likes of Portal and on the surface that is correct. During the game you travel room to room gaining new powers and learning the game as a sarcastic narrator comments on your performance. Where they differ is on their core mechanics, where Portal is Puzzle/FPS, QC is more Puzzle/Platforming.  A great execution of 3D platforming the game is good fun, and John de Lancie makes it all the better.  DAT ENDING
457	1	a	Pros: Really fun Reminds me of old arcade games Looks nice A bunch of different gamemodes  Cons: It gets repetitive
2225	1	a	Definitely a decent game, made more fun if you can play it co-op. Keep in mind however, playing as newbies co-op is actually more difficult than solo as this is a stealth game with a few game mechanics that are quite subtle which you discover as you go.  I would recommend playing through a fair few levels before starting co-op. Once you get the mechanics down playing as a team is very rewarding as each character brings a special ability to the table.  With 4 players it can get a bit chaotic, I would say 2-3 is the sweet spot.
1969	1	a	Different but good
389	1	a	Fluid WASD + mouse controls, great graphics, great soundtrack, and refined gameplay... this twin stick shooter basically does everything right. Even the menus are nice. The ability to sparingly slow down time is really useful, as you can never have enough of it and it will save your â¥â¥â¥. Solid recommendation.
2871	1	a	Great game, but to achieve maximum enjoyment you need to play with friends.
2145	1	a	Incredibly fun co-op or solo game filled with hijinks and theivery. Highly recommended.
4566	1	a	Tower Defense in the form of Satellite Defense. There is a high level of challenge in later missions, especially on the 'Unstoppable' difficulty level.  Many will appreciate the humorous cutscenes. There are a few game modes - Story, Challenge and Arcade, so there's some decent gameplay hours if you want to finish the game.
3234	0	a	This game is about as fun, as sticking your hand in a blender. Don't get it.
159	1	a	Critical Mass is nothing more than what you would expect. Its a fun little game that you play for 15 minutes at a time. That being said it's still a good game and is a lot more challenging then you would think.
1381	1	a	You control penguin in snowball battle. All you need is to throw down other penguins into sea. It's a great funny non-violent fps game. I recommend it.
4569	1	a	Get ready to experience a revolution in tower defense that will send you spinning. Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations.  Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world.
1055	1	a	I said how it's unjolly when people sell me Unity games without warning, ye? I did.
673	1	a	Great game to play solo or online. I like that is doesn't take a long time and has plenty of expansion.
2236	1	a	Gameplay is simple, but fun and interesting. Also, good single player and co-op.
730	1	a	cant play the game, been getting error message for days now, tryed everything that they tell you to do and nouthing works, this sucks, buy the game and all the extras that go with it and cant do any of them. I love the game and want to play, please help me if you can
914	1	a	A great PC tabletop war game.
3756	1	a	Fun little baby RPG. Double Fine brings its trademark humour to keep it interesting for all despite a childish theme. Were it any longer, it would be unbearbaly repetitive, even at this length, the feeling creeps in. Animation of the battle costumes are are quite likable, especially the patriotic powers of lady liberty. Good Intro to RPG for newbies, and fun to kill a few hours if you're in for a family friendly adventure. Decent overall.
22	0	a	This looks awesome but it deosn't. Repetitive and annoying music. Gameplay is bad. It should be a free flash game. Waste of money!
580	1	a	A great way to get your table top experience without actually needing flesh and blood friends.
3195	1	a	Turns out that a game about throwing balls into pots would be so fun. Definitely worth the asking price for any puzzle afficionado.
2062	1	a	A good game to play with your friends online.
1284	1	a	A fun little arena shooter style game where you knock others off your iceberg to the orcas and claim the iceberg for you and your faction. Not much of a life at that point... Just floating around on a tiny iceberg...
4218	1	a	This remains the most addictive game I have ever played. Not trying it is doing yourself a disservice, no less. :)
3147	1	a	Great game wait untill a sale to buy this game(if yyou are a cheap skate) but diffinetly worth the price offgetting it also do not getthis game if you are going to play by your self because it can get very boring at times. With friends it a great laugh and lots of fun. heres a link to a playthough its very funny.         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rythian and the Boys Play Monaco #1 - Worst Thieves in France&nbsp;
2102	1	a	fun game for a buck!
2701	1	a	A hilarious game to see if you and you friend(s) can actually work as a team.
1285	1	a	Super Smash bro peguin edition
4319	1	a	You walk around, stuff sticks to you, you get bigger and finally, you consume the whole world. Katamari Damacy on PC. And it's fun. And funny. Buy it. It's Dejobaan Games.
2316	1	a	This has to be one of the most fun multiplayer games I've ever played! And teamwork is KEY.
4837	1	a	A great little puzzle game filled with non-stop humour. Worth every penny.
5091	1	a	Fantastic game that you can spend hours messing around in. Reminds me a lot of the old dungeon keeper 2 game with a good amount of humour to it. Keep an eye on the animations!
2051	1	a	quite fun, and has good single and multiplayer. lot's of fun when played co op. mostly tactical in real time, but about 25% action.
3498	1	a	Charming RPG
2387	1	a	i have no idea what to type here.
715	1	a	An extremely accurate version of the real thing, Ticket to Ride in general is such an easy game to learn and a fantastic game to (try to) master. There are a few kinks that do, at times, prevent you from getting right into games, usually to do with the log-in system, but they never occur during gameplay and are often resolved with restarting Steam. A nuisance, I admit, that I hope Days of Wonder can resolve somehow.  If you're up for learning a board game that's been very well presented, give this a go. My advice? Get the DLC's (at least Ticket to Ride: Europe) and find a friend or a few to play this with. Yes, you CAN jump into random games, but if you're on voice-chat with a few friends in your own game, the reactions are wonderful if you manage to block your opponent. The DLC's offer more variety and a few nifty gameplay additions, whether it's Europe with stations and mountain-routes, or the different styles of tickets offered by different versions.  Currently my favourite board game adapted for PC... though that's likely 'cause there aren't many others available, and certainly not many more that offer as satisfying a board-gaming experience as this one. Enjoy!
2543	1	a	its a very good game, great storyline and very family friendly
5103	1	a	This game is a bit like Dungeon Keeper and a bit like Lego Rock Raiders if you can remember that gem. In the campaign you play a Prince that leads his clan to re-take lands lost to mages years ago. Each area consists of a randomly generated grid with multiple levels so the resources and non-quest specific rooms will move around if you restart. The focus is on furniture rather than specific rooms, but this allows for a player to designate their own shape and size for a 'room'. There are about 14 different resources of increasing rarity that will make better furniture to keep dwarves happy or upgrade your army. Game isn't too difficult but much of the time you spend will be mining the resources you need.
2456	1	a	Would only recommend if you've got friends, probably would kill myself if I played solo.
4773	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
4884	1	a	the narrater of tthis game is like a pile of delicately folded sheets
1379	1	a	okay game with cute graphics, all in all it's nothing much.
2127	1	a	Best robbery game EVER! I love all the carecters and all there specile abillites. 1 thing i dislike is dat pick pocking allways allerts gaurds. 
1777	1	a	Cool game.Escapes,Heists and other.I love tthis game!
1672	1	a	The game i will bring on an island... (an island with a good bandwith^^)
97	1	a	It is a 'sweet' puzzles game. Very short gameplay though. The way the environment is built is brilliant.
770	1	a	If you've played TTR the board game then you'll like this. You don't have to clean up after each game since it's digital. I got it when it was on sale and got most of the expansions for $5.00 bucks. Well worth it in my opinion.
2281	1	a	eh it was ok not amazing but pretty good
2552	1	a	Its a really good game, i recommend it
2083	1	a	Very fun!! :D Rainbowdashy's :3 rainbowz peace! ZWOMBIEZ :C RAINBOWS! c:
1059	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.
3241	1	a	You get what you pay for here. A simplistic physics puzzle game with marbles. What more did you expect?  A game that wastes no time in exploring a fairly limited premise, and yet has no trouble racking up the difficulty. Some of the last levels may even need a guide with the sadistic amount of timing needed as well as foreknowledge of a handful of sequences to get your result. All an all a quick pretty game with a soothing soundtrack.
2497	1	a	I'm really not sure what I can say about Monaco. It's a pretty good single-player experience, but the multiplayer is where it really shines: heists can be anything from incredibly tense, with your team struggling to fight their way to the level exit with little to no health left and the police closing in on you; or bloody hilarious, as you all run around beating the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the security guards and trying to figure out just where you have to go next before they all wake up and give you a well-deserved spanking. I would totally recommend it: It's worth the full price, and it's pretty much a crime not to buy it with the discount.
3529	1	a	Hey, Gabe.. if i was in charge, we were already have  plenty of candies  all those trading cards been sold with profit!
345	1	a	Fast paced to stick action, but its less fun if only with keyboard and mouse controlled.
4013	1	a	This is a really silly and charming little game aimed mainly at kids, but just as fun for an adult. It's easy and relaxing, perfect for playing while home in bed sick - or if you just want a change of pace - since it doesn't make too many demands of the player besides some simple quicktime responses, and doesn't drag out with too much grinding or pointless sidetracks.  The humor is a bit klichÃ©-USA, but if you don't take things too seriously the warmth of Costume Quest gives it definite replay value, especially around the later parts of the year. Both this game and its sequel are worth a chance!
559	1	a	If you love the board game you will love this! Fun and fast, this game will help feed that addiction. Such a simple concept that can give you hours of fun
3922	1	a	I spent 8 continuous hours playing and completing this today. Going to play GOI next and then make sure that I get every achievement, which will be a first. I wasn't expecting to like this game as much as I did. I had it on my wishlist for a while and was excited to playt it. But I read beforehand that there's battles in this game and that put me off a bit because I don't like hard games but this was a super cool and casual play. It's got the kind of easiness as the Lego games.   10/10  One of my new favourite games, Can't wait to play the next one!
1141	1	a	This game taught me how to jump like professional.
2106	1	a	Ridiculously fun, and a perfect balance of strategic pacing and anxiety.
125	1	a	Great little puzzle game. If you can get it on sale, even better! :D
4374	0	a	Where do I start?  As you may think, this game is similar to Katamari Damacy. However that's where the similarity ends.  The game forces itself onto fullscreen mode, you cant change the low resolution. The controls are clunky. Levels are boring, sound is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not worth the hassle.
1795	1	a	pvp in a nutshell   omg i have all the trophies better escape *shotgunned to the face right at the boat*
2818	1	a	Reminds me of Pacman......but with guns
863	0	a	I have the real board game with all the extensions. The legit game is way better and I feel like the dice rolls are unfair and usually favor one side. Just get the board game.
4484	0	a	I like this game very much, I just do not recommend this particular Steam version which does not work! The game cannot even be launched under Win 8.1 64-bit, the process just hangs and has to be killed manually.
5331	1	a	Awesome graphic and gameplay! It's like the old school Space Invaders. If you play Space Invaders, play this.  Very nice game, and you can earn and craft awesome looking badges :D
41	1	a	The game is fun and challenging without being frustrating. I recommend it. There is nothing that I disliked.
2943	1	a	One of the best local co-op games to have!
36	1	a	Appart from the classics, I'm not much of a fan of platformers, but this one is pretty good! Appart from the fact that the art is crap (I know it's obviously aimed at kids but even then it's still pretty poor) the gameplay is really good and it's very addicting! I got it in a â¥â¥â¥ pack otherwise I probably wouldn't of picked it up myself!
1154	0	a	It's a cute game to play on free time, but it's more fun to play with friends but many people are reluctant to buy it also online servers are very RARE almost no one playes it, it'd be fun with more people but on your own it gets a bit too repetitive
5106	1	a	Goofy, fun and at times challenging. Good fun!
1817	1	a	This is a really good game. It can be played single player or multiplayer (up to 4 people). Great pick up if you get it in a sale.
118	1	a	This game was a lot more fun than i thought, i just bought it for the lolz from the steam winter sale 2013 because it was 0,50â¬ and i was quite suprised how fun it was. I would defienedly recommend it to anyone who just likes to relax and play 'easy' puzzles!
158	1	a	An excellent game. It doesn't do much but what it does, it does right. It's a great time waster and for 2â¬, i'd say it's a very fair deal.
5395	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
3183	1	a	This game is very good.
75	1	a	It's a charming game with great puzzles. I got a little lost and had a little trouble here and there, but overall I was able to manage without explicit spoilers. This was also only part one! So if you loved it, go support the guys to get the full game!
873	1	a	Very good online game, but free 50 Gold is not enough
5516	1	a	A very simple premise: Make Space Invaders for modern gaming. Mission accomplished in spades. A perfect game for casual, retro gaming.
49	1	a	As beautifully-made as it is short, Lume is wonderful if brain-destroyingly difficult at times. I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of the puzzles, it got that difficult for me.  I would still reccommend this wholeheartedly, ALMOST to the point of taking it upon myself to offer a money-back guarantee of enjoyment. But I won't do that because that's just dumb. And it's not my job. And this isn't my game. And I'm broke. But it's still a game that's worth your money, even if just to tide you over until Lumino City drops.
4139	1	a	Wow this game is far longer than it appears. Basically it is a match the color game with RPG concepts. You level up, gain skills/stats, collect items to add passive traits, and by all accounts the story mode is at least 30 hours long (I played 9 hours.)  It has quite a bit of depth for this type of match the color puzzle game: You basically battle AI or a person to cause damage to each other by matching skulls or casting spells by matching colors.  The reason I am not finishing it... 9 hours in and I do not feel like playing anymore because it feels like Color Match Grinding. Interesting but the random aspect can someone skrew you over or make a boss a joke. The random stuff can be frustrating that actually makes it boring after a few hours.  Worth it if you like this sort of thing!~
175	1	a	Like an exploding rubics cube, but extremely relaxing. Will satisfy the completionist and the casual in you. Worth giving a shot.
4196	1	a	ALL puzzle quest games are great Puzzle Quest II is better, but for the price you can't beat this one.
3230	1	a	balls ahUEUEUEUEUEUE
1224	1	a	No lag Balanced No crashes  It does everything right that call of duty does wrong.  cod = fish penguins eat fish. Penguins &gt; cod  It's so obvious.
4690	1	a	Very Nice Puzzle Game that feels like Portal. It feels like it because it was made by Kim Swift wich was one of the lead devs to create Portal. Overall the Game has a pretty nice artstyle which reminds of Tf2 but also Portal, This Game is pretty challenging but its alot of Fun to play. I give this Game a 8/10
1080	1	a	It be funtastic!! The soundtrack is cool too.
3613	1	a	Great game from DoubleFine. Met all my expectations and more.
3736	1	a	GREAT GAME WORTH THE BUY ' AND PLAY TIME
3732	1	a	The art, story, atmosphere, and combat in this game are great. It's overall good.  However, I have a few gripes. When something is in the foreground it's at just the wrong level of transparency to hurt your eyes. The level of difficulty is a little low for my liking. The gameplay gets progressively more and more linear as the game progresses, especially in character progression. Which isn't a good thing in a psuedo-rpg.  Overall it's definitely fun and I find myself pretty addicted to the combat system. Worth a buy.
437	1	a	After playing this you are left wondering where all the time in your day went to. Very addictive!
3242	1	a	A fairly simple but relaxing puzzle game. I really enjoyed it, it won't last you very long but if you can pick it up on the cheap I definitely recommend it.
4069	1	a	Simple game with a simple premise, line up the gems (Think Bejeweled) However it adds a whole new twist through an RPG element introducing a new level of strategy. (Do you line up skulls to do damage, or certain colors to get the mana you need, or to deny your opponent the mana they need?) Didn't look like it would be fun, but its amazingly addictive and provided me far more hours of entertainment than I would have anticipated.
5373	1	a	Space Invaders, but better. Now, before you jump out of your chair and yell 'BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!', hear me out.  Titan Attacks! is a wonderful looking indie title. The story is rather simple and there's absolutely no way to truly spoil it. Aliens have attacked Earth and destroyed every single weapon on our planet, save for one tank - the one you, as the player shall control. Your task is to drive the aliens from Earth all the way to their home planet (technically a moon) and deal with them once and for all!  To make this mission (slightly) easier, you are given many purchasable upgrades in-between fights. Use the cash you earn to buy extra weapons for your tank, make your bullets do more damage or get a handful of borderline 'I WIN' button nukes.  The game is fast-paced and fun. It certainly isn't long, but it has quite a bit of replay value. Oh, it's cheap as well! I'd suggest getting it the next time you're looking for a new game to play - trust me, it's totally worth it.
1392	1	a	best game on steam
4251	1	a	Fun, addictive game. It brings that 'Katamari' feeling back into your heart. It's also addictive.
5317	1	a	Buy It: This is another game that surprised me a lot, first of all because I didn't liked too much the way the chick looks like, and then because to me it looked like a boring game for children (and even the kids coul be bored to play at xD) I was wrong! It's very nice, relaxing, and you have to use your mind to understand how to get help from the others animals around, the design of the environment and the animals it's pleasant and you will not be bored by the sounds, it's a very gracefull game to play at that will make you smile
3599	1	a	A very cute and fun game. Lighthearted and funny, an excellent October Halloween game. Just the right length too.
2775	1	a	Play it Co-op with friends. It is heaps of fun that way, cos when someone messes up, things get really frantic.
3221	0	a	Annoying puzzles that are either too simple or too 'difficult'. 'Difficult' is in quotes here because it's not really the puzzle itself that is difficult, it's the fact that they require millisecond precision in making sure the balls hit the right thing at the exact right second. It's less a puzzle and more a frustrating exercise in trial and error reaction time crap-shoots where you'll be replaying the same level over and over with slight variations on your timing to try to make everything fall into place.  The controls are horrible. You have to click on a chain or thing to select it and then right click to cut it. It would be far more natural to use a swiping motion over a chain or thing to cut it, as is done in a popular game called Cut The Rope.  Also, you can't adjust the sound effect volume or the music volume. You can only mute or unmute.  Fortunately, this game only cost me 49 cents and I can write it off. 3/10 would not play again.
4366	1	a	I really miss playing We &lt;3 Katamari on PS2 and I heard this would fill my needs.  I'd say it certainly did that, if only for a while. It's a shame it wasn't longer but it was very enjoyable while it lasted.  Roll up all the things to get as big as possible and save the world.  I'd say one to get in a sale but well worth a look if you need a fix of Katamari goodness.
95	1	a	When talking about Lume itâs impossible not to bring up its length, so I might as well start with that. Lume is very short, especially considering its price. It took me an hour to complete, and thatâs including stopping to admire the visuals, and I honestly canât see it taking much longer than that. You might draw it out to 90 minutes, but thatâs about it. But if you look beyond that youâll find an absolutely charming and adorable game. There, I said it. Iâm supposed to be cynical goddamit, but here I am calling a game âadorableâ. But it is, it absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing is. Itâs made out of cardboard for godâs sake. CARDBOARD!  Yes, this game didnât take very long to win me over. Look at it though, itâs gorgeous. Sure, there isnât much to see, but what you do see is incredible. I still canât get over the fact the gameâs made out of cardboard. Man, this game made me grin like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing child, and I hate it for it. It is a puzzle game, though the puzzles are rather generic and simple. Still, some fun brainteasers, but I feel resentful towards them because they arenât made out of cardboard. In fact there isnât much that is made of cardboard because the area is very small and can be explored in a few minutes, meaning you backtrack a lot and most of the length is spent solving puzzles. The fact that you donât get much of the gameâs best feature in a very short game is a bit of a problem, so itâs hard to recommend at full price. I got it in a bundle which was perfect, but for a considerable discount Iâd say itâs worth experiencing. Then again, Iâm all set for getting the sequel Lumino City (get it?), discounted or not, so maybe the price isnât so bad after all... Itâs made of cardboard though, and thatâs got to count for something, right? Besides, this game will charm the pants off even the most cynical of people, even if itâs only for an hour.
284	0	a	+ Interesting game modes + Nice style  - Will not recognize my controller - Only 2 weapon types - Only a single map - Has no power-ups to speak of - Slowmo isn't very satisfying - Music is uninspired  It's an addictive game if you can get past the bare bones, but you're better off elsewhere in this genre... *cough* Super Stardust HD *cough*.
4115	0	a	Will not launch in Windows 8.1. There's a long thread on the Steam Community Forum of users with the same problem. No solution has been found and no tech support is available.
490	0	a	Didn't like the new version.  The animation finishing a run was annoying.  The ability to bypass the score counting is gone now. Wastes too much time.  I won't be playing much now.
4644	1	a	  Crazy Machines   is a mind puzzle game. As the apprentice of a wacky inventor, complete the puzzles to achieve specific effects using a limited amount of knick-knacks.   Pros : This starts out as a fairly simple game with a low learning curve, new elements being introduced as you progress from puzzle to puzzle. You can test the effect of the solution as often as you'd like, which you'll be required to do, regularly needing to adjust your setup and check how different the effect is. The physics of the game, although not fully realistic, are close enough to help guess how most pieces work and wrap your head around it.   Cons : The difficulty isn't as gradual as it could be. You might have a hard puzzle that requires you to adjust one or more item by a pixel, over and over until it works, followed by an extremely straightforward puzzle right after. The hint system is very limited, are rarely actually help. Graphics are showing their age.   Verdict : âââââ - It's up to you  All and all,  Crazy Machines  is exactly what it sets out to be, and there is no mistaking that it follows directly in the footsteps of  The Incredible Machines . If that's what you're looking for, you won't care about the graphics and this game has the cheapest puzzle/$ ratio of the franchise. This game is void of any action or excitement, but rather is meant to make you stop, think, observe and resolve the puzzle. If it's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.  âââââââââââââââââââââââââ   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . 
431	1	a	I kind like remind of Geometry Wars
2698	1	a	Multiplayer is amazing!
5312	1	a	Such a great little game. Cute animals, a metroidvania styled world, and challenging puzzles makes for a very entertaing title. If you didn't enjoy Toki Tori 1 don't disregard it's sequel. It adds the element of adventure as you trudge through the world exploring for secret areas while finding all of the collectibles. I highly recommend this game.
1763	1	a	A great little Indie heist game that eveyrone should try. If you have any controllers, it's a BLAST for 2-4 players! I play with my sisters a lot. :)
2951	1	a	Looks good, fun to play, cheap. Overal just a great game. You should really get it.
5489	1	a	Good ol' space invaders with a sweet artstyle and nifty features. 8/10
865	0	a	You have to keep buying gold to play, the game looks like a Windows 3.1 game from the early 90s, and the game is VERY random and simplistic. Battlelore is based on the same system, but it's a much better game.
1082	1	a	to snuggle the truck: one must be complete in mind, and truck in spirit
3224	0	a	This game is essentally cut the rope, but uses jars instead of a candy-eating monster. ALthough it is fun, this game is just incredibly boring. I did enjoy Cut the Rope, but this game made me want to slit my wrists.
935	1	a	A pretty good little indie game. It's a puzzle RPG with real-time combat. If Bejeweled and Puzzle Quest had a baby this would be it.   The story is okay but the writing itself is a little rough. It also takes a bit to get off the ground and by the end of the game I was very ready for it to end.  The real meat of the game is its surprisingly deep gameplay. The difficulty takes a while to ramp up but becomes a real challenge by the end. If you do play it then do so on HARD because otherwise it robs you of the real ending. By that time you will definitely not want to play through again.
5147	1	a	Fun game, like dwarf fortress, without the steep learning curve but lacks the complexity. Levels take acouple hours to complete. Well worth the $10 asking price.
3605	1	a	A fun little RPG hidden in children's clothing. There's more depth to the battle system than is initially evident (finding just the right combination of party members, costumes, and battle stamps can eat up time), but can still be rather shallow when actually in combat. This combined with a lack of variety of enemies can lead to some redundancy, but nothing too aweful. Good humor and likable characters keep the player invested through to the end. Virtually no reply value since most collectables can be found in the initial play through.  Recommended for fans of: Simple RPG combat, cute and child-like humor, kids who have grown old but never grew up.
4902	1	a	if you liked portal or Portal 2 then you'll love this! (not to mention it was designed the same person)

3210	0	a	This game is ok, but does get frustrating after a while. I found the sound to be quite good, but I do feel that there should be some sort of volume adjustment instead of just a mute.
2151	1	a	Very fun, unique multiplayer co-op game centered around coordination and execution to heist various buildings for various valuables. Choosing from several different roles within your heist gang, you infiltrate your target and rob them blind. Very fun, espeicially with friends.
5132	1	a	This is not a perfect game. It is a bit unfinished, and will never be completed as the developer has quit operating. So why am I recommending it?  It's a lot of fun! You play a Dwarf clan and can build vast, underground caverns for your people. You have to dig for gold and other materials, but also make sure you don't run out of wood, and have to defend yourself from incursions by monsters such as Goblins or Spiders.  The campaign is silly, and while there are voice clips they do not match the dialog at all. But it serves its purpose in teaching you how to play. Sandbox is where this game really shines.  There is an in-game shop which wants you to buy items for in-game currency on top of the DLC, but all that's in there is cosmetic and can be completely missed.  If you like your 'town builders' but don't want the complexity of something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress, give this game a try.
3828	1	a	this feels like a kids game where the power of candy rules all, but it is great fun even for adults :-P All the little details make this game good, and its balance of reward versus penalty is very well done.  A nice calming game experience, where you need to consider your tactics well.
4133	1	a	Majorly repetitive but many addicted hours of fun!!
1353	1	a	One of my favourite childhood games,only buy it if you wanna play with friends,otherwise you will get bored really fast because there aren't any servers online,only hosted by players.
2615	1	a	This game is too fun to exist. Why doesn't everyone have this?
3617	1	a	This is a great little game by Double Fine, and when I say little, I really do mean little. It took me about 6.5 hours to beat the game, plus its free (on steam) continuation of the story, Grubbins on Ice. There will no doubt be another added on continuation of the game, sometime in the future.  The combat system is very similar to Super Mario RPG's, in that you time a button press to both do extra damage to an enemy, and to take less damage from an enemy. But this also has the addition of Battle Stamps, which act as battle-enhancing items. Stuff like applying a poison DoT to an enemy, or recovering some hp after each round in combat.  All in all, even though I bought this the day before it went 50% off for halloween, I am very glad with this purchase, and still have the next chapter to look forward to. Buy this game, especially while it is on sale.
5352	1	a	Just like the space invaders of old, but modernised. I love that old arcade classic, and I approve of what this game is doing and how it executed it.
2084	1	a	One of the funnest games ive played with friends. Its great to mess around, screw with your friends, guards etc. while still cooperating. DEFINATELY a good game if you have friends willing to play with you, which I don't :'( Im lonleh :C
4305	1	a	An amusing Katamari Damacy clone, with a great soundtrack. The only drawback is the fairly limited amount of levels, but it's decent for the price tag.
1798	1	a	its good has intrestrefatsf game play weird story good grafixs i guess its just good buy it..... its also really hard
5402	1	a	It's a fun game! If you are interested - the trailer shows everything there is to know about the game.
1610	1	a	When you play Monaco, you will feel like you are on a CAPER, straight up. Gameplay is Thief meets Pac-Man meets Left 4 Dead through their mutual friend, Ocean's Eleven.  You will feel classy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you play this game. You will feel like a smooth criminal. Even if you don't want those things for some reason, it's worth playing for the music and sound design alone.  Monaco is crazy-good, has something for all skill levels, completely changes depending on how many people you play with, and has high replay value. Oh my god get this game.
4714	1	a	A very fun game with many interesting elements to altering reality for platforming and puzzel solving such as making safes light and fluffy so you can pick them up, reversing time and manymore fun and interesting little things to do!  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of puzzle-platform games :)
1196	1	a	This game is stupidly bad its filled with glitches its buggy only get this for 30 cents if you want to derp around in a really stupid game
1012	1	a	I could NOT resist! Bringing cuteness into physics, and a somewhat reminder of Line Rider, the ability to create your own tracks - I had to buy it! It's yet another incredible indie game, and well worth the price. Get it!
976	0	a	Initailly thought this would be a Burton-esque steampunk P&amp;C adventure but despite the grand music, it turned out that The Clockwork Man actually is mostly a hidden object game with the occasional puzzle. Unfortunately the setting of the adventure, New Coventry, is much like its real-world equivalent and full of people with messy, run-down houses so the hidden object bits are frequent and rather tedious. However, unlike the world in the game, attractive women don't tend to run around enthusing about how much they like to clear places up.  Backgrounds were well drawn, though the designers elected to do the trick found on a zillion visual novels and show interactions between characters by sweeping them in from the sides. It's kinda cheap looking. Music was good, though didn't loop well and tended to be a bit jarring when it did. Story was overblown, though on the plus side   the annoying little R2D2 thing ended up dead.   Yay!  The game takes about 2-3 hours to complete. At about Â£2 an hour (that's about $10,000 for those in the colonies), it may not seem like wonderful value. Artifex Mundi tend to do this sort of thing better.
1028	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ that entertains sometimes!
2787	1	a	Overall, this simplistic game is an absolute gem. Sure you can pass a lot of levels by just running through, ignoring half of the loot and almost all the guards, but to do so is a waste. You will miss all the fun of sneaking around trying to pass each level without being seen/killed. Ok, single player has a limited lifespan, but multiplayer is great fun, and the ability to make your own maps extends the games life by a long time
5146	1	a	Fans of dwarves will enjoy this. Additionally the gameplay is quite enjoyable, balancing fortress management, with upgrades, mining and building an aesthetically pleasing haven for your dwarves is very fun. Incredibly good game and at a modest price.
2892	1	a	Monaco: The Heist is a co-op digging simulater where you go around and dig in buildings to collect money that is laying just about everywhere.    11/10 would dig again  Can you dig it?
5171	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
4399	1	a	Stupidly addicting... don't ask why, its just one of those really dumb things that you kinda gotta love.
3553	1	a	I have been enjoying Costume Quest a lot actually. The cartoon look is visually appealing and when you can play in 1080p it makes it even better. It is a quirky kind of RPG yet it does not fully present itself as an RPG, you can roam around and complete quest without even looking at your quest log. It's battles are fun and attacks involve timing and require you to think fast on which key to press when blocking attacks. I strongly recommend this game, worth its money, you may want to wait for a sale if you are money conservative.
2885	1	a	This game rocks. You have a couple of guys, they all got their specialty and you need to break in to houses/banks/exhibitions and all kinds of other places. Get in. Get the objective loot, and the coins if you want to get rich, or die trying. Get out. Multiplayer is as much fun, if not more than the singleplayer. I bought this game on the sale with 90% discount, but it has been so much fun it would have been worth my money without discount.
5497	1	a	I like this game.
3645	1	a	From the makers of Psychonauts, Costume Quest is an interesting and creative Halloween-themed RPG. You play as a group of imaginative children trying to stop the monsters of Repugia from stealing all of the candy on All Hallows' Eve. The battles are turn-based and simplistic enough so that even those who are new to the genre can get a hang of things quickly. The Cartoonish visuals are well done and perfect for this style of game. The writing is also quite humorous and exactly what you'd expect from Double Fine Productions. As long as you don't go into Costume Quest expecting a full-fledged RPG with a deep combat/inventory system, I think you can have quite a good time playing it. It's a fun and original game with entertaining battles and a lot of charm.
4357	1	a	Fun, colourful and charming little game.
3152	1	a	 'Balls into the pots'
598	0	a	it's really really bad.
2822	1	a	Great fun with friends. Definitely encompasses that feeling of 'nothing goes according to plan' in every mission.
4785	1	a	Light hearted, enjoyable puzzle game! The uncle's voice reminds me of Discord from MLP FIM,so its really interesting to think about discord talking to you instead of your uncle. The puzzles are many and great, the humor is plentiful and the game all around reminds me of a lighter humor than Portal. Would recommend. Would buy sequel. Looking at the DLC. If you loved Portal you'll enjoy this.
1076	1	a	9/10 Addictive iOS gameplay
1878	1	a	Me likey. I'd cut off my balls and sell them on ebay just to play 5 minutes of this game. Its cereal guys. For realzies.
2588	1	a	Its a very good game 
702	1	a	Brilliant game. The games are fast paced and tactical, you hae to make risks to win but if it all goes wrong it won't be long until the next game. Nice simple concept with great execution of the game itself. If you want to try a fast paced tactical board game then go for it. Not tried online multiplayer but solo and 'pass about' multiplayer are great.
4524	1	a	It's an old game that I used to play and loved. If you like sim games this is a good one. Just make sure you turn off the time before you leave the game or all your fish will die.
2940	1	a	Its great because you can choose how you want to play: Do you want nobody to notice you? Do you want to finish the level as fast as Sanic? well you can... Infact you can be sanic and be stealthy.
1420	0	a	If you want to waste money on something completely ridiculous which you probably won't spend more than a few minutes on...  then lock your money away untill you regain sense. But if you fail to do so, you might as well buy this.
927	0	a	This game looks cute and beautiful, and seems to be a nice match-3 game mingled with RPG element. However, if you are looking for a game like the Puzzle Quest series, you won't find anything that can even see the dust at the tail of PQ; you should get 10,000,000/you must build a boat instead, which are much better than the Legened of Fae. For the first several levels, the game may be interesting, but after that, the combat becomes quickly repetitive and the story progresses very slowly. The seemingly level-up system does not work well, as it does not give you the feeling of becoming stronger and more versatile in battles (the effects of the combo spells and summons are not worth the efforts for casting them). In addition, most monsters in later stages have special abilities, which makes the circumstances in combat chaotic. The music is just so so; the sound effect is alright at first, but after a handful of battles this rapidly become old and annoying due to the lackness of variation.
557	1	a	Another digital variant of greatest tabletop game. Very colourful, plays smooth, and well supported by developer. Must buy..NOW.
1949	1	a	Some Men Just want to watch the world burn 9/10
1877	1	a	Great game for COOP LAN fun
1860	1	a	Best played in coop.
5131	1	a	This game is a diamond in the rough. It's an isometric, much-simplified Dwarf Fortress, with a basic campaign and a sandbox mode. The graphics and voice acting are simple but enjoyable, with a good sense of humor. The mechanics are exactly what is needed in this genre; you dig, you accumulate resources, you move up a tech tree, and then you dig too deep and watch your dwarves die terrible deaths. One of my favorite indie games.
791	1	a	Fun game. Plays just like the boardgame.
983	1	a	What a lovely game!  A prematurely silver 21-year-old engineer named Miranada repeatedly and politely puts down any sexism against her from the male characters with her competence and confidence.  There's an adorable robot.  There's an adorable squirrel. The interactions with the squirrel made me nostalgic for the Ken and Roberta Williams days of the old Sierra King's Quest games. Very clever; great attention to detail.  The art is beautiful.  The puzzles are interesting and engaging.  For a Hidden Object Game, the plot is absolutely spectacular and the characters are rich and entertaining.  Great casual, low stress game for next time you're stuck in bed sick for the day.
2768	1	a	A VERY fun game. The characters are very diverse but each useful. Many of the levels players can just run around and work pretty much alone, but some of them require real teamwork- those are the best and the most rewarding. The campaign's extra levels don't add much in my opinion, but the core campaign is great.  The levels often take between 30-45 minutes to complete 100%. It's enough that it starts to get pretty intense, but not to the point where you're not willing to try a level again if you fail. The gold scattered around levels is simply irresistible to grab; most everyone I've played with just won't finish the level without getting 100%, but it's sometimes a real risk.  The level making community seems to be taking off really well now; I hope enough players start working through those and not just the campaign. There's REALLY great stuff in there.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to stealth lovers.   I got this game in a Humble Bundle.
2738	1	a	Actually a fun little game. Great for one player or multiplayer. The jobs really matter and it feels like everyone contributes. My only criticism is about five stages in or so, the difficultly really gets ramped up, so it's harder to find multiplayer teams to do those levels.  Still, a solid game.
3297	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute, creative, charming, simple to play, easy to master RPG set in Halloween. There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.  Speaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.  In battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.  The combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.  When the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.  The enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.  When you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.  You can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.  When party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.  Every battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.  On the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.  Every costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.  In all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.
3321	1	a	To be Honest I Love This game But,Yeah The levels 3 level + 1 bonus level ( forget the name :p ) to short  Why don't you play ? Play this on fall would more great .  (-) : I said above , the levels to short and isn't pretty good .  65% Postive and the rest is negative . Overall Graphic : 6.5/10 (not bad) Gameplay : 5.6 ( enough ) Character : 7.6 ( Well,Done)  That Just my Opinion , if you don't like it just ingrone it .
3620	1	a	Another quirky game put together by the Double Fine team. This time they put together a solid turn based rpg with some more of their well known humor. It's relatively short clocking in around the 5-6 hour mark but it was definitely worth a playthrough.   9.0/10.0
5268	1	a	This is the wrong message for little kids: hide in the grass from your parents, then run away when they are not looking. Also after sucessfully escaping, try to solve problems plauguing the entire world.
2299	1	a	Cant recommend this more, 9 out of 10, if you like Hotline Miami, youll probably go for this as well.
2006	1	a	Flawless gameplay. Great for solo and co-op play.
5522	1	a	bring back the memoriesof the nes era....this is what all games are all about....fun...
1243	1	a	At first when I played this, I was a bit worried that I had wasted my money.  I WAS HORRIBLY MISTAKEN. This game is a GREAT game for when you are bored, or just looking for A COMPLETELY AMAZING TIME. I would highly reccommend this to anyone out there looking to play the next game of the year 2016.  Great concept, great controls, I WANT MORE!
2571	1	a	LOVE IT, BUT I ONLY PLAYED FREE. :/
1586	1	a	Monaco is by far one of the best co-op games I've played.  Due to the game's amazing accomodation to differing playstyles, Monaco can be a stealth game, shooter, or simply a run and gun race against the clock depending on how you play it!  I was extremely excited for this game to come out, and it definitely lived up to the hype: polished controls, amazing soundtrack, accomodating to multiple playstyles (not only with the different classes, but with the tools involved as well), and overall just a barrel of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Monaco, whether you plan on playing alone, with friends, or with complete strangers.  That feeling when you pull off a perfect heist? Nothing compares.
3982	1	a	Straight Forward. Simple. Addictively Fun.
4027	1	a	Costume Quest is a really nice little RPG based around halloween with the costumes each having unique powers which are required for both combat and to advance through the games levels. Like most other Double Fine games i've seen the graphics are cute, cartoon-style and well suited to the atmosphere. Gameplay isn't particularly challenging but it is enjoyable, if you are struggling at any point then you have most likely missed some upgrade or other.
1317	1	a	like skyrim with guns
339	1	a	Awesome game. I like to play it in short bursts and it's always satisfying to play it when you're bored.  Superb controls, great graphics, multiple modes and an awesome soundtrack makes this game a winner that keeps you coming back.  Works very well with a controller.
853	0	a	Terrible game!  F2P that requires gold to be purchased constantly.  Make the game cost $10 and I would buy it. I refuse to throw money into a game where each match costs 2-4 gold bars PER match.
786	1	a	It made me want to buy a physical copy, so it fulfilled its purpose. Fun.
2375	1	a	Awesome game  +Playable with 3 friends (good for LANs) +Any Character combination is useful +Skipable Text +Level Editor +Can be played for 5 minutes or 5 hours and be still fun  -Guards seem dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥
324	1	a	like this game only i cant play it for hours 10/10
1722	1	a	This game drives me nutty. When im hacking as the hacker my shingy dingy gets in a twist and all these popo mcgees are all up in my grill. This is the overall reason for me being shamwowed by the judges badonka donk after the part time security guards latched me to a subway car and sent me down to the station. Monaco is a fantasmic game about litterally stealing from every place robbers shouldn't be stealing from; Hospitals, Embassies, and even hotels. The creators of this game are hands down the smartest people on this planet, because I would have never thought to rob a hospital for a quick buck. 10/10 would rob again.
2278	1	a	What happens when you couple a formula for the perfect heist thriller with gameplay found in staple arcade games? You get Monaco: What's Your Is Mine.  All of the key players are here, the game allowing you to play as one of eight unique character classes. The Locksmith is a master at unlocking - duh. The Lookout can see things that are outside the normal point-of-view, The Pickpocket has a monkey companion that will assist in collecting loot, The Cleaner can take out guards from behind, The Mole can devestate through certain obstacles with ease, The Gentlemen is a master of disguise, The Hacker can disrupt electronics from anywhere a socket is available, and the Redhead is a charmer able to coerce anyone that might be on to her.  The controls are very simple, you move, and certain objects can be interacted with simply by moving into them, such as picking a lock or slipping through the windows, or crawling your way through the ventaliation system. There is a sneak button and another button that allows you to use the gear you may be carrying.  The numerous stages featured in Monaco, which cover everything from casinos to caverns are riddled with security cameras and guards on patrol to keep you from reaching your goal. Fortunately there are numerous tactics you can use to approach your goal, stealth being the key in this title; perhaps moving through the shadows being left unseen is the best method? Or perhaps you're feeling bold and want to distract the guards using a smoke bomb here and there. Or do you prefer to wear a disguise and move freely incognito? Sounds like fun, right?  Between these unique characters, their special abilities and the gear, this game offers variety.  The visuals are appealing; bright colorful pixels fill in detailed reproductions of landmarks across the city in this French Riviera. The contrast between the grayscaled unseen and the bright enviornment make a stunning effect.  You should think about purchasing this one. It's definitely fun with other players, especially friends - and a means to communicate of course, or feel free to escape these tunnels and constructs alone, the choice is yours.
1756	1	a	I'm a civ player and something is telling me that I'd really like monaco.
3815	1	a	This game is great for those that are looking for a casual experience. Even better is that it's suitable for all ages, so don't let the name or theme fool you. I particularly liked the humor in this game. The variety of costumes and abilities however, is offset by the fact that soon after you get the basics of the game, battles become very tiresome. The game also offers a bit of strategy... no seriously, combining the correct costumes with the correct abilities (battle stamps), and choosing who attacks what and with what is pretty enjoyable, challanging, and evenrewarding once you reach the harder enemies.  All in all, this game is casual, so if you're looking for adventure or action, you've com to the wrong place.
4054	0	a	This game is fun. But the controls do not make sense. Like if you have Windows 8 the windows button if you press that it will â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. Plus this game is horrible I don't even know why i won this I should've let someone else win it You'll press each single â¥â¥â¥â¥ing key.
4783	1	a	There should be a LEVEL EDITOR that would be so COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
462	1	a	  Amazing music you guys can break the bank with this soundtrack alone.
1805	1	a	Heist game that is recommended only to those that like sneaking around and doing certain missions. Great game to have just to fill in your time real quick.
4512	1	a	Nice plant simulator with puzzle. Have to stop myself from losing myself in it. Hope to retry a new level again soon.
1737	1	a	An extremely fun rogue-like co-op game. Distinctive styling and fun atmosphere.
2060	1	a	Unbelievebly good! Pick it up if you can, makes a great controller enabled game + has brilliant multiplayer. Get some friends round if you can and play single screen. My friend bought this at full price while we were at his house and we were bored, and it was the best Â£12 we ever spent. He loved it so much he 100%ed it within a week (normal for him). And then we went back a month later and discovered there were 2 new campaigns! Just seriously, get it!
3908	1	a	What's not to love about Costume Quest? 1) It's Double Fine. 2) It's related to Halloween. 3) It's epic! If you love well written turn-based combat adventure games with a twist then you'll love this. Played it originally on Xbox 360 and it was awesome, played it again through Steam and it's still awesome! Really pleased the Grubbins on Ice DLC was included too, a nice addition!
2376	1	a	fast paced game similar to risk of rain or hotline miami
4004	1	a	Nice little RPG, is short (around 10 hours) and the combat system is very simple, however it has a good setting and some humor.
4750	1	a	Only bought it for the tf2 items, never played it before in my life
3155	1	a	This game does justice to the puzzle genre. The music is good, the visuals are good, the difficulty ranges from fair to very difficult, and with more than 150 levels it won't leave you wanting. The physics are good, it implies that you have to use speed along with wit. Sometimes not everything will go the same way twice, which can be frustrating, but it's not a bug - if you throw a ball on the ground it won't always bounce the same way. You will have fun, you will get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you will be back again...and even if you're not a patient person, just quit - come back later, maybe you'll see it in a different way.
1571	1	a	One of the best crime simulation games of the year. Play and plan with your friends the prison break, infiltration, and other jobs. Customize your own levels. Live a life of crime!
3952	1	a	There's almost nothing to it, but it's still a terrific game. Funny, well written, looks great and I'm glad the option for a female protagonist is present. Someday in the future around October I'll *make* my kid play this.
4530	1	a	very fun and has a nice puzzle..   9/10 for the gameplay 10/10 for 3 years old tribal chief..
3358	1	a	Cute, though a little tedious at times. I played it through once, but probably wouldn't repeat. Worth it even as an adult, particularly if you like DoubleFine-style games.
2695	1	a	A very fun 4 player co-op game if you have 3 other friends to play it with then get it and do so
4340	1	a	I love this game. It's amazing. While yes, it is missing some of the charm of a Katamari game, it is still great.... just because it's the only Katamari style game on PC that exists in the world. Believe me, I know, I tried. It's short, it's cute, and it's somewhat unpolished, but it's still fun.  Buy it.
418	1	a	Pros: Pretty damn fun. Feels difficult, but generally without feeling unfair. Looks cool. Controller support is great, best way to play.  Cons: No rebinding. I'd like to bind the bomb and slomo buttons to the buttons instead of the triggers, but I can't. A few of the game modes feel a little unnecessary. Should probably have some kind of gun upgrades or something, it'd spice the game up and give it a lot more replay value, without it, this game gets old a lot faster than other similar games. Pausing is really funky. You can't pause while you're respawning, a process that takes like 5 seconds, an annoyingly long time if you've gotten a bad start to survival mode or something and just wanna restart. And to further the frustration, the menu takes a little too long to come up, and if you're trying to pause in a hurry and aren't sure it came up, you may accidentally unpause it by hitting it again. In a fast-paced game like this, pauses NEED to be instantaneous, nothing feels worse than dying because you were trying to pause.  But, it's $5, which ain't too bad, so unless any of those things are a dealbreaker, I still recommend it. Good few hours of fun to be had here. If they add more weapons/guns/bullets or whatever, and maybe some gamemodes that aren't just bouncing around a circle, like an actual map, then it's a must have.
4869	1	a	Nice physics puzzle/platformer game. Hardcore like Portal 1 rather than 2. You need brains and mad jumping skills.
5456	1	a	Mmmmm......Retro Shmup!  I would buy anything from Puppygames, I &lt;3 their games!
4803	1	a	If you loved portal you cant miss this one
250	1	a	Amazing super fast paced game for just a few minutes break here and there.  Don't forget to blink!
3809	1	a	All right, Costume Quest was a fun little game. To sum it up in three words: 'Baby's First J-RPG'  The strongest point of Costume Quest is the writing. The banter reminds me of old Cartoon Network shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. It pretty much carried the game for me.  The gameplay itself is familiar from Chrono Triggers and Final Fantasies. Turn-based hit point reduction. I don't see anyone who has played a turn-based game being challenged by the combat.  But in the end, the game is clearly developed for children. And unlike most children's games, this one has intelligence and wit behind it. I would recommend this to people who would like to give their child or child-like entity an easy and painless foray into the wondrous world of turn-based games.
4462	1	a	I thought I would enjoy this game a lot, since I really like games that have you search for hidden objects, or find the differences between two pictures. But this game is hard. Objects are so well hidden, that you regularly have to use the Hint button (at no real cost). I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Probably a good thing, but THIS hard... I'm not sure.  Anyhow, I guess it can be fun with a couple of friends, but if you're playing alone, you basically have all the time in the world. That doesn't make it any easier, but it also doesn't make it any more fun. Still, you can't find a similar game like this on Steam, so if you're into these games this one is a must own.  [Rating: 67/100]
884	1	a	Command &amp; Conquer X Chess placed in real life WW2 battlefield situations. Awesome.
2300	1	a	In The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 20 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scheme that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden.  Overall: 9/10 its okay  Review paid for by: Amazon
845	0	a	Medioce port of the superb board game.  Fails to follow standard WIMP environment conventions - many interface items are clumsy and counter-intuitive.   Net coding is poor - takes way way too long in early rounds when players are mostly just double clicking for cards.  Chat box dissapeared after a couple games with no explanation or apparent way to restore it.  Default player name was taken from email string - for many this is a real name - as a developer you should ALWAYS be getting consent for this first.  Willy nilly decided I was under 13 years of age and need to submit a fax with parental pernission to access - LOL GET REAL - I was 13 a LONG time ago - can't fathom what their thinking was.  Core mechanics are consistent with the board game but there is no improvement either - the same double lane board is shown even when 2-3 player games exclude them - why?  6/10
5266	1	a	Some hard puzzle stuff... enjoy this yellow mofoka ;)
2839	1	a	Best for relaxing and passing your time
3946	1	a	Very fun, would/will replay.  I like the design, the music, the story, the gameplay... the whole thing.  I only wish I didn't have to uncheck every special FX for it to only 'sort-of' run smoothly on my 1-yr old MBA that runs other games without a hitch...  Took me a while to understand I just wasn't *that* bad at hitting a button at a specific time but that it was lagging as heck. Curiously, it's kinda 'better' when played on a huge videoprojector (3m large image) than on my 27' Cinema Display screen as it doesn't lag so much.  Also pad support is good... except when the game 'loses' your wireless pad that disconnected while you were away peeing for 2 minutes and you have to manually (read 'ctrl-q') quit the game because it won't recognize the pad when it reconnects... but it won't recognize your keyboard either. Got used to taking the pad with me for bathroom breaks ^^  Other than that, controls are spot-on and the whole thing is just really fun and just easy/hard enough that you're not discouraged or, at the opposite, feel like a kid.
2049	1	a	Deserves more attention 
2551	1	a	Grab somefriends, and play the living **** out of this game &lt;3
5381	1	a	Bright cheerful little game that is a lot of fun to play. It's not going to set any records but it is the kind of game you will visit again and again in your idle moments. Basically, Space Invaders with bells, there are 100 levels, and as you play you buy upgrades to your gun turret. It's good fun all the way. I really can't think of anything they did wrong with this one. It's simple fun at it's best. Highly recommended.
1139	1	a	not bad but not best i see so much greater F2P games and that game for money?I dont know why but I dont have problem funny,amazing but its not have story ou other gamemodes so its not for me 
122	1	a	This game is quite simple, but is great for when your wifi breaks.
4250	1	a	consume everything, even dogs. seriously though this is a good game  Very similar to Katamari, I like this cute little game a lot. This one of the better games by this developer, I enjoyed the achievements in this game, and the mild frustration it took me to score an A+ on all levels. I would get this game if it were on sale.   I wish there were an option to window it, as nothing works.
3225	0	a	With all my CPU dedicated to this game alone, I couldn't even move the mouse more than an inch per minute. Tried it 3 times and always the same result. Only bought it because of my 90% off coupon but even then, this game is not recommended at all.
523	1	a	A very good digital adaptation of the real board game. Great way to practice for when you want to demolish your friends in real life, and for learning the rules.
3337	0	a	well, everything seems fresh when you start, and then it almost immediately become rinse and repeat. It's pretty terrible for a game this short to be so repetitive, also for the style of humor this game presents, they really should have sprung for voice actors.
3008	1	a	Great game, i thought that it has done what a lot of new games are failing to do and actually grab the audience and drag them in and make them want to play the game. Very good game and it makes you want to play a lot more. Great story mode.
4799	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.  It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
1299	1	a	10/10 best game 2012, 13, and 14
1175	1	a	Pretty awesome game! Never knew!
1783	1	a	How bad are you at stealth games? How bad are your friends at them? This game is a sure way to find out
5224	1	a	An awesome puzzle game, much more fun than first one..
2296	1	a	If you're looking for a fun game to play with friends and while you're on your own than this is the game. It doesn't take very long to get used to the controls and when you do you'll be happy that you bought the game. The heists are very entertaining although there aren't a lot of them but there's no reason to worry because there are community made maps. There are multiple ways to complete the heists and multiple awards to go along with each one, so needless to say you can easily find yourself playing this game for hours on end. Overall great game, extremely fun to play with friends and well worth the money.
4327	0	a	A cheap clone of PS and Xbox's Katamari. It lacks the polish and charm Katamari DID have, and I didn't even like that game. There's no real point, no goal, except for collecting all the junk in the world to become bigger. Uhm yeaaaah... no !  [Rating: 64/100]
2562	1	a	Great game! Makes it worth more when it's on sale. :) But this is a great and addicting game. A must have for the Indie game player
4268	1	a	this game has great visuals and is creative but i feel like it would be better if it wasn't trying to 100% be a katamari damacy clone
527	1	a	A decently fun and quick, if highly random, game. There is one strategy tip that, once you learn it, kind of ruins the game, but it's a pretty fun family game if you don't know about that strategy. Overall, it's an OK time waster against some bots or whatever.
300	1	a	This game rips off quite a lot from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.  A lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.  I haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' 'Crunch Time' and RE2's 'Deadline' operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays ('Bombing Run' in Waves plays much like RE2's 'Pacifism', but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the 'Chase' and 'Rush' modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called 'Waves').  Sadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* 'heavily inspired' by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off.   Also, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.
1931	1	a	petty theft
3944	1	a	This game is so simple, but yet I had a ton of fun. It's short, yet I couldn't stop playing it and beat it within a couple days of starting. If you got it in the humble bundle, it is def worth checking out.
1862	1	a	A great game with well thought out stealth mechanics, interesting characters with helpful abilities (And the pickpocket), and overall amazing sneaky gameplay that challanges your mind, reflexes, and strategic skills.  Or you could just yolo it and run through all the levels real fast and hope nobody catches you like I did.
4427	0	a	.
5411	1	a	Retro style, almost like space invaders. A fresh spin on an older game style.
1303	1	a	Its actually an amazing game! The advert and picture does not do it justice, i was sceptical about buying it, but as it was on offer for Â£1.09 i though 'why not'! So i got it, played it, and i can tell you somthing: i am on the edge of my seat when i play it! Its great fun, just need some better multiplayer servers now, but im sue that will kick off when more people play! Definatley get this game!
4317	1	a	A fun game. A lot like an amateurish Katamari port, sans ball. Worth a few of your dollars, and one or two of your hours.
4097	1	a	love it a good game just feels like game is cheating sometimes :P
2473	1	a	A VERY fun game. The characters are very diverse but each useful. Many of the levels players can just run around and work pretty much alone, but some of them require real teamwork- those are the best and the most rewarding. The campaign's extra levels don't add much in my opinion, but the core campaign is great.  The levels often take between 30-45 minutes to complete 100%. It's enough that it starts to get pretty intense, but not to the point where you're not willing to try a level again if you fail. The gold scattered around levels is simply irresistible to grab; most everyone I've played with just won't finish the level without getting 100%, but it's sometimes a real risk.  The level making community seems to be taking off really well now; I hope enough players start working through those and not just the campaign. There's REALLY great stuff in there.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to stealth lovers.   I got this game in a Humble Bundle.
3976	1	a	Great game.
2709	1	a	
3610	1	a	SO far so good. easy to play. good story. but no map.. you need to remember where you are in the game.  7/10
3316	1	a	Costume Quest is a RPG from mithy Double Fine Productions set in the halloween theme, you combat the evil that had taken over the land, it's style is just like the old final fantasy's games, overall it is a fun and original game!  Rating: âââââ 
2895	1	a	Fairly simple: Get in. Get the goods. Get out. Couldn't possibly mess that up, right?  Wrong.   You can. You will. And you will have fun doing so.   Insanely fun, Monaco is a multiplayer game featuring a top-down view. You can collect various weapons/tools in the game to help you get the goods and get out, Each playble character has their own skills to bring to the table. Some of them are more useful than others, but arguably they all have different callings/playstyles; you just need to figure out which one works best for you and on which map.   Note that this is best played with friends. Although you can solo some of the maps, keep in mind that the game was designed around the idea that you'll be playing with other people, so you'll need multiple skills being brought to the table to ease your mission. You might want to be in call to coordinate efforts.   Have fun stealing stuff and breaking the law.
4987	1	a	The comparisons with Portal are perhaps too easy to point to. This too is a first-person puzzle game with a touch of humor and the use of crazy and original mechanics to move around and solve each 'room'. It too has an eloquent and at times hilarious narrator following your actions and guiding you. It too has tons of little humoristic details spread throughout the environment that you can choose to ignore or you can choose to tirelessly search for and explore. You may say that's a bad thing, for a game to piggy ride on the very effective premise that Portal pioneered. But I also think that if you're like me and after replaying Portal for the 20th time you suddenly wish that only there were more games 'like' it, then this game is definitely for you.
5001	1	a	This game has a rather funny story and a nice environment; however, the puzzles are repetitive, the gameplay seems to be the same through the whole game, and sometimes I got frustrated with the game mechanics. I like my Genuine Quadrwangler item in Team Fortress 2 better.
1707	1	a	This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.  Thumbs up!
1628	1	a	I was part of the core group of beta testers for this game and even have my name appearing in its credits. I invested dozens of hours into the work-in-progress version of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise is theft - and you can choose from a handful of different character classes that all possess unique abilities to to pull off a successful theft (the ability to smash through walls, hack into security systems, assassinate guards, pose as guards and more). The game affords for hilarious, whimsical encounters as one progresses through a map collecting treasures that all play into a single narrative or over-arching storyline. If you are a fan of robbery/theft films and games, you'll enjoy Monaco.
2674	1	a	Monaco is chaos, beautiful and organised chaos. I originally played it co-op with a friend and we had a great time trying to pick the perfect combination of characters to crack the missions. We thought with four of us it would be even easier, we were wrong. While four players gave us a wealth of skill it turned the whole thing into hilariously crazy and usually fatal attempts at the missions.
5055	1	a	MOAR PUZZLES. MOAR FUN. YEEEEEEAH. But really if you liked the first one, this had more of that plus some new puzzles. If you ever just want to take it easy and challenge your mind a bit, this is a nice game.
1438	0	a	but there was no joy in penguins arena that day, for mighty sedna had struck out.
2623	1	a	SO MUCH FUN  Accents ftw
2587	1	a	Awesome, Become a stealer and sneak in and out of ships, houses, bruning boats you name it. 9/10 stars 
1715	1	a	really cool game 
2580	1	a	One of the most enjoyable co-op games I've played. 8 unique classes that all have their own abilites that both work well with each other, and fit almost any playstyle. The campaign is straight up film noir, and the levels are very well designed. I haven't even touched any of the Workshop content yet, but that's coming in the future.
4779	1	a	This is certainly a very new and different kind of game. If you've got the dexterity to pull it off, and don't mind dying a lot (which, by the way, is very amusing in this game). this is a good game to get.
5032	0	a	What should be a good game is sadly let down by some really basic bugs, not least one broken achievement, all of which have been around since the game was released. This game isn't supported so they won't be fixed. There are still plenty of puzzles to play though, although it runs at a ridiculously low res so you don't get puzzles that are too complicated (they simply won't fit....). Not sure if there are localised versions, but it is nice not to have to try to think like an american when I'm answering crossword clues.
5037	1	a	A nice Puzzle game, it's ok for kids, and who wants to take a challenge, it's a little hard, but it's ok!
148	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I get bored of shooters or other games. Very fun and challenging with rewarding online gameplay. There is no reason why you shouldn't pick it up for $1.99
3246	0	a	Wow, 1.1 hours on record. I'm surprised it was that long. Unlike some people who feel compelled to finish, I quit when the frustration level got high and that was very quickly. It's not just that the puzzles are difficult to figure out, repeating the same level dozens of times to get the timing was not my idea of fun. Some people may like this sort of thing, but not me.
762	1	a	Pretty fun game, all in all. Nothing much to say really. Based off the board game, rules are pretty simple, and the gameplay itself is fluid and fun. There are...a couple major issues however that may make playing the game a major turn-off for some.  The Good:  +Like I said, gameplay. Simple, board game like, timer to keep you going, etc. If you've played the board game, you'll know what to expect.  +Multiplayer. God, you would wish that this would just be a given, but given the glitches the game has, it's a major plus that it works somewhat properly. So, yea. Nice that it doesn't crash and I can play with my friends. +Music/Speech/Sounds. Nothing to call home about, but they're pretty nice.  The Bad: -Oh god, the interface. So bad. So, so bad. For starters, the conductor will not turn off his initial speech after you've gone through the first menu. It'll repeat, every single time. You can turn that annoying factor off somewhere deep, deep in the settings, but until them, prepare to suffer. -Doesn't always install correctly. So, I got this off of Humble Bundle and am very glad that we had another place to download it from because the Steam version doesn't always install correctly. And, actually, the HB website version required some fixing as well. My friend had to go through some steps before she could get it to work, but, mine worked fine. So, it's a grab bag.  -Confusing set-up. The settings aren't really intuitive. So, making a game, changing something, or doing something isn't really easy and doesn't come with a solid explanation. Shame.  Overall: If you get the game to work, its fun. Nothing really fancy, a very lightweight board game port that passes the time and once you get everything all sorted out is quite fun. If you have the glitches however, good luck.
4549	1	a	Very good game vintage.   The rotating orbits add challenge to the normal tower defense games. Bought in a discount. Good soundtrack.  Good references to B-Sci Fi movies.
3486	1	a	Good game, took me 3 hours to finish, you should buy this when it's on sale. 9/10
4308	0	a	Hey, so that was pretty fun. A few hours spent goofing off in a silly, alternately-stylized Katamari Damacy. How much is this game going for anyway? ...TEN BUCKS? Yeah, save your money people.
4839	1	a	I dont want to just say this game is Portal......but this game is Portal. Instead of portals you get DIMENSIONS. Thats right kids you can mess with the fabric of space time and other fabrics to solve puzzles! WHO DOESNT LIKE PUZZLES? NO ONE THATS WHO. Really though its well designed and has a great deal of charm and save for a few frustratiingly designed puzzles its a damn near perfect game. So give it a shot. I know you'll just wait till its on sale but thats ok. DO A THING!
5099	1	a	This is really fun. However sometimes connection to shop failed.
2482	1	a	I wish i had more people to play this with!
455	1	a	Incredibly addicting and engaging. Looks and feels fantastic. Easy to pick up and great for small sessions. If you're doing well in Waves, you feel like you're in a trance. It's become my comfortgame.
4463	1	a	Personally I would give it a neutral rating; it's not too bad, but it has its frustrating moments.  Good: - The game show idea is great - Mini games bring fresh ideas - Hidden Object fans will still waste time because, you know, we have to find all the things :)  Bad: - The graphics are very dated - Some objects are incorrectly grouped - Some objects are just a blur of pixels, good luck figuring out what they are  It's good enough to pick it up in a bundle :)
2429	1	a	Monaco is a very interesting take on a stealth game (Unless you're one of those people who just run throught stealth sections like nothing). It's hard to describe, but the gameplay is pretty darn fun. The soundtrack is wonderful, as well.
3087	1	a	10/10
1827	1	a	A fun 2d birds eye view 'Stealth game'. Despite being fun, it is infinitely more fun if you play with 4 people in a skype chat.
3838	1	a	It'sooo cute and full of lovely details. It's funny to check out all the sweet costumes and play with the possible fight marks. I missed a bit a game mode where I can have endless fights to play with the costumes.
1623	1	a	The Steam Chamber takes a look at Monaco, a four player co-op heist game, from Pocketwatch Games.           YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Monaco: What's Yours is Mine - Review - Steam Release - Multiplayer Gameplay&nbsp;
4660	1	a	I love this practically new genre of tetris match 3 and RPG and this one is fun.
1408	1	a	Good game, and it get better playing multi-player, but theres the problem, the community its dead. 84/10
1873	1	a	This is a very fun game!
881	0	a	Pay to win, need i say more!
2751	1	a	An over the top heist game with an amazing art style and soundtrack. This game is a blast to play with friends.
2479	1	a	I'd definitely recommend it. It doesn't punish your for screwing up too much, although it will make it a little harder. It's not a 'camp in one spot until the guard leaves' kind of game. You can be really agressive if you want. And best of all: It isn't a linear hand holder. You just think, 'Gee, I need to rob a bank. Where would the money be?'
2304	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, what an interesting game, the combat system is slightly damaged, however the AI are incredibly intelligent - Whatever You do, they sense that there is perculiar behaviour. Monaco is a very clever Heist Simulation Game, with different classes to choose from - Ranging in abilities to give Heists different approaches which I extremely enjoyed. Although, Monaco has a downside, there are limited Heists and after playing for a while - The Game just gets tedious. I incredibly enjoyed the filters avaliable in Monaco - Such as the Zombie Mode (Zonaco) and Classic style Monaco. Overall, a great game, definately worth the small sum that this game is avaliable for. Also, take note that this Game is frequently on the Steam Specials for even lower prices.
3661	1	a	An adventure through the eyes of a child. Great story, good writing, decent enough interface and controls to get the job done, and a lot of overall fun. A tad short, but sweet.
477	0	a	This was a good game. However, they have updated it a couple of times and each time the game got worse. The game itself is good, though it would be nice if you could change the diffulculty settings (it's fairly easy). The artstyle was better in previous versions, but the worst part is that the settings don't work anymore (for example the fast speed button is broken). And worst of all is the increasing amount of banners, pop-ups and other commercial in-game activity that cannot be shut down. Verdict: good game, but increasingly annoying interface. Buy on sale for low price.
5187	1	a	I was considering giving this a thumbs down because it's a paid game with DLC and IAP's. I enjoyed the gameplay enough to consider it a recommendation though.
4584	1	a	
304	1	a	This game has a unique storyline behind it, amazing graphics and excellent detail. It is for hardcore , intense and adrenaline loving gamers. I can see this game becoming more popular than the Minecraft franchise and more detailed than The Last Of Us: Remastered.  This game is no joke.
2921	1	a	A very fun Indle/Stealth/Heist game like PAYDAY 2. I suggest it for playing Co-Op with your friends!!
377	1	a	I've had Waves sitting in my library for some time now, but have only recently gotten around to giving it a solid go. Waves offers up a fairly simple arcade arena shooter. You might associate 'simple' with some sort of negative - not at all. The mechanics on offer here all gel well together to create something that you can pick up for a short playthrough and have a great time.  It would be amazing to see a multiplayer (co-op) mode and see how far you and a friend could get. Given the various game modes on offer, I can imagine some interesting co-op mechanics to keep the pace going.  As it stands, this is a fun little shooter that is perfect to pick up when you have a few minutes of down time.
4372	0	a	This game is a direct ripoff of Katamari Damacy. Only they forgot to include the part where its supposed to be fun -.- I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. :p
747	1	a	Just like the physical game but plays much faster.
1716	1	a	i have no idea what im doing i r8 8/8 m8
5372	1	a	I love the modifications in this. All the titan games these guys made are a blast!
5408	1	a	If you've played Space Invaders (and who hasn't at some point?) then you already know what this game is about.   That said, it's not a direct clone. There are upgrades you can get, along with some special weapons.   Yeah, I know. This doesn't sound very exciting. Well, it's not the most thrilling game in the world, but it's cheap, easy to play (in that it requires virtually no time commitment), and has extremely low PC requirements. So it's a good little time waster, for those situations where you've got too much time to just sit around, but not enough time to play a more in-depth game.  Something else this game has -- that I really like -- is it saves your game whenever you exit, no matter where you are or what you're doing. It's more of a 'save state' in that your saved game is erased as soon as you load it. There are checkpoints are certain intervals, so if you die you don't need to start from the beginning (but you might have to redo a few levels).  If you've got young kids, this would be a good game for them as well. It's not overly complex and there's no adult themes to worry about.
2274	1	a	Monaco manages to give the feels of a good Esport, which is what is is, albeit in co op form. Can a strictly coop focused game be an esport? can it have a coloful and unique story inspired by classic heist films and retro 80's gaming alike? Monaco is the ultimate coop heist simulator, forget payday 2. The wildy different characters all have interesting backgrounds and more importantly their skills are essential for working together to complete each heists. A great scoring system gives it amazing replayability. Monaco is a game that teaches me new things about it's mechanics every time I play, it's nuanced design has so much buried under it's neon noir 80's gaming style and it looks gorgous while it showcases it's depth. The split screen function will get a lot of use in this household, as Monaco is also quite acessable. I had good times with a work buddy and a 5 year old guest alike, Reccomeded for pretty much anybody with a passing interest in coop gaming.
394	1	a	Waves is an arcade action game that is slightly less twitchy than Beat Hazard and Scoregasm. The game features a variety of modes that help keep the action refreshing and the addtion of controller support and widescreen modes are welcome. The graphics are not amazing, but the use of a ball instead of a space ship adds a physics element to the challenge missing in other similar titles. The music is average, not particularly bad nor memorable but taken altogether Waves is an above average entry into the field. I recommend this game to anyone who likes either action or strategy, and particularly players that prefer gamepad controller play.
1319	1	a	Ees good gam. has dank pingu memes, is cool, n its accually pretty good. it doesn't really look like an accual game, but it is. buy it. i think. get it on sale. ye. do that.
4814	1	a	I love physics games and I love puzzle games. Quantum Conundrum achieves both of these areas spectacularly with beautifully created graphics and a comedic storyline. Add to this a pretty awesome soundtrack and you get one of my dream games  Basically, it's a fantastic game and if you're at all a fan of physics games or puzzle games you really should try this out
3240	1	a	Its actually a very well made puzzle game. Good graphics, good music, simple challenging gameplay, and plenty of 'AHA!' moments. I really like this game
1671	1	a	I personally like Monaco, and I know this sounds stupid, but I personaly think that Monaco is a 'birdseye' PayDay, but more Stealth than Gun. (Unless you play Gun) Every character has different abilities, so its important you get a charater your good at, and will get the job done. Over all, this is pretty fun, the campain is short, but doing it again with friends brings the meaning back. Personaly, I think the level editor is hard. But It's just not my thing. Worth the $15.00, and gives you a hindsight experiance of tense moments of the ultimate hiest.
4952	1	a	3d puzzle games that requires you to work between dimensions, The main Story puzzles are Easy. but doing the challenges might be a bit more difficult than you think.  Did I forget to Mention the narrator is john de lancie
182	1	a	Rubik's cube Death simulator.   This game. IS just amazing.   The gameplay is so random at times. For all you know you're going great, but then. Nope. Sometimes you want to connect blocks up so you can execute them together.
2166	1	a	Disappeared for a whole year, came back, still an awesome game. A bit buggy and I got disconnected a few times today but I would definitely recommend it..
890	1	a	It's a nice I like.
5350	1	a	DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at  www.stanislavcostiuc.com.  I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.  Titan Attacks is a remake of the classic Space Invaders. On steroids. With upgrades and a big enemy variety, and by the end it gets so intense that it transforms into a bullet hell game. The distortion effects on the screen are very annoying though, but, luckily, you can turn them off. So, all in all, itâs pretty cool. If you were into these classic games, or want to try out a modern (though still fairly faithful) take on said classic games, then you should try it out.  In fact, I think more classic games should get a modern take like Titan Attacks (which seems like what PuppyGames is doing anyway). â¦ Hm. I think I just got inspiration for what kind of game my next side project should be. Thanks, PuppyGames!  Although, on a side-note, I have to say that due to all the upgrades you can get, and how many enemies there can be, the strategic value of having to time your shots well (which was present in Space Invaders and the beginning stages of Titan Attacks) gets diminished, which is somewhat saddening. On the other hand, the curve of starting with the more slow-paced and strategic Space Invaders and then transforming into a hectic bullet hell provides a nice flow and pace to keep you interested throughout all 100 waves (at least on the first playthrough before you start over with all your upgrades intact).  So, yeah. Titan Attacks. Not much more to say, really.
926	1	a	It took me 14 hours over two(?) days to finish the game on the basic difficulty level. I did that while having a headache on two occasions and one session lasting until 3am.  As you might guess, I liked it a lot. Then again, I bought it at 75% discount or comparable. If you see such an offer and like match-3 games, give it a shot. If it's got a demo, give that a shot right now.
1921	1	a	It will make you yell at your girlfriend. Therefore, all I can say in review of this title is that if you enjoy getting laid, never play it with her.
3294	0	a	So basically it was Cut the Rope before actual Cut the Rope hit the market. The problem is, that to cut the chain here you have to select it first and then click the selected chain to cut it. While it could be entertaining in 2009, it's not really impressive in the age of mobile gaming.
3986	1	a	Game Mechanics are boring, but if you're looking for abnegation, this is it.
892	1	a	AI is a filthy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cheater, 10/10, would get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed in the â¥â¥â¥ with 3 tank rolls on the first turn.
4152	1	a	I can stop playing it, help!
2401	1	a	Good fun multiplayer gameplay, new aspects to the gaming world, 8/10
1071	1	a	just buy it, dont ask why just buy it
70	1	a	BUY ON SALE  The game is cute, the puzzels interesting -- but over all it is SHORT. The game really feels more like an intro chapter than a complete game.   I'm sort of ambivalant on whether or not the fantastic art makes up for the less than an hour game play. The story line is more like a story premis since you don't actually get anywhere. But I did have fun, so buy it but not at full price.
4239	1	a	I find it weird that not many people have this indie game. Sure it has its negative points, like unpolished, bad responsive controls and I personally didn't like the camera angle or the music much. But none the less I enjoyed it. Especially the level where you absorb as much candy as possible. The levels are fun and a big variation of objects. It will be challenging to clear the levels but if you look for a fun and casual game..
2586	1	a	Fantastic. The game has great graphics, simple, yet intriguing, game mechanics, and a nice little class selection list.
4415	1	a	if you like relaxing and casual puzzle games then this one is for you.  the graphics are kind of aged and you can't even select another screen resolution but it gets the job done. however scaling the game to your actual screen resolution may cause everything to look slightly blurred.  the game starts easy and relaxing but gets more challenging later on. usually there is a time limit for each level so you don't have all day to finish the job but as soon as you get a grip on the game that shouldn't be a big problem. if you feel stuck just try another bonus ability and you should be able to make it through the game without breaking a sweat.  it takes about 7 hours to finish the game. i had to do it twice because i missed a piece of the map that makes you find the hidden chapter and sadly the game doesn't let you replay chapters. so that was a minor annoyance but it didn't keep me from having fun on the second run as well.  what can i say? i'm a perfectionist. no level gets left behind!
4401	0	a	Cheap mans Katamary Damacy, fun for an hour, not much more. Also pretty glitchy.
2570	1	a	asome game love every thing about it i would have liked more lvls and more playable chrachters but still a great game
209	1	a	'But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents!'  Fun game (bit challenging tho), great soundtrack.
3120	1	a	*Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.*
1654	1	a	One of the first Indie games that I can honestly say I enjoy. Interesting gameplay that provides challenge on a number of levels. So amazingly fun to play with others. Not really fun to play alone, but there is a good way to easily match up with others in public lobbies. Has in-game voice chat for communication, which is absolutely necessary to do well.
334	1	a	Feels kindoff like playing pacman with an arsenal of guns and bombs at your disposal. Had a blast, no pun intended.  9/10
1560	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the best co-op games I have ever played.
3703	1	a	I've only played this game for about 45 minutes.  kek.
2947	1	a	this is interesting......
3387	1	a	The combat gets repetitive very quickly(a lot of the cutscenes can be canceled by pressing shift key - thank god) but the other stuff is preety good. If the game is on sale it is definitly worh buying.
2490	1	a	Great in coop
3656	1	a	A quick and fun game, extended play through feels a bit repetative but enjoyable for run-through-and-finish play style. More aimed at a younger audience but fun none the less.
1524	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game.  I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.  So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.  This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try.  
1357	1	a	10/10 -GameStop Has penguins and snow balls
1306	1	a	  Best 8 minutes of my entire life, 10/10 cured my cancer cleaned my pores and brought my grandma back from the dead to say goodbye to the family. Would not reccommend
1759	1	a	It was great fun playing with friends. I recommend you buy the 4 pack! It's especially fun when someone messes up, everyone starts to panic!
2924	1	a	Reminiscent of old school top view games action adventure games. Play as multiple characters with different abilities that influence the way you complete the game. Best with multiple people.
3865	1	a	Solid, fun game. The combat is very lacking and boring/repetitive (though the costumes are INCREDIBLE), but if you can push through that the rest of the game is very enjoyable, cute, and actually does a decent job of being reminiscent of going on adventures as a kid.
4271	1	a	The pc version of Katamari Damacy. And not a bad 'inspired by' conversion either. Biggest problem? It's too short. Music and sound effects are top notch and it's quite challenging even in its simpleness. Buy it on sale! 
1000	1	a	Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.  The basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.  If getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.  Snuggle Truck is okay.
5035	1	a	Slicker than Puzzler World 1, but can lead to frustration using the mouse for things the keyboard previously did (for me at least). New puzzle types, but essentially the same game, volume 2. Did not offer the option of 'American' English vs 'British' English, which has led to a few small instances of confusion.
3290	1	a	Well worth the $1.09 price tag... Just smoke a bowl and play...
106	1	a	It is a fun game
1444	0	a	Seriously no... Even tho it's cheap it's not worth more than 10 hours of your time.
1620	1	a	I'm the mole now.
4140	1	a	An RPG with a gem-matching game as combat. It works too! There's quite the range of RPG elements.You have quests, you level up and spend skill points, there is gear, crafting, companions, you can tame enemies and make them your mount or learn their abilities, you can capture cities and collect taxes from them, there are taverns where you pay to hear gossip, as you progress through the main story you unlock other areas of the map, etc. There's also some amazing music. The only downside is the endless wandering monsters, which you run into every few steps when you travel, and even though there's no question you will defeat them, you still need to play the gem-matching game. But this is an annoyance that many RPGs with turn-based combat have. If you like RPGs AND gem matching games (you've got to like both), and you don't mind old school 2D graphics, then this game will be worth it.
1678	1	a	I lost all of my friends playing this
1553	1	a	It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol   seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...  Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love. It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone.   Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game, where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.
985	1	a	It's an okay game, but I finished it quickly.
512	0	a	After a year of good use, Ticket to Ride has ceased functioning. Support is had to access. I have tried what is suggested in forums and have no way to directly inform Steam or Days of Wonder of my problem.  Steam initiates normal logon, but then cuts to a black screen--no messages.  At Days of Wonder all attempts to 'play' directly similarly lead to a non-even, a white screen invoting me to check out or purchase products.  Both show my account in good standing. How do I access an EFFECTIVE repair. I've spent 90 minutes trying what you a;lready suggest.
1760	1	a	Tons of fun with four people. Good controls, good AI and just a great game overall.
5264	1	a	This game is amazing and you owe yourself to play it.
2790	1	a	Great game you should buy it 
5086	1	a	Fun game to play. I wish there was a little bit more to do in the game. Some random events or special units or items might give it a stronger appeal to more people. All in all its worth $10.00 for a few days of good game play.
867	0	a	I enjoyed the free maps and the game and even considered buying gold to play the other maps. But sadly i realized that even if you spend the gold on a map you must buy it again each time you want to play that map. As many of the other people that have reviewed this game, I must say it to, Just buy the board game it will save you more money then spending it on this. 4/10 Rating
4664	0	a	Terrible port and sadistic difficulty. Avoid at all costs.
4671	1	a	Until hell freezes over and the almighty Gaben decides to release the holy trinity, I guess we'll just have to settle for this game for now. It's not a bad game though, especially for its low price.  Much like Portal, this game is a good puzzle platformer game that features some very unique mechanics that is also backed up with a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, it lacks the story and environment that the Portal series is known for. Along with its over reliance on timing and platforming, this can be a hard game to push through at times.  Overall though, it's still a solid game and wouldn't be a bad idea to pick up on sale If you've got an itch for more Portal action.
2254	1	a	Very unique. Very fun. Amazing co-op. Own it on many platforms and would buy on PS4 if available.
680	1	a	Good game - plays like the actual board game!
2241	1	a	Simple but engaging gameplay. Harder than it looks. Great game
1263	1	a	best 8 minutes of my life
2965	1	a	This game is not dissapointing. i thought i would want to try it and then refund it but no its actually REALLY fun i love it its like payday but in 2d
2008	1	a	it is a good game with stealth mechnichs like the spy in  tf2
1641	1	a	8/10  very nice co-op game.
4732	1	a	This game is easily worth twice what they are charging. Puzzles are smart, and the polish is fascinating.
1886	1	a	Pretty cool game
67	1	a	love it puzzles not my thing had to look them up as I got stuck on them alot :-P
1022	1	a	Snuggle Truck is without a doubt the most hardcore game in existence. Think Dark Souls, but without equipment and progression, but you die a little inside every time you lose a level.  10/10
1972	1	a	Such neat, much hipster, many fun. Wowe.
4994	1	a	Great puzzle game with many layers! If you liked the style of Portal, then this game is probably a good buy for you.
1584	1	a	A quirky, yet addicting multiplayer rob-em-up. Lots of different roles, lots of levels, fantastic style and music, lots of depth to the gameplay. Very unique and different, worth the price.
4347	1	a	Pls buy game
4436	0	a	Preliminary note: As I write this, I'm done with 15 fields out of what seems like 20. I've unlocked every upgrade available and I'm still amassing money with no idea about what I'll actually do with it.  This game is definitely not bad. The puzzle system itself is intriguing, the aesthetics are nice and clean, and for a while, there's a good feeling of progression. I have some issues though: -The puzzle system is anything but relaxing. This game really feels like it ought to give you the time to think about potential moves. However, not only is there a time limit, but after a while you start seeing all sorts of critters and other things that threaten to destroy your crops. It makes the game feel frantic in a bad way, as it makes it hard to enjoy the strategic puzzle gameplay. -After you get every upgrade, the game starts feeling like a bit of a chore. There's just really nothing to aim for anymore, and it gets tedious.  I still managed to enjoy myself playing this, but I feel like I've seen all it's got to offer, so I will probably uninstall it shortly to avoid getting sick of it. Overall, not a bad game, but not one I'd go out of my way to play.  Note: This kind of game is the reason I wish the review system had a 'neutral' choice instead of a yes or a no.
3587	1	a	What's not to love about Costume Quest? 1) It's Double Fine. 2) It's related to Halloween. 3) It's epic! If you love well written turn-based combat adventure games with a twist then you'll love this. Played it originally on Xbox 360 and it was awesome, played it again through Steam and it's still awesome! Really pleased the Grubbins on Ice DLC was included too, a nice addition!
4867	1	a	Just barely a thumbs up. This is a portal clone that is mostly well-done. It just has a feel of tediousness and samey-ness to many parts of it. The voice acting is great, but the writing feels a bit lacking. The puzzles were ok, and I didn't mind most of the platforming. There were plenty of parts though where there was so much retry-after-failure due to precision jumping that it became aggravating.  Maybe it was just because I was doing most of the game in one long run, but by the end, the game felt more like a chore than fun.  It is a decent portal-like game overall, but take plenty of breaks while playing.
1334	1	a	Actually a pretty good FPS game. It's lighthearted but fast-paced and fun to play. Devs are still active as well. Why not give it a go?
1592	1	a	Summary: Heist simulator 2013 Multiplayer: 4 Completion: 5 hrs Cards: Yes Cloud: Yes  When you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.  In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.  The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.  Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.  If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.  If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.  While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!
2594	1	a	I like the game a lot. I want to play more of it but I don't have money to spare to get it. Buy it play it have fun.
2337	1	a	Probably one of the most fun games I've ever played with a friend, period.
2929	1	a	I open the van and step into the light drizzle of rain. A bolt of lightning flashes, illuminating the grand museum that holds artefacts that wait to be stolen. The rest of my group, The Lookout, The Locksmith, and The Pickpocket, stand by my side. I smile sinisterly, 'Lets go rob a museum.' 
1240	1	a	The most hardcore penguin game i have played
2295	1	a	A better heist simulator than Payday, if you ask me. There are multiple ways to approach a problem, and the different levels never get repetitive. Fantastic colorful graphics, and one of the best soundtracks.
4694	1	a	The first thing I can say about this game was it was charming as all getout. It's visually attractive and John de Lancie's voicework provides a lot of character. The puzzles were also sufficiently challenging; most of them had me scratching my head and wandering around the track for many minutes until I finally figured it out. That final 'Aha!' moment is what makes puzzle games interesting to keep playing, and Quantum Conundrum definitely had that.  What I didn't like about this game, however, was that it was trying  too  much to be like Portal. Kim Swift, the director of Quantum Conundrum, was also part of the development team for Valve's critically acclaimed sci-fi puzzler, and it really shows in Quantum Conundrum's story. However, it falls short of being anything interesting. The story, which is mostly told through your uncle's voice through the mansion' intercom system, is pretty bland and painfully unfunny. The final climax at the end of the game is barely a puzzle, and I remember finishing it and saying out loud, 'Was that it?'  Long story short, it's a tight, visually appealing, clever puzzler with some narrative problems that make it feel like a loosely tied together test track from Aperture Labs.
1525	1	a	Mon Dieu, les gardes m'ont vu! :-) This is a unique game, it is different to any other game you've ever played. To really enjoy it, grab 3 friends, get a microphone and act as a team; the best team of burglars that could exist! :-)
3311	1	a	It's another great game by Double Fine. It's got the same humorous dialogue, good story on a smaller scale as compared to some of their other games. Graphics are simple, music has that Halloween feel as it's perfect for playing something like this around October. Gameplay overall is a turn based RPG, it's easy and recommended for beginners of the genre. It does get repetitive but like a said, it's basically an RPG for beginners. My only complaint is that this game needed a map badly. Especially in the first part of the game. It's real confusing and almost took an hour just to find a house I did not go up too. Also the framerate is sort of locked at 30. I disabled the vsync and got it going up to 40 but for the most part this game is locked at 30. It's a 7/10.
340	1	a	It has flashy lights!!!! And explosions!!! Also my body is leaking some fluids, I believe this is what you call a scoregasm!
259	1	a	Without a shadow of a doubt, the best game ever made by someone I know.  Buy it, and help him afford to eat.
1383	1	a	360Âº no scope headshot all of them, got no bonus points. 10/10 would r8 again
2149	1	a	one of the best indie games i've ever play i would rate it 9/10 -012sean 
5362	1	a	90's kids know it 2000's kids know it  The rebirth of one of the best games!   Titan atack  It is space invaders! But Better graphics! Upgrades! And Harder than it ever was! with multiple bosses!(I don't know how many... never passed the first one :c) And of course FUN!  6.8/10!
1173	1	a	This was an epic game Gumboy Tournament is a semi-follow up to 2006's 2D side-scroller Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. What's unique about Gumboy Tournament is that it's not a linear, move-from-the-left-of-the-screen-to-the-right-of-the-screen platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros. The game's levels are closed-off arenas, and the view usually allows you to see most of the level,
4761	1	a	About 7 hours. Puzzles start pretty simple and dull, but you end up doing some cool things, even if theyre mostly not difficult. NPC's personalities may be too goofy for some to take. The ending has zero resolution, it just ends. Overall pretty fun puzzles.
990	0	a	It's better than the first game, but that's not saying much. The first one was absolutely terrible, while this one is merely awful.  The hidden object scenes very inconsistent in difficulty. Most of the objects are glaringly obvious but there's often one or two that are tiny and blend with the background, making them almost impossible to see. This is only made worse by the low resolution. The difficulty progression is also way off; many of the early scenes are far more difficult than ones later in the game. The items in the scenes are quite boring and the player is often required to find multiples of the same object. Some objects are mislabelled, quite badly so in some cases.  The puzzles are for the most part pathetically easy, although, again, some are much harder. And again, this seems to have nothing to do with progression through the game; some are just randomly hard for no apparent reason. Some puzzles lack context, meaning that the only way to solve them is to randomly try things until something works or just wait for the hint bar to charge.  The story is fairly bad, although well acted, and the ending is just rubbish. Perhaps the most annoying thing about it is that it has nothing to do with the story of the first game and in no way addresses the cliffhanger ending from the first. I thought that perhaps it would tie in later on, but nope, it's like the devs just forgot the first game exists. Which in all honesty I can't blame them for since the first game is so atrocious.  Apart from the gameplay itself there are numerous other problems with this game. There are instances where puzzle elements appear almost completely off screen; and by almost completely I mean that only a single pixel is visible. Some objects in the hidden object scenes are behind parts of the interface and so are not visible at all. The click detection is frequently so picky that it refuses to acknowledge that the player has clicked on an object unless the exact couple of pixels that it is happy with are clicked, leading to a great deal of wasted time looking for objects I had already found and clicked on a few times. Also the sound is somewhat bugged. I found numerous instances where lines of dialogue did not play, and at one point the ambient sound in one scene got stuck in a loop and continued to play in every other scene after that.  Having played many HOGs I feel I have a good basis for comparison and I would have to say that this one is not worth it. Not even if it were free. There are many other HOGs that are far better and much more deserving of your time.
98	1	a	Bit pricey for such a short game, but enjoyable and cute and will work well as a full game. They should, whne the full game comes out, make this a free demo.
3144	1	a	Dont know why this game is SO AWESOME. Beautiful art, great music and sound effects, but none of them would work alone. BUT IT WORKS FOR SURE. You must absolutely play this game with your friends, you might have some fun
5048	1	a	Word puzzles, number puzzles, find-a-word ... it's good fun when you only have a few minutes to waste.
3046	1	a	Incredible Fun! Excellent Co-Op action in a fun Retro style.
893	1	a	Memoir '44 is a very fun board game. This is the video game version of the real board game, and it is very fun. The problem is it charges you coins every time you play. The game is free and it gives you free coins to start out with, so you can play quite a few games before you run out. However, when you run out of coins, you have to pay money to continue playing. That really sucks.  I would recommend this game if you are interested in the board game, or if you just want to kill some time playing a board game about WWII. Just know that, eventually, the game will want you to pay to keep playing it. I'm not about to do that, so I guess I am done with this game.
3615	1	a	A simple and fun, not too long, not too short, game. Just what you need to kill a few hours.
3937	1	a	Short, fun little RPG. pretty similar to Mario RPG. Though the last boss is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ compared to the entire game up to that point.
1165	1	a	My buddy and I couldn't connect our gumboys together. This is insanity! Don't buy this game, don't gift, and do not buy 5 other copies. I'm bad and I should feel bad.
932	0	a	The game is inherently not bad, but the formula is executed in a boring and not very exciting way. I would expect a bit more hence I cannot recommend, but if you like a slower interpretation of 'match 3' games this one will be ok for you.
5457	1	a	I'm a sucker for new takes on arcade classics. Titan Attacks! is like Space Invaders, except it's pretty, has character upgrades, and features unique bosses. So it's Space Invaders, but better.
3369	1	a	Adventure RPG about a halloween night where your sibling was kidnaped by evil monsters and you &amp; your friends have to trick-or-treat your way till the end.  - Simple &amp; easy turn-based battles with quicktime events - Casual story, funny dialogues &amp; quests - Different halloween costumes with special abilities which help you in and outside battle - Very childish graphics - Good variety on levels   The perfect game for your children =3 
149	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
3201	1	a	Itâs good game with interesting puzzles which are based on the laws of physics. Some of them are very tricky. Ambient sound is nice too. Moreover, itâs a first game where I got all achievements. ^_^
3788	1	a	What a great little game! With light RPG elements this is probably better suited to younger children but its still a really unique game. Worth picking up and playing if you have 5-10 hours to spare!
2939	1	a	Good multiplayer, interesting concept, and the most important, FUN!
1781	1	a	WIKID GARFIXS. GOOD GAMEPLAY. ITS A TOUGHIE. BRAP.
3448	1	a	Somewhat of a children's game but I had fun anyway.
1562	1	a	Saw this game before its release, and i got it while it was on sale. Its a nice rounded game, the view point is eagle eye third person. and your goal is to steal things, or escape. the story mode has depth as well as many different classes to play as, my favorite class is the hacker, it turns off lights, and even turns off security.
707	1	a	Amazing game. So easy to learn, but very hard to win (on higher difficulties, or against humans)!
725	1	a	If you like board games or just plain FUN games - then I highly recommend Ticket to Ride!It's fun but not complicated and the pace is nice and smooth.
1463	0	a	Not for me, this concept could have been very good if the controls and physics were not so floaty.
2728	1	a	Ingenious game reminiscent of the old breakin capers, complete with all the main prototype characters. It's like Ocean's Eleven without having to look at Brad Pitt and George Clooney all the time.
4715	1	a	This game looks and feels like Portal 2, but is much longer and has it's own very unique game mechanics. If you really liked Portal, but thought it was too short or was lacking something: try this. It's very fun.
2579	1	a	Do not hesitate to purchase.  I welcome you with open arms even if you're damn troll.
3971	1	a	Adorable, fun, AND addictive. What more could you want from a game?
1391	1	a	This, is the end, the only end.  The ground was melting, the food getting scarce , the war erupted. But with our food so reduced who were the ones who had the idea to use fishes as weapons? Was it a warrior from the stern Pinks or a fisher from the dumb Yellows ? Who started to lure the children with booby trapped fishes ? The angry Greens? All these weeks after, I still don't know . All I know is that it was us, the noble Blues who scorched the land with mines stolen to the humans.   All these fights, all this war, the endless labour, the running, the sliding, the teeth in the water, the brief moments of elation: soaring into the air , flying even, just to descend as the flipper of Sedna to angrily push our ennemies off the ground, to push them in the water, to the teeth waiting in the water.   The Blue became the avatars of death, fighting all the other tribes in the ambient chaos of mutual assassinations but in the end we prevailed. Like Sedna said, there could be only one tribe of penguins.  Now, only the Blues. The ground is melting still. The food is scarce again. The teeth in the water. The teeth, in the water.
2355	1	a	This is a very comical game with face-paced action and multiplayer. My favorite character is the PickPocket because hey, who doesn't love money and a pet monkey who steals money from people's pockets?!? The best part of the game is the soundtrack. IT IS ALL ON PIANO AND IT IS MORE BRILLIANT THAN FUC***G MOZART!!! :D
2722	1	a	This is pretty fun on multiplayer!
2640	1	a	I thought this game was very creative, sometimes it would get repeditive but i think it has a great multiplayer feel!
1643	1	a	Excelent, adictive, fujn game to play with friends. thumbs up!
4575	1	a	Tower game kinda fun.
2950	1	a	Utterly amazing co-op play.
5499	1	a	***** blast bombs then enjoy it
3673	1	a	Very cute fun game with a simple enough battle system.
270	1	a	Waves is one those indie games i've never heard or seen before but beats some AAA titles despite being simple.  Things I liked: +Graphics Shiny, coulorfull and eye catching  +Gameplay Has many game modes to keep you entertained  +Soundtrack Motives you to play and it gives a nice touch to the game  +Scores You can compare scores with other players in the world   Things i didn't liked -My right arm hurts. :P
4172	1	a	Fun, casual puzzle game, with lots of replay value if you enjoy trying to become as overpowered as possible with each class (or at least, from what i've seen XD)
3506	1	a	Where to even begin with this one... Costume Quest is something special. The setting is superb and the RPG elements are interwoven brilliantly. The dialogue is really fun to read and I found myself laughing aloud quite often. All of the costumes are really creative and super fun to play around with. This game just gets so many things right that you really owe it to yourself, especially if you enjoy RPGs, to play it.  
1376	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR ALL THE YEARS. MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE. IT'S LIKE TRIBES BUT WITH AWESOME PENGUINS SO IT'S LIKE 20045 TIMES BETTER.
4915	1	a	âââââ
2764	1	a	Amazing multiplayer game with alot of fun and a few ways to play. Sneaky or RUNNING. bought it and fell in love with this game. makes you think as you collect all the coins and then find a guard around the corner. keeps you on your toes
405	1	a	asteroids on acid XD
5365	1	a	I actually enjoy Titan Attacks a lot. There's just not much there to hook you to the game. I would certainly recommend at least considering Titan Attacks if it seems like something you might like.
3418	1	a	I didn't know exactly what to expect when I installed Costume Quest. I was a big fan of Tim Schafer games when I was a kid (Grim Fandango and Full Throttle are some of my favorite 90s video game memories), but found Double Fine ventures like the much-loved Psychonauts to be marred by either clunky gameplay or hideous art decisions. But Costume Quest proves that Tim Schafer's still got it, and within 20 minutes I was a fan again.  Sure, the game doesn't employ high-end graphical techniques, the traditional JRPG style combat moves can take too long, and the game is quite short. It doesn't have a 'deep' story, and doesn't really try to say much, either. But the subtley perfect art, the cute-but-not-sickeningly-so character designs, and witty dialog overcome any shortcomings.  It's not complex, but it's one of the most 'perfect' games I've played in years.  Recommended to anyone with good taste, and essential to any gamer who remembers what the 90s was like.
1946	1	a	dangerously close to being a really good game
3286	1	a	This game is all about timing and physics, lots of physics.  It can be a great pass-time if you are an 'analytical thinker'. No, it is not the same as 'nerd'.  Pros- * Great background scores * Sleek design * Minimal controls * Good theme for an indie game  Cons- * Sanctum levels can be a bit frustrating. * Ultra I, II etc are a bit repetitive, especially if you have beaten Ultra V, then it makes no sense to play Ultra I, II etc .  9/10. I got it in a bundle, was worth the price I paid.
1222	1	a	Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a penguin themed first-person shooter intended for children, developed by  Frogames  [www.frogames.com]  in December 2008. It's a multiplayer game where players try to knock each other off of an iceberg and into the water. There are four different game modes and each map contains five different temporary weapons or powerups that give the player an advantage. The maps are all very small, thus the rounds are really quick and furious.  The online multiplayer of this game is practically dead and the artificial intelligence is not very good, often the opponent just falls off the cliff by himself or he just won't let go and the round goes on forever. If you want to buy this game, I would recommend you to get some friends to play it with you, if you play alone you probably won't have much fun. Also the game is pretty repetitive due to the similarity of the maps and the game modes, so it might get boring after a few rounds.  Still it's overall a fun game with cute graphics. It's nothing special, but it has a basic and easily understandable gameplay and the powerups enhance the fun. There's even a map editor, which I really like. You can download it  here  [www.frogames.com]  or download custom maps created by other users  here  [www.frogames.com] . Even though the game was released five years ago, the developers recently announced an upcoming update, so let's see what the future holds.  Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is great if you want a short-term fun game to play with friends and nothing too serious. Also it's a nice alternative for children to the many violent first-person shooters. The game is only available in a bundle, which is in my opinion not worth the price if you'll only buy it for this game, but if you can get it on sale it's worth a shot.
1050	1	a	Brony Mode activated!
3324	1	a	If you don't want to play as a battle unicorn, I don't want to know you as a human being
2795	1	a	Monaco is a difficult game to describe because it doesn't fall into a well-tread genre, but it's part puzzle game, part top-down action game, and overall a lot of fun. Up to four players form a team of criminals attempting a heist, and the game is a race to collect all of the money and treasure without getting caught by the gaurds. It's heavily designed around online multiplayer, and the open lobby system makes it easy to get matched up with random partners in crime.  One of the best things about the game is how it handles difficulty and varying player skill. Aside from levels that get progressively harder as the storyline unfolds, success in each mission is less about getting through the mission at all and more about doing it as quickly and effeciently as possible. So if you end up with a mix of veteran players and n00bs, everyone can still do their own thing and feel like they are contributing even if some players are doing more of the work. The time/speedrun system works well for replayability, because once you become better at the game it's a lot of fun to use your new skills to plow through some of the earlier levels.  There are eight different characters in the game all with different abilities, and the balance between characters is pretty good so that there are not obvious best and worst characters. Also each level has different aspects that can make certain characters more advantageous, although it's always possible to complete the levels with any set characters. There's also an entertaining and somewhat convoluted storyline for the game that gives each character a unique personality.  The core gameplay and level design are both top notch and that's why the game makes you want to keep playing levels to try for better times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-y games, especially if you are looking for an online co-op game. Even for people who don't generally like online multiplayer games it can be a good intro into that kind of game because you can start out as a novice and not feel like you're in way over your head. Great game and I look forward to more games from Pocketwatch.
3249	1	a	It's a nice puzzle game, the first levels are easy so you can learn in peace but some levels are really tough to beat.  152 levels, some of em need both reflexion and reflexes, for around 10-15h of play. Just don't ruin the game by checking the solutions :)
1125	0	a	A game with Bronies in mind. Amusing for 5 minutes and that's about.
4563	1	a	A very difficult tower defence game. you can move around the orbits of satilites which I thought would make it easier, but it really didn't. It just makes it incredibly difficult.
1520	1	a	This was such a gem of a game to play, it became one of my favourites in an instant. It's simple and fast-paced with a story I didn't even think would get so deep like it did. It's hard not to have a favourite play style and team setup with all the options available to you. Do yourself the favour and pick up this game, it's worth the price and you get so much replayability out of it.
2284	1	a	Good game. Perfect. Just.. Dont do this in real life kids.
1476	1	a	Doesn't matter how rich you get, how infamous you get, how many guns you get, how many people you kill, how many guards you alert, how many lasers you trip, how many holes you dig, how many computers you hack, how many doors you unlock,  how many times you disconnect, how many times you get blown up, how many coins you collect, how many teammates you revive, how many records you get, how many disguises you find, how many toilets you pee in, how many venues you rob, how many maps you make, how many pianos you play, how many trophies you get,  You will never ever have the world record for prison break.
255	1	a	a great game
3879	1	a	Absolutely frakkin ADORABLE. The kid in you will love it for the costumes and cuteness, and the adult in you will love it for the tactical rpg gameplay. Lovely game, start to finish.
5229	1	a	Maybe the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. No, really. Legit.
2118	1	a	cool game really enjoying it
280	0	a	This game is way to 'laggy' for its world. I mean come on, only geometric figures and this can't run smoothly on a decent machine...?
346	1	a	Great game but like similar games, it can get old pretty fast.
3727	1	a	A really fun and relaxing game. Just the end bosses are a little bit difficult. Usually sold with a massive discount, but is worth the full price. A must-have.
1499	1	a	What a cool funny game!  Sure, the graphics aren't Mona Lisa-like. But the gameplay is so super easy to get the hang of, and the music so fun, and the whole game so generally cute and nicely done that you can't help but like it and play it.  Get friends, play it together, and have fun for a good number of hours (yes, this game is surprisingly long, compared to what I expected). Plus, there's a zombie mode! Get it and have fun =)
1843	1	a	I love this game. I was so addicted and when you finish all the levels you get the trophies on them like the 1p trophie and the All Coins trophie and when your done with that you just start joining other people's servers and start making friends with them and help them finish all the levels and it just go's on and on. The Hacker is my favorite charecter because like love green and love neon green even better.
2657	1	a	One of the greatest indie games I've ever played. Monaco is insanely fun, both by yourself and with friends. It perfectly captures the essence of a heist movie and translates it into a quirky, 2D game. The soundtrack is awesome, adding another element of the heist genre to the game. Do yourself a favour and pick it up.
2960	1	a	Spoon is best class.
3921	1	a	This game is awesome! If you're looking for something fun and casual to play around Halloween you should definitely try it out.
4330	0	a	It's just like Katamari Damacy! Except without the innovative control scheme. Or the great music. Or the charm. Or the fun.
1374	1	a	very good game worth the money
4852	1	a	Has some of the people behind Portal working on it; and it's similar except the puzzles are solved by manipulating the properties of objects and the rooms by switching between various dimensions. Pretty clever situations in some cases.
2734	1	a	Monaco is a super-fast-pace crime simulator game that's more or less a meatier version of the SEGA Genesis game Bonanza Bros. Whether you're with a few friends, or strangers, or yourself, Monaco is a blast!
3112	1	a	Game is really great and its really fun. It is fun when youre playing alone but in some levels you need a friend. But it is really good stealth and funny game. Music is really nice and i live it, but sometimes game make me mad (thats understandable XD) I recommend this game to everybody whos looking for STEALTH COOP game :-)
769	1	a	I coud play this game for hours and I love the co-op features!
5371	1	a	the best in 'invaders' style...
2016	1	a	A great game, you should definitely buy it.
2515	1	a	Cooperative spy espionage at it's best!
868	0	a	Great board game. Horrible business model for this iteration of the game. Unless they change this shady practice/trend in a future update ,don't bother purchasing.
5500	1	a	It's like space invader super classic you can upgrade though and play tons of levels!
1907	1	a	Fun 2 play 10/5 if you ask me 5/5 if truth is said
4154	1	a	If you're serious about your match 3 and like crunchy RPG mechanics, Puzzle Quest is for you! A massive, sprawling campaign with an abundance of interesting and still surprisingly innovative approaches to the genre await. It's a deep rabbit hole that marries two time-destroying genres with significant success, so don't be surprised if it ends up dragging you away from your current playlist for a good solid week or 3 once you fire it up for the first time.
1701	1	a	Way too much fun...
3771	1	a	This is an easy, quick, and fun Halloween themed game. I would recommend it.
4906	1	a	Absolutly LOVE this game. This, besides Skyrim, is my favorite casul game. I find it much more enjoyable than Portal. Really hope the Devs make a second!!
1453	0	a	harry potter
4352	1	a	I actually DON'T recommend this game. I only bought it because I was hoping for a half decent Katamari clone and all I got was something that felt like they took its soul and promptly took a dump right on it. Horrible controls, glitchy and buggy gameplay and a difficulty curve that is more like a random scribble on a cocktail napkin. The graphics are amateur and inconsistent, the music is annoying and the voiceover stuff blows. This game feels more like a grade school student project rather than a product that was sold. Sometimes when you're starting out, less is more... keep it simple instead of trying too hard and maybe the game won't feel like you're trying to â¥â¥â¥â¥ something I appreciated.
727	1	a	This is a great conversion of the board game to pc. It has a clean interface and follows the rules exactly and plays quickly. The instructions aren't the best as there is no tutorial but if you know the board game you can jump right in. Unfortunately the AI isn't that smart. They will mainly keep destiantion tickets if they think they can complete them rather than plot out a real strategy. It's basically like playing against a beginner player vs an advanced player in real life. Also how exciting can a board game on the pc be? It gets dull a little quickly, board games are in essence a face to face social experience. But Ticket to Ride does the best it can with what it has.
799	1	a	My favourite boardgame on pc, I already know the rules and have more expansions than available as dlc. Love this game and also fun to play online against others, The best map (dlc) available at this time is Switzerland and cant wait till they going to release the India, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Pensylvania Maps
3020	1	a	A really fun and unique stealth game. It's primarily a co-op experience, but can be played solo. Quite a few characters(classes) to choose from, tons of heists(community made ones as well), all with a neat style. Lots of replay value.
3958	0	a	I liked the concept of the game. Different costumes gives you different tactical experience in battles, but Costume Quest is so boring that I can't recommend it.
4932	1	a	Pros: +Interesting voice acting/characters +Well thought out puzzles  Cons -Not very well optimized  I suggest getting it on a sale if you're interested.
3776	1	a	Costume Quest is so much fun. Probably one of-- if not /the/-- most fun small-ish games I've played in 2013. It's just so charming and witty and it never failed to make me smile the 8 or so hours I put into it and its little expansion. A fun little distraction, its cuteness betraying its deeper gameplay mechanics and secrets.
4985	1	a	If you're after more Portal goodness, try this game. Similar style, lots of puzzles. Voiced by John DeLance (Q from Star Trek The Next Generation).  Very enjoyable game!
4137	1	a	Bejewelled meets RPG!! Well kinda .... In my opinion they really have merged the RPG elements very well with the various match-3 style games which make up most of the play. It has all you'd expect from RPG .. weapons/items/stats/levels/character classes/mounts/spells but instead the combat is played out through match-3 style games which rather than blindly matching colours it does require thought/stategy and sometimes even specific items/spells to beat your opponents.  Picked it up in a steam sale for just a few pounds and at that sort of price its a bargain that has lots of hours of play.
1422	0	a	I never thought id be at a point in my life where id review about penguin game, but here i am. What can i say, I had coupon on the game (as way as other games) and i had nothing better to do. About the game. Its like the cousin of super smash bros that was drop on its head a lot as a kid whos favorit animal is a penguin. Dont get me wrong, its a fun game on a brain dead level.
3105	1	a	I no longer trust anyone but myself with the lookout.
4371	1	a	A fun Katamari clone with a catchy soundtrack. Not as polished as the source game and quite short, but great if you need your Katamari fix.
3782	1	a	I bought this game during the christmas sale and by far, it is a really fun game. Although there are no voiceovers, the witty humor, battle system and exageration of the combat is very entertaining. It is a game that never takes itself too seriously and will keep you entertained for a good time. Hopefully, it will go on sale again!
1309	1	a	For a fun game with a amazing community and that has endless fun and gafs, You can get your very own copy of Penguin Arena. Any haters are 20 year old men who dont know fun if it slapped them, Kepping goin eonguin arean users &lt;3
3072	1	a	it is a fun game i and i love to play it whit frinds you and your frind will love it have fun p.s dont hack on the game it will not be fun 
4067	1	a	Works great/smooth for me on Windows 10 64-bit in 1980 by 1080, albeit I am using a Radeon HD R9-390 video which runs everything.  Played multiple games no crashes.  Read that it's a dead title because the main programmer was killed in a car accident in 2010.  RIP   This thumbs up for you!  I enjoyed the table, not pinball snob though.  
4343	1	a	great game, it is simple and refreshing
663	1	a	Love it.
2659	1	a	i love it please let it free forever
4905	1	a	A fun and challenging game! Though if you suck at timeing and platform jumpers.. you might have quite a bit fo difficulty with this game.
1204	1	a	Best game of my life. I've never been so happy in my entire life to see a ball spinning like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3841	1	a	Pretty great game. I love anything made my Double Fine and this is no exception! Fantastic gameplay and I seem to always be laughing from thegame's humor!
4252	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a game developed and published by Dejobaan Games. It involves a marionette that grabs as many objects as he can before the end of the world. The game is similar to  Katamari Damacy  due to their similar gameplay. The objective of the game is to grab as many small objects as you can, growing bigger with each object consumed. The level ends once the player has consumed a predetermined amount of objects. There is also an exploration mode, where there is no objective. Also, The Wonderful End of the World was updated shortly before the release of  Portal 2  in 2011 as part of an alternate reality game. It was alongside several other games in the  Potato Sack . A secret level containing Portal easter eggs and potatoes was added to the game. Once enough players found these potatoes, Portal 2 was released.
4178	1	a	Game of The Year. Every year. Play this with a friend and you'll hate each other as much as any other Mario Party. Single player is pretty awesome, too.
5490	1	a	Remake of the classic Space Invaders. Puts your reaction skills on the line. Good looking visuals and a compelling soundrack combined with exact controls makes this a wonderful experience. Great replay value to increase your score or try another upgrade strategy. Enjoyed it a lot.
1331	1	a	Meh. Only buy it on sale. I wouldn't put it as a priority either.
1957	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.
3177	1	a	PROS: - A great physics based puzzle game without much randomness. - Overall atmosphere of the game is old-fashioned but classy. - Creative puzzles with unique and historical themes. - A decent soundtrack with classical instruments. - End credits.  CONS: - Music transition is a bit too aggresive, abrupt, and unnatural while navigating the game menu, selecting levels, et cetera. - A select few levels are abnormally difficult even if you follow walkthrough guides (either the physics engine is acting wonky or a particular level design is flawed, or both.)  Final Remarks: The game is quite good. If you are having hard time solving the puzzles, make sure to check out the  Steam guides  written by our fellow gamers.  . RECOMMENDED .
2643	1	a	A great game to treasure bushes.
3276	1	a	Good games, reccomended!
2825	1	a	I admit, I haven't been following Monaco's epic sucess story since the beginning (I actually bought the game on a whim after seeing all the raved reviews), but I do know a thing or two about the game's past. It's the winner of the IGF 2010 grand prize, and that was THE SAME IGF HOLDING FEZ AND THE BINDING OF ISAAC (I think). Now, it's a full-fledged game. The story is a classic story of a bunch of criminals trying to escape Monaco. Stealth is challenging, collecting all of the coins can make your life hell, and the characters all feel unique with specific designs and special abilities. The one thing I didn't like about the game was the art style, because, contrary to the popular belief, I feel that it only really worked for characters and not the environment. Overall, 9/10.
4132	0	a	This game cheats.
4846	1	a	If they made Portal with a crazy Uncle instead of an insane A.I. with a manor house instead of an underground lab, and control over gravity/time instead of portals, you'd have Quantum Conundrum. Great game can't wait for DLC.
4039	1	a	Strengths: - interesting storyline - thought-provoking sci-fi context in which people are in a hierarchy according to their health and wealth and children are brought up in child development centres to prevent 'neurosis' - characters were individuals, voice acting was good - linear gameplay meaning that you can do what you want when you want to do it - your gameplay choices affect outcomes  Weaknesses: - got headaches from squinting at the overly dark scenes - moving Phoenix around was sometimes difficult - graphics look poor due to the age of the game 
5468	1	a	very fun and addictive, the best space invader. 
3588	1	a	I keep playing it over and over so much fun, But I wish there was A 3rd. If your looking to buy it and don't know GET IT. GREAT GAME I RATE IT 10/10
2949	1	a	The best coop-indie game ever!!
912	1	a	very addddictiv !  nice stuff for sure...
5189	1	a	I almost did not buy this game, but for $2.50 I have been having fun with it. You have to manage your Dwarves happiness and health while growing your dwarven Kingdom. The game looks good and is easy to learn the skills to make your Dwarves happy and healthy. You can speed up and even pause the game which is handy when you find monsters underground. The only direct input you have with your Dwarves is that you can teleport up to 5 dwarves to any location. Grab it while it is on sale and have fun :-) I did not get the DLC's but the only one that looks good is the Pets.
5245	1	a	A great puzzle platformer! Great attention to detail and creative scenarios all the way through. It's amazing how the game mixes and matches elements to create whole new puzzles throughout the game. The presentation is far above what I was expecting and the whole game has been a joy to play (even when it has been INFURIATINGLY tough). It's been very rewarding and I can't wait to finish the last part of the game.
359	1	a	A addictive game that will keep you amused for ages.
4459	0	a	Awesome game but doesn't run at all.
90	1	a	Too short. Let's hope Part 2 et al. are free updates. It's a fun little game and the puzzles make you feel badass when you're done (if not frustrated at the obscurity), but Â£5 for 40 minutes of game isn't right. I feel ripped off, which is disappointing because it's a pretty game and I enjoyed the experience.  The biggest issue is I can spend Â£5 and get a better high that lasts a lot longer. Chocolate, man. The only way to fly.
628	1	a	Very fun game and a faithful recreation of the board game. Easy to pick up and very enjoyable, the only downside to this is that it desparately needs more maps, or at least support for a modding community.
4246	1	a	A fun game with very simple gameplay, simply run into small objects to get bigger so you can pick up bigger objects. A nice amount of variation in levels to keep it interesting. The fun and simple gameplay and the entertaining visuals make for a relaxing game. I would recommend it, but it is a short game so try to pick it up on sale.
4788	1	a	Tons of fun and a great first person puzzle game! NOT THE SAME AS PORTAL! So don't pick it up if you aren't up for a challange.
505	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game, and worked fine for a long time.  Unfortunately a recent update (November 2015) has made everything so much worse, and it's honestly one of the worse updates to a game I've ever seen with tons of bugs. Now there are graphical glitches, buttons don't work, there's multiplayer connectivity problems, the AI is worse, unnecessary route completion animations are present, the end-game score count is slow, and so on. Until these are fixed I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  There was nothing to warrant this update, so I don't understand why the producers would trash a game that was working extremely well. Seems like a waste of time and effort. Don't fix that which isn't broken!
357	1	a	Not a bad game. basicly a copy of a xbox 360 but can not thinnk og the dam thing
4885	1	a	Not only, does this game have some of the most interesting and challenging puzzles I've seen in a long time, but it also has some of the most funny dialogue I've heard in a while. In my opinion, the puzzles have an excellent level of difficulty. I never found any of them to be unfairly complex, or tasking.  None of them caused any major frustration to me, but neither did they feel pointlessly easy. This game is a perfect choice for anyone who enjoys puzzles, or has a good sense of humor.
2500	1	a	Great fun in both single and multiplayer.
2089	1	a	overall. i do recommend this but it is very hard to get used to and kinda lame.
3354	1	a	if you like halloween this is perfect
5134	0	a	I've owned this product since 2013 and in that time i've barely played it thats because theres nothing to do. the campaign is bare bones and the game play is repetative dont even buy this on sale
4908	1	a	Probably Portal's only competition. It's very much so the same game, but instead of portals, you get to mess with different dimensions. Each dimension changes the characteristic of objects in the puzzle. For example, if you can't pick up a metal safe, switch to the Fluffy dimension and it weights enough to be picked up.   Pros: -Great Voice acting from Star Trek's 'Q' -Pretty long -Fun Puzzles -Unique concepts -Difficulty curve  Cons: -Platforming is very unforgiving -Ending is stupid 
4623	1	a	For those that have the Win 7 Issue.  I just got the game, was shocked to see that it didn't work (Win7 x64), but then I went:  Where every you install steam games (Not the desktop icon) , go to cm2 and run it in compatability with XP SP3.   It seems to be working fine right now.  
4182	1	a	Really fun game.  Make sure you get the free expansion pack.
454	1	a	This game pisses me off that's why i recommend it for 99 cent its worth it. Just shoot sht and make high scores what more do you want to know that's pretty much the entire point of the game might I add it will p!ss you off to. lol Game enegine is Unreal 3 aswell so should run well on older PCs. INI tweaks might can push little more blinginess outta graphics just dont do allow dx11 it wont start every other tweaks and increased texture res works fine (advanced knowledge of them config files you might want to have else might screw things up i recommend you go to UDK site for unreal 3 enegine learn what does what before you jump balls deep into the ini tweaking)
460	1	a	Good, simple, arcadey fun. I have to make the inevitable comparison to Geometry Wars, which is plays very similarly to. Where that game has more diverse enemies, this one has more diverse game modes. Also, where Geometry Wars's control scheme really was optimized for dual analog sticks, Waves plays just as well with a mouse &amp; keyboard.
713	1	a	Great game etc etc.... but come on, where are the new maps? It's absurd that only three new maps (not including the USA tweaks) have been released. What about India? Marklin? Netherlands? Nordic Countries? TEAM Asia? Europe 1912 variants? Africa? Pull your finger out, Days of Wonder.
404	1	a	WOW this game is just so amazing! 100% worth the money
1083	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
4628	1	a	Great game
5378	1	a	To tell you the truth i had never heard of this game and i got a discount for it on steam. i was like you know what lets check it out. I go to the game and the video, didn't look too fun, but it was a big discount.  I WAS WRONG.  This space invaders/galaga style game with modern graphics and a beautiful array of alien ships and upgrades. Makes this game so fun to play. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, convince your friends to try and beat your high scores. Laugh as they try and fail because you are a god and they are mere peasants. Do it. Trust me.
1402	1	a	a very fun game &lt;3 :)) tho why can't i get power ups even when i bought the game? please fix it.
1699	1	a	Bring your friends for the co-op and become thieves! Such a funny game. Totally worth the buy!
447	1	a	Awesome twin stick shooter with great visuals that arent too overbearing, solid difficulty and a variety of modes to choose from. Can't wait to see what these guys do with WavesÂ² because this game is one of the best twin stick shooters around.
2346	1	a	 Monaco  is a top-down stealth/action game. I had a lot of fun with it, but it can be boring under the wrong circumstances.  tl;dr: this is a top-down tactical stealth game, it's by far the most fun with a friend in 2-player mode, and you should experiment with different characters.   Single-player runs are a bit too predictable and straightforward, and every mission will feel just like more of the same thing. Multiplayer is much more interesting - it's moments like sneaking in to steal the treasure while a friend stands guard and another hacks the security, or splitting up to clean out an entire floor within a minute, that make this game worth playing. On the other hand, groups of too many (inexperienced) players are likely to get in each others' way and spend too much time being discovered to get anything done. Two coordinated, voice-chatting players are the best for combining your characters' abilities successfully and pulling off your own strategy together. On the other hand: While smooth and coordinated runs are very satisfying, it can also be fun to treat Monaco as a party game and frantically stumble through a level with four players and swarms of guards behind you.  The graphics are stylish, unique and do their purpose, but a bit taxing on the eyes and take a while to get used to. The music fits the heist setting, but there's not enough of it. The story also helps to set the mood, and while it's not  important , I'm glad that it's there because it gives the missions context.  Stealing money slowly grants you additional tool uses/ammunition, so raiding optional rooms is actually rewarded within missions and it can be advantageous to do so and e. g. gather additional EMP charges before taking on the main vault's motion detectors. This means that while skilled maneuvering is still a focal point, threat assessment and careful planning are just as essential. While the core stealth gameplay always remains similar, the 8 characters' special abilities have a huge influence on which path and approach you can take to beating the level. One team may allow you to tunnel towards the objective past a large portion of the treasure and just run past the guards that remain in your way, while another one relies on luring them one by one and knocking them out so no one's even awake to answer the alarm. Monaco is fairly forgiving for a stealth game - getting detected early on hardly ever means having to restart a level in advance. It does get kind of boring how easily you can disperse attention by crawling into ventilation ducts and waiting.  The normal price is a bit high because the game only shines if you buy a second copy for a friend, but I very highly recommend buying this when it's on sale if you're into strategic, sometimes chaotic co-op action.
5529	1	a	Titan Attacks! really works as a retro style space shooter. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything looks and plays great. Who wouldn't have fun blowing up alien invaders with a super-powered and fully upgradable tank? This game reminds me of the classic arcade sh*t. And that's a good thing.
4745	1	a	Fans of portal will like a lot of this game for whose are looking for casual fun and also is good to learn about physics!
1993	1	a	A fantastic and fun co-op experience that can lead to absolute hilarity when it all goes wrong. That said, when it all goes right and you get the loot and get out its an immensely satisfying experience, especially as the difficulty ramps up in the later levels.
4286	1	a	I'll keep this short.  PROS - Katamari like gameplay. - Freeplay once you've beaten a level. - Decent level variation.  CONS - VERY short. I finished everything with an A score in less than 2 hours. - Pretty easy, no real challenge. - Occasional glitches with collision. Sometimes I couldn't get the puppet to go through a gap that was much larger than it. - The music is so-so.  Is it as good as a real Katamari game? No. Is it still fun and kind of charming? Yes. If you can pick it up on sale then do so, but I'm not sure you should grab it at full price unless you REALLY need to scratch your Katamari itch.
1233	1	a	Better than Five Nights at Freddy's.
5012	1	a	One of the best and most fun single player games I have played. Definitely recommend.
3384	1	a	Costume Quest is a simplifyed turn-based RPG where you must trick or treat the various houses in the levels in order to advance, gain different costumes with abilities and stats of their own and buy special skills for your party.  The title isn't that challenging nor requires an intense grinding: if you fill your candies buck on a regular basis and buy the right abilities you will have no problems in any of Costume Quest's battles. Being able to answer well to the various combat QTEs (which you can use both to defend yourself and inflict extra damage per attack) is however mandatory.  Beside fighting in random battles and collect candies and equipment, there are also several side quests in every area: the majority of them is recycled once per level, but without feeling that repetitive. Given this is a Double Fine game, you can also make a personal quest out of witnessing the various NPCs chatters and reactions.  The main appeal of Costume Quest is the writing: the story is simple enough, but the humor of the various NPCs and situations make up for it quite nicely. And of course, there are various videogame references for your to find.  The Steam version of Costume Quest also comes with the only DLC for the title, Grubbins of Ice. This new chapter doesn't add anything new to the overall game's formula (save for three new costumes) and doesn't last that long, being worth an average of two hours or so. However, as with the main campaign, the new jokes and characters make Grubbins on Ice a worthy add
4604	1	a	Loved Crazy Machines since the first bunch of games came out some yonks ago, the new perspective takes some getting used to, but contains the same zany items and puzzles from the originals.  For those having issues with physics related bugs - One successful workaround seems to be to simply roll back to the original 9.13.1220 Nvidia PhysX drivers that are supplied with the game.
2441	1	a	One of the best games of 2013! To best it good friends and some skill is required.
635	1	a	Reincarnation of the massively fun tabletop. This game was never going to be as fun as its equivalent, but if youre like me it will still keep you hooked for hours at a time. If youre not like me, youll still enjoy the odd game now and then and still feel you got your moneys worth.
2425	1	a	A very well crafted and enjoyable multiplayer game.  Can be enjoyed with friends online or locally in a party environment and something I still can't help but return to from time to time.  If you enjoy light-hearted stealth with well crafted classes and a decent plot that you can pick up and put down whenever, look no further.  It has decent sale prices all the time and Steam Workshop support too!
1997	1	a	great stealth game. reccomend if you cant afford payday 2 :) 
173	1	a	one of those puzzle based indies which are more like weed than game. This one put me into a trance instantly and I lost myself completely in it. This game is for everyone. Fast, slow, medium, all sorts of pace in gameplay, must play for everyone! After Hexic HD I think this is the game worth trying.
4184	1	a	4/5  Detestable though games built upon the match-three mechanic almost always are, this title wraps that in a thick coat of RPG elements that add several extra layers of enjoyment, including a cliche though charming narrative.
1010	1	a	the graphics and physics need some improving. However the gameplay itself is very enjoyable. The artstyle is weird and charming.
5207	1	a	Highly recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles! Unlike other puzzle games where they give you hints and stuffs, Toki Tori 2+ drops you into 2D open world and leaves you by yourself to figure things out.  Gotta work that brain out! It gets really addicting, I promise. First look of the game might look like its for kids but it can be for any age range. Pretty fun, adorable chicks, frogy's and more! Happy puzzling~!
5295	1	a	Fun, cute, not too difficult nor is it too easy.
1143	1	a	10/10 would play again
1639	1	a	I'm always looking for good co-op, and this one of my favorites.
3606	1	a	Absolutely brilliant and adorable. Quirky perfection as usual from Double Fine. Highly recommended!
435	1	a	OK, here is the test for whether you should get this game. Go play some free twin-stick shooter, like Echoes. Did you like it? Then you're going to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game. The controls are awesome and tight. The enemies are all interesting and unique. But the coolest part is the mechanics. The 4 moves are: Move, shoot, bomb, and slow down time. The first two are self explanitary, after a ten hit combo you have a second to activate a bomb, and you slowly charge a buffer, that can slow down time and get you double points while you do so 'because it looks awesome'. Oh, and you also get double points for shooting enemies at point blank 'because it looks awesome'. This game is awesome.
2745	1	a	A Definate Must-Play.  Monaco is one of those games that put itself out there to try something new, and it made it through. Monaco, like Minecraft or Team Fortess 2, is one of those games that were inovative and risked being criticized for leaving that line of what has become the cliche' of modern gaming. It is a game of skill and precision, you can't go around kill everything... well... actually, you can, but I wouldn't consider it. Sure, it's not anything to compete against espionage of today like the god-forbidden Splinter Cell, and whatever happened to it's dignity, or Metal Gear Solid, but it is completely worth the $15, it is intensly fun, especially with friends. I recommend that you and a friend buy this game, it's a really good way to spend an afternoon.
2981	1	a	one of the best games; i got it for 2 days to try it and after i purchased it at sales
5399	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
5075	0	a	This game tries to scratch the itch dungeon keeper and dwarf fortress have long since stopped scratching for me. (hundreds of game hours can only do so much.)  Unfortunately, where those other games are like a Velcro nose scratcher inside a spaceman's helmet, this is more of a damp sponge. You can try as hard as you want, it won't scratch.  I only managed to stick with this game due to the mild amusement of designing a very simple dwarf base, but that gets old FAST; it was pure stubbornness after the first 3 levels. You don't have the challenge and satisfaction of making something like in dungeon keeper or dwarf fortress, and it's not much fun aesthetically because the near non-existent challenge the game does provide wrecks your design.  The major problem with the game is how unfinished the final product is. The potential is definitely there, but it was rushed into final product for obvious financial reasons. Hence the cash grab DLC rushed quickly out.  The biggest clue to this being an unfinished mess is the falling animation. When your dwarves tunnel into a large cavern, or are falling for some reason, they panic, fall one Z level, stop in mid air, Panic again, Fall another Z level; rinse, repeat till the bottom. Come on guys, didn't have time to fully program that one?  The second clue is the half-hearted attempt at making your dwarves happy. You can decorate your entire dungeon with minerals you find, but this is purely aesthetic. Rough wooden walls and floors do the job just as well as Dragonite ore, the rarest mineral in the game. Come on devs, was the balancing too hard? Dwarf fortress had that coded!  If we are talking balancing, the teleporting mechanic breaks the game so hard it physically hurt me sometimes with boredom. You can teleport your dwarves anywhere on the map you have visited, as many times as you'd like, and as fast as you'd like. Sure they TRIED to nerf it by only letting you do one dwarf at a time, and by having special fields you need to send your dwarves to destroy, but you can work around them easily, usually by tricking the stupid AI.  If I send a dwarf tunneling into a unknown cavern, I should fear for his safety, or for the safety of my base, not watch bored with my hand on the teleport button to whisk him away from the slow moving enemies. (The combat AI is so bad they even take a second to spin and position in a North-south or West-East pattern before hitting each other.) I never had any fear for my main base while playing the game. You can stop intrusion by deleting a ladder. Enemies try to circumvent this by randomly teleporting around, but half the time they stood there stupidly. Depressingly, I never had the chance to use all the nifty traps they game had available for me. By the time you can afford the traps you already have the appropriately levels fighters, making them useless.  I was REALLY angry at the half-coded ending to the game. Anti-climatic, with rushed animations; even the writing was half-hearted. Did they even expect anyone to get through the entire game?  There are more problems, Terrible AI, bad animations, ETC; but this game has taken enough of my time already.  I know some of you out there are desperate for easy to play games that scratch that itch I mentioned above, but don't come here. You will leave wanting, and with less money in your wallet.
3768	1	a	Another good game by Double Fine. RPG game that keeps things simple and not overcomplicate the mechanics, but is still fun to play.
2870	1	a	Straight up fun playing in multiplayer. Being under powered, the game really forces you to work as a team, which is rewarding when you work together.
3028	1	a	great game. i cannot say more.
5141	1	a	Hello,  I would recommend this game to anyone who can go into it without expectations. As others have mentioned, this game could have been amazing. Imagine just about any builder game, but with this games perspective/control and I drool. Gnomoria, Towns, Dwarf Fortress, Terraria, Craft the World, ect. They could all benefit from this type of 3d environment.  Sadly, this game doesn't even bother to try to take the gameplay features of the genre and implement them. Instead it gave you just enough to finish the campaign and rip some more money from you in the form of DLC before it was declared finished.  I had a great time with it. Like all early access alpha/beta type games, you play them and enjoy them because the anticipation for the next content patch keeps you involved. However, if you can't help but let a game rub you raw with it's blatant inadequacy, don't get it. If you can take it for what it is, grab it.  I don't regret getting, so I will upvote. I am saddend by the developers/publishers lack of vision and dedication in letting such a grand opportunity to become the best of the genre slip away.  Cheers, Michael
2605	1	a	Don't underestimate this game because its 2d. Probabaly one of the best stealth games i've ever played. 9/10
5023	1	a	Plenty of puzzles to keep you going for hours. Some of the interface could do with improvements, but overall great value for money. There are also in game trophies to collect once you've got all the acheivements, if that appeals to the completionist in you.
2463	1	a	very cool :P
568	1	a	Who knew a game about trains could be so entertaining? Having clocked nearly 30 hours, I have to say that this is a must for any board game enthusuast.   My only critique would be that the Asian map has some of the most grating sound effects that I have ever heard in a game - enough to make me avoid the map as often as I can.
2576	1	a	Overall it's a pretty fun game especially with friends. The PvP is a lot of fun and so are the missions but much better with friends because sometimes you'll get a person who has no idea what they're doing and just ruin everything. The main problem I have is being able to aim. I also feel that screen is a bit too clutered at times too. If it's on sale definetly buy it.
1933	1	a	It's a lot of fun. And it have local co-op mode!  Must have if you are a play-in-the-couch-with-friend gamer.
2753	1	a	This game has a unique storyline that I wasn't really expecting, interesting characters, freedom spoons, gameplay that looks difficult at first but is understandable when first played, and guards. Guards everywhere.
2803	1	a	Love the style, it's so different from any other game I have. And I love that it's co-op =) Nice and 'different' game.
3925	1	a	Its got an amusing story and fairly good combat.
4412	1	a	Match-3 game with extra goals. Not as involved as later titles in the series, and if you're on a post-Vista and/or 64-bit system, you'll need a custom patch to play it. I still recommend it if that sort of casual time-killer is your thing.
728	1	a	If you like board games in real life then get this one. Ticket To Ride is a very simple game to learn, but is a challenge against the online players. Ticket to ride is one of the top games wich can hold up with games like Carcasonne, Setlers of Catan, Rio Grande etc. Get your creditcard ready and buy the game, i mean the bundle. All versions for a cheap price.
5315	1	a	Don't be put off by the 'No Tutorials' the game is extremely intuitive and a true puzzle game. This is a brilliant, super polished game.   An excellent pure puzzle platformer.
322	1	a	I bought waves expecting it to be a simple, boring time waster. Little did I know how wrong I was. Waves quickly becomes an intense battle for survival, with thick swarms of enemies chasing you constantly. I prefer Waves to Geometry Wars, as waves comes with a unique artstyle that I quickly grew to love. The different gamemodes are delightfully hard and enjoyable all round.   9/10 would get my face eaten by a giant cube again
4322	1	a	Fun and kinda of a playful idea this game...
4030	1	a	Great little game for the holiday season. cute and quirky. i enjoy the graphics and gameplay. complete with a unqiue battle system. tons of laughs for me and my little ones. good win for pc for family.
5214	1	a	pros: they changed the game mechanic from the previous 'collect eggs' &amp; maneuvering around the level - into a sing &amp; stomp puzzler, beautiful art style, soundtrack fits the theme (although not as good as the first game), environment is reactive to your actions, steam workshop supported  cons: although there are some visual cues - there is no tutorial or objective instructions (which could result in a player getting lost &amp; confused in what you are supposed to do), no mouse support for the world map, no windowed fullscreen mode, can't customize controls, huge difficulty spikes on some puzzles (would often require an online walkthrough to save time in solving tedious tasks)  Overall, this is a lot more open world than the first game but to the detriment of the player, there are times where you would get lost &amp; stumped on solving the puzzles. The new mechanics are great but with a flawed implementation. If you want an extreme trial &amp; error, time consuming, tedious tasks of a puzzle game this is it. Otherwise... Toki Tori 2 is a hit or miss.
4600	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AS IT WONT RUN ON NEWER COMPUTERS AND STEAM WILL NOT HELP YOU OR REFUND YOUR MONEY!
5082	0	a	I bought this game on offer, thinking I was getting a good deal, but the save system is broken so I can't even continue with the campaign after I save and exit.  I didn't pay much, but I've still requested a refund, as it's the principle of the thing.  My advice is don't bother with this game. Even if it's in a sale, you'll still be buying a broken product.
4505	1	a	A LIFE CHANGING GAME MAKE SURE TO WATER PLANTS
995	1	a	Excellent story but a very shaky flash implementation that really detracts from the experience. Many crashes that required a hard reset to recover from. To be honest I would not have purchased it if it was clear to me that it was written in flash, so I guess I see why they didn't tell me...  Worth playing but just be aware. 
331	1	a	As a happily married man, and loving father of three, I can only say that my family just can't compare to this game. Buy it, and leave your troubles behind. Great prices (usually ~.99) for a great game!
5079	1	a	I bought that game with no expectations at all. And that's probably what helped me enjoying it. In the end, I did enjoy it. I even went up to the end, which kind of took me some time. Of course, it is full of downs/cons, like, it's a casual game, it's quite bugged, it has huge slow downs when the map becomes huge and full of your constructions, it is not very deeply thought and programmed, the scenario is poor, the dialogues useless, blablabla, you could make a huge list of the bad stuff, as there are probably more of these than the good ones. HOWEVER. However. All in all, there is one huge aspect of that game that is so nice that in the end it becomes heavier or at least as heavy as the bad stuff in the balance used to rank this game: the exploration feeling and the construction features. And you know what? These two simple facts, no matter how bad all the other things are, made me feel closer than ever to the golden past of games like Dungeon Keeper, more than any other game did these past 20 years. So, if you understood the whole situation here, yes: I DO recommend this game.
4570	1	a	Fun spin on the tower defense genre with a 1950's invasion from outer space narration.
211	1	a	I honestly couldnt think of a single complaint about this game. It's pretty much everything I could ever want from a twin stick shooter.  One thing unique to this game that I really liked was how the bomb loadout worked: instead of picking bombs up and stockpiling them, you can only use them whenever you reach high enough hit combos. This forces you to think ahead and time your kills, and on higher levels things get very frenetic with you dropping bombs every few seconds. There's also a slow-mo ability that recharges automatically, which is another helpful feature.  Plus the controls are smooth and responsive, the graphics shiny and colorful, the music excellent (accompanied by a cool Glados-like robot voice), and there are enough game modes, achievements and leaderboards to keep you occupied for many hours. A very solid and satisfying shoot-em-up experience.
1995	1	a	Would recommend
4177	1	a	Surprisingly addicting game! I only heard about it after trying that poor excuse of a Marvel clone. Apart from the huge benefit of not having to wait while your characters heal, this also seems to have an interesting story where you actually can make relevant choices.
4051	1	a	This game is different. Although it is a dated game, the visuals are good and the story is excellent. Is there some truth in this? Can it be possible that the world will become like this?  Just play the game. ;-)
2710	1	a	this is a good game but there should be 2 player one keyboard
2428	1	a	'This isn't hotline miami, put down the gun you idiot' You and your idiot sidekick rob a bank. What can go wrong? - you say after reviving him over and over again.
333	1	a	this would be a sweet arcade game at any diner. worth a $1 easy. The game isn't too complicated as a foundation. The small stuff is great, I like that the descriptions of things sound more adult speach than technical writing.
605	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a competent enough adaptation of the classic board game. Game play is quick and smooth, as is to be expected. The style of the game is fair, if a bit cluttered. However this is all based on the player being able to get past the god-awful menus. Every menu has voice overs describing what options are available. Often each menu has but two or three options. Switching maps, more voices overs describing each map, often with horribly caricature ethnic voices. There is simply no way to turn the voice overs off and has been off putting enough that I've only been able to stomach playing two games. A pity as I really wanted to purchase gift copies for family and friends for online play.
837	1	a	This is a game.
5119	0	a	Mediocre at best. Better to just replay Dungeon Keeper.
4558	1	a	ââââÂ½ Even though gameplay is an alright concentric-ringed tower-defense game, i'm a big fan of their '50s-style sci-fi art and thematic cutscenes.
1014	1	a	Snuggle Truck is actually quite charming and challanging. It's a bit of a surprise really. Speed runs, keeping all of the stuffed animals in the damn truck with bad shocks... It's adictive as well.  It was bought for me as a joke but the jokes on them! I really enjoy it. I like to put some hardcore rap on when I play my Muthaâ¥â¥â¥â¥in Snuggletruckin. 
5479	1	a	Titan Attacks! is a great game that you can play for ages or just in small 5 - 10 minute bursts. Its a arcade style shooter along the line of old style games like Centipede. It has a steep learning curve and does get chaotic in parts but there is a sweet sense of acomplishment when you do beat each level.
147	1	a	I love this game and I highly recommend that you buy this game. It is somewhat of a challenge, but it is really fun and the music is awesome. I give it a 10/10. Superb game!
3676	1	a	8/10  Nice little casual game.  This is a cute halloween story. Even though it is aimed at younger people I still thought that this was a fun little game. The combat is turn based and the rest of the game is open world made up of smaller areas. This game has a cutsey and cartoony art style which makes the game look as though you are playing through a cartoon. There are multiple halloween costumes each with their own special abilities in both the open word and combat.   The story itself is very simple. You have to save your sibling from monsters by collecting halloween candy. It really incorporates the festival into it's gameplay. It's not just set during halloween, but there halloween activities to do: knock on doors for candy, apple bob puzzle and more. There are also some collectables to find which adds some extra play time. The characters are fun and engaging. At the beginning you can chose whether to play as either the brother or the sister.  Overall I enjoyed this game. It was short and it was casual. Pleasent to play when you want to relax. I reccommend this to younger people and children, however I believe that you can still get fun from this game, regardless of age.
392	1	a	If you enjoyed Geometry Wars or anything like it, this might be your new favorite game.
483	0	a	This is a fun game to play with friends, I have many more hours playing the actual board game.  Draw cards, place trains, complete routes for continental domination.  HOWEVER, the online playerbase is not big... at all. And a fair number of players will only accept you in game if you have a certain rating or higher.  I do enjoy the game itself so I bought the DLC.. have not yet played on any DLC maps. Most players just play on the classic map.  It would be nice if there was a reward or achievement system to make the game a bit more gratifying.. but there is not.  If you have friends that like it and want to play, I sure won't stop you. But for the price of this game, I would say invest elsewere.  5/10
2684	1	a	Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.  When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.  The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.  The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.  The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another.   If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.
5202	1	a	This game has some of the most ingenious mechanical and puzzle design you will ever see. It somehow manages to have metroidlike progression, where you see treasures and routes you can't take yet, but will on later visits, despite having no unlockable player abilities. It achieves this unprecedented feat by teaching you new and non-obvious mechanics as you progress through the various stages, which you can then use to solve other challenges you passed earlier. This teaching happens organically as you solve puzzles; there is no text or spoken dialogue in the game.   Toki Tori 2 is an under-appreciated gem and one of the best puzzle games ever made. 10/10
494	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a casual train based card game where you have to complete routes to destination cities. This is accomplished by drawing color coded train cards and placing those cards on the map. You score points based on the train length and completion of train routes. Game ends when a player runs out of train cars and the player with the most points wins. Pretty simple gameplay, but there is some strategy underneath it all. If you find yourself struggling to find something else to play, I suppose this can fill the gap.
2618	1	a	It Is fun But A bit boring With out others
5088	0	a	GAME OF DWARVES is just like Dungeon Keeper 2, but without voice acting, charm, fun or anything of interest really. The game is less pick up and play than Dungeon Keeper 2, because there is a lot of text that needs to be read and well supplies that you buy with gold. Supplies like wood to build stuff... you buy it, you don't chop it down. No this game is completely under ground like Dungeon keeper 2. And you play as Dwarves on a grid. Your dwarves dig out walls along this grid, but unlike Dungeon Keeper 2, you can dig up and down instead of just north, south, east and west. You hire new dwarves and assign them roles or jobs. Its just so much like Dungeon Keeper 2, but less faceted and a lot more boring. Not to say that every FPS is like Doom, with a new coat of paint, but imagine if a game released 10 years after Doom, used a modified Doom engine, yet had less interesting things than Doom. This game just feels so dull, incomplete and uninspiring. The only plus is that playing custom games will generate a random underground world for you to explore.
1785	1	a	A lot of thought and design went into this game and it shows, from the concept to the level design this stealth / heist game is a lot fun. Most of the various characters feel unique each with there own advatages and disadvantages. Co-op is great especially with 3 or 4 players each playing a different class lending their special talents like a disguises or tranq darts. If you like playing rouge / theif type characters you'll really enjoy Monaco.
218	1	a	This games is amazing cant stop playing it, the sound tracks just add to the awesome feel of the game. 10/10
4159	1	a	Dis game so good it make me want become a real puzzle champion fo real
1635	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an amazaing game of stealth and sneakyness with many YOLO moments as well! Great with friends, Great for busting time, and AMAZING for general fun!  Get Shotgun, Get Money, Get Kills - NO WITNESSES!!!! 10/10 - Love It To BITS
5143	1	a	A mix of Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress which is cute overload. For 9.99 it is a grab for sure as the Game Of Dwarves is very fun to play whilst being a long lasting game with a lot of possibilities. You can make halls , bedrooms , mine , research whatever you can imagine and create your own Iron Forge or Orzimmar.  85/100
734	1	a	Really interesting and addicting strategy game. A lot of fun duting the playing process, thinking of how to reach the best result is required. Different maps, achievements are available.  I found Ticket To Ride a very entertaining game, it could easily be played in the family.
3199	1	a	Instantly addictive, 'Just one more level' feeling. Great little puzzle game, worth buying!

3203	1	a	im a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i deserve to die. im garbage. everybody is better than me.
3747	1	a	Looks like its for little kids...is for little kids. However, there's a little kid in all of us. Rather fun.
4014	1	a	Cute game plus you can turn into a UNICORN and NAIL someone with your horn :) or turn into a robot its really a cute game the storyline is pretty good too for a game under a gig. I'd rec this to any casual gamer
4076	1	a	It's basically Bejeweled with RPG elements thrown in. Every colored set of gems is for a different element, and you have to spend these element points to cast spells to damage the enemy. Otherwise you can match 3 skulls and damage the enemy directly.   Winning a combat round gives you experience towards your next level which in turn grants you access to new spells, and gives you some skill points to distribute towards making certain elements more powerful, or to give you an overall boost in the game. You also have equipment that adds certain effects such as reducing the amount of damage you take, increasing the damage you can do, or even reducing a certain element from your enemy when you fulfill certain conditions.   In a way the game reminds me a lot of 'Gyromancer' except you do the matches directly instead of doing the 'bejeweled twist' style matches. The only thing not 'bejeweled' about this game is that there are no special exploding gems created for doing complex matches. You do get a free turn if you match 4 in a row, and if you match 5 in a row you get a free turn + a wildcard piece added to the board.  There's also some gold pieces to match for more money, and 'purple stars' for experience. In addition, certain stats increase the likelihood of these non-element matches giving you a free turn, so sometimes it's worth giving it a shot even if you'd rather be collecting the elemental pieces (red, green, blue, and yellow).  The music is decent, the graphics are kinda flat but it does the job, and the story is.... there. I mean, so far it hasn't added that much extra to the game but it's not cheezy either. If you're a fan of Bejeweled and puzzle games it's worth checking out. If you're dying for some real action or deep strategy, you should probably look elsewhere though.
4238	0	a	This game was positively... okay. It's an amusing timewaster at best, a really mediocre Katamari rip-off at worst. If this game goes on sale for like, a dollar, if you're really interested, pick it up. Otherwise, stick to something that'll last you longer.  This game is incredibly short. I beat it in about an hour, and the levels aren't particularly interesting. The art style is unique in a pleasant way, but the game looks like a late N64/Early Gamecube release in terms of graphical quality. While there is a lot of fun to be had with collecting objects and slowly moving your way up, the entertainment value wears off quite quickly.
3777	1	a	This game was so much fun in a kiddy kind of way. Not uber difficult but entertaining nonetheless. Last time I had fun playing a cutesie game was with Psychonauts. Highly recommend this game when it's on sale. Cheers!
1583	1	a	Great strategy game, can be a shoot em up if you want to but you wont get past the hard levels. Can be very difficult but is always fun, great to play with friends and if you really need the help just play with random strangers. Brilliant music to match.  9.5/10
4847	1	a	What a brilliant and fun puzzle game!
1841	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time!!
3227	0	a	Boring
9	1	a	This is really quite a sweet little game, very relaxing. There's challenge if you want it, in beating each level first time, but it can be played slowly and in bits too. Quite fun!
2045	1	a	  i don't own this game, but if you give it to me for free ill play it and rreview it for you ;^)
2108	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
4162	1	a	It's a match 3 puzzle game, but it's also a pretty damn fun and addicting RPG. Highly recommended.
1503	1	a	tl;dr: It's a top-down heist game about collecting shiny things. Maybe get it if you have friends to play with, and both of you are willing to spend a couple hours figuring out mechanics.    What is Monaco?
2330	1	a	its its really sad to buy this for a friend and never play it with them or anybody else but still 10/10 just make sure you have a group of friends to play with
1333	1	a	This is what COD wanted to be
1344	1	a	Possibly the best multiplayer FPS game on steam to date! pure adrenaline!
4447	1	a	Funny easy farming game very addictive puzzle type it dosen't require much thinking just get in there and enjoy it. I got it included in groupees bundle of games, didn't think i would play it but i was wrong and i love it.
3585	1	a	I recommend this game to certain types of gamers. It's very charming and sweet, but it is a little formulaic and tightly scripted and linear. As someone who only started playing video games again a year or two ago, this is really in my wheelhouse and I can totally see others would find it somewhat tedious. It's a pretty standard but minimal RPG: every encounter is planned, there are no truly random encounters, there is no way to grind and there are few real choices, except finding out what costumes and battle stamps work best together. But there are all kinds of neat stuff, such as the trick-or-treating aspect and all the cute themed side quests like bobbing for apples and trading cards with other kids. The dialogue and the whimsy are its strong suit. I loved finding out what costumes would look like in battle and what their special abilities would be. I personally loved the collecting candy aspect. I could pail-bash as many garbage cans as they put in front of me! After completing Grubbins on Ice, I highly recommend you play it after Costume Quest because I think the story works better that way. I liked that environment especially.
2400	1	a	Amazing game. Most fun I've had in a long while. Buy it, especially if its on sale. Worth every penny. 10/10
5081	1	a	This is an absolutely fantastic little game. You're a Dwarf Prince, who is given control of a group of dwarves, and you build fortresses and caves underground and fight bad things who want to kill you. You go searching for materials to build furniture and decorations, and to advance your dwarven army. Once you kill the bad things, you can steal their beds and bunny rabbits and stuff to put in your fortress.  There is a campaign mode with quests which I think is really well done, and great to play. There's also a sandbox 'free' mode so you can build your ultimate fortress without any distractions. In both sandbox and campaign, I love being able to decorate my little dwarven fortress.. thing. There's a whole range of decorations and things to do, and discover.   Killing stuff and making a badass army isn't bad either, theres a fair few enemies and bosses to defeat with your military dwarves.  Theres a skill tree type doohickey that will allow you to give your group of dwarves more powers and items as the game goes on.  It's a great game to play casually and relax with (if you learn not to try and rush through, which made lead to stress and death unless you're quite focused!).   Sometimes your dwarves don't do quite what they're told, plus they're fat so they get stuck behind furniture a lot and then panic and die of starvation.. but it's okay, you can just spawn another one.   I definitely recommend it. It might take a tiny while to get used to (at least, it did me) but once you're there, it's quite addictive. One thing though - Apart from the DLC, there is an in game 'shop' to use your steam wallet to buy yet more decorations. The packs in there arnt expensive, and I think anyone who enjoys building/decorating/creating things like I do will be happy to pick them up for the price they are.. but if that sort of thing annoys you, well.. it's here.
3549	0	a	It's rare to see a game made by double fine with bland characters, obnoxious gameplay and boring story however this game has all three. The combat system in this game is turn based with no strategy, that however I can stand I enjoy games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon, however Double Fine decided to 'innovate' by mixing in Real Time Events which just completely ruined it for me. Similarly to Psychonauts and Brutal legend this game features collectibles, however unlike these 2 games - collectibles are not a side-quest but are the main quest of the game and you cannot proceed until you have searched every last corners for those collectibles. I don't know what happened to double fine but their earlier games were much better.
972	0	a	Very short to play and not too much story. Not recomended unless very very cheap.
792	1	a	A famous board game came to live, try this and play with your friends online!
1767	1	a	Played couple hours, what can I tell it's worth to buy and spend some time at weekend with friends. Good game!
1262	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied.
3837	1	a	This game is adorable. Regardless of one's age or gaming genre preference, this one is worth checking out, especially when it's available for under a couple bucks.
4934	1	a	Great game, not sure what to else say about it, but you'll have to be clever ;)
5167	0	a	There was a bug that made it impossible for me to finish the first level. 0/10 broken game, stay away.
1864	1	a	awesome game. recommend to everybody.
3494	0	a	I like the ideas behind this game, but the combat and quests were a chore and I stopped playing in the second area.
683	1	a	Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC. I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC. Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good. I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues. But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10). Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked. The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say 'Play'.  The new interface works good for me (on my 47' TV). I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam. But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly. Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine. In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI. The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV. The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.  I only wish it had controller support. The mouse works fine and intuitively. I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version. It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360). But it works just fine. I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .
2715	1	a	Surprisingly simple stealth game with complex variations that takes co-op play to a new level
3589	1	a	At times you'll wonder when the game will end because the combat doesn't reinvent the turn-based wheel.  That, though, is really the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The adventure game sensibilities kept me interested between fights which are the times during which most games lose my interest. Also, I read through all the dialogue even though it's skippable because I thought the writing was witty.  Overall I liked the game but it was short and probably had a few too many battles. If I could go back I'd buy it again.
626	1	a	Great game of strategy. 10/10.
579	1	a	If you love the tabletop, you will love the pc version. This is probably the most accurate representation of a board game on pc that I have ever seen. Great game!
5257	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is very different from Toki Tori 1. Whereas Toki Tori 1 is a straight up puzzle platformer with traditional levels, Toki Tori 2 is a Metroid-like explorable world, where solving puzzles is the way to get around. Also, unlike the first game, there are no items to use. Instead, different reactions can be elicited from the native creatures by Toki Tori either chirping or stomping. While it sounds rather simple in theory (and some of the early puzzle are), figuring out the correct sequence to solve a puzzle can get rather challenging at times. Simply put, this is not the game for people who hate puzzles or those lacking patience. Those who do manage to stick around for the harder areas of the game will find an enjoyable experience, and will no doubt find a number of easter eggs in the process.
1217	1	a	âLike Club Penguin with guns.â 10/10
3634	1	a	Very charming RPG, with a heart and sense of humour. It's a must, specially for the price.
2925	1	a	Multiplayer and co-op modes of thieves, hilarious storyline. Best played together with friends.
2972	1	a	This is probally the dankest â¥â¥â¥â¥ ive played in a year I literally flew from my chair and became god -IGN 10/10
2975	1	a	This game is awesome. I love that you can play it stealthy and strategically, but you can get ammo and shoot everyone or run around going YOLO. (not with the automated machines. dont do that QQ) The music is really fun, the guards are really funny (does this brush look a bit awkward? *looks at the potted plant containing 3 people and 5 corpses* nah.)  The story is witty, the modes are fun, there are a lot of workshop content that you can play after the campaign. I also have to add that I loved the crunching sounds made by the cleaner when you 'crush' a victim. You can play it alone, but co op makes it really fun, especially pvp is a blast! (especially if you have c4)   It's not difficult or complicated, but it's challenging and fun. You can do a mission different ways, for example you can just sit by the electricity switch(?) and wait for all the guards on the floor come by one by one to turn it on and 'crunch' them all!
4031	1	a	A light hearted but worth while play.
687	1	a	Imperfect but adequate translation of a great board game.  The board game is so clever and fun that this digital version is okay too, even though it's awkwardly designed. The menus and navigation start out clumsy, but once you actually get to the game board, you can figure out the slightly odd layout and get on with the game. The core game itself is an addictive strategy game, and it's definitely worth navigating the quirks of the digital version to play it.
3185	1	a	super! very clever design. thank you for patience training game,
2894	1	a	Dumb fun. A heist game where the consequences don't really matter. Set of an alarm? Did someone die? Hide in a vent, hide in a doorway, wait, revive, continue. Different characters/classes allow you to approach things differently but you'll probably find yourself using the same classes over and over again and some are definitely more useful than others. Story is rather convoluted and I lost track early on but that didn't seem to really matter, as the story has little importance once the level loads. I guess a way to approach the game might be to try and do each heist 'perfect'. Or it can just be dumb fun. The art design and perspective used in the game can also make things more confusing than necessary as well. Either way, I'd only recommend on discount.
1606	1	a	This is basically the old Arcade classic âGauntletâ reimagined with crooks and thieves, instead of Elves and Dwarves. Teams of players work together to steal loot, and escape alive. Im a give fan of heist movies, and I can say that this is awesome and want all my friends to get a copy of it, so we can rob banks together.
2614	1	a	Fantastic game with friends, pretty good game alone too
1112	0	a	Basically, a 4$ flash game. A good one, but still not worth the price (cause of lenght and gameplay).  SCORE: 40/100
4925	1	a	Really fun and bubbly puzzle game in the same niche as Portal. Storybook estetique and a good portion of black humor, a must for any fans of puzzle games!
1465	0	a	Best game ive ever played  Ive never played another video game
3866	1	a	A simple and satisfying game for young or old. Quest for candy, destroy monsters, and watch as your Halloween costumes spring to life in battle.
2755	1	a	Did you watch the movie Italian Job or Ocean's series? You like it? Then Monaco is perfect choice for you. There are many playable characters and each one of them has unique ability which is helpful to stealing. Single play is good, but co-op is better for this game. Monaco is very nice infiltraion game with unique art style and beautiful soundtrack.
3650	1	a	Double Fine Productions does it again with this adorable and silly adventure role-playing game. Its gameplay mechanics are a lot like the Final Fantasy series but for children. However, don't judge a book by its cover because Costume Quest is filled with fun dialogue and clever references. If you want to fight your way as a mech, knight, rainbow unicorn, or even a vampire, then Costume Quest is definitely a lot of fun.
1599	1	a	Reminds me of Payday.
682	1	a	Very nice adaptation of the board game and its various expansions.
793	1	a	A good port to one of my favorite board games.
1041	1	a	buy this game right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now
3289	0	a	6/10 Surprisingly addicting for simpletons. 1. Select rope or chain to cut ball 2. Try to drop ball into container 3. Gouge eyes out with nearest sharp pointy thing. 4. Rinse &amp; Repeat
4428	0	a	why do i have this in my game library i dont even remember buying this   i dont want to associate my self with filthy casuals
2704	1	a	Monaco, charming, challenging, chaotic, my most unique and addicting gameplay from the last year
1472	1	a	Pack 3 Friends and get the Heist going. Monaco: What's Yours is Mine truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled 'Best Plan Ever' complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying âReady? GO!â, only to see it backfire in seconds. Regardless of whether you plan on flying solo or with some buddies, do yourself a favor and go play Monaco
1965	1	a	Fun game, fast action, bright graphics. Classes and abilities aren't explained well, but community guides make up for that.
491	0	a	The latest update (11/19/2015) adds animations and sounds that are distracting and reduce my enjoyment of the game and cannot be turned off. The new map has added details that are (at least initially) distracting. I was playing this a lot, but I think I won't be playing it as much now.
846	0	a	Removed support for my friends platform so I am unable to play with them. Very annoying.
475	1	a	Outstanding PC adaptation of a classic board game.  Each turn a player takes a couple of train cards or spends those cards in order to place trains on pre-defined routes. Completing some objectives like a continuous route between two particular cities earns the player more points.  So the game is both about strategy of choosing what routes to use and how to achieve that, while also denying your opponents from achieving their targets.  The game is well balanced and the DLC additions while far from necessary certainly add to the longevity of the game if you find yourself enjoying the mechanics. Surprisingly for a game like this, the AI is decent. However in most cases it is not difficult to win if you have even a modicum of strategy.  If you've always wanted to try a board game on PC then this is a good place to start.
2636	1	a	Great game, Have you wanted to be the bad guy so this game is for you. found only one but big disadvantage - you can t play alone, must play with other people. Tihis game is not hard but not easy, hard only when you play alone. buy this game its great.
5298	1	a	Come to Steam, children! This is the feeling I get when I look at this game's graphics, all very cute and colorful. This is an OK casual game. It would be better if it wasn't for the rather slow pace.
2743	1	a	This game is cool
5349	1	a	Titan Attacks is a very fun and addictive game. It is almost like a modern take on Spack Invaders which works really well as they have added more to it which is implements in the game well.  + Great ark work which fits in very well to the style of the game  + Fun and addictive  + There is alot of replay value such as leaderboards and achievements  + Being able to upgrade your tank is a great feature which keeps you playing Titan Attacks  + The music fits in very well and has a big variety of songs  + The game is well worth the money and its easy to get a coupon so this game is well worth it  + Controls are simple as they should be which makes it easy to play  - You will find the game to be a bit dull arfter ten hours on gametime  - There are only a few maps to play on and they are very similer from each other  - You fell as if they should of added more to the game at times  Overall I think that Titan Attacks is a great game to play and is well worth the money. I am give it a 7/10. Its very fun but sometimes you want more.
2789	1	a	Killing people and robbing places all in a smal 2D game
442	0	a	Runs crazy slow in 1920x1080 even though I have a laptop with a gtx 860m graphics card, 12gb of ram and an i7 processor. I love the game but the performance makes it unplayable for me. If it was fixed I would whole heartedly love this game!
3111	1	a	its its really sad to buy this for a friend and never play it with them or anybody else but still 10/10 just make sure you have a group of friends to play with
1095	0	a	i like the idea of this game, especially as smuggle truck where youâre transporting immigrants across the border. unfortunately the steam version is only stuffed animals to âda zoo,â is very noticeably buggy, and i donât enjoy the levels that much either. luckily i got it through humble bundle for android 2, so i can install smuggle truck on android where itâs less buggy. if youâre like me, you may as well run the steam version long enough to get the cards and actually play it on android.
3933	1	a	Easy to play, made me laugh, and helped me to introduce a friend to the RPG genre!
2004	1	a	Is honestly most fun stelth game I play ever in life.
1570	1	a	This game stole my virginity          there is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my computer
4565	1	a	Unstoppable Gorg is a charming tower defense title with, unfortunately, some flaws. Planet Earth is your base, and you can use orbits to place sattelites (which are your towers actually). It's just that it's very limited... since there are predetermined spots where you can place sattelites. When I bought this game I was initially thinking I would be able to place them anywhere on the orbit lines, but that's just not the case. Besides that, the game can get frustratingly hard, resulting in an aweful lot of replays. Now, the graphics do look good and the sounds get the job done as well. But it's nothing special really. The movies inbetween are kinda cool though, using real actors and stuff.  But in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Unstoppable Gorg just isn't the tower defense title I hoped it would be. Still, you really can't go wrong with tower defense games, so if that's your genre I suggest you try it out anyway.  [Rating: 63/100]
711	1	a	Awesome buy to get on sale. Sad that they do not include all the maps, but it is a faithful rendition of the good old fashioned board games.
970	0	a	Not a horrible game, but disappointing at how little game time there actually is.
3136	1	a	So amazing. This game has the best elements of heist and stealth genres in a top down POV. I can't wait for tooth and tail to release Awesome job guys. :)
4521	1	a	10/10
4299	1	a	let me tell you a story that may seem off track and irrelevant at first.  once upon a time there was this game called rogue. shortly afterwarts there were alot of clones of rogue and all were bunched together under the label 'roguelike' creating a significant genre of games that stood out from the other computer roleplaying games. a long long time later there was a game called minecraft, building upon the softer branches of roguelikes, it inspired many clones of itself. at first these clones got negative reviews for just being clones but later some began to get really great reviews as games in their own right. what the hell does any of this have to do with this game?  simple. it's a katamari clone. but not as good. which isn't a problem since it is an indie game. you know how indie games dont have as much of a budget so ofcourse it's going to be abit lacking. so anyways this be the first game ive seen that's an attempt to be in the same genre as katamari. and i see so many negative reviews about how it's a clone of katamari but not as good. it's like finding all those minecraft clones and seeing negative reviews just because it's a clone all while missing the point of building up the genre of epic snowballing. this game in itself is pretty interesting. and it's a pc game and not a console game.
434	1	a	- Realy cool game, you are a Ball that shoots even more balls with flashy effects. 7/10 :D
2173	1	a	Wow this game is so good I hate it. I have so much fun whenever I play it that I seriously start puking all over my keyboard so now I have to play with cellophane over my keyboard and I can only get through a solid 10 minutes of gameplay before I blow chunks. 10/10
3622	1	a	Boils down the standard RPG formula to its bare bones for even the most casual of players to digest and then throws in some collection elements. It only lasts about 6 hours or so and the combat will get a bit stale with the lack of a deep progression system, but the writing will keep you laughing and it's definitely a good $15 spent. I especially reccomend it to anyone interested in game design or development. There's a lot of interesting experiments with opening up the genre to casual audiences here that I'd say succeeded.
5276	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ outdoes the previous game by doing the opposite of what Toki Tori 1 did. In the first game, you had lots of powers used to solve puzzles in single screen levels. Toki Tori 2 gives you only two interactions (a stomp and a chirp), but does away with the tradition level format in exchange for a huge world teeming with life. The challenge in the game comes from discovering how the creatures in the game react to your two moves and to each other. This makes the game world feel a bit deeper than most Metroidvania style games, as each section has it's own simplified ecosystem that make up the bulk of the game's puzzles.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platforming puzzles, exploration and discovery, or anyone looking for a Metroidvania game without any combat that still delivers a compeling experience.
966	0	a	Primarily a hidden object game that includes a few other minor puzzles, such as placing items into your inventory, combining them and then using them on the environment.   The art is nice but set at a smaller box resolution, the Steam overlay doesn't work and the story and voice acting are rather dull. That leaves you with the meat of the game, finding objects! The environments are nicely drawn and you have a list of 10-20 objects or so to find in each scene. A robot ally can spot items for you at the expense of some of his slowly replenishing energy--the game's form of hints.   Objects you need to find are repeated quite often considering the game is only about two hours long. There's a free mode after finishing the game where you can spot to your heart's delight, and playing the game again is supposed to shift the scenes. I don't know why anyone would want to because it's a bore.
977	0	a	You go from one hidden object scene to the next, not much game play in between. This is a very short game, I only made it to 3 hours by letting it run while doing other things. For my taste the main character is rather annoying and not the smarted cookie out there. Also, some of the item to search for are multiple times in the scene, so that you don't only have to find e.g. a lipstick, but the right one. For a true HOG fan, this is ok, but for anyone new to the genre, there are better games out there.
120	1	a	Interesting little casual game.
2073	1	a	Super fun and easy to play.  nice game to play with friends on lan, u have no friends?&gt;? no worries there's actually a community playing this hardcore.
3503	1	a	Hilarious for the kids. Just ok for the grownups.
3148	1	a	Get a four-pack to play with friends because the multiplayer is dead and enjoy fun best steathh heist gameplay and plot better than in some AAA games!
3406	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&amp;2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!
4421	1	a	If you like simple puzzle games like bejewled or Bubbles: this try it out. Just to simple for my liking.
5342	1	a	Awesome little game. Really addictive and a whole load of fun. You can't go wrong.
2606	1	a	worth while
706	1	a	Faithful port of a very good boardgame. Nice for online play, or just for the Zen of solitaire.
808	1	a	I almost didn't buy this because of the negative reviews saying a recent update ruined it. The game went on sale so I took a chance on it anyway and I'm really glad I did. I find it just as much fun as playing the physical board game with friends. The AI is plenty challenging enough for me.  The game has crashed a few times, but when I re-open it, it brings me right back to the turn where it crashed so this is no big deal. I have not tried online play, but solo play and pass &amp; play (local multiplayer) work well enough for me.  9/8/16 Edit: Game has not crashed in a long time. I can usually (but not always) beat the AI. This is still fun.
224	1	a	Good casual game with relaxing music
591	1	a	A very fun little game, based on the board game of the same name. A little pricey, especially if you buy the DLC too, but a great deal on sale. 
813	1	a	This is a fun table top type game. SImple and quick playing, but very catchy. Interesting variables with the gameplay styles of different maps. I only wish there was one map that has all the bonus cards active.
1101	0	a	Go buy yourself a hot coffee, then, remove lid and put it in your car. Now, drive a bumpy road somewhere with jumps and watch your coffee being spilled all around. That's what this game is.
1245	1	a	Snowball fights without getting cold!
3293	1	a	Strangely... soothing
2730	1	a	I approve. I love the tiny download sizes. I love talking to people and telling them not to screw it up. I love the chaos they create when they ignore it. And you can p*** in the toilets.
781	1	a	A somewhat clunky interface isn't enough to ruin this implementation of the tabletop board game. Much quicker than the physical version to get a game up and running. Really good for a quick fix.
4802	1	a	If you liked Portal, this game has some fun puzzle elements do it and a great art style.
2178	1	a	Monaco is good, if you have friends its good. play monaco, it has good good
623	1	a	A great simple digital version of the board game. Really great casual play, not too complicated, and not really cutthroat. You're trying to build train lines and connect cities. Slow but fun--my one complaint about the game in general is that you can't trade wagon cards with other players. It would open things up a lot and add a good level of interaction to the whole thing.
314	1	a	Do you like shooting things? Do you like flashy colors? Do you like polygons and polyhedrons? Then this game is for you. It's a very fun game with quick paced action, with the ability to slow down time every now and then a great twist. It can be played for a quick round of a few minutes or for however long you can handle it depensding on which of the many gamemodes you choose. It's not a complex, story-driven plot game. You just enjoy shooting dodecahedrons.
1134	1	a	Good game when U have friends, but if U are alone it is boring
2325	1	a	One of the best sealth co-op games around, with hilarous results!!
3840	1	a	'Best single player fun i've had for a while. If you like Halloween,trick or treat,dunkin' for apples,then this is for you. Good humour.'
4727	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a FPS puzzle platformer. You are the grandson or uncle, can't remember, of a scientist who has trapped himself in some dimension. You need to reset some generators to rescue him.  To achieve this goal you use different mechanics like freezing time, making objects heavier or lighter and something else I never got to use as I gave up on the game. It's fun at first but I was bored with the game a littel after starting the first generator. A lot of it felt like the same old thing just different room. Plus a lot of it looks exactly alike.  The game is challenging and could be enjoyable for some. I don't care for the FPS platforming cause it can become very irritating. If you like good physics puzzles and can handle FPS platforming than try the game out. It did seem well made but it's just not to my liking.  Bear Rating 7/10
3844	1	a	Double Fine at its best. A creative and funny game about halloween. Finally, a game where character selection isn't just male or female, but the choice between two different personalities altogether. I cannot reccomend this game enough.
1548	1	a	It's an amazing game that you can play together with friends, and I've had lots of crazy antics playing in this game with my friends. You can just go absolutely nuts playing this together with friends, with a load of maniacal things happening, even if you're just screwing around or playing the normal story mode! The variety of characters you can play as are incredibly fun to play with The Gentleman if you want to be stealthy, The Pickpocket if you just want to hoard money, The Hacker for taking out security systems, The Mole for taking those irritating walls(who needs walls anyway? :D), The Lockpick for quick break-ins, The Lookout for a better view of what you're up against, The Redhead for getting those random cops to fall for you, and The Cleaner for silent knockouts... It's a great game, and you just have to play it! -WesTheDerp
4808	1	a	Such a fun game! If you love Portal you will love this!
1097	0	a	In this game you're the proprietor of a white van with tinted windows. Your goal is to drive around the town and recruit various children who are loitering around the school after hours to help find your lost puppy. When you pick a child up it is then your duty to brutally and savagely anally â¥â¥â¥â¥ them. This is the 'snuggle' part of the game. You then must drive down a secluded road miles away from their home and dump them off in the middle of the woods.
5344	1	a	Titan Attacks: Space Invaders, but better! That's the long n' short of it, minus the long.   So what is the long of it? Well...   Firstly, presentation! The game takes on an 8-bit  styled  aesthetic; The game's rather high res, but all graphics are styled in a blocky fashion with thick black outlines. Alongside this, particle effects are large pixels, and there's a bunch of filters and shaders on the game that make it look, um, arcade-y? Like, you've got scan lines, and a lot of things glow in this weird way as if you're, er, looking at a screen. It's hard to explain without just showing pictures of the game itself. There's also these more abstract effects where the game screen distorts or wraps around the the edges of the monitor; It was kinda cool the first few times it happened, but it did get on my nerves after a while. Thankfully, it only happens on menus, not during heated space battles, and you can toggle the various distortions off in the options menu (Options are Stroboscopics, Shader FX and Distortion FX).    There isn't a ton of music, but what's there is pretty jammin'. It's all techno, ranging from softer tracks, like during the main menu and shop, to more intense pieces during the actual stages. Stages are over pretty quick too, so it's never like you're listening to any one piece for an lengthy period of time, making them harder to get tired of. Still, there are audio sliders in the options menu for both sound effects and music in case you don't care for either. Might not wanna turn off sound effects though, as each hazard has it's own very distinct sound effect that'll keep you notified as to what's going on around you when things get more chaotic in the later stages; whether it's mines being laid, saucers flying across the top of the screen, or a charging laser beam, you'll more than likely need to keep an ear open for telltale signs of doom.    But enough of that, what about the actual game? Well, you control a tank going left and right across the ground and shoot aliens, most of which fire back at you and descend in some way or another. Occasionally you'll see a saucer flying at the top of the screen behind everything; it'll drop bonus-points, cash, shields, health, screen clearing bombs, or super cannons when you shoot it down, making the game a little easier on you if you can shoot it down. Alongside that, enemies have a chance to fall to the ground instead of exploding when you blast them, and you can shoot them again for a 'skill-shot' for extra points and money (Though they'll damage you if they crash into you). Alongside THAT, there's a chance that a martian will parachute out of the ship. These guys are a little trickier, 'cause you can pick them up for cash bonuses, but you can also accidentally kill them for no point/cash bonus, and if you don't pick them up, they escape and result in a cash deduction equal to the cash bonus you could've gotten otherwise.   With all these basic factors in play, alongside all of the hazards, battles become about good spacial awareness and quick decisions about what course of action should be taken: 'I could try and get that saucer for it's bonus, or I could catch that alien to keep me from losing money and get some bonus cash... The alien's floating over an area of heavy fire though... It might be more trouble than it's worth, and I won't get the saucer in time if I go to it. I don't want the cash penalty though... I think I'll kill it, then real quickly get the saucer.' Of course, if you don't make that rambling monologue of a decision quick, you'll be space dust. You'll have a lot to think about, and not a lot of time to think about it. Gotta be fast! All of this is helped by the fact that you move around by shifting the mouse left and right, so your speed is bound to how fast you can move it, and thus, is more or less infinite. This allows you to go mach 5 underneath low hanging projectiles and ships, making it possible to make those quick choices under the pressure and chaos of a full on martian assault.   In between stages is a shop to spend the money ya get, obviously, on health and weapons. There are repairs, which get more expensive the less damaged your tank is, screen clearing bombs, which get more expensive as you buy them through the game, cannon damage, cannon fire rate, add-ons (Other weapons), and add-on fire rate. It's pretty straight forward, and it's not like you have a whole lot of options, especially since you can't choose what add-ons you get (You purchase them in a specific order). Even then, the add-ons don't really change the gameplay too much; You've got left-side laser, right-side bigger-laser, left-side rocket launcher, and right-side laser beam. It all just kind of adds up to a large flurry of projectiles that don't add much of a tactical edge, but they're useful nonetheless.   The design of the different worlds were also very nice. Every twenty stages, after a boss fight with the mother ship of that world (Which, while fun, were never all that noteworthy), you go to the next planet: Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn, and finally, the alien home world of Titan. The changes of scenery were nice, but the new hazards were what really differentiated them. You see, this game, while being a Space Invaders homage, incorporates elements from other really old space games/shooters. Earth is simply Space Invaders, nothing more. Starting with the Moon stages, you'll be showered with neon blue asteroid outlines that split when you shoot them, which is a homage to... Well Asteroids. The Mars stages have their ships spin around in lines before taking formation for a short period of time, the dive bombing your tank, which is a homage to Galaga. I don't actually know what the Saturn stages homage; The idea behind those stages is that massive hordes of ships will descend from the top of the screen and try to collide with you before warping back to the top. Finally, Titan introduces these trains of enemies that go back and forth and split/drop stationary ships when you shoot them, which is how the Millipede in the game of the same name behaved. Every planet provided something new to keep the shooting more varied and interesting, and did so by providing tribute to some similar titles of gaming's history; I'd say it worked!   And for you score-junkies out there, the game doesn't have to end by the time you beat the 100th stage! After laying waste to Titan's flagship, you're instantly placed back at the first stage of the game with all of your upgrades, the same score, and more durable enemies. I think this goes on endlessly until you die, but I wouldn't know since I never made it to the end boss on the second run. Anyway, this allows you keep building that hi-score and show off on the global leaderboards; y'know, if you're into that.    I do have a few minor complaints, such as how there's no invincibility period when being hit, and how some stages have layouts that'll corner you very easily. Mix both factors together, and you've got a recipe for a near insta-death. It doesn't happen TOO often though, so whatever.   Anyway, I gotta wrap this up. It's a very nice looking and fun Score Attack/Space Invaders &amp; Friends inspired game. It's a bit on the pricey side for what it is though... I'd only really get it if it's in a bundle, on sale, or you know someone who's into the Score-Attack genre/Looking for a late 70's gaming nostalgia trip. In those cases, I'd really recommend it!   But in the end, it's all just my humble opinion. Cross-reference mine with others and see if it's a game for you.  Bottom Line: Titan Attacks is a game you get to shoot aliens and beat Admiral Nyaruko's 10 DIGIT SCORE. Jesus Christ, At least I'm in the top 10... For now... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5407	1	a	A fun little game that might just appeal most to old-timers who would appreciate the homage to arcade shooters. Space Invaders, Galaxian, and Galaga, of course, but also Centipede--by far the hardest levels. And throw in the occasional Asteroid.  Wonderful, bright (and yet dark?) graphics and simple, but satisfyingly wet and crunchy sound effects complete the package.  For the Achievers out there, don't be surprised to find you have completed over 50% of the achievements in a single, one-hour playthrough. Be aware that the save mechanic on Steam isn't at all like you'll read in the PSN guides. However it's not too hard to use the world-based checkpoints to quickly get to the challenge levels to perfect those. You'll likely want to fast-forward to Titan to have the best chance of grinding through the alien capture/escape achievements.
1676	1	a	Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:  'Dear future security officer,  congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:  - If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing. - If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it. - If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1. - Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at. - Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY. - Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER. - Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO. - Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting â¥â¥â¥ is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.  With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.'   [[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]
4669	1	a	this game is my answer whenever someone ask me what my favorite game of all time is. stirring story, cosy stages, overwhelmingly entertaining puzzles, genuine humor and everything I look for havin' fun in a game. I wish there was a sequal for it. I had my best times while playin'. 4 different dimension supply a huge variety on complexity and not only that it has awesome gameplay trough with it. I always thought that could cause lots of improvement in game industry but it's been 3 years and yet all we got is 'The Talos Principle'. I really think developers should look up for this game and draw a lesson. that's the stuff we need more and more. I dont know what kim swift doin' these days but we need her back really bad zxzxzx.
4461	1	a	I've played this one a lot, to engage the top level of my brain while I'm trying to figure out something else with the other parts of my brain. It's fun, a little mindless, but not in a bad way.
4744	1	a	Think way outside of the box. And then make it fluffy.
1530	1	a	Fantastic way to practice your high school French. Qui va lÃ ?   It's a decent single player game*, but the co-op play is great! Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.  Level design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...  The storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a 'mash the button to skip past all these stupid words' type, but not this time. Very well done.  It does have a few annoying aspects: - If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game.  - The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine.  - The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.    * My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing. I think he's nuts. :) 
855	0	a	Love the board game and I have most of its expansiond, but I can't recommend boardgames that are based on pay to play.
221	1	a	Totally LOVE this game! Great pick up and play game. Find myself playing it more and more. Really like the diverse playing options. Reminds me of Geometry Wars, an all-time favorite, and, much to my surprise, I find myself liking Waves more thatn G.W. Definitely recommend this game!
4774	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Portal! Same type of gameplay, but all new mechanics! (I also love John de Lancie so it's a fantastic game all around)
1656	1	a	Great game, take a bit of time to get use to the style of it.
748	1	a	This is a pretty fun and competitive game. I definitely recommend it!
302	1	a	Had a hard time getting a non-xbox controller to work with it, but the price point and game itself are spectacular already. If you loved geometry wars, or other arcade style survival shooters... you will love this.
1190	0	a	i didn't think i would ever regret spending 29 cents on a game but frickin crap.
3450	1	a	A classic in my opinion. This made me excited for Halloween probably more than decorating or getting my own costume and such. A great little game with RPG elements, but a unique style of its own.
5353	1	a	I don't play as many video games as I did 30 years ago when my kids were growing up. But once in awhile when I have the free time, I like to play something. Anyway, I was given this game as a gift, and I really like it. It is a lot like Space Invaders, but with nicer graphics. I like that I can upgrade the cannon. I would recommend it to anybody who remembers  playing Atari years ago.
2557	1	a	Its pretty good. I like the multiplayer quite a bit. It can be hard sometimes but then you realize its actually a pretty strategic game and requires a plan to win. 8/10
3544	1	a	Loved it!  Yes its cute, yes its simple, yes it falls into the category of casual. But its easy to play, doesn't take a lot of thought, and if you need something to take your mind off of the daily grind this game is for you! Plus with the DLC it gets even better. Now you're in a world where Robots, Pirates, and yes The Statue of Liberty get to join forces and save candy from monsters.   Great Game!  
3067	1	a	First, I want to say one thing. If you think FPS games are annoying sometimes and have a lot of flaws then, buy this game. If you like absolute chaos, then buy this game. If you like good soundtrack... then buy this game. if you have Â£10.99... then buy this game.  First off... I'd like to say that this review is longer than this. I would MOST CERTAINLY recommend this game. But to play it properly you need (at least) a small amount of intelligence. Even if you don't have some intelligence then it can be fun, but not to the fullest.  The game is set in, as the title suggests, Monaco, and it revolves around a group of theives who escaped from prison, and are trying to escape the contry by performing heists on certain buildings. There are A LOT of mechanics. You need to play the game to realise how complex it can be... without being very complex in itself.   The stealth aspect of the game revolves around a line of sight kind of thing, along with crouching so people dont turn around and kill you with their machine guns/pistols or batons. It's a bit like metal gear solid but there's no alert mode exactly, just each guard can be alerted by stuff like civilians screaming 'MON DIEU AHHGHHH!!' and things like that. (Heck, there's even red exclamation marks above alarmed guard's heads!).  Overall, wonderful game, blissful soundtrack and is absolutely crazy. 10/10 Would kill 8 people in a row with a shotgun again.
4743	1	a	If You A Portal Fan, Well This May Be Something You Might Like.
128	1	a	This game makes you think; if that wasn't enough...it makes you think.  Think about that.  What do you think about that?  You know what I think about that?  I think you should give it a try.  It's worth the investment.  It's like 3-d tetris in space.
2447	1	a	This game's the most fun when you get a team of four competent players working together. Try it out with friends.
546	1	a	My boyfriend bought me this in order to force me to play with him and in all honestly I didn't think it'd be my type of game at all..boy was I wrong! I absolutely love it..even more so than him now lol.  It's a great online board game, one of the best, if not  the  best.  There's always people online to play against which is definitely a major plus.  It's fun for the odd game when you're bored or if you want to play hours I still find it entertaining.  The DLC add a fair bit of variety to tracks too!   As you can see I've racked up a lot of hours in this and that'll just continue to grow :)  A 10/10 from me.
3942	1	a	This game is filled with charm and humour as well as being a really enjoyable, if basic turn based RPG. I would highly recommend it for anyone but especially if you are a fan of Halloween or cute stories, Costume Quest will not let you down.
5472	1	a	Byotiful.  Absolutely byotiful.
318	1	a	Great little pick-up-and-play twin stick shooter with pleanty of game modes to keep you interested.
4173	1	a	Bejeweled mixed with a RPG and surprisingly very addictive. Recommended.
840	1	a	Very fun and replayable. This board game can either be played against AI or against other players. The addition of achievements gives you something else to aim for to try something new in your strategies. The games are always different and I enjoy this game so much i bought the physical copy to play at my house with friends and family.
3446	1	a	This game is sooooo cute and I love it! There's so much to do and its so fun! ^.^
4145	1	a	Edit: My husband wrote the original review. This is my review. I've actually played the game.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING!   First off, the MUSIC! The music just gets you right into that 'match things' mood. If you are kicking behind, it ramps up with your adrenaline and you push yourself to an epic win. If you are losing... well, let's just say you'll know that tune and when the announcer chimes in that your hero is near defeat it's totally okay to start sweating.  Next, the actual game play is so smooth! Some matching games can be kind of jerky or have a slower response time. Puzzle Quest does not! It is smooth and seemless. The battle load screens don't last too long and walking about in the RP world isn't cumbersome or annoying. You can even rapidly click through dialoge if you don't care and just want to fight!  Did I mention the music? Because this is seriously some of the best music.   Also worth a paragraph is the strategy aspect. If you play correctly and put some thought into it, this game can be as intense and engaging as a game of chess. I have logged my 600+ hours on almost exclusively my druid, who should be one of the wimpiest in the game. However, using tactics and planning, she can whoop any enemy. Pick your skills, items, spells, and mounts carefully. Know your enemy's weaknesses. Know the board mechanics. Manipulate everything to your will and you will surely master Puzzle Quest.  Of course, after 600+ hours you would think I would be bored with the game, right?  NOT AT ALL! I return to PQ faithfully on a regular basis when I want a respite from the world of MMOs, MOBAs, and RTSs.   So go on, what are you waiting for?   The original sucky review by my husband who has NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: It's like Bejeweled except you fight and the music is way more epic than it should be, but it's still a wonderful game.
2157	1	a	find out which of your friends are bumbling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and which of your friends you actually like
584	1	a	I love this game!
5318	1	a	I couldn't get past the second level. Puzzle game fans should enjoy it.
895	1	a	Good. Like the board game. And free. Can usually find a match online.
2374	1	a	Love this game. The controls are so simple that anybody can pick up and play it without much difficulty. But the gameplay isnt lacking due to it's simplicity, as a little cooperation is key to success. Whether you're just playing with your best friend, or your whole gang, this game is greatly worth it. The story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and (without giving too much away) is told from more than one perspective of the characters that you play as. So there's a little for everyone to enjoy. Story. Gameplay. Simplistic. Fun. 9.5/10 Highly recommended.
110	1	a	They weren't kidding when they wrote up the description for this little gem. Brutally simple to learn, simply brutal to master, Critical Mass is the kind of game literally anybody can just pick up and waste hours upon hours of their lives playing, all in a vain attempt to top the charts. And don't think for a second I mean any of that in a bad way. Far from it; Critical Mass possesses a fun, addictive quality rivaled only by the likes of Tetris and similar titles.  In case you still have doubts, bear in mind that this game only costs a measely two bucks, so it won't be a serious dent in your pocketbook even if you turn out to be one of the four or five people globally who don't enjoy it (you know who you are). With that in mind, what do you have to lose? I pride myself for being more discriminating than most when it comes to choosing which games to buy with a rather limited budget, so believe me when I say Critical Mass is a nearly fool-proof purchase!
901	1	a	Game got me hooked enough to buy board game. Board game takes a good 15 minutes to set it up. Stopped playing board game and stick with this for good.
1015	1	a	I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.  This is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.  The experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.
4496	1	a	Cool game 10/10 would play again =-O
4963	1	a	This game is is funny and has really clever mechanics.
2448	1	a	If you like the idea of the perfectly executed heist, you will love this game. Play with a few tight friends, and you will feel like a bad-â¥â¥â¥ (or get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked). Either way, it's a solid game.
3947	1	a	Got this game just before Halloween. The whole family curled up on the couch and passed the controller around all weekend long. Imaginative, family friendly, fun, and funny. What a wonderful experience to share with my kids!
1191	1	a	goty every year
807	1	a	A Very fun and wonderful game. I can melt away hours playing this across multiple platforms as well as the original board game. This version is really good. It responds well, it's pretty and fun playing with friends in online multiplayer. If you enjoy board game style games then do yourself a favor an get this. The DLC just adds more fun to it.
2765	1	a	Pretty fun, friends who are idiots will want you to no longer be friends w/ them. 
400	1	a	Waves is an awesome fast paced 'arcade' style shooter that for the price is an absolute steal! This game is incredibly addictive, has great graphics and colours, a great selection of different modes from survival to bomb run and also has an amazing retro themed electronic soundtrack to go with it.  Add this all together and you get a great addictive game that you will play for a long time to come, as these types of games don't really get old.. ever!   Would highly recommend and for the price it is 100% worth it! I would give it 9/10.
1480	1	a	steam glitched from the free weekend and gave me this game for free forever 10/10
1780	1	a	Unique classes with different abilities, doesnt require a good laptop, fun (especially with friends), but later on gets kinda boring. 7/10
3800	1	a	A game for kids and adults. If you want to have a laugh while playing a great game, Costume Quest is what needs to be in your games collection!
3500	1	a	This game looks great. It's a really simple RPG and probably a very short one, but it looks cool.  Fighting monsters are a little bit annoying because of quick time events. I hate quick time events.
636	1	a	Alright, so there's a reason that the tabletop version of this game won Spiel des Jahres, and the steam version makes it even better. And cheaper!   Buy the European map as well for god's sake, the USA one is quite boring and doesn't have stations.
4767	1	a	What was supposed to be a simple visit to your uncle, who happens to be a brilliant scientist, becomes anything but simple when you discover that he isn't there to meet you and instead talks to you via his mansion's speaker system when suddenly an explosion rocks the mansion and your uncle ends up in some odd dimension. Now it's up to you to explore the really odd mansion and find a way to bring your uncle back to the proper dimension. Of course you will be doing some dimension switching yourself, all have their own unique looks and effects on the various objects, be sure to look at the paintings in each dimensions for a laugh. The story is simple, but it has a charm to it and the whole dimension mechanic is extremely well done and the puzzles will force you to be extremely creative with dimension hopping.
210	1	a	Rating 8,5/10  I played this game about 3 hours at once. Definitely, I can say it is very fun. You shoot other balls that come towards you. It can be seen as very simple and boring, yet there are different game modes such as rush, survival and bombing run, that I liked and enjoyed most. With them, you can have different gaming experinces
3106	1	a	Perhaps the most fun I've had in a game. A relaxing, yet not overally simple, game that is genuinly fun. Highly recommended.
2237	1	a	OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO THIS GAME IS VERY' WORTH TO BUY !!
4110	1	a	puzzle quest was like lightning in a bottle, the devs have proved they will never make a game this good again
4413	1	a	This is the second game I've played in this series. Really enjoyed them both. Took about 4.5 hours to complete this whole game, but being a puzzle game, it has high replay value. I liked this one more than the original game. It still has the same overall game mechanics but without the rotating of the board. The original was more challenging for sure.   There's not really much to say. It's a standard match 3 game like Bejeweled. There's the 7 Wonders theme, but no story. I still find this to game to be the most fun in this genre besides Bejeweled. After playing both the original and the sequel, I will continue to play other games in the series.
2397	1	a	10/10 you can stealth
3621	1	a	An RPG with combat similar to the paper mario series and some clever mechanics: your costume descides what class you are, and almost all of them have some out of combat ability. While it's not very hard or complicated, It makes up for this by being very cute and a lot of fun, with a very silly sense of humor.  Not much else to say really, If you want a nice, quick game to play to get in the mood for Halloween, this would be it.
1640	1	a	This game is a must buy for such a low price! Easy to understand when you start off playing.   A great combination of stealth play, tower heist and a 16 bit colourful retro theme. Plus the light piano music &amp; french accents is like the cherry on top. Also a bird eye view setting.  If you feel like stealing a bunch of valuable objects from buildings with plenty of security guards that you can either kill or make confused as hell, then you'll love this game.  There's a choice of 4+ characters with distinct unique abilities to help disarm alarms, hack computers, unlock doors, break down walls, you name it! You can pick up weapons too (AK-47s, spanners, C9s) but I find that breaks the stealth mode you want to enjoy and should really be used if you have no other option.  There are plenty of levels to play with character stories behind them. Co-op of up to 4 players is a great feature with so much more room for activities!  Super fun, highly recommended 10/10
3824	1	a	Fun little quarky, text based RPG.
2923	1	a	This game is awsome! Everybody must buy 
1613	1	a	One of the best cooperative games I own. Those clutch saves when one of you is stuck in a tricky situation, or pulling off perfect team timing make it all worth it
1192	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buns, wtf is this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It wasnt worth the 30 cents.
668	1	a	I have played the IOS and Android versions. The Europe/Swiss/Asian map is more fun to play.  A really good adatation of the the board game.  One slightly bad thing is that on Andriod, it i hard to review the scoreing.
492	0	a	At the beginning it was really a cool game, remind me the boards games I got at home. I decide to replay this after a couple of year off...  I did try all the different bot and maps... and i was really frustrating, game feel slower than before, bot were not at all playing objectives, they just build road beginning with those who get the more point till they don't have wagon left. 6 games, none of the bots made an objectives... -_- I like this game, but playing with those bot no way.   If you want this game play online with human being, seems ok but don't buy it to play alone.
1275	1	a	10/10 #Gameoftheyear2014 just go ahead and buy it you wont regret it! (much)
1280	1	a	What do you get when you force Super Smash Bros and Quake to make love?    This Masterpiece   
4183	1	a	Nice casual game. Great for procrastination.
62	1	a	This game is kinda easy in parts and then kinda hard in parts without warning and unfortunately it's a tad pricey for being so short.
5114	1	a	This game is one of those Dungeon Keeper 2 clones that's done REALLY well. There are many differences, such as being three dimensional in it's layout meaning you can mine down and up for resources. There are also no designated rooms meaning you can freely put whatever you want where-ever you want. It is a very long game and I warn you now, since the game has a huge area, especially in the later levels when building in large groups of Dwarves it'll munch on your virtual memory like it needs ever inch to survive. The story is certainly not epic, but it's definantly commedic and quite fun to play. I recommend playing it if you love games such as Evil Genius or Dungeon Keeper 2.
1202	1	a	There's one server.
2196	1	a	Simple Stealth Action!
1044	1	a	Would snuggle again - 10/10
4845	1	a	Enjoy the portal-esque puzzles. Hate the first-person platforming. Love the art-style. Q is your narrator. Worth my money.
1747	1	a	Monaco is the game that I started to play with my wife. It has been only 3 month that we married and she got her first steps on gaming culture, so I was a bit suspicious about how she will gonna interact with this game. I can't find true words maybe in shortest way, but It Was Amazing, Full of Fun! We were shouting each others about what we doing for each other whle playing game feeling whole adrenaline rush while running in corridors and hiding from swat guys etc. It was enormous feeling and fun to spend together with keyboard - gamepad while looking on same screen. I just wish to thank dev's team who gave us this beautiful time and opportunity to spend together.  My only con note about Monaco is, there is no way to play 2 people on same-screen whle online... We cannot setup 2 different gaming pc at home which I dont believe as 'standard' around, and we wish to play 2 more people in our team, so we couldnt understand technically why this is not possible... But generally, awesome game.... Awesome!
1762	1	a	A person who doesnt like this game is a person who doesnt like live. This takes its place as 4th favourite game (EVER) I am a person who doesnt really like these type of games but when I played it I fell in love.
4156	1	a	My wife loves killin' Nazzies with the power of gem puzzles. I say, hey, whatever kills them Nazzies is alright in my book.
3896	1	a	This game is downright adorable; and at only $15 which includes the expansion this is very much worth the price. Bursting with humour and creativity this game shows what Halloween used to mean to us 30 year old kids.
2694	1	a	A really fun and organised friendly game :)
1929	1	a	me:do you have this game  you:no  me:what the hell get it right now it is so awesome  you : ok  that is what u say to people who dont have the game cause it is so god damn awesome
5337	1	a	FUN! Very old school style.
1680	1	a	its awsome 
1769	1	a	Monaco has a 2 great things about intense escapes and great startegy 10 out of 9 
1025	1	a	This game is stupid and I love it.
948	1	a	This is a review for both 'Clockwork Man' and 'Clockwork Man: The Hidden World' since I played them back to back and they share the same lead character. Actually, I've played both these games many times on a different PC before I got into Steam. So my playtimes you see for each will probably be less than a normal playthrough since I can whiz through the games by now. We'll start with game #1:  Pros:  - Nice graphics and good character designs. The main girl, Miranda (YAY, she has my name!), is quite lovely.  - The voice acting is also good, for the most part. I really like who they chose for Miranda. Some of the others can be a bit cheesy but it is amusing rather than irritating.  - Interesting story.  - Both games have a very neat hidden object feature. Scrolling and zooming. Not every scene but many allow you to move around the area. Some items are sneakily hidden behind others but just one click to the left or right will reveal them.  - Both games also have an interesting hint system. You travel around with a little robot man and he'll help you locate those tough to find objects. He starts out with the ability to just tell you where a random something is. Then a little into the story, he learns how to give you an item's silhouette (which is the hint I prefer if I'm stuck). Further in the story, he gets other abilities. Like briefly highlighting each metal object on your HO list.  - In both games, the music isn't spectacular but it's pleasant to listen to. Actually, in #2 there are a couple places with very lovely melodies.  - When you beat each game, Freeplay opens up. This gives you random hidden object areas. Good for if you're in that 'I have a craving to find stuff' mood.  Cons:  - Neither game is connected to Steam while you're playing. So you won't be able to chat with friends or take steam screenshots.  - Unfortunately, both games have issues when it comes to clicking on items. You'll find you need to be very precise and occasionally you'll need to click more than once or try clicking on a different part of the object. It doesn't happen TOO often or else I wouldn't be able to recommend these games.  - Both games are short. Boo.   Now I'll list the differences in Clockwork Man: The Hidden World:   - The length is longer. Because of the higher difficulty, possibly much longer.  - This game has a journal where Miranda records her adventures and anything of note. You WILL need to use this journal to solve quite a few puzzles.  - There are many more puzzles in #2 and some of them are downright devious. There are no skip options either. Also, it's easy to miss things that you need in some scenes so you might get stuck for awhile. I love this game but it IS a bit aggravating sometimes. Those who enjoy a challenge will have fun. :D  - The story has no tie-ins with the first game. The Hidden World's plot is much more involved than #1 and, in my opinion, fascinating.  - The voice acting, again in my opinion, is better than the first game. (Miranda is still the same, which is good!)  - Maybe it's my imagination but it seems the graphics are better in #2, though I'm pretty sure they used the same game engine.   - When you finish the game, you can rewatch any of the cutscenes.    So in closing, I really enjoy both these games so I'm definitely recommending them to hidden object and puzzle fans. But, because of their short length, you should wait and grab them when they're on sale.   Important Note! The games might not load up for you, which is an issue I had. Right click on the Clockwork Man title, click on Properties, click on Local Files, click on Browse Local Files (which will bring up your program files for the games), right click on the Clockwork Man title again, click on Troubleshoot Compatibility, and finally click on Try recommended settings. I did that for each game and then they worked just fine.
3373	1	a	The rpg aspect of this game is so beautiful and the cartoon like graphics aren't too hurting to the eye neither. This is definitely a buy and 100% that ish. The DLC ain't that bad neither.
4582	1	a	So simple and so amazing, This game got me hooked immediately. I recommend this to any tower defense genre enthusiasts. It has a very unique gameplay, the story may be a little cheesy but it is pretty much fine, it just adds extra flare to the game. I love the extra 'retro' cutscenses in between levels. HIGHLY recommended game, hurry up and get this while the 90% discount is still active! By the way, I have no idea how this game has got such a low metascore, don't let that deceive you, get this !!!
3807	1	a	It is a very good halloween turn-based battle game! i have had this since christmas because i had like $2.50 in my steam wallet. I would recommend this alot! 10000/10000 Thumbs up!
3363	1	a	Costume Quest is a good game and definitely worth $10. This game reminded me A LOT of South Park Stick of Truth to the point that I actually wondered if the South Park team had used Costume Quest as an influence when they created their game. That being said, obviously the actual story and dialogue is very different to Stick of Truth. For one, the kids aren't swearing constantly, for two nobody is getting anything shoved up the rear region and for three there is no  spoken  dialogue. I was really on the fence about there being no voice actors in this game. What I enjoy about Double Fine Production games is that their characters are really likeable and they take the time to show you a little bit about everyone in your world, even the guy that you see for one second will have a funny line and a nice costume. Here I felt that was not necessarily absent but not as prevelent when compared to other Double Fine games like Psychonauts. I wanted to hear the kids voices especially in cut scenes where the dialogue is bouncing between 5 different people. It just would have made it easier to follow. Obviously it's not like you're constantly reading, this isn't a visual novel, it's just something that I would change. The characters are still likable and the story keeps you motivated to continue to the end.  What I liked the most about this game is that it's funny! It's fun! It's lighthearted! The art style is great. The world is detailed and immersive. The turn-based fighting avoids becoming repetitive because every now and then you get a new costume and a new set of awesome moves that come with it. Everytime I got a new costume I would call my boyfriend over so we could watch it's ultimate ability and high 5 afterwards because 90% of the time it was FREAKIN AWESOME! Heck I even took one of the ultimates and put in on 9GAG because it rocked my world.   http://9gag.com/gag/aLPeW75   What's more, you get Grubbins on Ice which is about an extra 1 - 2 hours of gameplay after you've completed Costume Quest. It's equally as fun and provides a great ending leaving you wanting to purchase Costume Quest 2 so you can see what happens. To complete both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice should take 7 - 10 hours depending on how into unlocking achievements you are. It's also the type of game that you can play again after a year or two. Oh and also, if anyone from Double Fine reads this: Thanks for adding the Psychonauts music in the Camping Store at the Mall. It made me smile &lt;3  7.5/10
3855	1	a	Actually fun, think like paper mario but simpler and halloween and possible hidden undertones of child â¥â¥â¥â¥
4972	1	a	Fun and puzzling game. I like first-person puzzle game, and this game delivers. Great gameplay, as you can change your environment in four different ways. Recommend!
1966	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.
2573	1	a	its yummy
153	1	a	The game is fun, and at such an inexpensive price, should be ownable by all.
2577	1	a	one of the best co-op game ever!  A Heist and stealth game for couch co-op
5470	1	a	Nothing much to say about this one. It's a Space Invaders clone, featuring new stuff that doesn't seem like Space Invaders on later levels, but a whole different bullet hell shooter game. The game has 5 worlds, and 100 enemy waves. You get to upgrade your gunpower, your shields, add Smartbombs, extra cannons (Plus a laser blaster and a rocket launcher.) and the amount of bullets in screen. You better start off upgrading the amount of bullets, cause accidentally shooting and waiting for it to go through the whole screen is really boring. And might get you killed depending on the situation. The soundtrack is good. You can use a keyboard, controller or even the mouse itself. Controls are so simple you can use a MOUSE.  tl;dr version: It's Space Invaders. With Upgrades. And more speed. And more gun. And it's good. Buy it. It's cheap.
72	1	a	This is a great game so far- the beautiful environment and music really makes it a unique and breathtaking experience. My main complaint however, is that this flash game is in such a small window. It is almost like a mobile game, since the maxiumum window size is so small. It would be much better if it was in HD and I could full-screen it. Also, the clicking doesn't feel too natural. The way that you explore the environment around you could be improved.
4603	0	a	It is an entertaining concept, but a poor execution. Level setup is always tedious, the narrator is obnoxious, &amp; physics bugs make some levels unbeatable. I tried to like it, but it's just not worth spending time on.
1176	0	a	imagine getting gangrene on your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ then having to cut it off with a dull filet knife  that is getting this game to work on multiplayer  
1140	1	a	This game changed my life for ever. A stunning mix of gameplay and storytelling. One of the most underated games on Steam. 10/10
3991	1	a	If you liked Halloween as a kid, exploration quests and simple combat system, this is a great game. There are actually two games inside one. The keyboard controls take a bit to get used to, although you can remap them. PC gaming pad would work the best. I only wish that everyone decorated their houses for halloween like in Costume Quest!
2830	1	a	Creative, challenging, and fun. You should own it.
4169	1	a	Final fantasy meets Bejewelled meets crack addiction :P
4581	1	a	A unique and interesting take on tower defense.
4420	1	a	Can get you to waste some hours. But nothing special.
5219	1	a	Although it may seem like a 'kiddy' game because of the artstyle, graphics, etc. Some of the puzzles in this game will really make you think. Great for people who like puzzle games, and games that they can play casually to relax.
3139	1	a	The best heist game one can play, whether it's a solo, online, or local multiplayer experience. Play it as stealthy as possible, stealing every last coin without losing a single life, or go completely nuts, making a destructive mad dash for the main treasure with guards in pursuit. The game offers a wide variety of character classes and challenges to suit your preferred diffulty and style of robbery.
4206	1	a	It's ok but a little bare fora PC game, definitely better on the iPhone.
2778	1	a	Me and my friend play this together and well it is hard at some points with two people but we manage! I love this game for its disigne and how well it plays! The game is very fun on multi-player and very competitive too! If you like action and 2D games then this is ment for you. It even has stealth in there for those who want that!
3262	1	a	ObulisÂ® is not a very good puzzle game as most levels require a lot of luck and not a small level of skill. so you may find yourself stuck on a puzzle long after you figured out how to solve it. I would recommend this game to people who like puzzles but just bear in mind the puzzles are easy,... but actual solving them...
1647	1	a	Frantic and challenging. You'll be left arms-in-the-air-cheering when you've finally cleared that difficult level on your 9th attempt.
778	1	a	Simple concept yet so addicting. Love it!
1869	1	a	Me likey. I'd cut off my balls and sell them on ebay just to play 5 minutes of this game. Its cereal guys. For realzies.
3206	1	a	Obulis is a great puzzle game with good music. It has achievements and it's definitely a fun game if you like puzzles.
4492	1	a	Nice little relaxing casual game. The series is really fun and well thought-out. The art is amazing and I definitely recommend it if you want a break from shooting stuff all the time.
5333	1	a	Great Space Invader/Galaga 'clone' that adds upgrades and other touches like bosses that really enhance the playability of the old arcade one screen shooter. A lot of fun and recommended to genre and non genre fans alike especially when on sale... dirt cheap fun.
4770	1	a	Really fun and bubbly puzzle game in the same niche as Portal. Storybook estetique and a good portion of black humor, a must for any fans of puzzle games!
4527	1	a	so fun a little hard at first if you like fish get this game
3310	1	a	I'm going to start this out by saying this: I loved this game. It is absolutely adorable. You play as one of two siblings out to collect candy on halloween. Alls not well however, when they discover that the neighborhood has been taken over by evil doings.  Artistically, Costume Quest is great. Interesting graphics with a FFVII-esque transition between the cutsy overworld and the combat scenes. The music fits the game well, but isn't outstanding. The story is silly and fun, and not super serious.  Mechanically, the game is solid. Combat and overworld controls make sense and everything is easy to pick up. Combat is menu based, but not overwhelmingly so. Each costume has different strengths and weaknesses, and different combinations can make for a very different combat experience.  If you're looking for a quick, uninvolved RPG, you could do a lot worse than Costume Quest.  If you liked this review, please have a look at   my other reviews!  
3042	1	a	great game i loved playing it a lot like payday and payday2
3277	1	a	Pretty Decent puzzle game. Some are easy, some are frustrating though not until chapter 2 but most of them are pretty enjoyable. Worth buying if on sale or you enjoy puzzle games. I put in 2 hours before I realized it, great time waster. Music can get annoying but you can shut it off, not much else to say about this one.
44	1	a	I wasn't sure whether or not to recommend this game. In the end, I decided to recommend it. Why? Because even though it was extemely short, it was heaps of fun and quite challenging.  Pros: - Visually pleasing - very nice art which looks like a lot of effort has been put into it. - Unique puzzles. - Pleasant music. - Interesting and fun gameplay.  Cons - Extemely short - felt more like a demo than an actual game. - Overpriced - very expensive for what you get. Get it while it's on sale.  If you like point and click puzzle adventure games, I would recommend that you buy this. However, it is not worth it at full price, so I would say wait for it to go on sale. :)
5478	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
2539	1	a	Fun game. Better with friends for your heist.
1940	1	a	This game is awesome. It's about many 'classes' doing various missions. 'Classes' being: Locksmith (Blue), Pickpocket (Yellow), Hacker (Green), Lookout (Red), Redhead (Orange), Gentleman (Blue-Green), Cleaner (Pink), and Mole (Purple).
4215	1	a	One of the best games ever created. Pretty sure it was crafted by gods, and handed down through history until we developed the technology to use it.   Can't be set to 1080p, but its visuals have aged well and its great for jumping in and out of when you have some spare time.   I can also attest to its appeal among children 8 - 17 years old. Hours and hours of them staring at a screen, not talking, and not fighting. The next best thing to my idea of putting teenagers on islands, away from real human beings until they come of age. Like study camps. Camps where they can concentrate. Haven't really thought of a name for them.
2937	1	a	This game is insanely fun as, especially when playing with friends, as you try to escape Monaco with all the money trophism and without being seen (hopefully).  Overall, Monaco offers a great experience!
2298	1	a	It's tricky, frustrating and so much fun! xD Perfect game to play with your friends!
4860	1	a	really makes you think a great game for the price (if under 20$) took me about 25-30 hr's to clear all the dlc and reg game (which i did in reverse order..... don't ask)
464	1	a	A fun twin stick shooter similar to Geometry wars.
2125	1	a	Fun, but more fun when you have friends to play it with.
839	1	a	A great board game faithfully brought online. Very simple to play, yet enough depth to keep me coming back for more. Games only take 10-15 minutes. The AI isn't too bad, but the real joy lies in playing multiplayer against other humans.
4766	1	a	Let's see...  1. This is a Portal knock-off...  2. ...developed by a former Portal team member...  3. ...with John de Lancie narrating...  4. ...and a level named after a Tenacious D song.  Oh, and it's a great game, too.
5345	1	a	I wasn't expecting much from Titan Attacks, I figured it was just going to be another Space Invaders clone, and there have been so many of those over the years. But I do like PuppyGames' art style, and their games usually have a certain charm, so I decided to give it a try anyway.... and suddenly an hour had gone by without me even noticing. I can't say it's not a Space Invaders clone, because it absolutely and unabashedly is, but it's an extremely good one. Lots of fun.
1859	1	a	Fun in a bun. Classic overhead stealth game, with line of sight and awareness control. Story is full of twists and turns, told elegantly. And the OST is 95% upright piano music. What's not to love?  What badge?
2520	1	a	To call Monaco a stealth game would be like calling a dandelion food. While technically it is, if you are eating a flower you are probably doing it wrong. In the same way, Monaco is more of a cooperitive game then a stealth game. That isn't to say that it's a bad stealth game, in fact it's one of the best that I've ever played. It just that it's so much better with friends. The best parts of the game are when one player saves the rest of the party and completely turn the hiest around. Even playing online is better than playing solo. So if you are looking to spend a weekend with friends, this is the game to play.
2544	1	a	I got this game when its was free and still play it its one of the best sneaking games,Good Job, 10 of 10
4571	1	a	Nice 'Tower' Defeant Game!
5426	1	a	I know what you're thinking: 'Oh it's just another dumb reboot to an old arcade game!' Well, not exactly. While Titan Attacks! shares various similarities with Space Invaders and Galaga, It's more than that. As you progress through the different stages (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn, etc.), You fight a plethora of enemies with different mannerisms whilst building up your funds to upgrade your ship for even more alien-shooting. Pretty addicting if you ask me. Although, there are a few drawbacks. One is that [on keyboard and mouse], Not only does the mouse move your ship, the WASD keys do too. This can make it difficult for players who move their mouse quite a bit when playing games that require it, as just a slight nudge of the mouse will send your ship into a flurry of death and despair.I have lost many a-shield trying to deal with htis problem. It might just be incredibly easy to fix in an options menu that i'm too lazy to check, but as most gamers do, I just went straight to the gameplay. I did see the notice, but didn't expect how highly sensitive the mouse was.  Well, i should stop ranting now. 9/10 Would play again and again. One of my favorite time-killing games to date!
4595	1	a	Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by. They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun 'Super Hexagon' way. Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah. The worst kind of time sink...  Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial. It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way. Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists. There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.  Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good. It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick. It does a phenomenal job of it too. All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off. The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be. One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking 'War Rocket Ajax'.. *cough*.. I mean 'Invincible' :) .. about 40 years too early, :)  Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final 'death scene', each level begins and ends with a 'Galaxy News' transmission. . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced. Right up to the end, the game feels 'fleshed out', there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.  The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes. As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial. The 'orbital slots' are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time. Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.   There are only 22 'single player' levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something. The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of. Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you. I never found much use for the 'sweeper' or the 'webber', they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it. Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better! I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.  One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites. Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves. Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up. So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too. The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies. It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much. I quite like it. It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).   Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games. It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.   I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.
2565	1	a	mentally ill hacker  11/10
4223	1	a	Pretty fun little mini-game game to play when you don't feel like playing 'real' games. The constant Half-Life references are a bit annoying, but it's fun over all.  Wax on wax off.
678	1	a	!!Ticket to Ride!!  Well what is there to say about this game? This game is a digital version of the classic board game with the same name. All that you have to do in this game is to build train tracs by collecting 'cart-cards' of a specific colour to build a train of the tracs. For example, if i want to build a train between Copenhagen and Stockholm and there is 3 squares with a purple colour you need 3 purple cards to build on it.  To win you need the most points in the game, 1 cart=1 point 2 carts=2 points 3 carts=4 points 4 carts=7 points 5 carts=10 points 6 carts=15 points.  But you can also get points by completing routes like Copenhagen to Rome. There's two kinds of routes, short distance (normaly worth 5-10 points) and long distance (worth up to 21 points). In the end you can also get bonus points by either building the longest route, completing the most routes or by doing both.  I've been playing the table version of this game some times and i've found myself very amused by it. Then we were playing it with 4-5 people and it was pretty hard to get to where you wanted without getting blocked by some one else, sometimes the others wanted to block your route just to keep you from completing it and getting those extra points. The same things can happen in the digital version.  The digital version has alot of different game types,  Solo with AI's Local (so you can play with other pc's on you'r network Online (so you can play with your friends) Pass and play (a group can play on the same pc by passing it around)  Note that this just like monopoly can destroy relationships and friendships easy. But if they are broken by a game then mayby it wasn't so good to begin with. And hey now you can't throw the board when you'r â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loosing.... now you can throw you'r expensive PC and since when isn't that a better option?  I started playing this game at a friend and it was so good and fun that I had to buy it so i can play it by myself with bots to train (get it, like train on a track... yea i know my jokes suck..... let's say my jokes started to de-rail! haha i'm so lonley)  The bots in this game is hard to beat in the beginning but you can quickly learn to beat them by starting with one bot and then adding more when you feel ready.  This is a great game to have when you don't have any internet connection avaible. One of the reasons why i bought it was so i would be able to play it while riding the train, taking the buss and feel less lonley since i've got more options than a train.  I've been playing this on my PC for a couple of hours and i find it realy fun and it's real easy to kill time with this game.  I would give this game an 9/10 since i find it easy to learn but still hard to master, fun to play and it's a game that i will be coming back to play alot.  This might not be the best review but i hope you find it helpfull!
891	1	a	This game sucks 
850	0	a	Memoir'44 Is a fantastic board game.    Memoir'44 Online is the digital version fo the board game. Its F2P model however lets it down in a huge way. Having to pay per scenario instead of paying up front for a NICHE genre of video games is just silly.
4224	1	a	I actually employ the meditation mode on occasion.  Has it helped hone my reflexes? Honestly, I'm not sure. However, it can be idle fun and the challenges are varied and difficult enough to keep some interest.  The art-style is interesting, and the music is a nice touch.
4475	0	a	this game isn't all bad but it's just not good enough to recommend it. i know you can hardly complain about casual games being casual but this one is really overdoing it.  you can rotate the board for a change and after you have destroyed all locked fields you have to guide the key stone to the key hole though a maze on the board. that's nice and interesting. for the first five levels. but then it gets old really fast and this game has a total of about 70 levels. there is a timer on each level but it's like 20 minutes or something. at no point there is any kind of pressure or danger of losing. some boards are so poorly designed you get a 'no more moves' message every 30 seconds. or you are stuck for 5 minutes just because the gods of randomly colored blocks wont give you the ones you need to progress. horrific!  rotate &amp; swipe, rotate &amp; swipe, rotate &amp; swipe... pretty much like a mobile game. and there is absolutely no other gameplay element in the game so it gets repetitive, boring and tedious very quickly. i finished the game in just under 8 hours and that's just as much boredom as i can take. i just uninstalled after winning and i will never touch it again.  if you want to play a game like this i recommend '7 Wonders II'. that one is actually very enjoyable to play and well worth spending time and money. but this one here is a stinker.
1558	1	a	Monaco is by far one of the best co-op games I've played.  Due to the game's amazing accomodation to differing playstyles, Monaco can be a stealth game, shooter, or simply a run and gun race against the clock depending on how you play it!  I was extremely excited for this game to come out, and it definitely lived up to the hype: polished controls, amazing soundtrack, accomodating to multiple playstyles (not only with the different classes, but with the tools involved as well), and overall just a barrel of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Monaco, whether you plan on playing alone, with friends, or with complete strangers.  That feeling when you pull off a perfect heist? Nothing compares.
3738	1	a	This game is really fun, and easy to play. The plot is interesting, as well as the different costumes your character can wear. Each costume serves a purpose for - and out of - battle. The dialogue is simple, and the humor is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who'd like a Halloween-based game.
5064	1	a	A fun mix of puzzles and games! Plus, since it is British, you'll learn new words and get rather confused over some answers; but that's what the hint tokens are for!
4976	1	a	It has John deLancie (Q from Star Trek) doing the voices. Do I need to continue?
642	1	a	I am totally addicted to this game, I just can't stop after one game! I used to play against the computer but lately I'm using the online option to play against other players. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, the purpose is to have fun while building routes between cities and trying as many maps as possible, They are all nice and unique. What I dislike is that there are players who are blocking others and don't know how to play for fun; all they're interested is to win no matter what and ruin the mood of others ... a block or report option for such cases would be nice ;) It's a bit expensive with all the extensions but it was on sale when I purchased it so I'm not complaining.
4970	1	a	From the original developers of Portal 1, this game is an excellent spiritual successor. It's not got quite the same character as Portal and the engine struggles a bit with some of the simplist of tasks, but the puzzles are entertaining. For those that are looking from some portal-like fun but are tired of waiting for the mythical third in the series (like all other Valve series), then I recommend playing this game (which is usually on sale in all steam sales)
1400	1	a	how is this in my library?
151	1	a	This game is quite fun, it builds up to a frenzied pace but doesn't leave you feeling brain drain. At the price of $2 you can't go wrong with it unless you hate having fun. I recommend it as both a casual play and as highly competitive at the same time. The better and faster you get at it the more fun it becomes.
3268	1	a	I just started steam and wanted to start building up my Library so I bought alot of cheap games. Forsome reason I decided to download this game, as soon as I started playing this amaing puzzle game I could not stop playing it I was in the ZONE. As soon as i drop my mouse and decided to do something else I notice that I was playing it for 92 minutes non-stop. It is an amazing puzzle game and one of a kind. Must have game!!!
4650	1	a	makes you think, which is something i try to avoid when playing games as my reason for gaming is to escape from that for a few hours... however the way this game does it works, its a REALLY addictive and very well thought out game, not so much into v2 but i love this one!
5228	1	a	This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. It is up there with Braid in terms of quality, but quite different. It's like the Super Mario World of puzzle games with a large, living world that is full of surprises if you explore enough. If you are a puzzle game fan, you should play this game.
3609	1	a	Cute little game! It's not very challenging, but it has a nice story. Nice way to spend a lazy afternoon.
115	1	a	This game is fun to play in short bursts. You have a cube and other cubes come flying at it, you match the colors to keep it from getting too big and exploding.
5061	1	a	Good 'casual' gaming. Just don't expect much depth.  You might not want to play this in one go or play it all the time.  Instead you fire it up when you're bored and don't wanna play something heavy with plotlines and quests and lore. (imagine you worked overtime, the clients were terrible, you finally get home, take a beer from the fridge) You want some puzzle and it delivers and a ton of content too. Also more puzzles and variation compared to PW1.  The game is designed completely basic and was probably a mobile app. 
2249	1	a	Awesome, funny. would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, genre or both :D
2340	1	a	Great Game
4913	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.  It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
2201	1	a	This game is a blast to go through with friends! Seriously, why haven't you bought it yet?
1686	1	a	Great story. Awesome characters and concept. TENNAWTATENN
5152	1	a	Pros: great graphics considering the age; good tutorial; easy to understand even for a beginner; low price Cons: unable to get past the initial music/video each time the game is started which takes a little time; even if I do everything right, my chars still die for no reason that I can see; when placing ladders it is rather difficult to get them placed the direction you want (other items seem to place OK though).  Overall, it's a cute game and worth the small price. It was a little frustrating for me but that's probably my lack of experience speaking.
3476	0	a	Ummm... The game could be alright if you enjoy nothing but quicktime events and colectable hunting. Personally, not worth the money.  Edit: It's an adventure game though. This is what adventure games usually are. I should have also added, the Linux experience is flawless so don't worry about that. Still not my cup of tea though.
2097	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
273	1	a	For those that played Geometry Wars, this game right here I very similar to it! You are a ball shooting other balls, what is there not to like? You can also buy the soundtrack!
4454	1	a	Addicting. Very addicting. Worth playing! :D
257	1	a	A fun little diversion that's well made and somewhat clever. Well, what's so clever about it? Light travels in waves, and there's waves in water, and you seem to be a little ball in a petri dish causing waves in the water while viruses, or whatever they are, reproduce. Oh, and there's some music, and sound travels in waves! And when you slow down time, the music slows down! Oh, how clever.   There's a twinge of sarcasm there, I know that some have a hard time being able to notice that on the internet. Anyway, the game IS a lot of fun, and it is a very fun diversion, as I stated before. For...a little while. I can't see anyone dedicating tons of time to this game because, to put it simply, it gets boring pretty quickly. It's great to have a game to pick up for a few minutes at a time if you just have a few minutes to kill, and this game is perfect for that. However, it's so similar to some other game *cough* Beat Hazard *cough* that do the concept just a little bit better. The things that make this game unique also make it rather samey in the move-around-in-a-specific-area-and-shoot-crap-dead niche, which I happily subscribe to.   Big fat A+ on the gameplay  B+ on the visuals, which are nice, but they could stand to be toned down juuuust a hair so that thing you need to pick up to refill your slow motion gauge isn't completely indiscernable from an enemy spawning in the same exact friggin' place (that's not challenging, just cheap.)   C+ on the soundtrack - now, don't get me wrong, the songs in the game are FRIGGIN' GREAT, but there's exactly 4, maybe 5 of them. The game could stand to use a bit more variety in a soundtrack. I have a hard time believing that the combined length of the tracks included equals up to the 25 minutes they have set for one of the survival achievements.   Overall, 7/10 - would definitely recommend buying, but you won't be putting hours and hours and hours of time into it. Honestly, if it let me use my own music to play with the same game modes, this would probably overtake Beat Hazard for me, of which I've put something like 40 hours into playing. Give us a little bit of customization. I'm begging for a sequel, no, really.
2661	1	a	Neon Thief Simulator 2013
2343	1	a	Another game that I love
2453	1	a	BEST GAME 
4805	1	a	Personally, I find this game boring, but intriguing. The mechanics are very well implemented but they get slightly over-used. I found always use each different 'state' fun but the zones where you used them went on for too long. I would get used to it, love it, then grow tired of it and would rush through the rest making me frustrated and tired. usually missing many of the small jokes and story.   5/10
2119	1	a	Buy it, what are you waiting for?
1310	1	a	This is where real men settle their arguments.
3964	1	a	This games got costumes, quests, monsters, and candy. What more do you need? This is truly a fine game, Double Fine infact.
4258	1	a	Absolutely shameless knock off of Katamari, and not a great attempt at it either. It's extremely low budget, has game breaking bugs, takes only 2 hours to get 100% of the steam achievements and has pretty terrible game design oversights. However I recommend it to anyone desperate to play Katamari and lack any of the consoles it's released on, or anyone who's new to the sub-genre.
3533	1	a	A good casual game, nice graphics, good story. Controls suck though and makes the game somewhat un enjoyable. Get it on a sale. This is when I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation cause the game isn't bad, but those controls makes it not worth playing, but for a few minutes.
1040	1	a	GOTY all years, marvelous gameplay, stylish graphics, great replayability, fantastic sound, insanely creative, an absolute must if you call yourself a hardcore gamer. BUY NOW!!
3239	1	a	Love this game. It has great chain reactions and sometimes really makes you think. I have honestly played this game for hours and it's well worth it for the price. Typically I don't review game. But this one has my recommendation :)
3554	0	a	Just a poor game. It crashes constantly and dosen't have a good story either. I do not recommend this game and it's most certainly not worth the price.
2769	1	a	Great game if your palying alone or with 3 buddies. you can choose to be either sneaky and silent or barge right through the misson not caring if guards see you! And the level creater is really cool too, but hard to get the hang of, and it takes an incredibly long time to create a level because of the way they set it up, but i still recomend this because the level editor is not really part of the game. the story is not really in depth and should not be the reason to buy this game, the way the game plays and how awsomly fun it is to play should be the thing that someone interested in buying this game should pay attention to!
3032	1	a	Hackersaretooover-poweredforyoufriend. 10/10
3696	1	a	Great to play around Halloween. An entertaining halloween action-rpg of sorts. Very fun and halloween-spirited.
5341	1	a	a great Space Invaders remake  + the Puppy Games awesome, polished retro aesthetic +/- the Puppy Games 'â¥â¥â¥â¥...this is hard'  score = 4/5
4865	1	a	8/10
2264	1	a	First of all I must admit that I didnt really like this game when it came free for a whole weekend. Manage to try it but didnt enjoy the game at all. It stayd dead for a while. Then Microsoft decide to give it for free on the xbox, so I was like yeah super awsome a sucky game! So i decided to give it a try, wasnt expeting anything at all except beeing bored playing it.... I was wrong, and happy to admit it. This game is original and a master piece in his kind! the gameplay is so simple but effective and playing multiplayer raise the bar even higher. I mean you can play up to 4 player, each of them beeing a different kind of class like pickpocket, cleaner, locksmith and a scout i think. Put all those togueter and you get an amazing teamplay. I would actualy recommend this game giving it a 7.8/10  The game is not perfect and it is not for everyone, but it is worth the try!
4495	1	a	Virtual Villagers is a fun game when you some time to kill. Basically, you have some shipwrecked people and you have to figure out 16 puzzles and level up 6 skills (techs) to help your villagers prosper. You can set individual villagers to do different tasks like forage, build, heal, research, and breed, The villagers will grow old or can sick so watch out for that. It's a real time game, which means the game continues on when you're not playing.   Be warned, this game does not â¥â¥â¥â¥ around about the real time aspect. Last night I had 13 villagers (mostly females) and I set one male to be a breeder. I woke up to find I had 63 villagers ( 5 scientist adults and everyone else was a child), almost no food and a pile of skeletons. The real time can make losing easy.
264	1	a	Shoot colourful thingies, I like. 8/10
1445	0	a	Mindless, frustratingly boring, buggy controls, dead multiplayer.
3836	1	a	This game has all the quirks and charm of a typical Double Fine game! The combat and RPG elements may not be complex enough for hardcore gamers, but I think the simplicity helps keep the atmosphere light and casual. This game gets a strong recommendation from me!
4254	1	a	Basically Katamari without the ball. You end up becoming a giant, swallowing up skyscrapers and stuff. My brother and I had a fun time trying to beat this one.
4334	1	a	While extremely short, WEotW is hard not to recommend. The gameplay is unique on PC as far as I know, and while a few of the maps suffer from poor design (it's possible to get stuck and lose time trying to get out of some awkward corners), the only real issue I have is technical.   The game lags and stutters at points, such as when you reach a certian size (and can see more of the map) or when you've eaten a certian number of objects. The lag is never enough to keep you from playing (all you do is walk around and eat things), but it is jarring and I have to question whether the minimum specs are nough to run this game. I mean, if I get lag with 8gbs RAM, a 3.5 multi-core CPU, and midrange/getting-old-now GTX 750 NVIDIA card... I'm sure most PCs are more powerful these days, but still, it's an issue to consider.
176	1	a	great casual diversion with an endless mode. nice brain exercise
2019	1	a	Just read the reviews and buy it already! It's amazing!
5056	1	a	A game full of variety puzzles. Of course they just repeat themselves with varying difficulty but it is a great collection of games, nevertheless. If you love puzzles, this is a no-brainer, pick this game up!
3169	1	a	Great game! Got it on sale and kept me intriged.
207	1	a	If you play other games that include using team work with friends that are not the shapest knife in the kitchen (like scott) then this game is a refreshing change as the outcome on this game will only be impacted by you and you only. Thats right! doesnt matter if mid is feeding, or your adc has 4 cs at 10 mim, this game is completely relient on you.
2199	1	a	Do I recommend this game? HELL YES! This game is an amazing game, the levels are well designed, the soundtrack is nice and the gameplay is INCREDIBLE. Singleplayer is fun but Co-op is where this game shines. Up to 4 Player Co-op staging heists and robbing people whilst avoiding cops. HELL YES. Using different characters with different skills. HELL YES. Playing Monaco? HELL FREAKING YES. GET THIS GAME. NOW.
1272	1	a	Serious Review   This game, is basically a BF or CoD version but club penguin added. If your into this type of club penguin shooters, this is for you.  Sadly no one really plays the mutiplayer, and well you can really just do single player.  Then again, you can use this for a time killer or give it to your younger sibling.  Overall, it's a club penguin shooter. Where u shoot the penguins in the water and they die.
1011	1	a	It was supposed to be called 'Smuggle Truck' and have you smuggle Mexicans across the border (or so I've been told), so that fact alone made me buy this.
5432	1	a	Brutally augmented Space Invaders.
2423	1	a	Game has some sweet music and gameplay, can recommend playing it with at least one friend.
3372	1	a	Super linear with the illusion of choice and control. It's like an extremely dumbed-down version of any of the Final Fantasy games. Plays like a game made for kids but designed for grown-ups. But you like this one not for the way the game plays. It's about the story and the atmosphere. (I mean, this is a Double Fine game after all). But it's a very good time, definitely. Don't get me wrong. I love the trick-or-treating atmosphere. The fighting. The odd humor. And the fact that there is no voice-acting, just silence and text (this is really creepy, in a good but unintentionally Lynchian way). Get the expansion/DLC too. It's loads of fun!
4091	1	a	The greatest puzzle is who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ would buy this?
2804	1	a	Let me tell you this game. THIS. GAME. Its super rad. I don't tend to latch on to stealth games or online games that make you follow the story, but Monaco is one that I was able to do just that. Each class is useful with none being better than the other, and the combinations that you can use in this game really makes is a game you can play with anyone! I highley recommend this game and I highly recommend you get other people to play it with you!
4480	1	a	I played this game once then again and again and again then once more.
5519	1	a	This game is so damn hard, my god. Get it on sale.
3481	1	a	A charming halloween themed adventure game. I originally heard about this game through Zac Gorman  (http://zacgorman.com/  /  http://magicalgametime.com/)  and how he has made it a tradition to play the game on halloween. I thought that was a neat idea as well and made it a part of my halloween celebrating. Cute little game, lots to do/collect, good Double Fine humor.
1587	1	a	I think I have a new addiction. This game is pretty damn amazing, in single player OR co-op, and especially addictive if you enjoy trying to completely clear games or compete on the leaderboards. I just need a group of good bros to steal with. Let me know when you buy it!
3350	1	a	A funny light-hearted take on the RPG genre. Very enjoyable.
2262	1	a	Great to play with friends! I fell in love with this game instantly, the controls and visuals were weird at first but I easily adjusted to them. If you're gonna buy this buy copies for your friends too!
4578	1	a	Very Cool Arcade tower defense game, with a seperate storyline based mode as well, Fun 50's Sci-Fi silly story, movies at every level, and cool in game arcade-style 50's Sci-FI graphics. Pretty slick and polished, if not ground breaking.  Need a new arcade game, and like tower defense? Get it, its fun!
131	1	a	so great....simple but makes you think :)
4533	1	a	I love the series of Virtual Villagers, I do so hope they get number 4, 5 and 6 on Steam too soon! &lt;3 This one is, like the others, a real time game with some simulation and strategy over, and it can be challenging, but not so much that you can't relax at the same time. ^_^
3846	1	a	Fun, Cute, and a cheap Quick game that is kinda repetitive, but lots of fun. The story is unique, and the costume and powers are individually unique and clever. It's a game from Double Fine so in the game there a hidden references to other games and the company themselves. I love this game, and as soon as I am able plane to get Costume Quest 2.
4621	1	a	I played the first CM since my 8th, and I still enjoy it! Really cool if you want to discover the limits and possibility's of the technic world!
2111	1	a	Great game, whether you play sinlge or co-op. Very amusing story and characters.
2315	1	a	Brilliant game to play with friends although it causes more arguments than teamwork!
2495	1	a	love the hacker 
5514	1	a	Twisted Space Invider.
1773	1	a	The best stealth-based party game makes its way to Steam! Amazing sound design, online heists with buddies, and a good sized amount of maps and objectives. It is true that the visuals take a bit of time to get used to, but everything looks a certain way for a reason.
3229	1	a	A great puzzle game with easy-to-grasp physics! Even after completing the game 100%, I find myself coming back to it every so often and enjoying it all over again.
3701	0	a	Fun at first but then becomes very repetitive. The game isn't all bad it deffinitly gets points for style and writing. If there was a little more depth and less repetitive this could be a better game. Stopped playing when I realized I was doing the same thing over and over.
5162	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is a fun casual game. If you just want to play something that's not too demanding, then this is a good game to consider. It has a few flaws, like what feels like unfinished AI, but, if you just want to spend some time playing an easy, fun game then this one is a real contender.
731	1	a	Fun game with loads of strategy in multiplayer. What makes this game so great is the fact that you can play 3 to 4 games in the same amount of time it takes to play one on the actual boardgame.
1513	1	a	This is the greatest game of all time, buy it because I told you to. Do you like fun? You'll love this game.  Verdict: BUY
4135	1	a	Obviously, I really like this game. I have logged 80+ hours. It is a fun little puzzle game similar to Bejeweled but with a decent story line to go with it. If you like puzzle games I highly recommend this, especially since it is decently priced. Worth every penny.
2689	1	a	the game is good
2109	1	a	Game is great, lots of replaying. Dern Sure fun game with friends.
870	0	a	Pay for literally every battle. Great but im not paying that .
2631	1	a	It's pretty cool. Might be more fun with friends, but I personally hate dealing with strangers online, so I normally LAN with my closest friends.
2868	1	a	this game combines simple and stunning visuals with a tense, professional atmosphere and gameplay. whether you're grinding through the levels by yourself or frantically robbing a bank with friends, this game is fun and addicting.
5292	1	a	Fun to play. Excited puzzle
2799	1	a	Lets game is different and its great. I have had so much fun with this gem.
674	1	a	Fun game though it is hindered by a ton of bugs and terrible AI.
5216	1	a	I like it,nice,friendly puzzle game.
353	1	a	Best score atack game ever!!! + the music is the best time atack music you will ever here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1313	1	a	A very simple yet very fun game. It will make you want to throw snowballs to other penguins one more time.
3156	1	a	Picked it up for 50 cents on a crafting coupon, it's a fun little physics puzzler.
4655	1	a	I played this game when I was younger and I still love it today.
2216	1	a	Monaco is a great stealth game with a big mystery, as there are always 2 sides of the story, in this situation, they both are criminals. Let's get down to the pros and cons!  Pros * Mysterious and easy to follow story, which you can choose which to believe. +2 Story, +1 player choice * Fun characters, each with their wonderful mechanics. +3 Player Choice * Workshop support, where you can download any maps you want and play them! +1 Entertainment * Great multiplayer, with excellent replay-ability. +1 Multiplayer Cons * A bit glitchy. -1 Entertainment
4494	1	a	Epic game, you get annoyed by the 'no' and 'uh uh' from the characters when you want them to do something and they won't but I already spent a good 50 hours per game in this franchize before I baught this. I've beaten the 4th game (which Steam should add *hint**hint*) and gotten close to beating the other 3.
3338	0	a	Let's see... Costume Quest is one of those games that you may only enjoy if you're 13 yo. or younger, or you just have some serious nostalgia going on... I do hate to not recommend this game, but you can probably tell if its for you by looking at the screenshots. Thats about it.
577	1	a	If you have every played the board game then you will know how fun this game really is. This game is very well done with its style of play. When you win a game it is very satisfying and gives you the sense of a job well done. It is alot of fun to play online with others. You can get some really intense games in. The singleplayer is also challenging with the computer AI. You can choose to play up with 5 people real people or have just the AI play with you. Ether way its a great time. I have really enjoyed this game and I know you will too if you have ever played the board game.
1600	1	a	Monaco is really fun, I like that it has a varity of diffrent classes with different skills but can be really hard at times
3539	0	a	Apparently, people found this game actually humorous? And the battles anything but boring grinds? Gosh, I AM surprised!  Okay, okay, it probably is good for those of you who haven't heard the sort of jokes before, or aren't super interested in battle strategy in your RPG, so instead I'll say this: If you do consider yourself a veteran super-l33t gamer who has invested far too much of their time in comedy, you won't enjoy this one. At all.
2321	1	a	This is probally the dankest â¥â¥â¥â¥ ive played in a year I literally flew from my chair and became god -IGN 10/10
137	1	a	Most action packed adventure ever!                                                      (DON'T BUY THIS GAME! IT'S SO BAD!)
1450	0	a	It is... alright, y'know those old Shockwave games you might have played, back in the day? This isn't Shockwave, but it feels very much like one of them. Except a lot better. That should give you a fair idea.  If you're a kiddo who doesn't remember those olden days, then let's just say it's about on par with a Flash game.    But it's also ridiculously priced, so don't get it.
4311	0	a	This is a weird sort of katamari-damacy-clone. It's kind of cool to see all of the random â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the game, but once you play through it, you don't really want to go back. It's like looking at a painting that is amusing for the first time you see it, but not worth hanging on the wall to stare at or come back to.  Plenty of way better games out there, this one just comes accross as cheap and poorly made.
2259	1	a	Great Indie Game, it's like Payday if it were in the SNES Era :D
1574	1	a	Monaco   ~A Short Review with no spoliers~  I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment I began.  The bright colors contrasted against the dark background, the fun music, and the multiplayer environment made for a terrifically fun experience.  I played this game with another person,and by doing so, I feel that I got the most of the game, and thus I would recommend playing this with two or more people.  Multiple playable characters, each with their own special abilities, are unlocked through a driving story line of criminal behavior -which was executed with the perfect balance of elements. This game was not as serious of a heist game as Payday 2, but it was not what I'd consider a âkiddy gameâ.  When you assemble a team of the right characters for the mission at hand there's no way you can fail - that is unless you are me and my friends. Though you can fail multiple times, the fun never ends, at least it didn't for me. Each play through is different in itsownunique way, even though the layout of the levels is the same.  Changing your characters may help if you fail a few times in a row.  But when you just beat a level, it's not over. You can go back and try to âcompleteâ the level, picking up every coin and every trophy. There's so much to do in this game, and that's why I love it.  I didn't have a single complaint about the game with the catchy music and bright colors. I rate it 5/5, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer heists.
4962	1	a	I would have to give it 2.5 stars out of 5 simply because THERE IS NO QUICKSAVE FEATURE AND IT'S SO ANNOYING D:
4699	1	a	Pretty good first person puzzler, shares some similarties with the Portal games. Puzzle revovlve around dimesnions (light, heavy, slow, upside down) For example throwing a heavy object in light dimension so it smashes through glass when you switch back. Couple of nifty ideas and it trains you pretty well. Has quite a bit of platforming though, so if you hate timed based platforming then it might frustrate you.
607	0	a	This is an absolutely awful implementation of the game.
3123	1	a	AMMMMAAASSSSSSIIIINNNNGGGG game but i wish more people played multiplayer; seems fun but there are never any lobbies.
4449	1	a	really enjoy playing this fun puzzle game :)
3781	1	a	Quite fun, some tactics involved in the fights, however questing- running around looking for stuff - can get a bit tedious after a while, although the system works good... Fun story! ~8 hours to complete
1406	1	a	10/10 MLG Pingo    In all seriousness this is a great game, you can throw fish at other penguins. Plus it requires skillz unlike COD :) 
3810	1	a	Awesome game! Addictive!
5140	1	a	This is a good game if you like dwarf fortress. 8/10
3333	1	a	THIS GAME IS SO CUTE, I WANT TO THROW UP AND KILL MYSELF!
3399	1	a	Did you like Bugs Bunny or Crash Bandicoots? How about Monkey Islands? Costume Quest is like a modern hybrid of the aforementioned on steroids, and you should definitely give it a try. It's adorable, it's got humour, and most importantly, there's that sort of quintessential innocence like it came straight from the heart.
4670	1	a	I really wish there was a maybe. The puzzles are fun, but later on in the game this becomes more like a platformer and I have trouble jumping and hitting buttons in time to do the stunts which is frustrating. This isn't the Portal rival I thought it would be, although the first levels definitely fooled me into thinking it would be!
4933	1	a	 www.com/Quantum  Conundrum for more help
4179	1	a	Best Puzzle Quest game in the series
1088	1	a	Snuggle Truck, life or video game? Once you play this game it WILL become your life. It is an obsession you will be unable to fufill because Snuggle Truck is life and thus unless it is your life you will be unable to fufill the desire that is Snuggle Truck.
2018	1	a	I have no clue what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you are supposed to be doing in this game. I find it rather irritating the view and the controls. Only thing that is good is the coop with your friends lets you be confused togethre.
2061	1	a	Didn't think this game would have guns. Alwell, whats a game without guns thesedays?   - 10/10 would be sad again
733	1	a	very good board game adaptation, and there are quite a few people playing at any time so you can get into a game fairly fast (like in a minute). Overall highly recommended.
4945	1	a	Cute gameâfor a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
290	1	a	Great twin stick shooter. Geometry Wars clone but it's great on its own.
3897	1	a	The game is better than what it looks like at first sight. May get repetitive in the second half.  I liked it.
3357	1	a	4th favourite RPG of all time. I said it before and I'll say it again: 'Originality' is the one word that describes DoubleFine. How many games do you know that are turn based combat RPGs where you change your classes depending on which costume your wearing? Did I mention it's halloween, the dialogue is charmingly funny and the game's currency is sweets?
3758	1	a	I don't fancy myself a guy who calls things 'cute' but this game definitely was. While so simple someone with an IQ of 10 could play, I found myself engrossed. Maybe it was my mind harking back to a simpler time and the premise of kids just simply trick R' treating.   The battles were very simple, they had some interactivity but not much. They were the standard JRPG style battles we all know  and...love/hate .   There were a good selection of costumes, all fun and simple. My favorite had to be the ninja...for obvious reasons. Not to mention the decent selection of power up cards that helped you along the way.  If you enjoy simple fun and miss the imagination of your childhood then this could be the game for you.
4809	1	a	This is quite a good fun Portal imitator which has its own idea on how to make physics puzzles more interesting.  The idea being you transfer between dimensions with different properties to solve puzzles. However I have one big gripe with this and that is the momentum within the game.   Sometimes, when it suits, momentum is conserved, and other times it really, REALLY, isnt. You will remain still on moving objects and then fall to your doom. You can be blocked by certain floors, while objects sail through, etc. etc...  This game is by no means perfect, making it very much only an imitator of Portal and not a competitor. I would recommend it for a visit, but only get it if it is on sale.
2983	1	a	Payday in 2d pixel version. 10/10
3514	1	a	Fun little budget title with lots of charm, but its nowhere near Psychonauts. Plays like a Paper Mario game with extremely simple rpg mechanics and timed button presses. It does get repetitive after a while but its not too long. Definitely worth $5 or so.
2506	1	a	i realy like this game
3089	1	a	What makes this game is the ability to play with friends. Challenging enough to stay engaged, easy enough to be fun.
5283	1	a	Cute game. Challenges await, and the puzzles truly are puzzling.
3345	1	a	A fun, accessible, bite sized 'RPG' with a creative concept and a beautiful artstyle. I would say don't play for the gameplay, it's basically a 'Fisher-Price: Babies first turn based combat system'. There's actually more strategy in trying to not win a battle, as the game makes it extremely easy for you. Instead, play the game for it's hilariously written story and enjoyable feel. A great way to blow off some steam.
1118	0	a	Wow.... Just wow... *shudder*
2595	1	a	This is Honestly A Good RPG game and has 
4844	1	a	Not as good as Portal (this game was designed by a former Portal creator by the way), but still a fun and lenghty game for your 15 bucks. My big complaint about it is the frustrating platform-jumping section, it doesn't work well in the first person perspective and the platform are too small and rely too much on unpredictable physics.
1007	1	a	'Cause Brony mode :D
2491	1	a	An awesome co-op game that could run on a toaster, and its $1.49 right now. Buy it!
742	1	a	Extremelly fun and addictive, would recomend to all those into board games. The online option sometimes has a few issues but to fix those it only takes a quick game restart.
3041	1	a	10000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
2023	1	a	one of the most fun co-op games ive played. 10/10
3231	1	a	It's Cut-The-Rope. Adding a few physics based differences here and there, regardless. download and play if you like that style of gameplay, it'd suit perfectly to you.
42	1	a	And incredibly adorable point and click game with a wonderful aesthetic and puzzles ranging from simple to complex.
5513	1	a	A very good remake of the classic Space Invaders game. Starts out a little slow and ends up being perhaps too hard. Great game to spend a few hours playing.
4631	0	a	it was in a german bundle. enough said. kapout
2824	1	a	IT*S CRIMETIME!
1784	1	a	Strongly recommend! Great game, if you love Stealthing stuff or going full out, it's mostly Stealthy though, great game to play with other friends ! get it while its on sale! I'll play with who ever has it &lt;3
3273	1	a	Great physics puzzles with a soothing environment. Honestly, I was easily addicted to the gameplay, but the music and the graphical presentation really sucked me in.  I am only writing this...because I want the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ticket...but really...it is a great game 
3892	1	a	What a cute little game! My friend suggested that I try this game and it took me forever to find time to do so. There are just so many games to play! So, I finally tried it last night and it's actually starting to get a little addicting... Better stop while I'm ahead and get back to my schoolwork.. Fun, even for guys! ;)
2359	1	a	Normally i don't like top-down games, and games that involve an enemy sight radius, but Monaco puts together stealth aspects and multiple mechnics of this interesting game to put together a great crime/stealth game. Working together to collectively plan out and co-ordinate a heist is not easy, and if you're not a fan of Payday's FPS or messy style of heist, this game offers complete opposite, where getting detected is not recommended and getting through the entire level undetected is possible. Especially with friends you know and through voice chat, co-ordinating you're movements together and having loads of fun. Just a awesome co-op experience overall
3064	1	a	I like the game but for me it sadly won't work properly... I tried every fix but nothing worked so far and the game freezes within 5-15 minutes after I started it...
4134	1	a	This Puzzle Adventure game can get very addictive; go on quests around the world trying to defeat the big boss and levelling up your hero (different classes available) with awesome gear and spells/skills. Combat is turn-based and makes use of a Bejeweled-like grid, through which you must strategically collect mana points (to cast your spells) and punish your enemy without taking too much damage yourself. Overall, quite entertaining. ****
2979	1	a	10/10
2532	1	a	I tend towards knocking everybody out before stealing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the levels. Cleaner too good. I really need to finish this game.
2723	1	a	To be quite honest I bought this game only because the trailer was made in such a great way and because it was on sale but it turned out to be a really good choice. It's an interesting take on stealth genre and it's a fun multiplayer experience with all the different classes. The single player is also worth checking out but is nowhere as fun as the online matches.
3950	1	a	Costume Quest is a child's fantasy turned into a real game. You follow the protagonists as they have to fight a menacing threat on Halloween and their costumes will help them. I will give a short explanation concerning several aspects of the game.  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid, though it can get repetitive after a while. Each costume brings with it a certain power or ability that can be used to get past certain obstacles (Such as entering a location, passing an object and more). This means that every new costume you unlock will be used, one way or the other, to acquire new adventures, enemies, candy and secrets.  The combat is turn based, but it works. The idea behind it is simple. You have to press the attack button (E for keyboard) and then time the same button again at the right moment (A small bar appears) to gain an effective attack. After you have attacked, the enemies will attack your group. Defense works the same. The enemy goes into slow-motion, you get a chance to press the right button to defend yourself. Succeed and you get less damage, fail and you get more damage. On the third turn of the battle you unlock your costume's special abilities. And last, but not least, you can augment your costumes to enhance your performance in battle or cause status effects to your enemies by battle stamps, which you can purchase. Candy is the currency in the game.  Story: The story is simple, but fun. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, it's pretty much a child's fantasy turned into a game. You have to fight monsters, your Halloween costumes give you super powers and you get to save the world. There's not really much to tell in this part.  Sound: Same as with the story, the music is simple, but it works. It's not the type of soundtrack that starts to get annoying after a while and it does give you the proper atmosphere for the game.  Style: The game has a very colourful appearance and you'll see this in-game as well. From the small houses in the comfy neighbourhood to the big, shiny, blasting super costumes, everything just screams fantasy.   Total: If you're looking for a fun game and you don't mind a bit of repetitive combat, a simple story with a rich fantasy style attached and you can miss a few bucks/ euros, then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're looking for a game with engaging gameplay, a rich story, a good challenge, this game won't be for you.  Personal: I recommend it, I liked it, finally got around to finish it shortly before writing this review. A thumbs up from me.
4052	0	a	It doesn't actually work. Don't buy.
3193	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I had to buy this for a good steam level. 9/10 would say never ever purchase.
1148	1	a	10/10 would bang (into the AI, because they help each other to win just to spite my obviously superior skills.).  Also made me fail my A levels.
3572	0	a	1 good game doesnt make up for all of your transgressions Tim Schaefer.   Dont give this developer any more money for the love of god. Go look up DF-Spacebase 9 and Broken Age and see how he's been abuaing the fanbase.
3575	1	a	I am a huge fan of Double Fine Productions. This game sure as hell delivers halloween goodness in a small but impactful package.
1237	1	a	I love this game. I live streamed this on twitch and got a few more people to buy it! very good since it was made in 2008. Keep up the good work!   10/10
1259	1	a	What else can you say about this ground breaking game better then any other shooter that ive played even check my hours. Truley the Qauke smash experience  2 good worth the pruchase
714	1	a	Fun and relaxing game with just enough strategy to make playing another human a challenge, especially when they actively block routes they perceive you are working towards.
4695	1	a	The voice of john de lancie never gets old, though the story did lack a certain depth. Puzzles were just difficult enough to make me stop and think, but no harder. Often they relied on twich skills as much as thought, and a few times I knew the real answer and brute forced something silly that was easier.   I give it a B.
2370	1	a	I have purchased this game 3 times now - once on the Xbox, and twice on Steam (I bought a copy for a friend). All in all, I've put many hours into this game and loved every minute of it. There are very few multiplayer experiences as unique, challenging, addictive, and flat-out fun as Monaco. It's simply a wonderful game that will test the limits of your creativity and teamwork.
4126	0	a	CPU blatantly sets up multiple combos, reducing much of the game to luck.  Not worth $10 at all.
3131	1	a	  So a hobo and a monkey walk into a bush...
857	0	a	1.5 out of 6 stars.  In short, sorry to say this but I don't reccomend it. To sum it up:  1) The outcome of the battle tends to depend far too much on luck with dice rather than tactics, using terrain etc. The game tends at times to eb so random as to seem a glorified game of craps with toy soldiers in the background.  2) Units are generic, you get almost no ww2 'chrome' in this game. Maries and Japanese infantry are the only exceptions that stand out. 3) The business model is costly and player-unfriendly. Its not so much a F2P game, It feels more like a free extended demo.  IN DETAIL:  I played this with a friend - we are both old time wargamers (Advanced Third Reich, Squad Leader, Steel Panthers). We came to this expecting a beer&amp;pretzels sort of 'Baby's first Squad Leader' game. I don't mean it in a derogatory manner - in my opinion there is nothing wrong in making a simple or fast-play game on a popular topic, in this case tactical WW2 combat.  Memoir 44 failed to deliver though. Yes, it is simple and fast. However it also lacks historical 'chrome' and all the unit types feel far too generic (german tanks in Normandy have same stats as allied tanks etc).  The worst thing about it is that it is VERY random in combat outcomes. 9 out of 10 games both me and my friend walked away with the mutual conclusion that it was luck that was the decisive factor. In this game, your decisions, combat errors or tactical mistakes feel to have very little impact on the outcome - luck means much more.   We've had situations when infantry charged madly into the open field and shot to pieces an opposing infantry squad (same stats) that was defending a bunker. And no, this was not a point-blank assault on the bunker, we were shooting from many hexes away. I'm ok with such situations happening 'once in a blue moon', but in memoir 44 this happens all the time. Much more so than in most ww2 combat games we've seen - here everything depends on how the dice rolls - terrain and equipment don't seem to matter all that much. For me this is an absolute joykill.   Let's get one last thing straight - calling this F2P is somewhat an exaggeration. The free part is more of an extended demo - you have a limited amount of gold that allows you to play the game a limited amount of times except for several small free scenarios. After you run out of gold, you will need to pay money for each scenario you play - multiplayer, single player, doesn't matter each time you will have to pay. This does become a probem as each scenario is small and these play fast. IMHO this is not a fun business model for me as a player.
1768	1	a	Strongly recommend! Great game, if you love Stealthing stuff or going full out, it's mostly Stealthy though, great game to play with other friends ! get it while its on sale! I'll play with who ever has it &lt;3
564	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun, easy-to-learn, fast-playing board game where players compete for points, which they primarily earn by connecting cities via railroad. The game is about equal parts luck and skill. I had not previously played the board game, but I have played a very similar game, which was probably its pirmary inspiration: Empire Builder. The game is much simpler than Empire Builder and its variants, and the maps are smaller, so games tend to finish a lot faster.
1563	1	a	This is a fun stealth game. It can be challenging sometimes but with one or more friends you should be able to get through it fairly easily, I'd reccomend this to anyone who loves co-op stealth games or just stealth games in general but it's way more fun with a few friends.
2505	1	a	Very fun game, even on public, it does give a lot of fun. Greatest indie game i played the last month
5248	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a cute sequel which is also more open. The puzzles range from easy to 'i have no clue'. Having never finished the first game I don't know if the puzzles are actually harder, or more clever,... or easier. Toki Tori isn't a fast chick, he's quite slow actually, which also influences the gameplay. If only he walked a little bit faster. The game is so slow and uneventful that I had to play it in sessions of 10-30 minutes. After 2-3 hours of total playtime I had no more interest in finishing it. I doubt I will ever finish it in the first place. You might enjoy it however so if you loved the first one you'll love this one, too. I'm sure of it.  [Rating: 72/100]
12	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a nice little platformer with puzzle elements; the levels are short enough to play on coffee breaks, and there's a nice amount of variation in backgrounds, game elements, and throwbacks to classic games like Space Invaders. It runs on a 2D physics engine meaning there's a lot of things bouncing and swinging off of each other; this gets especially interesting in the bonus levels that can turn sideways and upside down. Once you've completed each level, you can try to do it again finding a hidden object and without dying, to get extra rewards (well, achievements).  The downside is that there's only one song in the game, which may get repetitive after awhile. There's no story to speak of, and not a lot of replay value. Still, the game is well worth a shot.
468	1	a	This game is pretty addicting
2122	1	a	Nice &amp; easy to play :)
4742	1	a	So pretty much, if you loved portal, you're going to love this game. The puzzles are very similar to the style of portal's, and the lead dev also was part of the first portal (surprise surprise). You use 4 different dimensions, which you can change at will, to solve puzzles. Fluffy,    Heavy       Slow Mo    and    Reverse Gravity   . They aren't all unlocked from the start, but you slowly unlock each one as you progress through the story.   PLUS, ITS NARRORATED BY JOHN DE LANCIE! JOHN â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LANCIE!  How much better does it get?
3233	1	a	Some will think it's not worth the cost, but I think you have to play it to judge it. 8/10
1879	1	a	you can be the mole
2418	1	a	Fun multiplayer stealth.
922	1	a	this is a super cute game and concept, i quite like this. similar to bejeweled, but not the same, with a cute little story and elements to factor in!  Definitely more catered towards people who like playing Bejeweled, or doing the same thing over and over throughout a game, I liked this game a lot. Fight enemies, with your little sprite friends, fire, water, earth, air, and use their strengths/weaknesses to your advantage. The art in this game is beautiful, and the story as well.
3013	1	a	What's fun: retro-graphics, co-operative multiplayer and varied level designs and goals. It's a challenge and you'll probably spend some time learning how to be any good at it - if you can find anyone else patient enough to play with you, that is. Entertaining soundtrack and plenty of roles to choose from - the only things to lose are what you steal from everyone else.
5461	1	a	THIS GAME IS EXTREME!!!  YOU DONT EVEN KNOW HOW EXTREME IT IS!!?  ITS SO EXTREME, IT MAKES TEA FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER WHILE IT FIGHTS A SHARK!!  IT THEN THROWS THE TEA INTO AN ALIENS FACE, THEN â¥â¥â¥â¥S YOUR GRANDMOTHER!!!!  EXTREME!!!!!!
38	1	a	I love this game! I had a lot of fun playing this game! I totally recommend!
3332	1	a	Costume Quest is a great fun game! With a feel much like Psychonauts in the ilumination and backgrounds, I could really tell it was a Double Fine game. The only one missing in this game is voice acting on the characters that would make much more epic, besides that I loved it!! I love it has a continuation on the main story in the same game. A must have!
3113	1	a	Great coop play! Good range of classes to suit various play styles, allowing you to specialise in what you want to do. Allows you to create highly skilled teams with people playing what theyre good at.
2445	1	a	One hell of a fun game that can turn into a chaotic disaster if done without teamplay!  exactly what i was looking for :)
3090	1	a	This game is one of the best and most challenging co op games out there, guaranteed arguments, screaming and noob calling. Love how the different characters synergize better with some characters and not with others. Great fun with some strategy and skill required.
3355	1	a	Simple yet addictive game!!
739	1	a	If you are a fan of the board game Ticket to Ride but are looking for a pick-up-and-play version, this is a great game. The mechanics are simple but require strategic thinking and games generally last less than 30 mins. As a bonus, you can play online or vs the AI in case you're looking to learn the ropes. Recommended.
2067	1	a	The Graqphic are so good, the gameplay is better and the local co-op is teh best. the only thing that is not so good is the Storie . So buy it and the worst thing is that the keybord is from france. that is not okay but buy it now
5494	1	a	Perfect time killer! I can keep coming back to this game again and again. There's not much to tell... it's a space invader's remake... but it adds a lot of features like upgrading your tank and boss fights.
1914	1	a	Great graphics, great music, a great experience. Some levels can be frustrating if you're a perfectionist like myself, but what's a game without a little frustration, amirite? Would replay new levels 10/10.
5357	1	a	Space Invaders with nicer graphics 9.99Â£  10/10
3616	1	a	For once, I'm not going to talk about hats. Although this game does have them. Lots of them. God I love hats. Uh. Anyway. This game...it's the most fun I've had with an RPG in a loooooong time. I feel like some may argue that it lacks depth, but that's kind of why I like it so much. It's got this air of simplicity, but still maintains a sense of style. Of course a weakness of the simplicity is that battles get slightly repetitive, though they are short and not abundant to the point of frustration. Overall, it was a great experience and I loved it.  9/10
2928	1	a	One hell of a fun game that can turn into a chaotic disaster if done without teamplay!  exactly what i was looking for :)
5065	1	a	Coming up to 40 hours and just completed half the puzzles. A great little casual game to play when you want something a little less zombiekilly and peoplestabby. Turn off the in-game music and put some relaxing yiruma on (or some cannibal corpse, whatever floats you metaphorical music boat).   As a sequel to the first puzzler world (hence the 2 at the end), I think it adds to the original premise of 'a ship load of puzzles' and expands on it adding new games and tweaking existing ones. Whilst some of the games have been tweaked to be 'easier' to play, personally some of them were a little annoying, such as having to drag around link-a-pix as it zooms in really close. Would really appreciate it if they had a zoom function on it to put it to how it was in the first puzzler world. Of course this allows for bigger puzzles (such as the ones featured in the master mode.  Also implemented is the tokenator, or the spinnywheeltokengame which whilst it appealed to the 'ooh spinny thing' side of me, the token animations take about twice as long as the original puzzler world, which were just a little too long for my liking in the first one. No skipping this either so, everytime you beat a puzzle, you have to spin the wheel, wait for it to stop, watch the token bounce around for a bit and then redeem and then see all the tokens pour out like a game of coin solitaire. Whilst this is flashy, and probably what most of there budget went onto, slows everything down especially if you're going through puzzles fairly fast (some of them can be done in 10-15 seconds, such as the silhouette (I don't quite understand that game either?)). One thing that is amazing and probably makes this all okay is that you can spin the wheel backwards! Yes people, backwards compatibility! (Insert new-gen console jokes here).  Some features they haven't included though such as screen resolution, it looks terrible even on my 1080p screen so windowed is the only way to go if you are a low-resophobe. I have puzzled on it full screen and it's not too distracting but it looks much nicer windowed. Also, whilst the in-game trophy system are a great incentive to actually clear all the puzzles, something the first one lacked as I stopped playing after about 200 (will return when I beat this though... probably), I feel a little let down with the steam achievements. Exactly the same as the first in requirement, I don't see why they couldn't have just linked the trophies with the steam achievements... This would've also removed the fact that there's no point in beating more then 10 of each puzzle in the original.  I got this in a bundle (with the original) and probably paid about 20p for it. For 40 hours and only halfway complete (my GCSE maths tell me that it would therefore take about 80 hours, without taking the exponetionally rising difficulty of levels in further stages and brie, tea and wee breaks (I'm so british). Adding all that in could be around 100 hours). 20p has never seen so much mileage. Even at a fiver, you'll be stuck to find a game that will last you a good 80 hours! Despite some flaws, this simple game gives you a lot for a little, you'd be mildly braindead to not see the value in that!
3228	1	a	A very fun physics based puzzle game. You simply break a few chains, setting a series of events in motion, and using gravity and inertia to get the marbles to their color coded destinations.
3674	1	a	A Fun game for when Halloween rolls around, a unique premise for an rpg to be sure and it is full of funny and cute moments. It comes with the christmas dlc free 'grubbins on ice'. If you are too old to trick or treat this is a nice game to play while eating a big bag of discount candy on halloween and again during christmas with the dlc.
4540	1	a	Now this is a casual game. You can play it for 5 minutes, not even, and then shut it off to come back hours later to find them only a few 'years' older or you can leave it for a day and it's the same thing really. I'm on the second generation and I still haven't purchased all upgrades. O_o
627	1	a	CHOO CHOO IM GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL OH NO I DREW THE WRONG CARDS ITS ALL OVER
1804	1	a	What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine.
600	1	a	look i just came to build some trains but everybody is some kind of â¥â¥â¥.
654	1	a	Simple game, play with friends, have fun.
4618	0	a	it was boring
3049	1	a	Someone bought this for me during a sale and I have to say that I didn't expect to enjoy it. But I did. The game itself is great; I love the art style and the way that the whole thing feels. But the thing that made it for me is the soundtrack. This Ragtime-French-Criminal style of music fits so well with every level and I adored every note of it. Fantastic.
4753	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a fantastic puzzle game with equally fantastic writing and humor. If you enjoy the Portal series or other similar puzzle games, I would strongly encourage you to give this game a shot.
3266	1	a	This is a great little puzzle game and it's cheap too! Definitely pick it up if you're into puzzle games.
341	1	a	Waves is a unique, fun shooter with great visuals and graphic style, and some good music. Definitely a game worth buying if you enjoy top-down shooters.
5272	1	a	I... I... I... like bird now.... This game... makes me... braindead... Way... too pretty.... i can't..... Handle.... prettyness... and this... happyness... Your bird.. can make... music.... soo.... happy... its a platform.... game... i... i... must.... play... can't... review..  Brain..washed...game... play... at.. your own..... risk.... They.... made.. me like.... it...   6/10.....
4050	1	a	An extremely interesting game. I definitely recommend. Too bad the planned sequel was scrapped.
5391	1	a	Space Invaders, but better. Now, before you jump out of your chair and yell 'BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!', hear me out.  Titan Attacks! is a wonderful looking indie title. The story is rather simple and there's absolutely no way to truly spoil it. Aliens have attacked Earth and destroyed every single weapon on our planet, save for one tank - the one you, as the player shall control. Your task is to drive the aliens from Earth all the way to their home planet (technically a moon) and deal with them once and for all!  To make this mission (slightly) easier, you are given many purchasable upgrades in-between fights. Use the cash you earn to buy extra weapons for your tank, make your bullets do more damage or get a handful of borderline 'I WIN' button nukes.  The game is fast-paced and fun. It certainly isn't long, but it has quite a bit of replay value. Oh, it's cheap as well! I'd suggest getting it the next time you're looking for a new game to play - trust me, it's totally worth it.
1743	1	a	A really original take on a video game: case da joint, sneak past the guards, h4xx0r the alarms, and get away with the loot. The variety in obstacles and powers to overcome them is good, though I think that some characters seem underpowered compared to their fellows. I like that it's designed with single and multi-player in mind, but think that the single-player is a bit too frustrating. It really ought to let you swap out characters during the level if you're playing by yourself. As it is, you only get to use a new guy if your current one dies. I've yet to actually suicide in order to do this, but close. There are definitely spots where it gets tough in the later levels, and sneaking by solo is all but impossible. If you want to grab everything, you may wind up brute-forcing an unpleasant amount of stuff. Haven't tried out the multiplayer to date.
610	1	a	Wonderful game. Love the ability to play online with cross-platform (Android, iOS) opponents. Fun game that is not too stressful either, The expansion packs add nice twists and extend the game with different rules, more locations, etc.
883	0	a	Third persion looking game like chess it's kinda borring for me....  player told me that's tactic game...
3555	0	a	Does not work at all on mac, DF is making it hard for me to love them.
3939	1	a	Recommended because it's one of the funniest games ever. Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst battle systems ever. Although you can change costumes (effectively classes) outside of battle, once one starts you're stuck with what you went in wearing. And that's where the problem begins. Each class only has one attack and a timed special ability, none of which are particularly interesting. Worse, because there are only two costumes in the game with healing abilities, every battle had to be designed around the possibility that the player would be totally unable to heal. The end result is that every battle is exactly the same thing whether you're fighting a boss or a basic encounter. They tried to add a bit of variation with equippable Battle Stamps. Unfortunately, you're limited to one per character, can't change in battle, and some of them are objectively better than others. They don't solve the problem.   If you're willing to put up with the awful battles for fantastic writing and some unique scenarios, it's worth the sale price of $5. I'd struggle to recommend it at much higher of a price, unfortunately, because this is a game that hits its peak early. It's a fantastic first 90 minutes, a pretty good second 90 minutes, and a third that I didn't finish because it had become primarily battles rather than laughs.   Minor note: This game has terrible mouse acceleration that can't be turned off. It doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it makes menu navigation annoying.
4855	1	a	Some peoples say: if you like Portal then you like this game. Not really. First and most important - different puzzle 'complete mechanism'. What i mean: in Portal (at least in Portal 2) you need figure, how this puzzle must be solved (main time) and then solve puzzle for a minute; in QC you figure how this puzzle must be solved for a minute and then must do some keyboards ninja tricks (quite frequently difficult and annoying). So, you often facing with a situation, when you straight know how puzzle must be solved, but can't done it, because not so fast and not in the order press keys. And you must repeat, repeat, repeat. Plus poor level environment: just sofas, tables and cabinets with books in ALL levels. If you can deal with above, you can get fun, because this still decent game and anyway it worth a try. Also recommend 'Flip a Switch' song from QC Soundtrack.
3626	1	a	Pretty fun game. Worth getting
1500	1	a	I haven't finished playing it yet, but it's absolutely a fine single-player stealth game with lots of replayability that doesn't give any special advantages to one character like all those other co-op games do. Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold. Also the sound and visual design are pitch perfect as well.
1532	1	a	Great game for when you want to 'stealth' it up with your fellow idio-, I mean friends.
233	1	a	you spin my ball right round, right round.
2808	1	a	Amazing game! Really fun to play, especially in multiplayer. Each character is unique.
311	1	a	Hell Yes!! Ive been looking for something like this for a while.
583	1	a	Never tired of this game: always fun
5335	1	a	This game is really great   -Good old puppy games styled ost and 8-bit visuals -Galaxian style non-stop action -You can upgrade your vehicle  -leaderboards  Overall its a great time killer, but on the other side of the coin, if you want to unlock all achievements it's sometimes bugs and dont recognise that you completed all stages.
3858	1	a	Great game to play during Halloween.

4700	1	a	This game is an interesting concept for a puzzle game. You are a kid going to his uncle's (who is a  slightly  narcisist scientist) when something happens causing a lock-down on the house. Your uncle has a mild loss of short term memory, and can't figure out where he is so he asks you to go restore power to remove the lock-down. In the process you get access to the IDS device that he was working on that allows you to shift between dimensions (More on that soon).  The story isn't complicated, but it gets the job done and gets you going where you need to be. The dialogue along the way is cheesy, but in a good way (Though if you are not a fan of cheesy humor, I would suggest muting the voices).  The gameplay itself is quite interesting. You gradually unlock 4 (well, 5 if you count the base dimension) dimensions that allow you to modify physics. These are Fluffy (Or, light weight), Heavy (Heavy weight), Slow down (Everything moves at a near crawl, even lasers), and Reverse Gravity. You, personally never are altered (The idea is despite the fact you are going through the rifts, you personally remain physical to your dimension). Now, these mechanics lead to some interesting relationships between objects: A steel Safe becomes able to be carried while in fluffy, You can toss a table in fluffy then quickly change to Slow and hop onto the platform (That normally would be going fast) as a platform across a gap. A cardboard box can be used as a heavy weight using Heavy. Or with Reverse you can have something utilize the bottom of a conveyor belt to be carried along (or quickly switch to keep it floating). It's not as though you just unlock them all as you go along: Each room has certain dimensions availble (though they can be changed via what batteries you find in the puzzle), so they give you a general direction on how to solve it, and leave it to you to figure out how to use your tools to reach the exit.  It is worth noting this concept shines in one level in particular: You choose one and only one of the 4 and have to solve the room from there, and based on which one you start with changes the entire solution.  That said, the puzzle aspect partially comes from how well you can execute it as well (You can only 'Table Surf' if you are good enough, after all) so if you are looking for a pure puzzle game, you aren't getting that. That does not make this a fun title though.  There are also a lot of neat little features, such as how paintings and such change based on the dimension (Example is a painting of a grandmother where in fluffy her hair is insane, where in slow there is a grim reaper standing behind her). Another is that during death or loading screens you get some hilarious dialogue (Things you will never experience because you died #93487: The Zombie Apocalypse (Though this may be for the best)). There are also little knick-knacks in each level that you can hunt for, given a neat sense of exploration, even if all it does is add little dolls in the main lobby.   That all said, there are a few issues. One annoying one is the give-away hints. Your uncle will give you a hint on how to beat the chamber after a while of being in. It's a neat idea, help stumped players get through, but often times he says it after what seems 1 failed attempt (not counting deaths), which means if you don't get a puzzle right first try (whether or not you get the solution) he's gonna chime in and basically become Navi (There is one puzzle where you clearly have to go up, and he constantly goes 'You need to get higher.') If the hints were so dead give-away (Almost shouting 'HERE IS THE SOLUTION') or he didn't just tell you within moments of entering the room this wouldn't be an issue, but together it can be a bit annoying.  Another is some questionable hit detection. Numerous times I've been standing on a ledge where suddenly I just get booted off, or I hit a ceiling that still appears numerous feet away. It can cause some annoying and at times frustrating deaths.  The game itself is also rather short, unfortunately. Though it could be positive because that also means it doesn't over stay it's welcome.    On a side note I have seen this game compared to Portal. While it has a Portal feel to it, it's not going to quite get rid of that itch, though it will help satisfy it.   Overall, a really fun puzzle game and definitely worth getting if you are looking for an enjoyable game.
3648	1	a	Game is fun. Best part is humour and worst is repetitiveness. It plays very quick, puzzles are easy, boss fights are OK until you do QTE right(beat all of them+expansion at first try). Achievements are done almost right - beat game 100% you get =100% -1. No need for second play-through, but you have to fire game during Christmas period :( Overall I recommend it
3423	1	a	Clever and tons of fun!
2649	1	a	This game is so fun once you start you cant stop playing as it gets more and more difficult, but you unlock some characters who can do many things well.
907	1	a	Check this out. It is totally cool once you get over the toy soldier look. Easier to set up through Steam, if you've got it.
379	1	a	One of the best Twin Stick Shooters out there you can WASTE HOURS on this thing trying to get best your score.
3862	1	a	A relatively short and simple game for an RPG, but has a hint of Earthbound's charm to it.
2440	1	a	Awesome game. I don't much care for trying to aim with my trackpad, but maybe next time I will hook up my 360 controller to do this game
2152	1	a	A great game! The playing style changes based on how many people are playing and who's playing as which character, and can range from expert stealth to charging in guns blazing. I love the in-game art style, but the pixel-ish dialogue segments before each event where a bit odd; but then again it fits with the menu very well. Music is FANTASTIC! I love how it changes as the mood of your gameplay becomes intense, relaxed, or frantic.  It is a very difficult game, and the difficulty will change for how many people are playing (depending on the people, it can either get easier or harder with more friends). I can recommend this to almost everyone I know; if you like a game for it's story, gameplay, art style, dialogue, you name it! This is a great game for everyone to enjoy.
143	1	a	A fun puzzle game. Worth playing if you want something challenging.
3419	0	a	It's a children's game. I got bored with it very quickly, despite the art style, background music and animations (which are all done well). Combat is turn-based, and consists of attacking and defending. It's a very very simple turn-based RPG. You have quests, you have an item slot and you can level-up but it's all so very shallow. Would not recommend for anyone over the age of 15.
5285	1	a	Remember those animal things in Super Metroid that taught you how to shinespark? Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.  Unlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these 'powers' from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the 'right time' is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me.   Toki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.
4121	0	a	As a game PuzzleQuest: Challenge of the Warlords falls into the category of 'fun enough' gameplay. There's enough pleasant reward based feedback loops to keep a dude interested. But the story, the dialogue and the art direction are all so bland, so generic, so throw away that I can't /look/ or /read/ anything without wanting to smash my head into the wall. There is not /one/ thing here that hasn't been stolen, cribbed, cannibalized and copy/pasted with no real original input from the developers. I felt like I was playing a simulation of like... a world created by taking ever description of a fantasy realm by Salvatore, Brooks, and Anthony and blended together into the most homogenized word soup before being doled out to the artists and writers with a stern 'Do this' issued with each spoonful. Puzzle games are ubiquitous enough that you can find one just as fun as this deal without having to read the worst that nerds have to offer.
4989	1	a	John De Lancie does a fantastic job narrating this game.  Don't let the cute graphics fool you, the puzzles in this puzzle-platformer range from simple to almost fiendish, and are quite satisfying for an adult to solve.
139	1	a	Challenging game and mind numbing, but it is a great and addicting game. I hate it when you place the block in the wrong place!
2003	1	a	Im not sure what im doing but I like it
2360	1	a	I rarely complain about graphics but it should be stated that the first 30mins of this game will be used to figure out which smudge is your character. It is best to learn that fast becase as the game goes on it quickly can become crazy with all that might be going on.  Monaco is a stealth based game first, coop second. This means while thugging it with a heavy hitting team will breed success early on, it can quickly fall apart on higher difficulties if the team doesn't know what they are doing, and with the games drop in style play you'll often run into the latter unless you host private games with friends.  The Online at the time I played was an utter mess with people trying to FREEDOM SPOON through everything and quitting when it didn't work. The Mole however is still a top tier character for higher difficulties its just it often ends up in the hands of the unskilled player so it gets a bad rap.  In all this a great game with friends and frustrating one with randoms. I reccomend this game.
3623	1	a	This is a great little game.  You can finish it in 7 hours easily. 3 hours for the Grubbins on Ice add-on. This is not a con.  In fact this is proof that a great little game with lots of personality can be a good product. Not everything has to be a 50 million dollar epic 100 hour RPG! Don't let this fool you though, there are lots of cool things to find, collect and do as you play through the story.  This game has all the great traits of a Double Fine game. - well written - personality - good mechanics - highly enjoyable  It is the perfect length for the story and mood of the game. Any longer and the mechanics of the fighting would have been too repetitive.  This is good example of a smaller downloadable game executing really well. Check it out for some light hearted fun!
1662	1	a	Monaco is a great co-op dungeon run. Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.  There's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the 'proper' gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.  It has a forgiving 'death' mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!  It also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are 'cheevos' through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.  The graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the 'ring' of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.  And the price? Cheap! I highly recommend this game.
3003	1	a	The time I spent on this game speaks for me. Very good game, in my opinion as good in solo than in multiplayer. Wonderful team of developers, very active and attentive. The level editor is amazing, so the quality of the workshop maps is excellent. New content is also added regularly: for example, a new campaign is coming. My favorite game of 2013, definitely.
1674	1	a	Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer. Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play. Playing with friends is where this excels. Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun. If you dont have this and see it on offer for under Â£2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.
3794	1	a	I liked it. It's kiddy but still made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed the game play, which would be a school-age and up difficulty. The only downside for me was not being able to skip battle animations, which got a bit repetitive.
699	1	a	very good transfer from board game onto PC
4632	0	a	I didnt like this game. At all
1566	1	a	pretty fun. especially with friends. deffinitly reccomendddddd
586	1	a	THIS IS SOO FLIPEN FUN! JUST PLAY IT OR YOU WILL SUFFER!
246	1	a	If youve ever wanted to blast geometric figures with a sphere that shoots plasma balls, this is the game for you.  You control a sphere that you roll around inside a cylinder from a top down view, making it a 2d circle. With your sphere you shoot plasma balls/beams that destroy other geometric shapes when you hit them. Those shapes spawn in intervals, depending on the level youve gotten to. You gain levels by destroying the shapes and collecting little blue orbs of EXP that conveniently home into you when you get close enough.  This is a greatly fun game in short bursts. Its simple to learn, but difficult to master.  It is also clear that this game is a fantastic way to increase your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking potential, and accuracy of short-term logical predictions. As you gain levels it becomes exponetially more difficult to coordinate your spheres movement (cannot touch any other shapes or youll explode!), your plasma beams, and the path youll need take your sphere in the next 1 - 3 seconds to avoid the semi-predictable paths of the other shapes and avoid touching any of them, lest you explode.  Graphics: For what the game is, Im satisfied with, and enjoy, the graphics. They are colorful, appealing to the eye, and mesh together well. 10/10  Sound: I have no complaints about the sound other than that there are not enough music tracks. I believe there are 4 total, which are nice tracks, but a little on the low side quantity wise, which can start to become repetative. 8/10  Gameplay: Intense, is the best way to put it. Perhaps even 'overwhelming' at first once you get 8 or 10 levels into say 'Crunch' mode (3 minute game, get highest score possible). But thats not a bad thing; as stated above, Waves really has awesome potential at training your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking, and movement prediction capabilities. 10/10  I got this on a whim while it was on sale, and I am very satisfied that I did. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys intense, even overwhelming levels of information that need to be dealt with immediately lest you explode. I also see this game as having the potential for being a training game for just about any other fast-paced video game out there.  Final score: 28/30 = 9.33  PS: Ive seen reviews questioning if this game is OK to be played with mouse and keyboard instead of gamepad. I play with M/K, and I find no intrinsic problems using them as opposed to a gamepad. Ive used both on Waves, and prefer M/K myself, but it all comes down to personal preference. Im very adept at M/K, but not so great with gamepads that require stick usage.   Id recommend trying both, and seeing which feels better to you right off the bat. Whichever does will probably be your best option.
499	0	a	In principle I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoys the original board game, as it is a very good digital realization of a very good analog original. Enough has been said about the game mechanics etc. in other posts, and just as most I do enjoy a nice round of planing, scheming and backstabbing against/with other real players.  But there's another aspect which forced me to give a negative rating: Under Ubuntu 14.04 (as well as all other Linuxes according to the TTR steam forum), the DLCs do not work any more after the last update, meaning I cannot play on the additional maps I paid for! The publisher is aware of the problem, yet a solution is not in sight.  As soon as this problem is resolved, I will change my review as the game itself is fine. But as nothing has changed over the last two months, I can't help do feel deceived so far.
2472	1	a	Greatest multiplayer game (that is not an MMO) I have ever played. sequel please!
2785	1	a	Incredibly fun co-op or solo game filled with hijinks and theivery. Highly recommended.
2829	1	a	Fun, simple, and challenging. That's all a game really needs to be.
3527	1	a	A fun RPG/Adventure that's a funny too.
4607	0	a	Did they even beta test this? All the puzzles are single solution with very limited tools. Some of the puzzles cannot even be solved because background ornaments prevent placing some of the objects required for the solution.  Pretty much a watered down version of The Incredible Machine with creativity replaced by bugs.
4705	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a first person puzzler / platformer that is based on changing the physics of your environment. My only major issue with this game is that the story was left unfinished and there is no known sequel on the horizon. Though not quite revolutionary, Quantun Conundrum knows what it is and executes excellently.   If you like games such as Portal and don't mind some additional platforming elements, you'll appreciate Quantum Conundrum.
1567	1	a	Tons of fun to play with friends! I definitely recommend it!
2044	1	a	Sneak is for the weak. 9/11 would blast through the level with rocket launchers again
650	1	a	I love board games. I have a large collection but the problem is I don't normally have anyone to play them with me. Love that i can hop on and play against the computer. Online needs some work.
1100	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this casual piece of manure, belongs on phones and nowhere else.  Ok, it's not that bad but seriously who would seriously spend money on this?
4249	0	a	Short, easy, boring levels. Not worth 10 dollars. Feels like a free flash game.
4333	0	a	This gmae is nothing more than a very low-quality Katamari ripoff, and no one should ever pay money for it unless it's sold in a bundle with better games.
4658	1	a	It could have been longer, but otherwise, I have no real complaints about this game. It's a very fun puzzle/RPG set in a sword-and-sorcery setting. The storyline and character development are little more than a MacGuffin to keep you playing, but at least the gameplay itself is really solid.
2527	1	a	Lots of fun, highly enjoyable with lots to do
3479	1	a	Cute as heck. A+
535	1	a	If you like the game board, you will most probably like this and play it over and over again. Nicely done board game adaptation with beautiful boards. You can choose the map you want to play (but you have to buy every map separately) and the number of players. You can play online with others (ranked, not ranked, private, publi, etc.)
187	1	a	I love twin stick shooters i've played them all this one is fantastic great graphics and numerous play modes elevate this one to the top of my list,i picked this up in the sale last week for under 1 euro after it was on my wishlist for about a year i should of got it earlier i know.I recommend this to all the arcade junkies out there who love building up highscores.
5445	1	a	I play this game off and on every so often. It's one of those fun little games that you can pick up and play at anytime. 
4850	1	a	Weird little adventure in the spirit of Portal, narrated by John de Lancie. Original and worth playing.
2250	1	a	Definitely reccomend this game.
2303	1	a	This is a really fun stealthy grab everything topdown with sight line game, and if your friends play it, it's even better.
2819	1	a	Great co-op stealth gameplay with friends. Tons of missions even though I don't mind playing missions ovewr again. Complete with an awesome soundtrack and a good story line.
2890	1	a	This game is totally worth the money. The gameplay is unique and refreshing. The graphics/art style stand out and looks very nice. The soundtrack is ear-melting and catchy. The different game modes, time trial/ score run and characters add a lot of reasons to replay every last drop of content this game has to offer. Plus, there's custom user-made content to try if for some reason you get bored with the regular game. This game definitely deserves a lot more recognition than it's getting.
1289	1	a	  This game was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sick before. But the AI is terrible as of the most recent update :(  Please fix it you cuties  --------------------------  Edit: It's been long since fixed :) Great game pick it up with friends
3894	1	a	It is ok.Can finish in about 5 hours or so 
193	1	a	 Definately one of the best twin-stick arena shooters I've played.  There are few frills here - just good old fashioned schmup fun. The controls are tight. The battles are fair, and the music is good.   Pros:  +Tight controls +Several game modes, and they are all pretty fun +Music is high energy and very solid +Graphics are nice, and while things get hectic, I can always discern what is going on +I love chasing my Steam friends scores (friend me if you wanna get crunked) +Price is too cheap   Cons:  -It doesn't bring anything new to the table - which is usually a  huge  con for me, but in this case, I'm cool with it   Excellent game if you are into this genre.  Well worth full price. 
2669	1	a	it is great with friends
3804	1	a	I am completely in love with this game. It's rather fun and just enough challenging to make you think a little without being realy hard or trying.  The main game has all sorts of chances for achievements and the costumes you aquire are really neat.  I enjoy the battle system. It's a straight forward turn-based system, very old school RPG. There's a little strategy involved, deciding what costume to wear and some are on by necessity along with what 'battle stamp' to use.  It's also nice that losing in a battle kicks you out of the battle, you're not 'dead' and go back to a previous point.  Only exception to this are boss battles but they point they send you is more to give you a chance to rethink your costume and stamp combos more than making you re-play levels.  My only real frusrtation is the graphics. While fun and interesting, the level of detail lags my computer like crazy. Even turning off shadowing and other features, navigating the leves and timing events in battle.
3356	1	a	Great fun! Always give this one a replay during the Halloween season!
2575	1	a	It's an amazing tiny game, I even never play this kind of the game. attracting my desire.
3012	1	a	Steal stuff the game!  Or fight your friends to steal stuff in versus modes!  Or ZOMBIES!  this is an interesting topdown stealth game which i normally hate but this game is great learning the roles of the characters is important for team missions I like THE CLEANER the most just knockin people out!  I highly recommend this game!
1614	1	a	You can't stealth in this game.
2873	1	a	A fun little stealth game. Horrible with singleplayer, but amazing with friends. It's entertaining to say the least.
888	0	a	I played this Steam version to determine whether or not I should get the board game, given all the praise surrounding it. Long story short, I am glad that this version was free because this game is just terrible. It's joyless, nonsensical, and void of any real decision making. It, like Twilight Struggle, is simply 'Here are your cards... base your strategy around them!' That is not fun by any stretch of the imagination.
4445	1	a	Fun puzzle game, not much more then that.
2608	1	a	If you like Pac-Man, then this game is for you. A combination of action, adventure and many more. The story is interesting and the gameplay is somewhat very cute.
894	1	a	Fun turn base strategy game you can play yourself, but is best played against friends. Causual and fun.
1386	1	a	You shoot penguins into water with fish that have dynamite crammed down their throats and they get eated up to death by sharks who eat specifically penguins of the blue, green, yellow, and red race. Afterwards you live out your life as a ghost penguin who's hobbies include, getting revenge on the penguin that got you eated to death by the shark, and launching bombs at other penguins to complete the first hobby that was mentioned.  All in all its a pretty simple and fun game i'd say.
3194	1	a	This was an excellent game! I also found it to be very relaxing. Puzzles had some challenge but never frustrated me.I even left the music on which is something I rarely do, as it added to such a peaceful atmosphere.
3107	1	a	Well this is a special game but super fun 100% better if you play MP
4264	1	a	I didnt think I would like this game but it turned out to be a lot of fun. Not worth the $10 price tag since it's so short of a game, but if it ever goes on sale for $8 or less I recomend geting it.
165	1	a	This game screams for touchscreen support!  It is a very quick block puzzler where you trim down the Mass by throwing like colored cubes at like colors. If the block grows too large it will reach Critical Mass and explode.  I find this to be a very relaxing puzzler to play with some nice ambient/downtempo tracks.
4071	1	a	Once you start playing you are sucked in. One of the best matching games ever made. A unique and fun game that crosses RPG and matching elements very well. The story is also interesting. 9.5/10
4489	1	a	Simple, sweet, Point and Click/Hidden Object game. Some hit detection, and rotation cursor issues. Music was good. Overall 9/10. Just don't expect an epic. It's definitely a kids game, or something to kill time.
3614	1	a	Short game, but super fun!!  The game itself is very simple and easy to play. The story is interesting in it's self and I found it entertaining. The gameplay of silly little costumes was very interesting and I enjoyed the game a lot, though it was very short and very easy to finish the game. I don't know if it's worth 10 dollars, but it might be worth to just buy it when it's on sale.
248	1	a	This is one of the better games on Steam, it's so very simple yet addictive and good-looking that you just can't stop mashing the buttons. Such colors, very eye candy, wow. Unlike many 2,5 dimensional shooters which are repetitive and uninteresting, Waves is totally awesome like a zombie ninja Jesus riding a motorcycle into outer space.  Playing Waves is very easy, but getting good at it is next to impossible. Needs good eye-hand coordination and swift reflexes. The game gets FAST in a minute or two, and that's an old school definition of FAST, where 0,05 second gap really matters and a slightest error kills you instantly. TO DEATH. Like, really.  Just go ahead and buy it right now. This game is good, and you should feel good about it.
1537	1	a	Co-op stealth OR Co-op beat-em up, depending on how you play. A slay
5180	1	a	Very fun game, everyime to make a new and epic settlement is good for passing time, After all its very enjoyable :)
749	1	a	A near-perfect translation of the board game! Definitely recommended.
4332	0	a	I started out small. Then I slowly grew to one, Big â¥â¥â¥ ball of stuff.
1108	0	a	Has a brony mode. Buy it only if you don't want to be on my freinds list.
415	1	a	Nice game to test your reflexes :)
4551	1	a	funny and unstoppable game  9/10  Advantages:Many satellites with different abilities and innovative gameplay Disadvantages::Pre-defined space for your satellites may impair gameplay  jogo engraÃ§ado e imparÃ¡vel 9/10 Vantagens: Muitos satÃ©lites com diferentes habilidades e jogabilidade inovadora Desvantagens: espaÃ§o prÃ©-definido para os seus satÃ©lites podem prejudicar gameplay

5393	1	a	this game is amazing!! brings back memories since i was a kid !! go for it !! it is the best arcade for our time
2832	1	a	Monaco has excellent trippy visuals that really apeal to my color sense. When I first got this game I thought of it as being a stealth/heist type game, but now that I have played it I understand the comment that I read about how it feels like a puzzle game.
261	1	a	very fun to play
554	1	a	Best India game on STEAM.
4438	1	a	There are far better casual games out there, but this one isn't bad. It does get particularly repetitive toward the end, when all upgrades are purchased and you're left just doing the same thing over and over with no variation, but the timed element still keeps you somewhat on your toes. Essentially, it's your job as the farmer to harvest the appropriate vegetables to send to market, which you do by creating squares on the field that have the same vegetable in each corner. You will also need to deal with several different kind of pests and such along the way. So, not much of a storyline or challenge here, except in the fact that there is a timer that pressures you a bit toward the end, but it is overall quite relaxing. I did get the game in a bundle, and wouldn't have paid full price, but it is at least worth playing if casual games are something you enjoy at times. Really, it's basically what I had expected based on the description and screenshots, so I can't fault it for not being more than that.
3882	1	a	Very cute and addicting game. Story is very nice.
3410	1	a	This game is awesome! You play as a child who dresses his costume for halloween and goes to the houses of the neighborhood to trick and treat. In the middle of this, you lose your brother and your journey to rescue him begins.  This game mixes simple elements of RPG and action game, the graphics are lovely, as well as the soundtrack. The battles are per turn and quite dynamic, recommended!  And the achievements worth the try, for those who like those kind of things. ;)
5401	1	a	Titan Attacks starts off really slow with a Space Invaders like pace, but ramps up quickly to something like Galaga on steroids. The screen is exploding in pixel fireworks after a few stages and upgrades to your little tank. Super fun neo-retro fixed screen shooter!
3422	0	a	While I love Double Fine Adventures, this was not worth the time or money to me personally. It is a bit repetative and it lacks the ability to save wherevere/whenever I want. I quit playing after I kept starting from the same point after a while when I'd only want to play for about 20 mins or so (then again, I can sometimes be a slow gamer, so the checkpoints may arrive earlier for you).
2777	1	a	Hectic neon-gasmic fun.
2253	1	a	Requires an amazing amount of teamwork and is challenging ,Worth a try
3910	0	a	A charming way to kill a couple of hours, especially if you decide to marathon it on or around Halloween. However, the repetitive nature of quests and combat combined with the game getting increasingly dull the more you play it keeps me from recommending it. Not bad by any means, but not something I'm sure I'd play again.
548	1	a	All the joy and fun of Ticket To Ride without the hassles of tidying up after every session.
1653	1	a	15/5 IT'S ALWAYS CRIME TIME
4726	1	a	The puzzle's are great. Obviously, very Portal-esque. The platforming is AWFUL though. Still a lot of fun.
5206	1	a	Nice puzzle game. Cute graphics. Intuitive controls. Interesting enemies and approaches to beat them. Plus add steam workshop, just priceless. --- Get it and have fun playing this relaxing game.
4219	1	a	A classic game with lots of fun, but I have rarely played it since Marvel: Puzzle Quest (Android) came out. I have played this for a very long time on DS &amp; Xbox 360.
587	0	a	Cannot get it to run on Mac Maverick or Yosemite.
2103	1	a	This game is one of my favourite co-op puzzle games. It is one of those games that challenge you, and make you enjoy every second of the game.
1608	1	a	This game is like Payday 2, brought onto an 8-bit platform. This game has up to 50 missions to complete, a zombie mode and a map editor. The fun never stops! Would recommend this to everyone that has consumed a marshmallow.
3816	1	a	I am completely in love with this game. It's rather fun and just enough challenging to make you think a little without being realy hard or trying.  The main game has all sorts of chances for achievements and the costumes you aquire are really neat.  I enjoy the battle system. It's a straight forward turn-based system, very old school RPG. There's a little strategy involved, deciding what costume to wear and some are on by necessity along with what 'battle stamp' to use.  It's also nice that losing in a battle kicks you out of the battle, you're not 'dead' and go back to a previous point.  Only exception to this are boss battles but they point they send you is more to give you a chance to rethink your costume and stamp combos more than making you re-play levels.  My only real frusrtation is the graphics. While fun and interesting, the level of detail lags my computer like crazy. Even turning off shadowing and other features, navigating the leves and timing events in battle.
5307	1	a	beautiful art.. I love it.. and that 'no tutorial' statement is a great point.. it make me want to play again and again.. I want to know what will happen next..
4234	1	a	I can only recommend this game by the slimmest of margins. It's enjoyment wears thin and the feeling of 'more of the same, only a little harder this time' is unavoidable. This can be minimized by short sessions, which is probably how it was meant to be played anyway. Another gripe is that multiplayer seems to be discontinued, just as the dev's website is also nowhere to be found. This breaks almost half of the game's achievements and reduces its overall value considerably. However, if your expectations don't rise above a series of fun and unique minigames that test your twitch skills, then you should be happy with Ninja Reflex. Just wait until its on sale...
3483	1	a	This is such a fun game. It is perfect for either someone who likes cute, fun, casual games or for kids. Really, this should be a must for every child to play because it's a good blend of puzzle working, RPG, and imagination. Great game! =)
1609	1	a	to good to be true
4605	0	a	Total â¥â¥â¥â¥, buy the first one which is better.
4120	1	a	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords review    1) Essential - buy it NOW   2) Recommended - buy it on sale
1677	1	a	Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard. So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.
4335	1	a	Dec 21st 2012 in a nutshell
1493	1	a	it's a 2D, top-down stealth and inflitration game. this is one of the best co-op games you'll be able to find for you and 1-3 of your friends.  + it's able to be both entertaining and challenging + the design is charming + great soundtrack + have a blast with your friends, playing locally or online - it's not all that much fun playing solo  score = 4.5/5
114	1	a	one of the best indie puzzle games i have played in a while! recommended!
3172	1	a	Good game to kill boredom..... And when you come to chapter 3,clock tower X,then begins frustration
5225	1	a	great game with great features that most players will enjoy.  If you enjoy a good puzzle, Play this game!
2215	1	a	Shares some similarities with Payday 2, Hotline Miami, Minesweeper, and a whole lot of it's own thing. Nice graphics too (watch some videos, skip the pictures).
631	1	a	Great strategy game! Very addiciting, even against the A.I.
449	1	a	Really Really Really Fun game. I try my hardest to get the highest score in one of the game modes, but I fail.
2197	1	a	Super fun! Took me a minute to understand the controls (mouse + WASD) and I've only played single player... But so far so good!
4203	1	a	This is a great game! The sort of game I like playing apart from MMO's. You just keep wanting to play once you start!
1428	0	a	Check out the video below for full detail:          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rainbow Reviewer: Penguin Arena Sedna's World&nbsp;
3887	1	a	First Steam game i ever 100 percented and it wasn't a a pain at all. Even though it stars kids, do not be fooled into thinking this is a kid's game. It requires a quick-time event with every attack so it keep you more involved than ususal turnbased RPGs
3884	1	a	This game is fun, but the fights are all the same which makes the game a little repetitive. But the environment is great, the story is funny, although really short (a few hours to finish the game, a few more to finish the DLC and/or get all side quests).  If you can buy it in a bundle or on sale, you should try it. Otherwise, wait for steam summer/winter sales ;)
2967	1	a	This game is just pure of joy and excitement for group of friends who would love to chill and enjoy playing together i would totally recommend this game ! :D enjoy
4191	1	a	Time is an illusion. Lunch time doubly so.
2056	1	a	This game is absolutely phenomenal. It's great if you have friends that can play with you, and even better if you can talk to eachother whilst playing it. This game is my game of the year 2013 and game of the year 2014 so far! I love this game so much, but my only knack is the dodgy level editor system. It's controls are somewhat flawed, but if I could navigate it with my mouse then I feel that it would be greatly improved. Buy this game and share it with your friends!  P.S. I have taken the liberty of creating a group for our Monaco friends by the name of Voleurs De La Nuit. Please join us and invite your friends to have even more fun in Monaco!
71	1	a	It is a fun game
4085	1	a	if u like connect 4 then this gme if for u
5168	1	a	Silly little game with a tutorial that makes learning game play very easy. The AI is sort of dumb however and can take a while for things to get done.  Glad I got it on sale. Wouldnt have wanted to pay full price for it but its a fun time killer for the casual player.  Relaxing. Doesnt require tons of thought.
779	1	a	This is good - like the board game
2854	1	a	It's no exaggeration when GameFront says that Monaco is a strong contender for Game of the Year. It may look like a simple game at first, but Monaco is the most fun you can have, alone or with friends. Multiple well-designed campaigns, a cast of quirky and sometimes lovable characters, and a terrific soundtrack make Monaco one of the must-have games of the year.
2859	1	a	A well made little stealth game. I really enjoy it and thats either by myself or online with matchmaking. I believe it can be even more fun playing it with voip and a gang of friends. There is some shooting envolved with this game but don't expect to have a gun on every mission. However you really don't need one. I recommend this game to any and everybody!
5498	1	a	Byotiful.  Absolutely byotiful.
1808	1	a	Great game which is easy to learn and great chracters to play as with unigue abilities. The game is always different with different people and a different character set. You can have a good time with some strangers or have a laugh with friends especially when new friends join the game and sing new york new york as he walks past people the first time he uses the gentleman. But in the end it is a great game and you have fun learning what to do with the simple controls and good gameplay.
5002	1	a	Excellent game, looking forward to installing it for my kids to play in a few years. Fun and challenging with good amounts of humor.
2082	1	a	Star in your own zany heist movie with friends, local coop or online.
3299	1	a	Overall: Costume Quest is a cute and adorable game about the complicated relationship siblings have with each other, set against the backdrop of one of my favorite holidays: Halloween. While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it.   Rating: 9/10 - Details below  Story: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in.   Graphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it.   Controls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.  Sounds &amp; Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.  Gameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the 'Trick' aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up.   Final Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children. If you can afford to pay full price and want to support a good game, do so.
1462	0	a	pls don't do games like this
3535	1	a	This game is just fantastic! It's a fun little halloween RPG by the amazing team at Double Fine, which are responsible for masterpieces like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend.   This game does not disappoint at all. It's a short and sweet game that i enjoyed from start to finish, even though the combat can get a bit repetitive in the start of the game, Once you get out of the first area of the game the combat becomes fresh again. Introducing new enemies, new costumes, and new abilities.  It also has quite a bit of challenge, i didn't die a lot, but nearing the end of the game it really gets difficult.  Overall it's a really good game. 9/10 
4820	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great experience overall, but it somewhat lacks in a few aspects. First of all, if you liked the original Portal you will probably like this game, considering it was made by most of the same team. The puzzles are good, not too hard, but not so easy that I could fly right through them. I see a lot of potential here, if they are planning a sequel, they should try to do the same thing Valve did for Portal 2. If you feel like taking a trip to Quadrangle Manor I would reccomend that you wait for a sale before purchasing. But it is worth the price if you can't wait. 7.5/10
1030	1	a	Adorable side-scrolling obstacle course driving game, in which a truckload of cuddly toys must not fall out as you fly over ramps, TNT, and moose! Levels range from the simple to the incredibly hard.
2470	1	a	What an awesome game. Pac-Man on steroids. Run around gathering coins using different class characters. They are all evenly balanced to allow you to be proficient at clearing certain obstacles ... and if you catch a semi decent online team it gets to be alot of fun.  Full controller support too is great. I could play this game on my 360 pad for hours! Now if i could just get touch support on my surface for it ... its a perfect tablet game otherwise.  Also, I hadn't tried it just yet, but the game appears to have a built in mission/map editor where you can post you missions to the community. That got me really excited. Unlimited mission possibilities really extends the life of the game.
3370	1	a	This gem is a great example of what games can be at their best: funny, charming, creative, unique, and short enough to enjoy over a weekend or three. Very highly recommended.
4444	1	a	The best farm game that features rabbit slapping and oil drilling you're likely to find.
1432	0	a	I Uh.... Was this someone's final uni project? Oh well, Free Cards.
269	1	a	A very fun and innovative game for the twin stick shooter genre.  Classic scoring system allows for competitions among friends and maybe even tournaments.  Fun game that's worth its price.
1930	1	a	its so more fun then it locks 
5013	1	a	Awesome game if you like to complete puzzles with a portal feeling to it ;)
424	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in soundtrack and some great mechanics. Seeing how far you can push your combos feels great, and the alternate modes offer some satisfying spins on the traditional challenge. I was personally very motivated by the leaderboards and trying to catch up to friends' scores. If you like twin-stick shooters, definitely give this one a spin.
2647	1	a	Co-op is so much fun!
4170	1	a	A laid-back, yet addictive puzzle game. Lots of fun and very easy to learn how to play--but challenging enough to keep you interested.
2070	1	a	if everyone followed that motto we would all have things, but they would like always be replaced with new things every few seconds... it would be a rotation of other peoples things that then becomes yours and vice versa... oghrigt goldengirls out of cia miami
4894	1	a	Physics-based puzzle platformer in the same vein as the Portal games. Pretty fun.
489	0	a	Can not recommend after recent update.  AI will just hoard cards until there is nothing left in the draw pile - not enjoyable anymore.
2628	1	a	'Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine' is a very unique game that is one of the best in it's genre. The stealthiness gives you a feeling of acomplishment as well as being a spy yourself. Also, the cooperative gameplay is amazing, leading to very funny times and very fun to play moments. The levels are also great, being difficult enough that it's very hard, but not too much as to not motivate you to try again. Monaco is truly an indie gem.
3731	1	a	Cute game suited for younger audiences. The combat system is simplistic, dialog is entertaining.
5511	1	a	From the creators of Revenge Of The Titans, here is a nice tribute to space invaders, with a design style that I can't get enough of. You progress through various stages and planets with a short description of your mission; which is of course to SAVE THE WORLD. As you progress you build a score as well as a bank in which to use for buying upgrades. Upgrades include weapons, armor, screen clearing bombs, and more. Each planet is finished with a boss who may, or may not, be trying to destroy you. It's a great casual experience that you can walk away from and it will be right where you left off when you come back. The best part is if you die, you return to the beginning of the planet you were on! Yes, you do get set back a bit but it's a nice surprise to not having to start entirely over! So if you liked Space Invaders, you should definitively get this game. Shoot those laser bullets, destroy those aliens, capture and/or kill the ones who try to escape, defend those planets, and win!
556	1	a	This is a fast learning game and can be played in a short amount of time. 
2526	1	a	This game is multiplayer stealth that works. As if that alone wasn't enough of a reason for you to check this game out, it's also crazy amounts of fun. I say best played in a group of people you know, or with a mic, but even then, so much fun. Highly reccommend.
4146	1	a	This is a Great Game for you fantasy Fans and/or Puzzle Solvers. its got alittle something for you guys.
2231	1	a	Maybe one of the funnest co-op games I've ever played. Haven't done much single-player so i don't know how that holds up, but if you can get two-three friends together Monaco is a GREAT time.
2069	1	a	The best game ever made.
1741	1	a	Before you get this game, do you have at least 2 friends who would play this with you? If you do, then go ahead and buy it.  A cooperative stealth/collection game, Monaco offers a variety of ways to play with its ecclectic cast of characters. With skills unique to each character, such as Disguise, Spot and Breaking Down Walls, playing with a different set of team members will create a whole new approach to each carefully designed level.  
4777	1	a	Really fun game from the dev of Portal
4652	1	a	One of the greatest childhood games ever.
3379	1	a	I enjoyed my play through of this game. The run took me about 6 hours trying to complete all the quests I found in the game. It doesn't have replayability. What it does have is a nice atmosphere, great tongue in cheek humor and a story line that is fun and didn't were out its welcome. I'd say I was only a slight bit bothered that you are unable to skip the combat intro's, which get somewhat repetive after a while. Definitely give it a try when you can get it in a sale!
2232	1	a	Awesome game, great for the strategist or going in 'guns blazing'. Spent many hours on it and still not tired of it.
2644	1	a	Fun and frantic. Better with friends than solo, of course. It gets pretty crazy and pretty difficult, but that's part of the fun.  The music and ambience is great, too.
1380	1	a	Best Game of the pack! Worth!
3327	1	a	This is such a cute game. I got it as part of a bundle I purchased in order to get another game I wanted and never really intended to play it. But I did. And I ended up loving it.  It's definitely a pretty casual game and you can breeze through it pretty quickly so it might not appeal to the most hardcore of gamers but I thought it was a blast. The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.  Since all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.  There are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.  The only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level. The top tier of that level just looked all the same to me and I kept getting turend around. At least your main costume comes with rollerblades so that you can just zip right along.
1232	1	a	Penguin genocide and more maps than Gears 4.  10/10
2179	1	a	Oh snap! It's the THE ARCHITECT'S PATCH!
4471	1	a	Not much to say here. I enjoyed this game. I would probably play it again. I will definitely play the two sequels. It's a simple block matching game with a few unique features. You can rotate the board 90 degrees at a time as often as you want in either direction to control how the blocks fall. There are some decent boosters that can clear out an entire row or column. Once you clear the the board, a special block appears and an exit slot appears. You need to clear blocks around the special block to move it toward the exit. It can be a little more challenging than it sounds. As the levels progress, the configuration of the boards make you work around obstacles. It's a fun game. Total play time to completion was around 9 hours.
3926	1	a	Best game to play for Haloween time, i enjoyed this game a lot.   the art styling was coo to see, kind of like an older game. the gameplay is fun with all the different costume abbilities, and the games makes you want all the costumes to see what they all do :)  i would give this about 8/10  the soundtrack was kind of dull.
1941	1	a	Tactical game for thieves!
1086	1	a	this game is not as bad as you think this game is fun  worth it
2673	1	a	This game is so fun .... ur missing out
1779	1	a	best played with friends, a fun little stealth coop expirience has given me so many frantic and fun moments, would wait for it to go on sale though, not sure if it's worth the Â£12
53	1	a	This is a tiny taste of a game. It is a very quick play-through and, honestly, at full price I would be a bit miffed. Thank goodness for Steam Sales! The animation is unique. I hope Part II is equally well done.
3416	1	a	Gotta thank one of my besties, gogostar, for getting me this game. Because of it, I love Double Fine Productions and will definitely be keeping an eye out for future projects. It's supposed to be a children's turn-based RPG but only informed teens and adults would understand some of the more subtle humor. I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas (you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin) but less deranged. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, good feels, nice art style, and it's adorable as â¥â¥â¥â¥. What other game would let you duke it out as a vampire, unicorn, and a pirate (my favorite in-game trio)? Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to relax with a nice, cute story about sibling bonding and friendship.
3487	1	a	Highly entertaining Halloween based adventure/RPG game. Turn based combat is simple to grasp and there is a good selection of costumes providing different bonuses and abilities during combat. Basic equipment system (Battle Stamps) allow for minor tweaking of your characters. Story is highly entertaining.
5358	1	a	â Good presentation â DRM-free version exists â GNU/Linux support.
203	1	a	Old style arcade shooter fun, if this doesn't get your blood moving then you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead on a slab.
326	1	a	They just keep coming
1031	1	a	I have felt every possible human emotion while playing Snuggle Truck.
3745	1	a	This is actually worth playing if you got it during that one Humble Bundle long ago.
1998	1	a	Way overpriced but fun. Worth a pick-up on a steam sale.
4977	1	a	Fun Puzzle game. Levels are fun and challenging to think through.  Although the ending was a bit underwelming.
306	1	a	Waves has a surprising number of different gaming modes. Only after playing it for a few days, I have my favorites and find the entire game quite addicting. The more I play, the better I get and the more I want to play. I have a controller and find the controls very smooth. The in game tools at your disposal are limited (Slow-Mo and bomb), but are very useful and affective. Both have saved my life numerous times. As you level up, you have a chance to get a score multiplier. I really hate when it disappears before I can grab it, but it does add some difficulty to the game. I purchased this game when it was on sale, but it's definately worth the full price.
3596	1	a	Pretty repetitive and can kind of drag but if it's the halloween season and you're feeling festive you'll enjoy it.  A good, safe, game to give your kids.
4061	1	a	I love slamit pinball. You can play the game two ways. First time you go up a colored ramp you are picking that side to play for. Either cop or robber. The table took some slight adjustments in the editor till it was the angle I am comfortable with but after that it is a very deep game when it comes to unlocking the vault and breaking into the bank. The safe combo has sweet effects to it too and multiball gets nuts. Great table for the price.
5363	1	a	Space Invaders with a few twists. Throws in Galaxian/Galaga type characters while you play in a Space Invaders manner.  WARNING!!!! MAY CAUSE A CASE OF 'MOUSE FINGER' (index finger cramp) AFTER PROLONGED USE!!!!!!!  Like Retro (Atari Days Retro)? Get it.  Hate the days of Atari? Might want to avoid.
4811	1	a	Absolutely great puzzle game-platformer, some puzzles are sor hard they will make you cry. 10/10 would puzzle-cry again
1638	1	a	Leg it boys! Gotta get that gold ya see, ya see?
3601	1	a	Super cute, reminded me a bit of Earthbound :)
2071	1	a	What the hell do I do in this game? Help Me PLEASE!
2672	1	a	amazing but right now its not working for me 
2989	1	a	Monaco is one of those rare multiplayer experiences where everything goes from ok to 'everythings on fire, and all we have is oil to put it out' and you love every minute of it.   The characters you choose from each have their own unique strengths, and often you'll find yourself choosing a specific one that matches your playstyle.   The music is very well done, changing based on the situation but never feeling intrusive.   Lastyly i've never joked about chloroforming people as often as i have in this game. If you have a good group of friends and you want a solid co-op experience buy this game.
5029	0	a	The first Puzzler World was mildly fun. This one is incredibly boring and feels like a chore every second you keep playing it.
2986	1	a	WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half-â¥â¥â¥ review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess. It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck. Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must be something behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includes different amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats. Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine. *OPENS THE GAME* Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is. Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcade no that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing  the game you went like,â¥â¥â¥â¥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include  them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPC with the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll already be there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the place I just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero! Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half-â¥â¥â¥ now they were too  lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get. Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaÅ.Almost forgot,since the developers are too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy to get a minimap at the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understand how much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer. Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the â¥â¥â¥â¥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everything you wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked. WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from  freesounds.org?  Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining. By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either. That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  NO GOD! PLEASE NO!!! NOOOOOOOOOO&nbsp;

5154	1	a	It has a few glitches and lags sometimes but not severely. Overall this plays okay and I like it.
3746	1	a	A cuddly, adorable, heartwarming adventure that is certain to make you nostalgic for your childhood. To anyone who has a soul, this game is a must play.
2047	1	a	this is the funnest fast paced arcade game I had ever played!!!!! it is an amazing and fun coop experience and also has an intense pvp mode to play with your friends. all of the classes are usefull and fun to play as, whether your into difficult stealth gameplay or just want to have some fun with your steam friends this is a game I recommend for all  10/10
2756	1	a	At first I was like what the F is this game? Then I decided to try it and wow.. Fun fun fun
96	1	a	Best puzzle game I have ever played
3303	1	a	Absolutely adorable game that oozes Doublefine charm. You play as a bunch of kids who get wrapped up in a halloween monster plot to steal all the world's candy. The gameplay is somewhere inbetween the Mario RPG games (Superstar saga, Paper Mario) and South Park Stick of Truth, with your kids actually turning into their costume for the battle. There's a heap of unlockable costumes which act as character classes and a few other clever ways to customise your guys. It's just all round fun.  I really wouldn't be surprised if the guys that made Stick of Truth were inspired by this. They're ridiculously similar, in a good way! It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Definitely grabbing the sequel :D
2288	1	a	Really fun with friends, best spent 1 key in my life.
5273	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a Metroidvania style puzzle adventure. There are no tutorials, there's no hand-holding, no-one tells you what to do in Toki Tori 2+. The fun is in exploring and overcoming the obstacles of the lush forest island on your own merit.   Our unlikely yellow hero may be the star of the show, but he won't get anywhere without the creatures he meets along the way. Armed with just the Whistle and Stomp moves, he can influence and make use of these strange creatures' unique abilities.   But what's up with that black goo? It's threatening your home world! Your goal is to get to the core of the corruption and save the island!
1104	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of 'Snuggies' as fast as possible to the zoo. On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.  Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from 'Smuggle Truck' to 'Snuggle Truck'. Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.   Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend 'Smuggle Truck' instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.
5486	1	a	Twisted Space Invider.
2899	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
2679	1	a	Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .
4567	1	a	Good RTS / Turret Defense. Plus has some replay value, with its unstoppable difficulty, challenges and arcade mode.
5006	1	a	+ Funny puzzles + Great graphics and sounds  - Longevity (it's not so short, but it could be longer) - The finale. It seems they didn't have many ideas on how to end the story... - Ike could be used better - A bit repetitive
3317	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute little game worth goofing around with in October. Once you get into it, it's pretty fun. I find myself really eager to try out whatever new costume I come across just to see its special abilities.  Combat is pretty much nothing but quick time events, which is somewhere between disappointing and frustrating. Each costume has its own different take on the quick time event though, with some asking you to get timing right, some asking you to hit a button before its too late, and some asking you to mash keys. It does keep it interesting I suppose. At least defending is always the same thing.
1648	1	a	10/10 best new stealth
5525	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
3523	1	a	A damn fine piece of candy.
2501	1	a	You see, monaco is like a really really good pizza pop. not much build up, but its explodes in your mouth and covers you with delicious
4554	1	a	I absolutely LOVE this game -- it's probably my favorite indie title ever. It has a goofy retro sense of humor which perhaps some younger gamers don't appreciate, so just to avoid any possible confusion: it is NOT trying to be serious. Some folks complain that it's too hard for a 'casual' game, but I didn't find that to be true at all. True, I had to repeat some levels several times before I got through them -- but do you really want a game that you can beat in one sitting? I think of each level as a puzzle that has to be solved rather than a simple anything-goes shoot 'em up. Most of all I appreciate that this game has in abundance something that most are completely lacking: style. I periodically return to play through the whole campaign just to experience that. An unreserved thumbs up.
465	1	a	I have a soft spot for twin-stick shooters: they're some of the purest arcade style shooters available, and with the simplistic control scheme joined with the even simpler gameplay style, I'm very rarely disappointed with them. Is Waves worth a check out? You betcha.  For anyone that doesn't know, a twin-stick shooter is exactly that: the left stick controls you, the right stick aims where you shoot. Easy peasy. The arcade classic Asteroids can be seen as one of, if not the, first twin stick. So with Waves the premise remains the same: see brightly colored geometric shape, aim at it, and watch a pretty display of particles explode out from it. The more shapes you blow up, the more points you get. Blow up enough shapes in quick succesion, the higher combo you attain. High combo means more points. Points are life.  Waves breaks up the monotony by implementing a slow down mechanic based upon an ever replenshing gauge: use it to get out of hairy situations or to rack up bonus points. Waves also utilizes a bomb system in which you're awarded bombs based upon your score, but only for a short moment. Miss your chance to use it and it's gone.  Waves has a nice selection of gameplay modes, but if there was one issue I had with it, it's that they're all a little short (except for Survival of course.) Each mode has its own score boards, which is cool, and the variety keeps the game from becoming boring.   The visuals are nice, the music is pleasing, and the gameplay is tight. If you like Geometry Wars, or simple arcade shooters in general, this is certainly worth the purchase.
3899	1	a	The premise is clever and the art style is charming, but this game is probably best suited for little kids as battling gets repetitive and the controls are slightly awkward.
3187	1	a	not the newest game in town but i enjoyed it a lot. visuals are quite neat for its age, sound is ok as well and while the game mechanics are kind of simple there are a lot of challenging and entertaining levels to play.  two levels i had to check out on youtube because i just couldn't figure out where to start for ages but that was just me suffering from brain f4rt. everyhing else was completed 100% after 8 1/2 hours so the game certainly is not too short.  if you want to kill some time and test your (in)eptitude at puzzles then this is the way to go.
5108	0	a	Painfully unfunny and horribly paced. There are many other, better dungeon/city building games than this.
898	0	a	Cannot control all of my units. ***Units do not defend*** - units do not exchange fire during combat. Cards usually only allow you to control a couple units at a time and usually only on left, center or right...!??! So big problem is if you have more than one objective (and enemy may not have the same problem) while you move towards one objective, enemy has at your other units Without incurring damage! Your order, movement and combat choices are (very) restricted by the cards.  In a nutshell: much more luck than skill involved :P  Maybe it's just me. I don't like it.  However, this is a polished functional game - so still a nice free game.  Try it, see if you like it :)
2611	1	a	If you have a few friends to play with it can get pretty hectic, definatly a must try.
1218	1	a	More intense than Titanfall
3154	1	a	Obulis is a puzzle game that utilizes physics in order for you to solve the puzzles. You have multicolored balls that must reach a given pocket or hole. In order to do so you'll have to figure out the proper order and timing on when to release them from their dangling/swinging chain, or when you need to move them with the click of a mouse. I really liked this game, it was very simple to play, but at times very complex to solve. That's what I want to see out of any puzzle game, the difficulty being in the puzzle itself, not trying to figure out how to get the game to work for you. Simple graphics, forgettable music, but it all fits perfectly because of the fabulous gameplay and physics that this game offer. Highly recommended for any puzzle genre fan.
998	0	a	The ending credits are longer than the game itself. 3/10
2959	1	a	This game is pretty fun. The early levels are too easy but one the difficulty ramps up lots of fun is had. Best played with friends
5384	1	a	hollywood version of space invaders. BADASS
2748	1	a	A great game with great gameplay. I stronly reccomend this game!!!!
3916	1	a	Great game for Halloween! Super fun game with tons of charm that has elements of exploration and turn-based RPG battles.
21	1	a	If Super Mario 3 and Braid had a baby, this game would be it LOL....Dodge the madbro clouds of firey doom, jump over the buzz saws of death, and flying/gliding through death traps...this game is pretty cool. ( ps - don't fall in the lava XD )
4100	1	a	This game can be extremely fun to play if you can just get over the fact that this game hates you. I don't mean that the game is designed to go against you. I mean the game hates you with a passion. The designers of this game created the first artificial intelligence system designed to mimic the actual emotion of hate. When you are sleeping, the game is plotting your downfall. Other than that, it is insanelly addictive and mimics the Civilization style 'just-one-more-turn'.
5520	1	a	Okay...the trailers give you all the info you need. And yes, it's just as fun to play. It's basically space invaders with a wider variety of enemies (which makes it play like centipede or a bullet hell shooter at a few later levels) and some item upgrades. It's not the most complex game on steam, but it's absolutely fun. :-)  (note: I had some issues getting this thing to properly work on fullscreen. At first, it didn't properly register my mouse, meaning my ship couldn't go all the way to the right. On windowed mode, it could happen that your pointer accidentally went 'off screen', meaning you suddenly dragged the game window around. In the end, I set the .exe to start at 640x480 resolution. It works, but looks more retro than it's supposed to ;-) ).
2116	1	a	Amazing heist game with high replayability value. Would totally buy.
3495	1	a	I usually despise JRPGs, but I really enjoy the concept, story, characters, dialogue, and graphics of this game. The battles have enough for the player to do that make them better than typical JRPG battles. Basically, if you don't like JRPGs but are intrigued by the trailer and screenshots, this game might be worth a try.
3346	1	a	When a game has as much charm and attention to presentation as Costume Quest does, you don't really mind that the RPG mechanics are incredibly rudimentary and simple. The only thing I really found irksome about this game were a couple of moments where DoubleFine let its history of creating Adventure games show, and the player is forced to perform tasks in particular sequences or in ways that nobody in their right mind would think of. While it's probably the easiest and shortest RPG I've played since Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, it's a really fun and light-hearted way to kill a few hours while getting into the Halloween spirit.
3269	1	a	Surprisingly fun and challenging puzzle game in which timing is a key factor! I really enjoyed it!
3579	1	a	It's the only way I can trick or treat without being arrested. So I love it.
3125	1	a	It's like Payday without the microtransactions! Every heist will somehow turn on its head and will provid hours of laughs and fun. Get this game, it's super cheap during sales and even at full price it's worth it.
2342	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends! I had it on my Xbox 360 and played it a ton with my brother.  The item pickups and character abilities are cool. The levels are interesting and pretty challenging later on. The art style and music make the game more fun and intense.  I recommend adding this game to your wishlist and that you and a friend buy it during a good sale!
1714	1	a	Great game!Shows how well ur aware are u in a game and mosts of all one of the best co-op games I've ever played
5179	1	a	I bought this game because I like dwarves.  I didn't really play it that much or really enjoy it that much.   But also I really like dwarves so like 9/10
5102	1	a	I loved this game, it reminded me a little of dungeon keeper and warhammer.  My campaign gliched and made me a replay a few missions and was quite short but i still enjoyed it.  I dont like the paid extras... i bought the game, i dont want to buy extra textures and items. 
4642	1	a	This is a very exciting game !!! Play it
408	1	a	Great random fun!
2478	1	a	Let me tell you this game. THIS. GAME. Its super rad. I don't tend to latch on to stealth games or online games that make you follow the story, but Monaco is one that I was able to do just that. Each class is useful with none being better than the other, and the combinations that you can use in this game really makes is a game you can play with anyone! I highley recommend this game and I highly recommend you get other people to play it with you!
788	1	a	My girlfriend and I played this game in it's board version with friends and decided to buy it ourselves because we liked it so much. We play it a lot and bought some of the expansions as well.  Liking it so much I also bought the Steam version one day when it was on sale just to see what it was. I played it a little in single player vs a computer, it was fun but I forgot about the game after a while.  When we were on a holiday together and she (okay it was not her, it was me..), forgot to pack Ticket to Ride the board game I remembered having the game on Steam. Since I brought my Windows hybrid tablet that could run steam I installed it, took the keyboard dock off and played the game with the touch screen together passing the tablet every time. Although it is different than having to fiddle with the trains etc. since it is all there on the screen it was a lot of fun! Passing the tablet every time was a bit of a hassle but we had the same fun blocking each others routers etc. We laughed and had the same competition we would normally have had with the board game. The downside is that you can not see the playing board all the time so it is a bit harder to think ahead.  All in all I loved having this installed on my tablet. It's convenient to take with you compared to the box with the game if you are low on space for a trip. Still I prefer the board game whenever I can with more players or when I do have the space to take the full board game with me. I just love to have this as a backup and for a fast game of (single player) Ticket to Ride.
4740	1	a	A really good game. I'd say the puzzles are even better constructed than those in Portal, mainly because there is often more than 1 solution to every puzzle. It's a bit on a short side though, so pick it up when it's on sale.
1360	1	a	This game reminds me of ps1 era games, on good way. I'ts actually very fun game, but gets dull very quickly if you play it alone, that goes for gameplay and for music (which seems to be a bit surferish). This game would be even better if it had better physics. Don't be afraid to try this game, but be cautious - playing this game solo is boring!
1719	1	a	took a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and came back and it was done downloading  10/10 would download again
4647	1	a	Crazy Machines - Fantastic game 8/10 Crazy Machines 1.5 New from the Lab - very good game 7/10 Crazy Machines 1.5 Inventors Training Camp - good game 6/10
2235	1	a	This game is tonnes of fun, better when with friends but it is playable by yourself.  If you can get a few friends for PVP or Story it is very good.
978	0	a	Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye.
3011	1	a	9/10 disapointed by laser shark 
3502	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those unusual games you either love or hate. It is quite original, as is the trademark of Tim Schafer and the great Double Fine Productions, and offers a mixture of RPG and Adventure quite unseen in all the role-playing games I have played so far. A possible problem is that it merely brushes the surface of the genre and never goes in-depth. Don't expect neat level up and careful customization of your party, Costume Quest need to be played for the taste of its storyline, full of humor and for the cool gust it blows on a game market filled with clones.  I also continued to play this game for its atmosphere, despite the repetition and the boredom that may occur after the too many similar moments of gameplay: the combat system barely evolves throughout the (short) story and the items hunts sometimes break the rhythm. To conclude, I would recommend it only to those who are ok with playing a game for its particular taste and the polish of its storyline rather than for the mechanics of its gameplay. Once again, Costume Quest is a very short game (I maxed it out in less than seven hours) but it is definitely a great pick for those who are looking for a bit share of originality . 
1970	1	a	Great OST but don't play public coop.
3499	1	a	Where to even begin with this one... Costume Quest is something special. The setting is superb and the RPG elements are interwoven brilliantly. The dialogue is really fun to read and I found myself laughing aloud quite often. All of the costumes are really creative and super fun to play around with. This game just gets so many things right that you really owe it to yourself, especially if you enjoy RPGs, to play it.  
4800	1	a	A lot of people are going to compare this game to Portal based on the overall design and style of the game. Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.
5078	0	a	My first impression of this game was very optimistic; its gameplay was somewhat different from most games, and the games that this one is likened to are only in 2D, making this very promising.  However, after the first hour it became very apparent that this game was designed to be casual- no real resource management or needs/logistics to cover even the most sprawling of dwarven strongholds. Granted, the game IS in the casual genre, but a game like this has so much potential that it comes off as more of a half-baked idea than intentionally casual. This is evident in the lack of true challenges and very repetitive gameplay.   So, avoiding the strategy genre because there is nothing challenging, I wouldnt count it as a building game either. The number of items available arent very many for a builders' game, and what's available is most likely useless decoration, which would have been fine if the game had direction, but because of the immense amount of time it takes to make one or two decorations, playing this just doesnt seem worth the effort.   I was looking forward to this as an alternative to Towns, but I am disappointed to say that Towns is far more engaging and rewarding.
2626	1	a	It sure is a game. It has a character, or maybe more (no spoilers). It has context. It has a start and levels. Much Review, such wow, very dog
696	1	a	A really decent version of the classic board game.  My only real problem is that sometimes the ticket cards don't activate when clicked.  4/5
1938	1	a	I don't remember ever playing this game, i also don't own it yet I can review it.  GG
3328	1	a	This game is so much fun to play, especially at Halloween. On sale now for 0.99 cent !! Get it now !!
3864	1	a	Not the type of game I usually play but it came in Amazon's Double Fine Bundle and I gave it a go. I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls &amp; combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.  Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game &amp; DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.
