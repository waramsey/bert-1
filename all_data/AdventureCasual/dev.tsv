5758	0	a	I personly liked the gameplay from the beginning. My only problem with this is game and the reason why i am still not going to play it is, that it has only support for some common screen resolutions but my 1280x1024 is still not supported. And nothing is more infuriating that playing with the wrong resolution. Don't get me wrong. I like it that you have improved and fixed a lot of stuff. But the only thing i am asking for is to get the resolution problem fixed.
2150	1	a	dinos spitting green â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giving electric shock with their teeth  would do LSD again 7/10
1062	1	a	I made a profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
5928	1	a	Buy it, this game is so much fun, despite a few minor bugs. First of all, what game have you played that lets you defend against a wave of dinosaurs that isn't crap? This game has so much fun in it for the 99 cents it costs.
4020	0	a	Sucks... Fun but gets boring
4819	1	a	This game has a bad reputation from previous and outdated builds. Its a ton of fun to pick up and play for a while.
2082	0	a	lags whit intel celeron 6/10
5212	0	a	Cool concept could be better
1857	0	a	This game does more than charge you 1 buck, it sucks the life out of you, if forces you to play this buggy â¥â¥â¥â¥ and charge you for it, and for those who played this on the free week, my harddrive is offended and tried suiciding after first launch. 10/10
859	1	a	It's just good clean... well not so clean, beat em' up murder and mahem. This reminds me of a classic sidescrolling beatemup game that you would find in an arcade, except it's on my compter, and it oozes blood from every orifice.
2811	1	a	10/10 - Best game ever. Must buy, the gameplay is amazing, the mechanics are perfect. Everything right down to the core of the game has been refined for your pleasure by these loving indie developpers. Support these great people by buying this game.
4832	0	a	not even worth 99p its the worst game that i have  
2508	1	a	this game is bad really its not that good at all but when i baught it for a dollor it was amazing its just one of those games you have to play with friends a bunch of people killing dinos thats what u get it would also help if you turned of your brain a bit theres numerous issues that pop up but all in all for a dallor it was 100% worth it
4694	0	a	50% terrible 25% hard 25% nothing 0% need to buy this game
5711	1	a	The ten minutes I played was completely worth the Dollar. Seriouslly, it's a dollar, It has dinos, you have tons of game modes.  Did I mention its a dollar Like 1 dollar I had fun
1735	1	a	Groovy, hip and radical.
6570	1	a	fun, but laggy i also wish the weapons were permenant but nope they are not permenant at all. 
70	1	a	is rly good  No but really, This is an amazing collection of games that if you need to pick up if you haven't played them yet.They are my favorite games from this company and for 20 USD its a steal
5863	1	a	Honestly i dont see why some many people dont like the and why its beeing considered the 'worst game ever' i had lots of fun alone and with friends. I bought it like 10 times and giftet it to friends because i think its great. And for 0,50$ i dont see a reason why not to buy it  
5727	1	a	I AM TUROK!!!
2378	1	a	People say they will dream dreams, dinosaurs are no dreams they're are here, among us in the shrubbery what will you do when they attack? probably die but this game defies everything humans have ever said, ever. this is no review this a witnessed revolution, a game to end all games with a higher metascore than ingame weapons these dinosaurs arent just messing around they're here for the ketchup and brown sauce and it doesn't seem like they're going to leave the mayo with out it. I think im done here, ironic isn't it..? this is the end and yet its only just begun.
5284	1	a	Its not suppose to be a award winning triple A game with amazing graphics and story. Just a simple, very fun horde mode sci fi fps with dinos. Its all up to how much fun you have with the game. Playing with buddies is a blast for me. If you are intrested, wait till the price drops and get it for you and your buddies.
646	1	a	This was a fun and reasonably easy game to master. The mythic poker system is more of a cross between solitaire and poker. The layout is solitaire, but the building of hands is very much poker. Royal Flush has the most value at 50 attack points. I like the way your runespells charge by both dealing damage and receiving it from enemy attacks. The story was reasonably engaging for what it was, and they left room for DLC or a sequel. All in all, a good way to kill 8 or 10 hours. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for fun, but an 8 or 9 as far as games you can play to kill time whne you are bored. Online play would be a natural evolution for this game. I hope they are considering the development of PvP matches.
2425	1	a	GET IT. PLAY IT. LIVE IT.
3217	1	a	Pretty Cool
5274	1	a	Super stupid fun, worth the I think.... 2 bucks I spent on a sale? Would not buy full price, there is just not enough content here. It is best played with a bunch of friends doing stupid stuff but don't try to play the Dino Vs Human, the dinos are so overpowered its no contest. A dino player can choose the massive dinos like the T-Rex and just maul a human with little effort while having a health bar that takes literally 6 mins to chew through, and the human objective is to collect eggs that every dino can just camp. Playing a small dino is pointless however, it is the compleat opposit with the exception of the exploding compy (a dino that somehow has a bomb strapped to it's back?), you get killed so fast from any weapon you have to get very lucky just to get an attack off. The flying dinos.... I don't know, I never figured out how to even attack with them. The Human vs CPU dinos is fun though, you have to go to objetives, get in vehicles, protect buildings, ect. There are jeeps, tanks, mechs, and I believe ATVs. Do not get stuck as a gunner on the jeep if it gets stuck in a wall though, there is a bug where you can't get out. It feels like a quirky unreal tourny vs dinos and you can pick perks to upgrade your humans.  Overall its a fun game if you can snag it on sale, play with friends and don't take the game serious at all.
6010	1	a	Orion is a wonderful game to occupy your time, always promising entertainment for you and your friends. Definately worth the $0.99.
4371	1	a	This is game is pretty good
2033	1	a	I've been holding off on writing a review for this game for quite a long time. I played it a few months ago, and, admittedly, it was less than stellar. If you were to ask me about the game at that point in time, I would have said it was garbage.  However, I don't know what happened, but this game is suddenly incredibly fun. Sure, the dinosaurs are kind of janky, and it's definitely too challenging to play on your own (bring some friends!), but there's something charming about it. It's just a loveable game. Quite fun, too!  I definitely recommend that anybody considering getting this game should get it. (At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.99 for like the 5th time, so I doubt this will happen again, but it may.)
3525	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
3553	0	a	Let me just start off by saying this game looked cool at first, but then i actually played it and boy was i wrong. First off all the weapon variation is absolutely abysmal, its either assault rifle that shoots chocolate covered marshmallows or a flamethrower that will give the dinos a slight tan equivalent to a nice day on the beach. The dinos look and behave like pidgeons that have been fed bread crumbs laced with weed. This game is absolute trash and writing this review was a huge waste of time as was downloading and playing this game. Having this game in my library disgusts me. Please remove this game from steam so that nobody has to go through playing this pathetic excuse for a game. If i were to sum up this game in one word, that word would be Pathetic.
480	1	a	Gameplay works, it's fun as hell and the powers are inventive. Your effectly 'The Thing' you able to perfectly replicate any person and your body can be shaped and twised into devestating weapons on the fly. Along with that, Movement is smooth and responsive, besides a few hiccups, it was after all one of the games that defined the super hero sandbox. The story, though bland gets the job done, but it's what had me stop playing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and worth the 20 bucks if you buy it not on sale, it's just I could not buy the protangoists 'anti-hero' angle the story was trying the sell me...which causes the rest to fall apart as they attempted to make the enemies you fight 'Blackwatch' so sterotypcially evil might as well give them snidely whiplash mustaches and kick puppies. To be fair I am only 13 hours into the game so I don't know how far I got into the story, but still..I am recomending it as game to buy..just that little problem I had with the story stacked up enough to where I didn't want to play anymore. Eh maybe someday I can come back and complete it.
2428	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ what a game for $0.99. I no â¥â¥â¥â¥ punched a T-rex in da face.
1070	1	a	Just bought the game the day before writing this review... I don't usually write reviews on such short play time however this is one of a very select few side scrolling platformers that have actually kept my interest...   1&gt; the little robot you control is absolutely friggin adorable...  2&gt; the gameplay is so smooth and clean...  3&gt; the graphics and sound are just crisp and clear... 4&gt; Great setting  A VERY WELL put together game... I bought it on sale for $1.29, buI feel it's definitely worth it's usual price tag if you are into the puzzle side scroll platformers... Similar games I'm also a fan of are: Limbo, Giana Sisters and Trine...
6548	1	a	Very great game!
1063	1	a	A real gem of a game, I haven't finished it yet but what I have played so far was really enjoyable. Even if it seems there won't be hours and hours of gameplay, what I have played so far is still incredibly fun and since the game is cheap, well worth it. I recommend this game!  (There was a slight bug at the start with screen size, but to fix this all you need to do is press ALT + Enter to go windowed)
6481	1	a	One of the best Co-Op shooters I have played in a long time.
5565	1	a	this is a fun game if your really bored and have nothing to do...
611	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ story, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics, but ign worth gameplay.
6218	1	a	Great banter, 10/10. Actually, you'll probably only have fun with some buddies in this but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it.
586	1	a	Prototype is a fantastic game, anyone who hasn't bought it I highly recommend you do.
5823	1	a	Unless you like to laugh at how bad the game is get it... However if you like to laugh at how good the game is get it.... just get it i mean its come on... it was only 99 centsssss
5257	1	a	A lot of fun, but has frequent framerate issues. Sometimes to the point of gamebreaking (may just be my computer though), but hey it's only a dollar. If you are playing with a controller, it can be unresponsive at times during the gameplay.
4547	0	a	This was a bad game, that was then a bad game under a different name, and it is still a bad game.
6180	0	a	Bought this game for laughs tried to get a refund and have not got a refund yet. (P.S THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE)
3020	1	a	It's 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollar.
5201	1	a	amazing such good graphics my comp can barely handle it lol
6225	1	a	I must say, this is a well constructed game with half-active servers even three years after publication. I would recommend Orion to anyone looking for a solid FPS PvE game. My only complaint is that sometimes there are glitches, other than that great game!!
3621	0	a	   The old metacritic score was 36.  
3635	0	a	For some reason, this game crashed my brand new computer twice...  Aside from that, I almost feel that there's a few things in the game that would make a world of difference in the game. The biggest thing is the music, because the music almost ruins the moment (that's just me though). Also, the controls I wish would have been universal with all the vehicles, but maybe I didn't play long enough to check.
5093	1	a	Nice game for low price :)
4603	0	a	The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly optimized and the graphics are complete garbage. Even for under a dollar (what I got it for) it isn't worth it.
2453	1	a	'I bought this so I could 360 no scope a Tyranosauras Rex. I was not disappointed.'  At the time, being a 74 cents purchase, it was definitely worth it.
5044	1	a	Dinosaurs and Jetpacks, what more can i say.
4214	1	a	I r8 8/8 no h8 plz no calls after 8 call me at 888-888-8888, plz sk8 to r8 n' don't b l8.
4817	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥in' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Even the dinosaurs it has doesn't make it even remotely playable. Overall Rating: -4/10
1419	1	a	I should buy this for my sweet sister Not a bad game 8/10
3758	1	a	This is my current stress buster. Do-op dinosaur shooting. Nothing else needs to be said really.
1141	1	a	This is a Indie 2d Platform Puzzle Video Game  I like this game to begin with it;s like a Mario game...  It's have some good soundtracks. Game has a very good tutorial how to play the game. It's not a really hard game to learn and pickup. Fun..... and gives you a good challange.  There are no achievment and some people will not like this. For me not a must have. It still haves trading cards... so you can make a badge !!  I give it a 7/10 score.
6313	1	a	Super fun game, worth way more than what it's priced at. A couple bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. So much fun to run around as recon stabbing â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a cryo blade.
5664	1	a	killed off chicken ancestors  11/10 would dino again
1876	1	a	Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.  I recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised.   The first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.  After tweaking controls and graphics options to my heartâs content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7.   After we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an 'open world' mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds).   The biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.
3282	1	a	Punched out a velociraptor. 10/10
193	1	a	Great game!!  Lots of variety in how you fight, what you upgrade...   My only problem is the PC controls. It's like they couldn't be bothered when it came to the PC, as it seems just about everything is linked to the E button (when there are so many other keys...). I'm trying to do my stun attack when instead, my character is trying to get into a tank (this happened 2-3 times in a row before I just decided to change attacks). Also, I'll often run up walls when I'm trying not to, pick up the wrong objects in the middle of a fight, target the wrong enemy... feels like it's a console game lazily ported to PC.   Still, good game and worth purchasing on a discount
3713	1	a	Stupid fun, everything a mindless shooter should be. At 99 cents it's a must buy.
2401	1	a	I'm not gonna lie. This game is terrible by all definitions. Animations are hilarious, perks are almost irrelevant, but it's so much fun that you'll overlook it's flaws and enjoy. Definitely at it's best with friends.
2316	1	a	Buggy game but â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents.
3436	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
5658	1	a	Today I ran over a pack of raptors with a jeep and rammed it into a t-rex before being tossed out of bounds and then proceeded to slowly crawl back to the map while shooting said t-rex with a revolver. 10/10 would ram again.
5477	1	a	Ok I clicked recommend but its right on the edge between good and bad. Yeah its only $0.99 but its only ok. The graphics are ok, the effects are kinda ok, and its only multiplayer(so it probely shouldve been free). But it has lost of fast pace action and can be fun. Its kinda worth the $0.99 but it wouldve been better free.
4212	1	a	Got it when it was on sale for $1. GREAT game for only $1. Idk if i'd give it a ten or anything...but for $1, it doesn't get much better. If full price (I can't see because I already own) is $25 or less, then I'd recommend it!
6417	1	a	Not the best game going, but i was plesantly suprised at how entertaing it was. If your running low on things to play or just want to pass a few hours give this a blast. On the flip side get to kill dino's in mech's and tanks whats not to like!!!!!
2171	1	a	Apart from some issues here and there, the game is great and fun and very cheap.
5462	1	a	Really great and fun game, tons of customization and frenzied action, as well as constant free DLC! Only downside is that you need a semi-strong PC to run it decently.

928	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
1581	1	a	Incredibly buggy, yet somehow really fun. Although the game is pretty broken I can't help but have fun killing dinos. Think kind of like Left 4 Dead survival mode, but like 100x dumber.
5842	1	a	So bad that it's good.Its hilariously basic and buggy.I love it for the atrocities.Its too dank.
2478	1	a	Great game to play with friends.
2858	1	a	i realy like pony's so i recommend this game
3005	1	a	:^}
1719	1	a	Like killing floor but with guns! 11/10
2445	1	a	Pretty cool game and also the option of getting Steam trading cards from it is awesome! Thanks VALVE!
3491	0	a	Couldn't play it. Shooting didn't feel sharp or even responsive. Also I paid a buck just to watch it go free, but whatever. Also, the devs are children.    No but seriously, they only use reviews written anonymously by some kids online in all their game trailers. Has anyone else noticed that?
2395	1	a	Maxiumum Immersion Game for max points  Immersion/10 would Immersion again.
5289	1	a	I tentativly would reccomend this to freinds its killing floor with dinosaurs 5/10 for me it has potential but it dosent use it
786	1	a	Reminds me of polished Amiga titles like Chaos Engine and Disposable Heroes. Noisy 3D shoot-em-up that gets quite difficult but challenges in a good way, best played with twin analog stick controller.
3030	0	a	this game is not great. but its not bad. i do not suggest this to people who have already played primal carnage. the only problem in my opinion is the concept. and the way the dinos play out. what i do love is the vast amount of species to play as and the NPC/BOTS they work well as balancing the teams
3249	1	a	fun game need decent harware to run not 100% friendly to new players but a great game in general thanks for the huge sale guys 99 cents awesome
5875	1	a	If you like: --- Dinosaurs --- Guns --- Jetpacks --- Cheap games --- Customizable characters --- Invisibility --- Elf hats --- Flying helicopters with rockets and miniguns --- Driving trucks with miniguns on their backs --- Shooting miniguns --- Being a dinosaur --- Sniping --- Knifing --- Shooting --- Big boom booms --- OR ANYTHING ELSE   you will love this game  p.s. you can be a dinosaur  100000000/10
1990	1	a	This game is woth 0,50 cents, wich is what I payed for it.
642	1	a	Runespell is a combination of RPG, Solitaire and Poker, similar in nature to Puzzle Quest. You stack cards like in solitaire to form 5 card poker combos to attack your foes and cast spells. It's fairly simple to play an so is the presentation. The story is based on Norse Mythology and while it's somewhat thin it does has its twists and turns. I found the gameplay enjoyable for the most part and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unfortunately, as the Overture in the title says it feels like a first part of something bigger, a second game that may never come out. That didn't upset me but can frustrate some people who got more invested in the story.
3527	1	a	A good game for being only 79p.
3105	1	a	I killed a T-rex with a knife. 11/10
5538	1	a	I have no idea what's going on  But hey it's a dollar.
2575	1	a	If you're a fan of Halo: Reach's FireFight mode and love shooting dinosaurs, then this is certainly your game.
587	0	a	Fun for a few hours...not much past that.
4240	0	a	Don't trust their newest propaganda people! This game still sucks! 1/10 Don't buy this. Please.
5329	1	a	This is basically Halo with dinosaurs. I never liked Halo, But this game is superfun mega challenge fantastic happy blood storm. With dinosaurs!
3273	1	a	FUGIN great a bit like CoD Zombies with DINOS
5846	1	a	Extremely fun for a 99c game, Ive already reccomended it ot a few friends  11/9 Got memed by a friend playing a Spino.
5583	1	a	CoD and Jurassic Park got married and had a child but then CoD divorced Jurassic Park and Star Wars become the stepfather.    0248329 WI5THNAJDBSFBESBEELZEBUB/10 IGN would get molested by a Trex again.
3141	1	a	It was a great game at first then i stopped playing then i played it again and i got addicted to again so its one of those games
4609	0	a	this game would be better if it werent just a plain wave survival game. theres no storyline ive found and it makes it boring fast
393	0	a	Don't buy it unless your PC has only 1 CORE WITHOUT MULTITHREADING Or if you want to spend all day on the BIOS configuring stuff for this game to work :/
4652	0	a	heretical,duisgusting,tainted, evil, divorced peice of dinosaur slaughtering sh*t. burn it all
5860	1	a	Bought a 4 pack when it went on sale from $15 down to $1 as they started promising huge updates.  Devs changed base price to $1.  Went from 25% off for $0.74 to 51% off for $0.49 in the last few minutes  11/10 great game plz buy my copies
4985	0	a	I THOUAD THE NEW ORION IS FOR FREE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ES
3241	1	a	Good game if its on sale.
6114	1	a	you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host you've lost connection to the host great game 10/10
3993	0	a	really bad game
662	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.
4141	1	a	The game is, ok. Its cool for about 5-10 hours then it gets old. If you like short, cheesey, repetitive games then u will love this game.
779	1	a	A decent, but safe and familiar, twin stick shooter that takes a little while to get interesting. The later levels are more fun and provide enough of a challenge to entertain me.  6.5/10
305	0	a	Wont start from first save. Modern Machine. 
1244	1	a	Unless you can get this for 19 cents like i did dont buy it
5327	1	a	This is quite an enjoyable game. From the amount of intense gameplay when your getting mobed by a pack of tiny dinos to the exitment of being in a giant walking mech and mowing down a bunch of dinos. Its fun left and right, The enviornments are very colorful and pretty, Wide open so you feel free in a sence, I highly reccomend this game.
2440	1	a	The game in it's current state is already awesome - can't wait for all the coming updates/upgrades!  You get to play in a team with 5 against a hell of a lot of dinosaurs! Coop-mode is great, and I really enjoy it. Also you can play many different game modes (1v1, Team Duel, FFA Duels and so on...) and you can even play dinosaurs! So, didn't you always want to play as a T-Rex and feast on your enemies? Come on, you know you wanted to! Now you can do it!  Players seem to be very friendly, and helpful towards beginners - at least that's my experience so far.  And since you create your own servers to play with friends (or find servers created by other players) ping is not an issue at all. And if there is no server with the game mode you want to play - just create your own.  The game is fun, and the graphics are nice. WASD-controlled and just like the other FPS-shooters you know, so I was able to hop in and start killing some mean dinosaurs right away. You also earn credits by killing dinosaurs, which you can spend to upgrade your weapons and/or abilities during the match. NOTE: Those changes are not permanent, and credits are earned over and over again every match.  About the metascore: That's total nonsense. The game is far better, maybe around 76 to 81. So just don't give a hoot about that.
5121	1	a	Gameplay like COD/Halo + Vehicles from StarCraft 2 + ArtStyle like Borderland = THIS AWESOME GAME and its more awesome with friends!
4952	0	a	I paid 79 cents on sale thinking I was getting a bargain. I ended up camping on a mountain shooting dinosaurs that looked like they were created by a DOOM modder high on bath salts.   Hey devs! Bragging about how much this game has improved since it's release is like bragging you have the best hygenie in every Wal-Mart you go to. You put a bow on a broken toilet and I'm not even mad.   At least I got most of my investment back from selling the cards.  
5213	1	a	Loved this game... not much more to say. Ya shoot dinosaurs and its loads of fun  9/10
3971	0	a	Well..It's a cool game and very cheap tho,but i found alot of bugs like kicking me out of the game at the end of the match and loosing the xp i got. FIX IT PLEASE ! ALSO I SPENT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DOLLAR ON IT NOW ITS FREE -.-
5743	1	a	THIS. GAME. IS. AMAZING. Its only what 99 cents? BUY THIS NOW!!!!!1!!!1!
2430	1	a	Probably the best game on the steam market   10/10
895	1	a	This game is really awesome  Sometimes its really hard to catch because many details on a 2D games
4018	1	a	this game gave me the biggest dino boner must have
4685	0	a	Don't even bother buying this game...
4415	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
5800	0	a	i dont care how many updates they had. this game isn't even worth 99 cents in my opinion
2931	1	a	What kind of game is this? A $0.99 Game. Can't argue with that logic.
5272	1	a	Drove head-on into a stegosaurus, exploded into a ball of flames. 10/10
2619	1	a	I saw the video, because i wanted to know what kind of game that is and... wow ... what can i say ... THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! The video was so good that i had to buy this. Everybody says that this game has bugs. I say this game IS a bug. But is not that the thing that makes the game funny ? 
1346	0	a	extremely annoying that this game does not have a windowed mode with lower resolution and graphics (for better alt + tab experience)
3898	0	a	a dollar is practically worthless and i still feel like i wasted money on this simplistic, boring, barely-a-game.
941	1	a	Another great successor of Klei Interactive (creators of first Shank and Mark of the Ninja). Great visuals, Amazing Soundtrack and Unbelievably enjoyable gameplay. If you are a hack-n-slash fan, pick it! beat-em-up fan? pick it! Like to chainsaw someone's face? Pick it! This game was intended for you! If you have a bloodlust desire, this game can grant your wishes :3 p.s. It's also have a co-op survival mode, worth checking out too
195	1	a	still best game, but i cannot understand why here are only 31 missions.. i mean prototype is best game ever i've played. i have all gold medals and like in assassins creed 100% sync.. is sad to see a good game very small in gameplay
4769	0	a	No. Just No. Not even for 99 cents.
5849	0	a	got boring real quick
1076	1	a	Fun little platformer with a nice physics engine, a nice combat and a very forgiving difficulty. At the current price it's a must have for all.
5690	1	a	Worth playing for just a buck especially with friends
3603	0	a	Your connection to the host has been lost.
6281	0	a	Terrible Game, Don't buy it.. get Primal carnage instead ;)
3504	1	a	Incredible game, only because it found a way to make Instagib completely uninteresting
6290	1	a	this is a really fun game hard but fun so if you like a fun shooter to play with your friends or on your own this is a nice one ^_^
502	1	a	AMAZING GAME, 'nuff said. It has full controller support. I mean, other than the loading bug, everything's pretty epic! Run up and across walls, glide through the air, alter your body to take on enemies and Military Vehicles, it's totally insane! I highly recommend this to any sandbox/action lovers, especially those of you that played SR4. Pretty interesting story, bits and pieces are unlocked as you consume targets. Disguise yourself and sneak into a military base today! (Or when it's on sale, which would be far preferable.)
5262	0	a	Shoot Dinosaurs as they skate towards you.
6045	1	a	Would 4-Pack my friends again.  Two pistols way, way up!
4401	1	a	its a nice game
5344	1	a	This is a good game if you like to kill dino, what else is there to say? Down with the zombie fad and long live the dino!
3522	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
1713	1	a	One of the best games I've playe in a while
3232	0	a	This game is not worth 99 cents. This game is not worth the time it takes to download, even on a fiber connection. This game is a finely glazed sewageloaf.
770	1	a	A non auto scrolling shoot em up, you can upgrade your walker and the overall artstyle is just wonderful!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFxigQPjygk 
6103	1	a	A decent game with a great community. Definitely worth the buy.
308	0	a	Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.
3678	1	a	Decided to try a Christmas map just to get blown up by a robotic santa wielding a rocket launcher   Will rematch Santa again
4543	0	a	Feels like an unfinished game. Tons of bugs, lack of content, and no balance. Not recommended.
3791	0	a	What ever you do. Dont you ever buy this Game. It was the worst Game I ever bought and I even bought a 4 Pack because I though wow Dinosaurs must be fun. The Release Version was unplayable. I mean the dinosaur killsound was a Civilian HL2 Death sound. The Game was in such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ state that they released the Game again 1 year later under another name? HOW BAD CAN YOU BE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR NAME. The Original started a meer riot in the Steam forums for refund. So dont buy this. just dont!
5473	1	a	I don't like it but with friends is funny. For less then 1 â¬ it deserve a recommended :)
4806	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥s this god damn game 
4595	0	a	I BOUGHT 4 PACK FOR 2 GAP!!! READ THIS ONLY IF YOU GET SIMILAR OFFER!!! I was not going to buy this game... Ever really. It first came to me when I saw WTF is... W/e this was named back then(considering it has changed name in my own inventory by now as well who can blame me for forgetting) Devs claim game now is better than it was. I don't really have a line of my own to compare it to. However I can compare it to my impression from what I saw years ago on WTF is... .  IT'S F|_|CKIN SAME!  Yup, it looks same. Anything with a wheel controls like â¥â¥â¥â¥. I saw nobody even try to use vehicles. Now guns.... Guns don't know what recoil is. I do... It took me a while to understand that they don't.   Ok, so no recoil, shity weapons,shity driving...  Shity... Dinos... Yes dinos ... I wont go in to AI ,or lack of it because there is some, I think it is borrowed from zombie/alien shooter. Dinos look terrible even for years ago they look terrible. Maybe my texture settings are not on high maybe res isn't that good (who knows? Oh right I and 3 of my friends cozz I bought 4 pack), but dinos and not only dinos, all visuals look like CRAP-â¥â¥â¥â¥ BUNCH OF OF IT SMEARED OVER EVERYTHING... Game looks grey even when it is not grey... If that was meant to be well then... Why do I say though that dinos look like crap? Well reason is simple: I played Dino Crisis on PS1 long ago. Those looked better. Heck I replayed it on epsxe couple years ago it still looked good. 15-20 years later (aprox.) this comes out and it looks worse. Something is wrong there.  Now I did say 2 things here First that I bought 4 pack of this so one game cost me 0.5 gap... About 0.8 suds each. Currently it is priced at 0.79gbp per 1 and 1.99 per 4 At this price you might as well buy it because: it is fun TEAM shooter where you and your team of friends will have fun. Co-op mode is the only viable mode here(do note however there are plenty of good coop games out there but this one is OK for a weekend or two)   HOWEVER that said  Second thing I said was that alien or zombie shooter has similar AI... As in it always goes towards you... IT IS HORDE SHOOTER SAME AS THIS. With many big significantly important things to keep in mind: Singleplayer, Story, Survival, Turret modes, upgrades, drop upgrades, perm upgrades, progression system shall I even continue?(no) so I'd suggest if you aim for single player or lone wolf experience... Spend 10.99 on zombie or alien shooter and play that...  Or hell better yet...  http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/  it is free And due to this I do not recommend this game
3252	0	a	Crashes on starting/joining, also in-game store is dull. Also it is not on Early Access. Money well spent.
3754	1	a	Well, i have played fora couple hours now, and i must say... ITS AWESOME. yes there are glitches, i came across 2 in my playtime but it was not to bad. i really enjoyed this game i mean what other game lets you fight dinos in a mech suit?
6095	1	a	Really enjoyed this game. It has a good idea with dinosaurs!
3908	0	a	Not worth the money
80	1	a	Once a janitor, always a janitor!
216	1	a	i've had this on my wish list for alot of time and i wasn't sure i was gonna get it... but holy crap i'm glad i did. it has a interesting story and freeroam, which makes for fun to run from building to building. i'm not to far in but i all ready know when i finish it. i'm buying the 2nd one.
5240	1	a	I bought this game for $49 - oops, I mean $0.49 - you fight waves of dinosaurs. You can use a pistol to kill them. Or two pistols. Or machine pistols. Or shotguns. Or sniper rifles. Or LMG's. Or SMG's. Or a grenade launcher. Or a rocket launcher. Or a bow and arrow. You can place turrets. Gun turrets, rocket turrets or flamethrower turrets. You can drive over the dinosaurs. You can shoot them with rockets from aerial vehicles. It's bloody brilliant, and for 1 dollar you cannot get better value for money! I've only played co-op with a friend, and it was insane amounts of fun! Buy it, this game is a steal!
2107	1	a	Fighting dinasaurs with a lightsabre in a halo suit with â¥â¥â¥â¥ animations, 10/10 ign would never play again
452	1	a	Man aids gets real bad in the future. It gives you god damn super powers.
4556	0	a	every time i enter an online game it clips me in the ground and i dont see a menue or hear sound or even a person walk around
3073	1	a	This game is so dumb that it is fun!
2282	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde -the game has bugs -the game is laggy -the graphics is not so good but they are okay +fun in singleplayer and multiplayer +fun with friends +good price  it gets a 6.5/10
2971	1	a	Played singleplayer Got eaten by a T-REX  Played multiplayer pwnt everyone   10/10
5368	1	a	I LOVE IT, just wish more people played it.
3448	1	a	ridiculous fun and only a dollar how have you NOT bought this
5642	1	a	So much fun, I foresee hundreds of great hours ahead of me
466	1	a	One of my all time favourite games. Sequel is also very good. Extremely enjoyable gameplay, doesn't shy away from making you overpowered. But keeps it interesting. Great concept behind it. Kind of like some kind of venom/carnage character. My vote for 'Needs another sequel' award in the steam nominations. A sequel nearly ten years on would be unbelievable.
1466	1	a	It's nice.
6000	1	a	Very interesting game :)
111	1	a	There's just something special about a game where you can pick up a car and run down the sidewalk, tossing people around like bowling pins.
4639	1	a	Nice game
6368	1	a	Many dinosaurs are in this game, your job is to make sure there are less by the time you return to your desktop.
6227	1	a	cool cool.
3116	1	a	Great fun. Smiting dinosaurs with a rocket launcher while jetpacking across the battlefield is the meaning of life.
701	1	a	This game has a simple card playing mechanic where you play poker against an enemy to win. Powerups and collectible cards also help with gameplay and has an RPG style story that's interesting. A casual game that's easy to pick up and get addicted to. Great little game overall.  
527	1	a	Play it for the story or just to go on a homicidal rampage. You can grab people and run up the sides of buildings, hold them over the edge and watch them struggle before you either A consume them with your tendrils or B chuck them hundreds of feet, leap over the edge and freefall to the sidewalk, then just tear up the city just cause if you did that in real life while awesome, most people frown upon it. Run through traffic vaulting over cars and flip throw one at an elderly person. Why? Cause you can
2410	1	a	As soon as I bought this game, I've non-stopped played it for alsomt 6 hours. It is so much fun and so addicting. I recommend this to everyone who loves first person shooter games. This game is better than most of my $50 games and I got it for $15!
4432	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super Â£10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
4094	0	a	its super slow to connect to servers, even EA's servers are way better tha this game's servers. (i have good internet)
6353	1	a	Awesome fun FPS for some quick n dirty fun with friends :). Seems like the game mechanics may be broken (or lack thereof), but in a good way that makes it fun.
2335	1	a	I love this game for many reasons 1. I love first person shooters that are also action packed and just fun to play, 2.I love love love this game because of the dinosaurs just really DINOSAURS I have only once seen a game like this I especially love to be dinosaurs in one of the gamemodes and 3. Its multiplayer for the whole world to enjoy and its a strategy game or if you play on the gamemode where your a dino and your a dino by yourself just eat people overall this is one of the best games so far and i cant wait for its future peace out 
806	1	a	Shank is like ramboo.  -fast paced game thats full of action , story is too short and quick to be judged , you feel that theres no story at all. -the artwork in this game is fairly decent. -this game is sort of too short , you may finish up with the main story in 4 hours~ -if you're intersted in action combos , trying different weapons and moves , you may like this game. -well , theres also multiplayer in it , which may extend the fun from this game to afew more hours.  In general , this game is not bad , not worth the full price i recommend buying it during sales or bundles. 6/10.
4969	1	a	the game is easy to play and and looks like halo with dinosaurs i would recomend for the killing beast type of person
959	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
3093	1	a	this game is amazing , it's so addicting , 'now you are looking at my playtime , hmh only 1.1h atm' ,  but I know I will be playing this game alot more ! , It's like halo , but with fckn DINOSAURS.... Like if you like Halo, and surprisingly Like Dinosaurs also , then this is the BEST game for you ! , like damn. this price for such an amazing game ... It's just MADNESS , MADNESS I TELL YOU!
3487	1	a	  Nutshell Review:  
1472	1	a	The robot from Sealab 2021 has to kill other robots and collect gold nuggets.   Delightful game.
3063	1	a	I don't know how this game got 36/100 i love it, me and my friends play it daily!!!
4093	0	a	Intersting concept, but not very polished.
882	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
769	1	a	Major fun especially on a HDTV with a controller. The game is so fun and the graphics are quite good for a game of this price. I'd definitely recommend this game. I'd like to see a sequel.
6243	1	a	Really good concept, great idea, but the execution in the game was pretty bad. It's still in progress, and needs fixing, but it's a blast to play with friends!
2177	1	a	i bought it for 99 cents now its on sale for 49 cents i feel ripped off     just kidding get this game! ITS WELL WORTH IT
2205	1	a	So much fun, so worth it, 5 man co-op is the best. Buy now
1784	0	a	This is such a bad game I cannot put it down. It has the crappiest programming, the weirdest glitches, the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest bugs, and the worst possible sound. With that said, it is addicting to watch giant alligaitors with painted on eyes crawl around you in circles.
1605	1	a	I know that the first version of Dino Horde didn't get very good reviews, and many people pass this game up because of that. The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.  Edit: This review is for dino horde. Prelude is a terrible game; the creators messed up big time.
1287	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
4171	0	a	this game always crashes
330	1	a	Became an old lady take a machinegun and shoot everyone   11/10
1284	0	a	Mario-like platformer and I hate Mario.
4381	1	a	A game in which 4 or 5 players hold out against a horde of Dinosaurs and the occasional giant crocodile in maps ranging from forests to even an icy hell landscape. Dinosaurs range from the classic T.rex to the Stegosaurus . If you liked Left 4 dead then you will love ORION (The T.rex throws giant rocks just like the tank)
5782	1	a	After reading the negative reviews I was amazed at how far the level of stupidity could go.  I bought this game only yesterday and since then this game has been a pure pleasure to play. For only 1$ I have to say, not only is one of the most cost efficent games I know of but this game is a hell lot of fun. You go around either freezing dinos with your medic gun/healing gun or you could go full Arnold mode and just shoot the dinos and **** them over. This is an amazing game, survive endless hordes of dinos, eventually you can buy new guns and upgrade and get new perks. Overall I will give this is game a 10/10 not only because of the value, but the fun and happiness it brought me.  It has some cool â¥â¥â¥ glitches and bugs as well, such as driving on a charging stegosaurus and flying 20+Meters up.
2477	1	a	99 cents, shoot dinos with yor friends, bring me some pizza.
4729	0	a	Is it worth $.99? Sure. Is it worth your time? No
3568	0	a	paid money for this now its free to play no refund now â¥â¥â¥â¥ trek industries i mean it only costed me 50 cents but tose are 50 cents i could have spent for another game that its what5 gets me mad trek industries sucks
1025	0	a	This game it a bit broken... Its not possible to set the key mapping yourself and you are forced to use the arrow keys instead of the WASD. It is bought in steam but registered in Origin (?) THis is abother EA fail game... Same for CNC4 and Mirror Edge.    4/10
387	0	a	&gt; Repetitive Gameplay  &gt; Boring Story  &gt; Good Level Design  &gt; Compatent Optimization  &gt; Gross Textures  Not even worth it for free.
6263	1	a	A very fun game and for $0.99. This is 100 out of 100
822	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
5236	0	a	Not good. Just not good. Don't buy it.
3703	0	a	Eh. If you like the site of dinosaurs, this might be for you. Otherwise eh.
4201	1	a	Easily the best game for $1,it is just a buck..... buy it already.......
4296	1	a	EPIC. worth definetly more than 1 dollah...it has some small bugs in the movement of dinosaurs but the game its still improving so...ive seen bigger games with serious bugs so i dont see why so much hate the game actually has good graphics(unreal engine),fun gameplay(coop againts the dinosaurs and deathmatch are the two main types),and nice soundtrack...sometimes it reminds a bit of borderlands...so if u wanna have fun with your friends other than homo-pillow figthing u have to buy this one...its 1 dollah..seriously now...1..
2199	1	a	Fight a spitter from Jurassic Park with a Warthog from Halo.
2448	1	a	Awesome game just a little bit laggy and not sure if it's my computer but it has bad motions like running and walking which made me a little bit dizzy when playing :P
561	1	a	What Mirror's Edge's parkour should have been + Spiderman 2 + Slurping Random Innocents = Good game 10/10
3468	0	a	This game was a waste of $0.99 It's that bad.
3502	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.  But god damn what a f**king lie that was because the entire game is executed so badly, the high expectations that it set itself begin to smolder into a pile of broken Alpha-testing nonsense, yet this is DEVELOPED and RELEASED at that. Going to mesh two good games together is aiming to pull alot of fans of both types of genres and when you invoke such f**king power words like that, you need aim well and aim high to appease both audiences because the bar has been as such by those previous titles. But oh man, you guys pulled a number on me good, man.  (You might as well sub out the 'Halo' bulls**t and replace that with 'Tribes', because that is the only thing that screams to me besides halo. A bad Tribes clone with dinosaurs.  Every gun in the game has around a 100ms delay for firing and for hitting a target, so you have to probably calculate the Coriolis effect before you hit anything thats more than 50 f**king meters away from you and it's worse if it's in the sky.   Everything feels like its clunky and runs like its just an amalgamation of crap, and the fact that when youre playing and you die from...oh lets see.. a f**king pterodactyl immediately lifting you off with no regard or warning, or a couple of small dinosaurs that you cant even see because the grass texture is so tall and its dispersion is not very good whilst the dinosaurs in question are hidden in plain sight until you're on your back pockets bleeding out attempting to shoot at them to revive.  Theres another thing, the dinosaurs. The pinnacle of this game is the dinosaurs, right? Wrong. That couldnt be more far off from the truth. Because you might as well be fighting newborn babies in the form of giant lizards that are radioactive to the touch. You wont know that youre getting hit because the animations for your foes are so terrible that when they do them its literally NOT what theyre actually doing. ------ Example: Dinosaur walks up and is right in front of your face and you just hurt terribly for some reason, no animation, no nothing its just a roomba moving at you with dinosaur legs attached. You move away and eventually it begins to do an animation for a bite in your face that does nothing, until you stop then you begin hurting because the vacuum is back on again.  Example 2: Be me and my friend, on a boulder next to a cliff with a tree on it, stegosaurus walks towards us and looks at us and and a floor stomping animation sends us up into the air out of nowhere but the dinosaur did nothing but look at us. It could have farted and I'd believe it at this point. Then it raises its front legs to stomp us because im right infront of its face it would definitely hit me again. It lands and nothing even happens, we didn't even move. What?   Man I'm already tired of thinking about everything in this game that I encountered that im not going to continue much on this anymore. In the THIRTY SIX MINUTES that I played I encountered so many things that would put me off of it I wouldnt even consider replaying this until they redo it entirely. (OH WAIT YOU DID THAT?) Well too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.
29	1	a	This series is over thirty years old now. You know what you're getting into.
3404	1	a	Bad optimized.. freezes on i7 4712MQ + Geforce 940M, where GTA V works on high settings.. But it's fun to play! :)
3283	1	a	$0.99, Why not??
3034	0	a	no reason to play as dino when assault class can just sit on walls w/jetpack out of reach with infinite ammo pistols
2075	0	a	This game Ä°s not fun it looks fun but its not you just cant do anything fun. The dinos are pretty crappy and the classes are not interesting. I would have never bought this game if it wasnt on a steam sale.
2886	0	a	If I didn't get it for only 99cents I might feel some serious buyer's remorse. Definitely not worth $15.00 let alone the 99cents. Clunky controls, unpolished game-modes, cookie-cutter builds, and shoddy environments.
99	1	a	Really good game. Not as unknown as it was when I bought it because of its sequel, but still quite underrated. It has a decent story, despite it's about a failed experiment/mutated people/zombies. I really liked that, unlike the other games about that topic, you are an infected one, and not a survivor, but even the infected ones tryto kill you. Basically, you're a solitary overpowered mutant that everyone wants dead and doesn't remember who he is and has to consume targets that have memories about that to remember it. It has a quite good graphics ( considering it's a 2009 game) and a good gameplay. The only thing, it gets quite repetitive when all you have to do is to infiltrate in military bases, destroy zombie hives and machines that emit poisonous fog, but at the start and at the end the missions are more interesting. On easy it's reaaally easy, as you are an overpowered mutant capable of regenerating consumating people or infected ones, taking other people's appearence, running on walls , making your limbs become weapons, stealing tanks, ecc... After you have completed the main quest if you want you can play another time without having to unlock everything you unlocked during the first time.
557	1	a	A great action game. Fast, fun and a really interesting plot
5485	1	a	When i first saw this game I thought 'This looks okay, lets check it out... 79p? Lets try it out, if it sucks then i lost 79p which isn't a great deal' but wow, this game is great! Much better than COD GHOSTS if I'm honest.
6266	1	a	all im asking was this game realeased on 2014 or 2012 because it says orion dino beatdown was in 2012 and orion dino horde was in 2013 so im confused
1668	1	a	Worth It
242	0	a	That's not compatible with windows 10 please don't buy it
249	0	a	Crash on load. The game is a literal non starter.  Win 7 - 64 i7 - 3960X 32GB GTX 780 Ti SLI(2)  
2710	1	a	99 cents to shoot dinosaurs, and get more updates than DayZ will ever have.  10/10 Devs WILL update again &lt;3
4120	0	a	TL;DR: Fun for the first hour or two, but was controversial, and is unoptimized, even after more than 3 years of development.  So this game has been the subject of plenty of controversy for over 3 years. Released multiple times with different names such as Orion: Dino Beatdown and Orion: Dino Horde. Then it was also part of another controversy as far as theft of assets. But let's get off that and into the actual game.  You basically survive wave after wave of killing dinosaurs, while completing the occasional objective or two as the match goes on. You can do this on your own, but it's usually more fun to play with people. It's rather fun, if you like having no challenge, as dinosaurs can easily be unable to get to spots on many of the maps, making it easy to exploit them. This is because of how easy it is to get to some places with the Assault's jetpack, but even then, you wouldn't have too many issues with the normal dinos if you were another class, due to how horrid the AI is. The flying dinosaurs are hardly any issue either, as they don't take too much to kill. This effectively drives any fun in the game extinct unless you like potshotting giant reptiles.  I had some fun with this game, worth the 1 dollar I spent on it, but to be quite honest, I have no faith in the devs at this point, and I doubt this game is going to become much better at all, as much of an unoptimized mess that it is.  But hey, now you can kill derp dinos for free.  You'll get some fun out of it, but don't expect too much more than what you get in perhaps the first hour or two of playing.
1631	1	a	this game is about jeff goldblum in space
3885	1	a	This Is Just TOO AWESOME GAME!!!!!  +Plenty Of Weapons +You Can Play With friends +Vehicles +Many Difrend Maps +Too Much dinosaurs +Good Graphics +It's Only 0,99$ Game  -Soldiers -Soldiers Riding On Dinosaurs -Some Tiny Glitches -You Must To Pay Real Money For Hats  Questions:  Does It Have Voice Chat?    Something Else To Say:  Don't Look Comments JUST BUY IT Its An Epic Game  10/10
5553	0	a	It crashed after 9 minutes.
625	1	a	If you really want to play something without a hard story, because your life too stressing and you only want to destroy things with amazing powers an movements out of this world, this game is for you. Sprint or fly into in a free world map (of NY), make parkour or destroy everything at your way; it doesnÂ´t matter at all, but you can also make a buch of secondary missions or follow the main story of a prototype of a superhuman who accidentally drop a super toxic virus and thatÂ´s why the whole US goverment is trying to chase him.
3156	1	a	This is a good game, I only have 5 or so hours in it and in that time I found it a fun game to mess around in and not take serious. Didn't find any bugs or problems while playing.  Lot of content to keep you happy from a large selection of weapons, vehicles and dinos and classes.
1671	1	a	I realize this game has gotten a bad reputation from it's alpha stages, and people don't like how they changed the name to avoid ridicule. But WOW! It's improved a TON! I don't see why anyone could complain about such a well done FPS Dinosaur game- Freaking Dinosaurs man!!!! I love the game mechanics, and the multiplayer is surprisingly solid. By far the best game I've played seen on steam. So many weapons, vehicles, upgrades, perks and maps make this game a HUGE online experience that everyone should have the opportunity to play. Almost flawless, and still coming out with updates, I think Spiral developers are some of the greatest developers out there! Keep doing what you're doing guys!
3797	0	a	This game is the worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have ver seen. The creators should literally take the computers they made this with and shove it up their asses. 10/10
4514	0	a	Horrible
864	1	a	Some ok 2D action
3829	1	a	Halo and Borderlands had a lovechild with Turok. It has lots of flaws but its fun with friends, and its only a buck.
6549	1	a	This game is surprisingly awesome. It's like Turok and a weird TD had a child and that child was slightly antisocial but once you get to know him he is actually pretty cool.
1294	0	a	Nope even though i bought it under 1 Euro, it was not worth it..... Even if it would be free, it would not be worth it....
2785	1	a	Great game 9/10 the 1 problem i do have is the lag 
2918	1	a	its halo....its turok....its awesome! love this game if you buy it let me know ill play!!
5131	1	a	Best Game on PC loving every minunte would pay 50 times the actual price for it
4178	1	a	Bought it on sale for 1 dollar basically. I think this game deserves more credit but...BUT that constant running back and forth between the point you have to protect and the weapon station is a hugeeee pain. Even if you use the teleporter or use vehicle. It's still a hugeeee pain. There's no incenditive for people to play medics because they don't have rocket boost jet, their medic gun needs charge every now and then, and on top of that, the dino seem to be programmed to go after medics. Plus medic doesn't get as much credit as these other units so what the heck, who wants to play medic -.-  anyways, despite that, for 1 dollar, definitely get it. The server system are unstable and there are still bugs that freeze the screen but for 1 dollar, you can't complain. :)
3047	1	a	Killed a triceratops by stabbing it in the legs multiple times with a futuristic kitchen knife. 10/10
753	0	a	Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this game. Nothing about it...let me emphasize that again... NOTHING about it is good. NOTHING.
1623	1	a	good game for the price of a biscuit from popeyes  biscuit/10
1849	1	a	I love it the game never gets old always finding fun ways to play this :P i love da game
774	1	a	Great graphics, great gameplay, balance, controls and amazing soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best schmups ever made. They really need to make Gattling Gears 2 soon!   5 Stars!
761	1	a	There should be really more of those games. An adventure game with nice puzzles, not to hard and a capturing story line. I really enjoyed the time spent on trying to kill Hitler.
3236	0	a	Wtf, it's not even worth a dollar
683	1	a	Awesome game, much like Puzzle Quest, and really engrossing take on the standard RPG. The card combat may take some getting used to, but it is well worth it. The art, the mechanics, and the feel of this game are highly recommended.
427	1	a	Overall a fun game.    The story is basically resident evil.. virus outbreak although unlike it you are insanely overpowered even on hard diff..    I like the fact that you fight both the military and the infected however the AI on the military is just sad you can literally do the most insane â¥â¥â¥â¥ right in front of them and they won't react never mind the fact that you are obviously not human or that you are supposed to be a 'priority target' even if you do get in trouble you can kill all of them or evade them without much of a struggle.    The infected are even less of a threat then the military. Once you learn the move set of the enemy they become closer to tedious then to a challenge including what is supposed to be bosses which just take more time to kill and are still easy to evade sins you are extremely fast.    Apart from the protagonist characters somehow don't feel complete.    The gameplay is pretty cool. Basically you are very fast and agile. Most of the time you will be jumping from one rooftop to another. Has a good variety of weapons and powers and you can even steal tanks and helicopters from the military and use them to your advantage. The stealth system is just about the only thing i dislike in the gameplay sins all the NPC's are blind, deaf and suffer from a rare disorder in which their mind goes blank and forget everything every 5 seconds or they might as well be in a coma.    I'd go ether way with the recommendation depends on what you want to play.  Even with all the issues it has it is still fun to go fight endless waves of enemies and see how long you are going to last. That is until you learn how to heal up fast and that the waves are not actually endless...
4312	1	a	ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!! IN SPACE, WITH SHARKS! ITS A BALLS OUT DINOSAUR LASER FIGHT!!!  ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SCIENCE, JUST ASK ALBERT EINSTEIN! (HE INVENTED SPACE)
1972	1	a	A sci-fi, dinosaur, fps for only 79p; what's not to like? But seriously, this game has everything from character customization to tanks vs t-rex's, I love it!
6038	1	a	First game I was 'forcefully removed' from a 'NOOB' level server on my very first game. Graphics are dated and not optimized, however the game is fun for 99 cents. I recommend for a dollar nothing more.
1970	1	a	Modern Human Technology vs Colossal Primitive Lizard was a best war ever!!! But I more like old name: 'Orion: Dino Beatdown'
4357	1	a	Water baed lubricant? Orion prelube.
4921	1	a	I pay the game dafuq now its free :v jeeez
5292	1	a	t rex bit my face off. the bite scores a 5 but the game scores a solid 7.
5900	1	a	when i was testing it i became a t rex then killed someone and he flew out of the map..........         10/10 BOI
717	1	a	If you like Alternative RPGs, this is a greeeeaaat one, as good as puzzle quest 1, different though. cool game,.
1698	1	a	I loved this game even before it got good.

44	1	a	I only played SQ2 back in day, so I decided to pick up this collection on sale. Pretty enjoyable classic comedy adventure games, totally worth the price.  Being pretty old, I wanted to post these tips on how to play these games with optimal graphics and particularly sound/music. 1. If you plan to play the games in DOSBox,  SierraHelp.com  has a patch for the collection that sets up a newer copy of DOSBox than is included (highly recommended), adds configuration programs that are missing, tweaks configs for optimal graphics and sound, and adds shortcuts that launch the games in DOXBox. Highly recommend only for SQ6 BECAUSE... 2. Space Quests 1 - 5 are supported by ScummVM, and it's by far the easiest/best way to play them. Saving and loading games come with screenshots and unlimited slots. Speed bugs are fixed. Runs efficiently and natively on a number of platforms. Even adds mouse support to SQ2. ScummVM will warn you if you patch the games as mentioned above; I had to revert the patch to get through SQ5. 3. Graphics and sound effect settings are handled optimally by default with either of the above choices. 4. Music gets a bit trickier to do 'right'. General MIDI/SoundFont can be chosen to taste, but most games created at the time targetted two top-tier music modules: the Roland MT-32 and later the Roland SoundCanvas.  A) SQ2 is the oldest, and supports PCjr/Tandy 3-tone sound in addition to PC speaker. You can try both settings in ScummVM to hear the difference. Default is the better Tandy mode.  B) SQ1 remake, SQ3, and SQ4 were composed for the MT-32. ScummVM comes with MT-32 emulator that is nearly spot -on. You need to add a couple ROM files to your ScummVM to enable this, Google for details. You'll see a 'INSERT BUCKAZOID' message once you have it working. C) SQ5 and SQ6 were composed for SoundCanvas/General MIDI. You can use FluidSynth in ScummVM with a SC SoundFont or one of your choice. For DOSBox, you'll need to add a software MIDI driver to you system. Virtual MIDI Synth is recommended, and their website is a good place to get SoundFont recommendations.  A little bit of effort can give you the best experience playing these Sierra classics.
1944	0	a	This game is pretty repetive. I can not see anyone enjoying this unless they are playing with friends. And only enjoy it for a day at the most.
2118	1	a	ORION: Prelue manages to take the best parts of some of the greatest games of all time. From the overall aesthetic of Halo, to the scale and sense of wonder of Shadow of the Colossus. O:P takes these, and mixes them with the surreal pleasure of shooting DINOSAURS. ORION: Prelude is, simply put, the greatest game of all time, and the fact that it is only $1 means it is accessible to the general population. If you don't own this game, you owe it to yourself, your fellow man, and even the concept of artwork in general to play this game.
3335	1	a	Worst game that I've ever played and I like it for that! The glitches in this game make it a hilarious game to play with your friends, especially if you like derping around and breaking the games. Obviously, it's not going to be a masterpiece as you only pay 0,99â¬ for it, but I think it's definetily worth trying at least!
4642	1	a	this was surprisingly worth the dollar i payed for it
2398	0	a	Good game, now return my money.
4631	0	a	birth controll should have been considered
4690	1	a	this game is so fun! i could just shove it up my butt yaa its that great!!! :)
4282	1	a	Started off as dino beatdown which was filler at best but i did spend a couple hours on that. Then it turned into its 2nd form Dino Horde and it was a lot better and I spent more hours playing that. And now its it's in its 3rd form and it has vastly improved since the very beginning. So say what you want about the game but when you sell it for $1 and STILL consistently upgrade the game on this level, then you have to give the develpers mad props.
3806	1	a	  game is 1$ why write a bad review also its rly fun with friends
374	0	a	The Prototype 1 Better game but  i wait for prototype 2 but now it took me feel bad for that game   
3824	1	a	nice but i cant run it on may pc :( but its ok this game is good :D
5569	1	a	My system is moderatley-okay, and can run most games on mid-high mixed settings, but this unoptomized lemon gave me 3fps and made me re-think my life choices.  3/10 would not buy
329	0	a	This is a good game on ps3 so I figured id buy it again for pc... this game sucks on pc its buggy the resolution makes everything widescreen the keys are laggy and sometimes unresponsive (usually during important times or right after a pause) story wise its a good game &amp; theres more cutscenes in the pc version but overall I can't recommend it.
3114	0	a	I got this game for .48 cents and I still feel like I paid too much.
2055	1	a	An okay game for 99 cents, though it doesnt feel anywhere near complete
1803	1	a	Hey itâs pretty fun!  The game is actually pretty fun. By now itâs really damn straight worth one dollar. I like the sun lighting in the game as well as the ability to upgrade your character and use weapons like sentry guns and rocket launchers to mow down waves of enemies. The game does have some downsides as it's still kinda buggy.  Now the âconquestâ game mode is something to have a lot of fun about. Try beating that before you leave the game. The game gets even more fun when you level up your character and start spawning with weapons that you would normally have to buy. I also like the fact that you can customize your armor style and give yourself a hat and a cape so that you can look like a badass when fighting dinos. It gets pretty fun in high level games.  The only downside to this game is that it's still kinda buggy. They aren't too much of a bother to me.
1928	1	a	u kill dinos      thats cool
2912	0	a	This game is absolute garbage, whoever wrote those quotes were either psychotic or a moron. I got this game fo 99 cents and I overpaid, if I could take this game and wipe my â¥â¥â¥ with it I wouldn't. Because it is to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for even my â¥â¥â¥. 0.01/10
3913	0	a	all hail the lag king of all my games with no lag love u counter strike as for u prelude 1st place for lag and terrible quality and great lag u done it this time guys
2438	1	a	It got the ''feel'' of a good game, can't explain. GET IT
5178	1	a	Now i Know how the dinosaurs disapperd :3
5154	1	a	Dinosaur game for $0.49, why the hell not?
3210	1	a	This game is the most fun I have had in ages. I was sceptical at first because it is so cheap but MAN was I wrong. This game combines everything you could want. FPS, upgrades, cool guns, dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, hovercrafts, jetpacks... Do I need to go on? It is MULTIPLAYER!!
2249	1	a	such an amazing game! love it, best dino game ever. Right now in my 'Never delete' folder. Tundra map music is so beautiful  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U15YpjIMRjE)

340	0	a	Doesn't Work. Want my money back. 2 gtx 670s and intel i7 3930k cpu and 32gigs of ram. Can run almost any game on the face of the planet yet activison and steam is telling me it's my rig. Well I'll suggest save your money and do not buy prototype. Interesting enough second one works. maybe a different studio i don't know. Prototype 2 isn't as good as the first imo.
3936	0	a	An F U to people that bought the game
1638	1	a	I had no idea what to expect going into this game. Had it gifted from a friend since IT'S $0.99 RIGHT NOW!!! Turned out to be a riot. You could take it seriously if you wanted to, but it's more fun to treat it like halo with dinosaurs in it. I mean, come on. I can't think of a reason not to buy this game, especially for a buck.
6194	1	a	Good game but it has some fps issues.
5740	1	a	This game is really entertaining and simple to play You kill dinosaurs and hoard weapons and vehicles As for the story... there is no story. Great for playing with a couple of friends just for fun. Play by yourself if you have no friends, but game is still fun. I mean c'mon it's less than $1! Blew my expectations when I tried
5069	1	a	Stalin approved.
2620	1	a	Triceratops flipped my tank 2000ft in the air and killed itself  11/10
2325	1	a	Great game.
5895	1	a	For 99 cents this game is amazing.
2612	1	a	Awesome game to play over lan with your friends
6105	1	a	A fast-pace co-op FPS. Can't praise graphics, but it's not what this game is about, the picture is just about what is needed to keep on going. The action, however, is AWESO-O-O-O-ME!
5216	1	a	An amazing Co-op experience for up to (I believe 10 players). Wave based killathon. A large number of gamemodes, weapons, powerups, enemies and vehicles. Highly configurable in terms of both game rule settings and also video/audio. Graphics are superb. Netcode solid (thanks Unreal engine). Tons of steam achievements. Map editor via sdk. Need I say more? Get it. Great job by developers to stick with it until the game shined.
4249	1	a	If you are into ever spinning dinosaur, dinosaurs launching themselves into the air while mulipling themselves (yeah.) or being unable to move for certain reasons while dinosaurs come at you, you might enjoy this thing.  Oh, remenber to press 'V'(melee button) while reloading. It cancels reloading animation, like completely.  4/10 7/10 for lolz
1475	1	a	Platformers, by and large come in two varieties: Cute and Cuddly, and mentally difficult. While things like SuperMeatBoy fall into the latter, this very firmly falls into the former.   Beep is, essentially, a keyboard/mouse physics puzzler/platformer crossover. You take control of a little robot, exploring a solar system of three planets, 'beaming down' into level after level, looking for 'antimatter', and then beaming back up.  The game features all the usual favourites of platformers - you'll be teetering on edges, jumping over enemies, sliding blocks, running on rotating drums, solving machine puzzles, shooting bullets, and my absolute #1 favourite: dying a lot.  That's the thing about platformers: They're set up to kill you. Some are fierce and you're expected to die every 10 seconds, while others involve tactics, long run-ups, and really spectacular jumps (e.g. Sonic). This falls midway between the two: It never presents a level which is ridiculously hard, usually giving you a relatively safe place you can 'fall' to, but although there are some really nice long jumps, and great swings, it doesn't have the majesty of AAA platformers like Sonic.  This feels like an indie Flash game that outgrew the technology and needed to visit the big leagues. It's cute, cuddly, easy to pick up, has good music, fun sound effects, and is nicely balanced. There were very few occasions where I got truly narked with the level design, but generally, I found a better way to do it than I had been trying.  The game rewards mild exploration. Unlike some games that cheat with invisible doors, off-screen specials, or collapsing platforms, this game is pretty straight-up, and says 'There's a special up here. Come get it if you can work out how.'. I finished the game collecting every single last piece of antimatter, and didn't spend ages banging my fists in frustration either.  So, yeah, this is a really really fun little game. I don't recommend playing on a touchpad. It REALLY benefits from a mouse. Similarly, if your mouse skills aren't great, I'd pass on this, cos you have to be a bit good on the point-and-click.   For the price, this gave a lot of entertainment, although not a lot of story per se. The game hints to a sequel, which I'd consider playing if the price was as low as I got this one for. Pick it up if you have a few hours to kill: Each level takes about 10 to 30 minutes to master and complete, so you can play it in short bursts.  Great fun.
4243	1	a	Those Dinosaurs don't have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3907	1	a	This is one of the best dino games ever!!! please work on the bugs and grapichs... BUT ITS SO GOOD
61	1	a	A must have for every classic adventure fan out there, Roger Wilco our beloved space sanitor as he campaigns through the galaxy for 'truth, justice and really clean floors'. :)
2682	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
4074	0	a	A good try at a game but it falls short in most areas. The combat is iffy and the controls feel weird. The concepts are all there but it is just missing something. It has many multiplayer aspects which can be fun but all fall short of amazing.  Personal Rating: 4/10
295	0	a	First thing first, I had absolutely lots of fun with this game. Just the sheer amount of destruction you are capable of doing is incredible. The hero has so grossly overpowered he literally rips to shreds everything he encounters, from regular people, through tanks and helicopter to disgusting and huge mutants. Action is satisfying and story, B-rated as it is, has a nice twist at the end. The reason I must say no, is that the game has some technical difficulties and it took me a few hours browsing through internet discussion and trying a lot of things to get it run normally on more than 3 FPS.
6321	1	a	Really fun game. Pretty much Halo versus dinosaurs. Have fun!
5258	1	a	This Game is very fun. first point: It teaches people about the jurrassic  second point: Its FPS , who don't like FPS third point: You Can play it online or play with your buddys and family  Most Important Point: The Game Is Cheap
3609	0	a	I really believe its a good game even as arcadish as it is now, but I just cant reccommend this to any of my friends. There are not decent servers with playable pings for me and my pals. Nowhere in my region are there any servers...I bought it simply because I found it cheap. Gameplay animations, etc could really use some polish...but for the low price I wont complaint much there.
5358	1	a	It' pretty good, but the dynamic weather can get really annoying, but hey, that makes it more 'real', the rain can really blur your vision, other than that, it's a fun game for a decently low cost (on sale)
85	1	a	how do i put the game in the remade version?
5552	0	a	All the demos are at like, 1/4th the speed of the actual game. The game itself is so incredibly fast that unless you know precisely how it works from the get-go, you're going to be spending a long time just figuring it out.
6011	1	a	Good game for the right price!
2694	1	a	the devs put effort into the game, and improved it quite a bit, +rep the reviews before Dec 2013 are outdated, so think of that before making your conclusion
4039	1	a	sooo worth it if u have a friend to play whit its just rly awsome game i strongly recomend it :D
5898	1	a	good game so OP jaws droppin at my feet
5593	1	a	Poorly optimized.  EDIT: The devs really turned the game around.
4329	1	a	Aside from all the bugs and blemishes throughout i found the game actually rather entertaining.I myself would certainly purchase this game.With its budget price and rather surprising graphics while supplying both competitive and co-operative game modes its great.however i will admit this game needs some tender love and attention yet.the bugs can be irritating and you never know when your host will leave and so far there is no way to migrate host instead it favors removing the match alltogether booting you out leaving you with little more than the experience and a sense of unfinished business.if you have some patience i recommend at least trying it out when it is free.
5025	0	a	Lags even on low settings
6376	1	a	Dinosaurs are farm animals, yeah?
1176	1	a	You know what they say, a little BEEP never hurts, if you don't like it there is this other game named Brilliant Bob and it is just amazing trust me, (Don't see my review in Brilliant Bob) so yea you'll have the best gaming experience with BEEP and Brilliant Bob in your library, trust me, I do.
104	1	a	I like to play it once in a while. Never gets old :P
5721	1	a	Very interesting, graphics are great. Lots of content. 8/10
323	0	a	I tried playing again recently and I realized within the first 2 hours why I never bothered to complete this game. Considering that the game is no longer supported and also doesn't work well on Windows 10 with newer graphics cards, I can only recommend that people give this game a pass.
4458	0	a	LAME, uninstalled this turd soon after playing it for a bit.
6100	1	a	totally worth it
3633	0	a	Terrible. I got it on sale, and it was the worst waste of a dollar ever.
320	1	a	Like Infamous except it looks worse, plays worse, has a worse story, awful cutscenes, and an unlikable protaginist.  Yet, it's oddly better.
5331	0	a	Did not like the game, difficult to control, though I'm not a huge fan of FPS versus hordes
6371	1	a	a good game for this price !! just try it xD
3329	1	a	For one dollar, it's definitely worth it. Think of it as an arena-styled game with some Halo-like vehicles and Borderlands-esque graphics. Though its not the most engaging game ever, its very fun at times and has rewarding gameplay. Mowing down hordes of dinos is always fun as you continue to gain credits in order to get better weapons and even vehicles. Great value and good fun for a dollar and you'll definitely get some enjoyment out of this for its price.
3805	1	a	Amazing game. Ambient arena with your friends and weather and EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT. Btw, who cares if anything is stolen from the game. Games always steal sounds, textures, etc. And that doesnt make the game any less great.
2035	1	a	Best FPS game i have played in sooo long. Don't let the price decieve you, this game is probably better than half the 60$ games being released
40	1	a	First there old programs and when ran in 64 bit dont work right, there is a patch you can download and after you have followed the patch and installed they work great on windows 10 and 7. there great games and i would reccomend i do wish it was done better but heck it dose not take alot of work to make them run right.   The games are fantastic and funny and worth playing even if you need to install a patch to get them to work, below is a link to serriahelp for there old games and 64 bit patches to make this game work. there is also more help on the install in the community hub.    http://sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html 
2725	1	a	Fun game, Has coop and i met some of the best people i have on my list through this game. This game not only made me have fun, but involved some good team work, has some awesome upgrades and really for .99 the graphics are pretty damn decent. This game is definitely worth every cent :P   If you get the game don't expect it to be extraoridinary, dont expect it to be mindblowing, but expect it to be fun. If you have some friends, jump on with them and just have a blast.
4679	0	a	In this game you can play as a dinosaur who has to protect eggs and eat spacemen, or a spaceman who has to steal the eggs and shoot dinosaurs. I don't think much planning went into making this game, in fact I think this is just two different games, from teams who had zero communications with each other, shoved together and released for 75 cents. This is a game that Ed Wood would release if he made video games about dinosaurs. This is a game that Strong Bad would think of after drinking too much Mountain Dew.
3685	0	a	GIVE ME THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 50 CENTS I PAID FOR THIS GAME. I COULD USE THAT FOR CSGO SKINS OR SOMETHING
6340	1	a	the only complain i got  is that I got stuck between the rock while climbing mountain in the snowy map and recoil from grenade dont work even that flying dinousaur wont even kill me when i want it to  other than that this game is awesome  10/10 would kill the T-rex by punch it in the face again      
5247	0	a	Don't buy this is game is a troll
84	1	a	The original MEME!
4196	1	a	It's a good game , i recomandet
5211	1	a	This has to be one of the single worst games I've ever played, and yet I cannot stop playing. It's just so entertaining! Being drunk helps, of course, but it is not vital to the experience. Grab a four-pack and three friends, and give it a shot.
3505	1	a	Great game if you love Jurassic park and first person shooters!
2321	1	a	cheap, fun, easy to get into and play with friends
2697	1	a	Game is great, very fun, kinda reminds me of serious sam with Dinosaurs
1779	0	a	I found out the hard way that I really don't like being savaged by raptors that have 3 frames of animation to their name while my buddy kills a T-Rex who got stuck in a rock in the background and a very enthusiastic announcer yells 'Bring me some pizza!' at the top of his lungs. No sir, I don't like it.
5369	0	a	Horrible load of â¥â¥â¥â¥, I got it for free when they were giving it away. Not even worth the price of free, it's like a really broken and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of Halo 1 with dinosaurs.
4835	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx40udwQvZI 
2999	1	a	This is the most broken, cheap, unimaginative, and repetitive game ever made.  Download it for free, have a laugh, and forget about it.
3772	1	a	The Best Game I have played For ever!
5879	0	a	probably the worst game i've ever played in my life
1885	0	a	Are you looking for fun, excitement, adventure, and a one way trip to cool visuals?? Well then go and stare at a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall. Better yet go and try to moon a King Kobra while 3 feet from it and stare at the ceiling in a hospital because atleast you'll get a nice view as you are in agonizing pain. Seriously, this game is like what would happen if Halo and Killing Floor made love and decided they had better things to do so they chucked the thing off a cliff. But then it was adopted by the brilliant minds that brought you Ride to Hell: Retribution.
5903	1	a	Sure, game had a rough launch, but very rarely will you see a game with such a dedicated dev team, that not only fixed the game, but made it superior in almost every way to what it once was.
4995	1	a	Starrving childerns doent nead foood.   Thems nead theis game.   12/10  
1275	0	a	I got stuck on pressing the 'New Game' button. Not even worth it if you go it for free.
1329	1	a	yo this game's gay
5636	1	a	My first time seeing this game I didn't watch any gameplay something in me knew it would be an amazing game. The metta Score of 36/100 is misleading it deserves a 90/100. This provides an amazing co-op gameplay you can play hours without getting bored! I would sugest buying the 4-pack and grabing your freinds to play this epic game! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update 5/5/2015  Since my original review I have to change my rating of this game. Since I first bought the 4-pack back when Orion Dino Horde first realeased up till now I have bought atleast 5 more copies of this game after buying the 4 pack for friends! Instead of the developers abandoning this game when it had horrible reviews they never gave up! They continuously updated the game over and over again making it better and better each time. Untill eventually it became Orion-Prelude the Dino game we all know and love today. Keep up the work with this amazing game! I must change my review from a 90/100 to 100/100!
5663	1	a	I dislike playing it but would be more entertaining with friends. Not my type of game but worth it to just buy it and support the devs for all the criticism they have gotten and the successful project they have created.
5960	1	a	A good solid fps game for mp, still playable for my old pc. It has solo play to train yourself before playing in mp.
6285	1	a	I used to play on a laptop. I bought this game and my computer broke. It was horrible. It lagged, it glitched, it was broken. I then built myself a gaming cpc, and this game is amazing. If you are a true PC gamer, you should have a gaming computer. On a good computer it is so much fun. I kept playing for hours. It wasted my life. (In a good way)
1471	0	a	This review is base on the game not on the card.  Platformer/Puzzler who get really boring just after 2 level. No fun with this game. So I decided to land on the sun!  If you look for excitement, play at mario galaxy, Yoshi will be in it at least!...  I said it so. NEXT!
5923	1	a	If you read back in the history of this game you'll see a lot of shiesty stuff, allegations of the developer not paying the programmers and things of that nature as well as misappropriated game assets. The game somewhere along the way even changed it's name, an event some use as condemning evidence of it's sordid past.   Me I don't know, we got this game as a pack during a seasonal sale and you know what for the dollar it cost it was worth it. The reviews in the past were all negative and that was the community supporting the people that got ripped off, now they're mainly positive because people to forget the past and lets face it for a buck this is a stupidly fun game.   Level progression in this game has been revamped (not for the better imho) and content really hasn't been updated that I can see for a while but at a buck you do get your moneys worth.
4498	1	a	TFW game you bought for cheap price becomes free.
5556	1	a	This game is awesome. I think every one should play this game.
1867	1	a	This game is a lot of fun no doubt.Highly under-rated.Love the scenary/evironment.And the dinosaurs are wonderful i really enjoy killing them .Fun weapons and vehicles to use. Only downfall is its bugs .Hopefully it all gets resolved in the future to make the game perfect.
2562	1	a	Dinosaurs + guns + multiplayer + cars, count me in.  9.5/10
6403	1	a	OH MY DEARY LORD THIS IS THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD THAT COMES CLOSE TO BAD RATS!!!
3209	1	a	Its very good game!!
4782	1	a	I got it when it was expensive
2864	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!
3634	1	a	So bad it's good and somehow gets worse the better it gets
5076	1	a	Way too much fun! Except there needs to be a 'Reconnect' button when you get disconnected from a server.
3057	1	a	it has been released â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 500000000000000000 times
2483	1	a	What can I say about this game?  Well.  Prelude sounds better than 'Dino Horde.'
534	1	a	Wish I never bought it.
880	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
5411	1	a	Shot my friend and killed him, then turned into a dinosaur and ate him. 99999 out of 10
1870	1	a	I found the game to be quite good, it makes good use of the Unreal Engine too. To see my gameplay the link is attached:  https://youtu.be/zEILzMO12lk  
5441	1	a	Its all about the dinosaurs fools!
6287	1	a	Great game, only thing is that all players rather go pve then pvp.
2728	1	a	Fun Game, but only in multiplayer. If you and a couple of your friends have it then play together. It could use some more work, but im convinced the next ORION game will be awesome.
4080	0	a	jumped on a car and got launched across the map
388	0	a	A total waste of Time and Money... But hey, I have a lot of fun throwing cars at innocent people yes. 'Had'
5190	1	a	Really fun game, plays like halo1 on pc but has dinosaurs. You can jump out of helicopters and land on tpteranodons.   10/10 game of the year.   Make sure you have friends to play with cause community may be dead.
5123	1	a	It is honestly alot of fun. I enjoyed the old Dino Horde as well. It is funny how the joke enemies were added, like the Pirate Compy for example. I would suggest they could add some new dinosaurs. I just wish they add the Argentinosaurus that actually has a million health, the stomp ability, and capable of causing mutiple fatalities. Also a few other types of dinosaurs like one that acts like a Velociraptor but can spit purple venom could be the Cryolophosaurus, a rham-sized pterosaur, the Tapejara, an Oviraptor, faster and deadlier than the Raptor,an Allosaurus that acts similar to the T-rex but can run faster, and a Carnotaurus, a carnivore half the size of the T-rex and can charge at great speeds, running over players. Since some dinosaurs cant heal in PvP modes, some ambient prey that can spawn almost any where you go on any map can help them alot even players who are lost in conquest maps by healing them (if they can cook it) and give them credits. Here are some ideas of the ambient prey: Pterodactylus- reward $50, heal strength 10-30 Orodromeus- $25, 5-10 Dodo Bird- $10, 20-25 Gallimimus- $60, 40-60 Pachycephalosaurus- $70, 80-95 *fights back* Dimorphodon- $50, 10-30 Moetherium- $100, 60-80 Deltatherium- $1, 0-3 (a large brown rat the size of a compy) Protoceratops- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Ankylosaurus- $500, 800-1000 *fights back* Meganeura- $5, 3-5 (comes in 2 colors) Lepidoptera- $5, 3-5 (a large butterfly that comes in 3 colors) Psittacosaurus- $25, 30-50 Parasaurolophus- $1000, 500-750 Arsinoitherium- $500, 250-475 Tupuxuara- $80, 40-55 Brachiosaurus- $3000, 5000-10000 (found in large maps, such as conquest) Hylaeosaurus- $150, 70-100 *tamable* Diplocaulus- $5, 5-10 Coelurosauravus- $5, 1-5 Glyptodon- $30, 10-30 Icarosaurus- $5, 1-5 Karaurus- $5, 1-5 Triadobatrachus- $1, 0-1 Eudimorphodon- $300, 100-142 *fights back* Archaeopteryx- $10, 5-15 Nomingia- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Caudipteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Sinosauropteryx- $5, 5-10 *common nuisance* Along with these other ideas, they should also add in the enemy team we have seen in the other version of ORION Prelude on  kickstarter.com . If they allow these ideas to go on the game, I would recommend this game, but if they cant, I understand. But I still enjoy this game even when it was Dino Horde.
108	1	a	Prototype is a good game. Most missions have the same objective, like highjack a vehicle or consume someone. Other than the repetetive gameplay, the game is full of fun challenges and trials to keep you playing after you're done with the main story. It has gore, good combat, and all the freedom you can get in the world. From my experience, I give it a 7 out of 10.
1210	1	a	This Game Sucks. Enough Said. 5 Outta 10...
1097	1	a	Great platformer to play when you have some spare time. Simple yet very fun and gives a challenge. Was trying to move a rock and hit myself with it and launched myself off the map. 10/10
911	1	a	Like a great grindhouse action movie turned into a 2D platform. Just like its predecesor Shank 2 has been infused with awesome fighting mechanics, soaked in blood and sweat, and left to bake in the hot desert sun. As all sequels should be, Shank 2 turns everything up to 11, trumping its predecessor on all levels. Klei would only continue to outdo itself with Mark of the Ninja
5146	1	a	Really, really, REALLY fun game. Gotta buy it, great with friends!
3424	1	a	This Game is incredibly fun Flying around and shooting dinosaurs Just Fun   pros:   Good gameplay  Graphics are pretty great for a game thats a dollar  level design great  Taunts  Customisable heads   cons:        I give this game a 9.5 out of 10
5449	1	a	not a bad game, honestly if i wasnt utterly flat broke and three months behind on my mortgage paymant id buy this thing in a second. its not spectacular, but for 99 cents its a heck of a deal. I mean, where else are you gonna get to battle dinosaurs online?
2642	1	a	It's amazing. O And theres dinos Yup Its cool
6562	1	a	Got this game when it was on sale for $0.99. Best dollar I spent. Great game guys, keep it up 
699	1	a	Card game rpg? Why not... fun for a little while unless youâre into cards, then you'll have a blast methinks. There should be an 'iffy' button for 'Do you recommend this game?'. More positive than negative so I'll say Yes.
251	1	a	awsome game! one of my favourites :P
6204	1	a	I was just supposed to test the game and see how it ran then quit after a few minutes.... I played 86 minutes by mistake.... I first played this back a few years ago when it first came out and was called 'Dino Beat Down', I hated it. It was boring and glitchy and ran like crap. But now, it isn't so bad. It still has glitches (The hover bike makes me lol), and I don't really like the default third person running animations with the pistol (they need to put the gun up by their head or down low instead of always pointing it out forward, they should only point it forward when you shoot), but overall the game is REALLY fun.  It is like Halo, actually, it is a whole lot like Halo. The jeep and the tank looks like it pretty much was ripped out of Halo, but the Dino defense and survival is actually really fun. I can honestly say I like this more than the original Halo and Halo 2 (Those were the only two I played. Let's face it, Halo was over-hyped poop... don't hate me).   Overall, the game has its flaws but it is really fun to play. I also play Killing Floor and I played Killing Floor 2, and so far I can say that I enjoy this just as much since it operates on a similar survival mechanic. Since the game is so cheap, I highly recommend you give it a try, it's worth the buy
569	1	a	Go for it, purely causing chaos is as much fun as playing the missions :D
2616	1	a	about this game a little bit laggy 
1948	1	a	You shoot a f*ckload of dinosaurs. That is the game.
4342	0	a	Wow even for 50 cents I feel robbed. Takes a lot for me to make a comment and being a Steam user for many years this is my first review. DON'T BUY it!!!!!!
6580	1	a	Game is super..
2665	1	a	Graphics are stunning, the most realistic thing I've ever seen. I wish I had 3d glasses so I could abuse the 3D mode. Has a huge class variety, which one is extremely different from the others. The Soundtrack is so nice I feel like bethoveen couldn't do better. Also, the learning curve is so smooth I can always learn more and more!   This game is the new eSport.
5360	1	a	A really nice game, especially for multiplayer. High paced action and a lot of chaos is ensured
2127	1	a	Take Halo and combine that with zombies from cod and replace the the zombies with dinosaurs and u get the best game ever
4882	1	a	a 36 rating??? DAFUQ METACRITIC
2669	1	a	I got this game as a gift from my homie. At first I thought he bought a cheap sh*t for me but we had a lot of fun :D
5421	1	a	This game is amazing. The only question is, why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is the price so low. This is a $30 game. $0.99 for this good of a game. This game is perfect, fun, entertaining, engaging, and action packed.
5917	1	a	If you expect a high quality dinosaur game, go pay more than 80p. For 80p I can't really argue with the content provided, it's pretty comprehensive for that price tbh If you can, get it in a sale for 10p less because this is Steam; the haven for penny pinchers!
4281	1	a	Paying $0.99c to hunt dinos? Nuff said. Take my dolla now!
725	0	a	Weird gin rummy game.
1562	0	a	The game is honestly not THAT terrible, but the developers are absolute scumbags. Don't give them your money.  For those unaware, in a nutshell, they took assets from other games (notably Call of Duty) and when they got taken off Steam because of stealing copyrighted content, they made a big fuss and told everyone big bad activision was unjustly attacking them.  And upon people discovering the claims were not Activision being evil, the developers tried to censor everything they could as the tide turned against them.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ you TREK/Spiral. The Internet isn't your personal attack army.
316	0	a	This game is possibly the biggest influence for Saints Row 4, however, I'd say it's not anywhere near as good. The story is hard to follow (might be because the voice acting is terrible, could also be because the story is kinda really very boring).  For a 2009 game, the visuals are really horrible. Lighting and shadows seemed a little closer to 2006 levels (I was playing with everything maxed out)  The controls were alright, though it wasn't anywhere near refined enough so the game felt cluggy from time to time.  The game most likely requires some work to get running well. With Nvidia cards, it's less of an issue, but almost everyone seems to suffer frame rate issues of some sort. If you are running with the an Nvidia card, I'd suggest leaving Vsync off in game and use the control panel (This should really be standard practise).
1289	0	a	IT was okay for a while, got it in a bundle. I mean i Wouldnt pay money for it alone
3618	0	a	Game is nothing but rip offs and poorly coded boring gameplay
4574	0	a	One of the worst games iv ever played in my life.
5004	1	a	jolly good meme 10/10  
358	1	a	Cutscenes are broken on Windows 7, frames are dropping very often but at least story and gameplay is good enough to make you play it. Play it first before Prototype 2 cos of huge spoilers. Better buy on 75% off sale.
1345	0	a	got for trading cards lol
5679	1	a	Great fun, didnt know what to expect and was pleasently surprised!
1293	0	a	The only positive for me was that I made more on trading cards than I paid for the game. I expected a cute but difficult platformer from the reviews, but what I got was bland and boring.
1670	1	a	-Opened Game -Joined Match -Immediately Killed by T-Rex -Immediately Love game. In all seriousness though, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's got the gameplay mechanics of Advanced Warfare, the charm and uniqueness of an indie game (despite not being one.) and the amazing graphics of Half Life. It's an amazing game, and it's only $1!
5228	1	a	You can run around as a dinosaur in some modes.... eough said XD Pretty damn awesome fun, for the cheap price! A must play with friends.
3611	0	a	sucks
3771	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its right up there with elder scrolls and battlefield
5328	1	a	enjoying the CRAP out of this game. A very great game that is so much fun to sit down in front of for hours and just mow down dinosaurs!!!
790	1	a	The campaign is fun, but the real beautiful core of this game is in the survival mode, which is one of the most delightful co-op experiences I've ever had. It's tough but fair. Get a co-op partner and â¥â¥â¥â¥ some mooks up
6086	1	a	This game has no story behind it, no special features and no complex things to perform.  Yet, surprisingly, once you get the hang of it, it's really fun, especially when playing with other people. And what makes it better, is that you can play as a noob or as a seasoned player, the result is still fun.  Plus it's really really cheap. For the money it's asking, it's worth it.
3795	0	a	....... really.......
4719	1	a	Worth my last 50 cents
1646	0	a	Absolutely terrible, do not waste any money on this whatsoever. Complete trash.
3080	0	a	This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played.  Go get it on the next sale.
5885	1	a	This game is really fun to play, plays a lot like halo in terms of mechanics, the warthog uses look to steer for e.g. and you have the same weapon's setup i.e. guns grenades &amp; melee.  The combat isn't as polished as halo obviously, (billion $ franchise vrs small indie) and the weapons and vehicles feel a little light but having said that it is still really fun to play.  For the current asking price Its a steal, and that price includes all the important game features that you'll need to play. (No PTW features only hats &amp; cosmetics as far as I can tell).   If you enjoyed gow 2's hoard mode you will probably enjoy this game although it has lots of other game modes, I've not tried them yet so can't comment.  Definitely has that 'one more round' thing going on and the new steam add is cool as hell. ;)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ 
5995	1	a	Graphics aren't the best, mechanics are a little glitchy. But the amount of fun I'm having with this game definitely justifies the cost
3275	1	a	Pretty cool game, if your into dinosaurs and biting peoples asses off. Or, if your into killing animals to extinction and trying to get eaten. WELL! THIS IS DA GAME FOR U!
3857	1	a	Approved by the goat!
1942	1	a	Guns+Jetpacks+Armored Mechabots+Dinosaurs= A â¥â¥â¥â¥ load of fun! :) havent even tried co-op yet cause my 'friends' have yet to accept their cheap â¥â¥â¥ gifts but this game is totally recommended if you are looking for the above. And the graphics are pretty damn impressive for such a little game :)
5684	1	a	It's ok Definitely worth playing with a couple of friends, can get pretty fun.
6220	0	a	(Pukes)   I hate this game. It is so laggy even tho it looks crappy. Ive been playing on lowest settings and I got like 2 frames more. And the gameplay doesnt even make any sense. You are a Halo guy that needs to survive hordes of dinosaurs. Wtf im outta here
2389	1	a	this game is rocks this is halo star wars jurrasic park weird game and this game is only 1 dollar sometime I forgot my 1 tl and I don t care but this game need some update still like some bugs and I still need something this game have sooo much pay in thing it is bad and dino has some bug and you can only be a dino in rampage and it is bad I hope devs are read this I love this game devs are relly fuuny and this game has slowmotion ooowww yeaah :D  and if I need to give point 7.5/10 for this game if you ask devs 11/10
1777	1	a	Take Vehicles from Halo, And weapons from every fps in the world and add Dinosaurs.  What do you get?  A Metascore of 36   ORION: Dino Horde.  But seriously.. I shot down a stegosaurus in a tank and everything went slow motion and a voice said Dino Down 36/10 best game ever.
734	1	a	
2771	0	a	This game is broken beyond all hell and sucks DinoDickâ¢  tl;dr When a game has a 36/100 metascore, DON'T BUY IT
2412	1	a	Awesome Game!  Believe it or not this is a great game to invest in if you enjoy first person shooter, or shooter games. I know the price of the game is a bit misleading on its value, but I assure you its more then worth it. There are many difficulties in this game, and you can earn your achievements pretty easy on all difficulties. I generally only play Survival as I am more of a co-op type person then PVP. In survival mode you basically have to defend you the generator from the on coming Dinosaurs mobs. As you get kills or team mates get kills you earn credits &amp; experience. The credits can be used to buy better weapons, upgrades, mods, etc at the end of each level. Out of the three classes I enjoy playing assault the most, and I like the special skill of assault which is a jetpack that allows you to get on top of rocks &amp; other places to get away from harms way.  What do you have to loose? Its only $0.99 &amp; if you like it awesome, if not get a refund?
2540	1	a	Great fun and can't wait for the new updates!
4097	0	a	Buggs And Bad Graphics !
3199	1	a	You shoot guns, and kill things.
5172	1	a	Great game when you just want to kill stuff. You can also up the level and comense rage ;)
3765	1	a	Orion: Prelude is one of the best games ever! Looking at the price of it might make you think that it has DLC or overpowered weapons but no! You buy the game and that is it! It has some cosmetic items that you can buy with real money but it is more like a donation and it gives you no advantage! Overall the game is great! Graphics are not the best but it fixes it on gameplay!  This game has a 'single-player' mode that is basicly same thing as offline but with bots!  Also when I tested the server creating it worked perfectly. It doesn't have the same problem as Valve games (so in Orion: Prelude you don't need to make dedicated servers to play with friends)!  Totally worth of your money :)
1770	0	a	Nope
6039	0	a	No... Just No
3337	1	a	11/10 would hear me roar oar oar oar oar ooarr
52	1	a	Not sure why people complain; have tried this on Windows 7 (disabled DEP) and works fine. It uses DOSBox to run the original game files. So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as two different items).
226	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
4254	1	a	This game is worth more then 99 cents.
4863	0	a	ummm... uuhhh... why this game become F2P? ._.
297	0	a	i must admit while i do like this game get it on sale for atleast 70 off it gets really annoying note this is not a bad game just not worth what else you could get like saints row or this war of mine 
1069	1	a	A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging. Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.  Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.
169	1	a	If you are into shapeshifting and killing everything that walks in style, this game is for you my friend! The storyline in this game is thrilling right from the start to the very end, 10/10 in my humble opinion.
439	1	a	Destruction, havoc, carnage, massacre, murder, bloodbath are the best words to describe this game.  If you enjoy gratuitously murdering ficticial people in multiple exaggerated ways or hate military forces you'll love this masterpiece.
3684	1	a	  I love it the way it playes feels like halo with dinosars.
4778	1	a	Hainanese Chicken Rice Never Tasted This Good Before?! Good Price, Kappa Gamers.
1688	1	a	Many Good. Buy for monies.
2878	1	a	You paying only 99 cents, you can play the great game like paying 59 dollars 99 cents.  Very fun, many mode, good graphic, but you paying only 99 cents.  It's the best!!!
1008	0	a	Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.  It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.  Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.  I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.  Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.  Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.
4731	0	a	I really wanted to play this game unfrotinately i get disconnected every time i try to join a server even when i get into one instant disconnect. i was looking foward to playing this but i made a mistake buying it.
2063	1	a	It has its problems,.. You can't grumble at Â£0.79... Good banter.... 11/10 would get eaten by a T-Rex again.
3844	0	a	THE GAME IS FULL WITH BUGS AND I WENT MY MONEYS BACK
1261	1	a	This game was surprisingly awesome! I got it free cause it was on sale for .19 and gave cards for .21. Still, I thought it would be another freebie game to get cards from but this game was really fun. A bit on the short side, but totally worth it. It basically is Mario mixed with WALL E. Its a great mixture of platforming and puzzling. I like how its challenging enough to keep me engaged but not too hard to make me pull my hair out. The puzzles were a bit straightforward but took thinking to complete. Plus the environment, music and ambiance were very soothing. Totally worth the 2 cents I earned to play it and I think you should play it too. I hope they make a sequel. They should be proud of what they accomplished.
4211	1	a	I am this game this game is me 
952	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
4725	0	a	Congratulations. This is the only game that I have ever seen to be the worst game of 2012, AND the worst game of 2015. They should get an award. 
3624	0	a	Stephen Hawking Runs Better Than This Game
6132	1	a	ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
2668	1	a	its cool trust me. also im pretty cool bro. i have friends and i have swag, suck it
4414	1	a	this game is actually quite fun despite what the metascore says, I decided to look into it, and they're reviewing what came before when it was Dino Beatdown and not Dino Horde. It's a decent game, great fun with friends, I'd give it a shot for 99 cents.
3351	1	a	Better than Bioshock Infinite, maybe.
2576	1	a	Like Killing floor + Turok, but with dinos, and the wonderfully large ones that will chomp you in half, or grab you by the leg and carry you 80 feet in the air, only to let go and you fall to your doom! (unless you choose assault class, you have a jet pack)
2158	1	a	THIS IS THE BETA VERSION OF FAR CRY PRIMAL !!1!!!1!!111!!
2196	1	a	All it's missing is the brute shot.
4602	0	a	I couldn't play the game due to the terrible looking 'ice' obstructing my vision. I also couldn't stand the players foot steps hurting my ears, you could hear someone walking from 4 miles away as if they were right beside you.
606	0	a	more like phototype because of the bad frame rate
3242	0	a	This is not Jurassic Park. 0/10
6386	1	a	A great graphic novel , honestly made me cry...
672	0	a	
871	1	a	Beat it on PS3. Even better than the first.
1851	1	a	It's now a dollar, or 79p. Permanently. Definately worth a flutter. And it's come a long way since it's much maligned launch. Whilst not as polished as say, Killing Floor you can tell that the devs have been trying hard to be. And the game improved a lot thanks to their efforts. Hit detection occasionally has a silly moment but for the most part its fine and the game runs pretty smooth. I can even host games with everyong pinging under 100. And its fun. Good assortment of vehicles and weapons, power ups, plenty of maps. So if you like co-op shooters and have had your fill of zombies give it a spin!
2917	1	a	when you rub poop on the monitor the game looks a little better
4877	0	a	This is a mistake.
5096	0	a	Don't play this.
4704	1	a	nice game worth 1 â¬
2057	1	a	cool game for u thats want survival game
5317	1	a	Game runs like crap but is fun on conquest with a group of friends.
1730	1	a	Review of Orion : Prelude! This game may seem dull at the first hour, but when you play enough of it, you can't stop. The graphics might not be very good, but it makes up for its gameplay, it has several vehicules, giant maps, Adjustable NPC difficulty, 10+ game modes ( only 2 are Singleplayer sadly ). Orion is basically Humans V.S Dinos, Don't see that much often eh? Anyways, Humans have 3 Classes, Each class with it's upgrades and special Skills! 7 or 8 Vehicules! 12+ Guns and taunts!  = Fair Graphics  + Good singleplayer - Microtransactions ( i really hate that! where's the time where skins would be unlocked by a special challenge/ mission?) + Different gameplays + Several modes + Workshop + Several maps  = Taunts ( depends on your view of Taunts i personally hate them ) + Good XP system + Cheap price ( well in my time at least! I heard it's going to be $20 in the next few months ) So get it on sale or not, it is worth the money!
4426	1	a	if you like dinosouars this game is for you 
645	1	a	Love this card game, use poker hands to defeat your enemys, with plenty of spell cards and allies to aid you when things get difficult. Most enemies are easy to start off and you think its a walk in the park but it soon cranks up the difficulty later on and you have to really think ahead and put good hands together to win. If you like card games then this is worth a shot.
1075	1	a	If you combine platforming from the Mario games, and mix it with the half-life gravity gun and physics, you have BEEP.  BEEP is a colorful game about physics and platforming.  Pros: Colorful and bright graphics. Amazing puzzles and physics. Picking up random crap and throwing it to kill enemies is the funniest thing ever. Many different levels and worlds, each with their own enviroment. Cons: The physics can be broken very easily. Not a very good storyline. A few bugs I've ran into, but not very many. There should be a 1-2 second delay between reloading your gun.   I would recommend buying this game on a sale (I got it for around 0.20$ on a sale) because the game goes on sale often.   Now, for the rating: I'm giving this game a recommended 6.0 rating, but that's just my personal opinion. I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.  Anyway, that's my review.  I'm out. ~Darkel  
5300	0	a	I bought this game for one euro.  Still felt robbed of my money.
3957	0	a	DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LATEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN STATING THAT THIS IS A FIXED GAME. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT TAKES AGES TO GET INTO A GAME AND WHEN YOU DO YOU MAY AS WELL BE TRYING TO STICK LEGO TO CAT TURD. AWFUL
4007	0	a	This is an unfinished game. The animations for characters, player view models, and dinosaurs are lazily done. For instance, the pistol equip animation doesn't sync with the pistol itself; the pistol will be in idle position a good half-second before the hands are fully out there. The gameplay is shallow, since it's basically 'kill dinosaurs with no real impact with their attacks' then 'buy one upgrade' and rinse, repeat.
4738	1	a	I Absolutly Love Fighting Dino's in Space! This is my absolute favorite steam find and i am looking forward to their up and comming sandbox game from Spiral. Keep up your Indi Gold.
3555	0	a	Baaaaad game.. Stay away. Horrid sound effects where they exist at all. Feels and moves cheap. The animation is amateur. The lighting is horrible. Menus are clunky. When you die the game just instantly goes to a loading screen.. no idea even what just happened. I could go on but it's worth more effort than the game is worth.
3388	1	a	think of halo, and raids of dinosours atacking. that is EXACTLY what this game is. there is replicas of ghosts, banshes, and those tanks... its a rip off halo 3 - reach
1099	1	a	Fun little side scroller with a nice art style and music that will lead to marital problems in your 30's.
4025	1	a	This game is awesome relatively fun while disregarding it's initial Metascore. It's very simple as in repairing your power generator and securing an objective but hell you get to kill dinosaurs with Mech's and air ships that can literally kill anything at a moderate speed.  Although it can be repetitive more often than not but it's well worth the $.99 buy.  7/10
6361	1	a	  Such gameplay, much Wow
1666	1	a	Sound like a good game despite of the note in many site, it is a real pleasure to play with friends! Alone it is a harder but you cannot dispatch the defense position but it stays completly playable.  However I regret a training mode, with many health (maybe god mode) and so on to discover the ability of weapon and so on... I see somewhere on the forum that developers are creating admin command then try do not forget 'funny' command (or cheaty command as you wish :p)  
487	1	a	Prototype is a game where you play as Alex Mercer, a scientist turned mutant who has god like powers, this game very much reminds me of Assassin's Creed and it feels like it to. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and the random violence can prove a good substitute for some of the animation bugs; a good game in general.
6559	1	a	For $0.99, this is a great deal. The game suffers from a fair amount of latency issues, but is well worth a try despite it.
5242	1	a	My god it is fun with friends. You will need friends to play this though, it's better to have someone to help you with this experience. It's like an even more indie version of Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs, mechs, tanks, and (helicopters?). Good for how cheap it is, if you can get over how indie it is.
4656	0	a	Poorly optomized for geforce 210.
548	1	a	Very fun game, great storyline, and good if you like chopping people up for no reason!
3508	1	a	4 pack it ASAP!  Dinos..... Sci-fi weapons..... co op...... laughs..... onsale for a dollar at times..... It is a no brainer. If you are scared to lose a dollar on a game then your loss....
3647	1	a	Games can't fail, only developers can. This game is by far the greatest bang per buck value. It plays a lot like Unreal Tournament 2004, combined with a bit of HALO all mixed in with dinosaurs.  Grab a couple of friends and go nuts in this game. You'll have a blast and I don't think you could spend that little bit of cash anyway better. This developer should get way more praise, they are like the indie CDProjectRed.
1918	1	a	Awesome game, recommend getting it. still a few problems but overal great
1669	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in a futuristic environment sounds fun... and it is. Especially if you play it with some friends. Grab your guns, upgrade yourself with some augments and kick some a$$. Leveling up gives you some bonuses.  You can choose between three different classes (Assault, Support, Recon) which only vary slightly. What makes every player different is how they customize their augments. This is by no means a bad thing. You are not stuck to a special weapon set depending on your class. You want to be a jetpacking shotgun maniac or a sniping medic? No problem. It's all up to you.I have to admit the weapon balance isn't that great. There is no effective automatic gun. To do good damage you have to pick either a shotgun or sniper rifle.  The maps are huge and it can take a few minutes to arrive on the other side without a vehicle. That's great but therefore they havent many maps available. For each map there is a day and a night variation but this makes nearly no difference to the actual gameplay. Map objectives seem to appear on random locations every time so it's at least not exactly the same experience every time.  Vehicles variety is awesome. There aren't many different vehicles available but they are all different from each other. Steering a minigun welding mech or fly around in a harrier... It's fun. Navigating left or right by using the mouse is something you have to get used to. Other controls are easy to go.  So the overall gameplay is pretty solid but at some points it's a little bit glitchy when it comes to player positioning. In some cases you can get stuck in walls and the hitboxes of the tiny dinosaurs are a little bit weird.  What drives me mad somehow is the 'Spiral Store' where you can buy Hats and colors for real money. This would be perfectly O.K. for me in a free to play game but not in a full priced game. It doesn't affect gameplay but getting them as rewards for achievements would be way more appreciated. It can get boring after a while since it's the same again and again. It offers some different gamemodes but in the end it is PvP or survival... Since player positioning sucks it's only surivival for me. This is why I would recommend to get this game only if you have some friends to play this game together in Co-Op since this makes it a lot more enjoyable.  This is my opinion about the game and may differ from yours...   TL;DR  Personal rating: 6 Fair | out of 10  The good: + Alot of different perks/augments + Vehicles + Huge maps + Plenty of gamemodes + Simple controls  The bad: - Weapon balance - Glitchy hitboxes - Low amount of maps - Fancy hats from the trailer only for real money - Gets boring if you play it alone
5893	1	a	only for dinosaur lovers 
3991	1	a	No game is bad for a dollar
3075	0	a	I don't quite understand this - If the dev is having so much difficulties making money, and looking where 'ORION' has gone, I must say that making this free was NOT a good move, on the authors or for the customers. I understand that making this free in order to lower the hate for this game and all it's glitches is a way to go, but at least give some regard to those who enjoy this, and spend their time playing it. 
209	1	a	Throwing the burning skeleton of a destroyed helicopter into its companion helicopter certainly is fun
3712	1	a	so this game is for kids like 7-12 years old l thought wow something like borderlands NO lts just epic guns wow but shoting is totaly lagged and the island is too bugged this game is hard 2 cuz you must kill flying dinosaur wtf lts really good to gift for you frind 7 years he gonna be happy and you will pay 0.50 euro so good gift 6/10
4220	1	a	I like it. dont know why, but i do. I find myself playing this way more than expected.
5695	1	a	cheap and fun.
931	1	a	Even better than the first! Awesome!
1497	1	a	It's bad... In the best way possible. Will Dinohorde go down in history as an innovative piece of gaming? Not in any sense of the phrase. Will it be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, intuitive gameplay or captivating story? Negative. What you will remember about Dinohorde is the unreasonable amount of fun you will have playing it with a few of your best gaming buddies. Its difficult to describe why, and it might just be how ridiculous the whole thing is, but Dinohorde is one of the most fun games I've played in 2014. The quality isn't quite there but you won't regret dropping a couple dollars on this inexplicable gem.
3560	0	a	The game being $1 dosent make it any less â¥â¥â¥â¥  
479	1	a	Ever had such a crappy day that you wanted to blow up Manhattan? You can do that here.
1563	0	a	scum developers steal game assets
5098	1	a	If you enjoy those 'quarter' arcade games, this reminds me of them, except quarter arcades are now 4 quarters and this game was half of that. I'd say I spent my 2 quarters worth. Its actually rather fun, I was very surprised. The dinosaurs could look better (they have that floppy 2D feel that makes you think they are 3D while on ground level) but its still great and I think gives it that charm. Can't complain for the cost.
4891	0	a	After booting my potato machine, I decided to buy my friends this amazing looking game. No doubt, killing dinosaurs will be a blast. After waiting for 20 mins downloading the game we hopped in with high hopes. I will tell you right now, that the trailer is deceiving. The game runs at a solid (revolutionary) 20 frames per second. The game has a wonderful soundtrack if we could hear it without stuttering. What this game needs is to get out of the Dinosaur age technology and get optimized! (Also needs cheezus crust)   'This blows' - hanxshan 1/29
4187	1	a	The dino's creep out of no where and just destroy you...  What a game...  Got the four pack for 0.79...  8.5/10 IGM
360	0	a	I have a tag in my steam library for 'Will Never Play Again'.  This game is the sole resident.  This game made me create this category.  If you must, play Prototype 2. It's better in every single respect.
4115	1	a	Get 30 fps with a gaming laptop, kden
382	0	a	DO. NOT. BUY.  Barely runs on many computers because it's poorly optimized. I can run Crysis 3 on HIGH but not this on low.
5027	0	a	The game crashed while I was exploring the in game store. It's not very good.
5555	0	a	Its very laggy i would rate this game a 6/10 the graphics aren't that good and its should be free for the games performance. Tell me what you think in the description.
981	0	a	And why do I not recommend this game. EA's Origin! Never even got the game running, 20 minutes of painfull Origin create profil, login, enter game serial. Run game, login again, enter game serial once more, game crashes, start game again, login yet another time, game crashes, reboot windows, run game, login just for the sake of login in, game crash, uninstall!  Steam, would you please ban EA Origin games!
3011	1	a	This game is incredibly fun for anyone who wants to play with their friends.
1821	1	a	Holy cow. This game is awesome! And for 0.99c it doesn't get any better! I love this game. The graphics is.. Im speechless.. THEY ARE AMAZING. Even on lowest !! Really liked the first couple of rounds I played and will be playing more.
4176	1	a	I agree with basically everything everyone has saying, the game started out shaky, albeit i still had fun playing it, but Much added content and updates its unreal how much has been added. I vote 7-8 game play, 10/10 for developer, basically showing they care.
4072	0	a	Not worth a dollar Gameplay is boring Guns don't recoil properly all around a pretty lame game
6569	1	a	i played this for 5 hours straight brillant game.
5467	1	a	very good but he graphics are ok
5171	1	a	I saw this game on sale for 1$ and being as cheap as I am it sparked my curiosity so I searched it up on youtube to find some hilarious gliches like the front fliping t-rex. So I bought it xpecting to walk into a hilarous brokem mess that would be worth it for the laughs alone. Instead I got a genuinely good game, I would recomend to anyone to buy it because 1$ isn't much to spend on a game that is good. In fact this is the only game that I have spent under 4$ on and had it be good. If the pvp was more active I think I could have gotten into it a lot more because the pvp wasn't a broken camper noob tube filled shot gun spamming sound whoring mess (*cough cough 'cod'*) The pve was pretty nice too, it kinda reminded me of firefight on halo but better in almost every way. If you don't have it get it, for 1$ you can't really go wrong
133	1	a	Generic story and characters that you canât connect with or give a sh*t about and a boring and ugly open world. But the fun gameplay saves the game from being bad. Gameplay is nothing great either because of some tedious and just uninteresting missions and objectives but there is fun to be had in this game. Running around the city really fast and unlocking some cool abilities is the highlight of the game. I like the final boss in the game itâs the only thing I remembered about the game when I first played it on release. 6/10 (Decent)
3884	0	a	you should just let this game be free because all your doing is anoying a lot of peoplee by putting out for only a week free and its not that good any way so just make free !!!!!!!!!!!!!
4403	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
3370	1	a	got picked up by a T-rex, used a rocket launcher to explode its head. 10/10
4662	0	a	Despite the developer's numerous attempts, Orion is still an unwhelming game at the end of the day.
2770	0	a	Definetly not worth the money, even though I bought it during the $0.99 sale. Terrible game, early 2000's graphics, terrible animations, and unbelieveable amount of glitches. 0 stars and extremely not recommended to be bought, not fun at all.
1312	0	a	Lacks a lot of things, it was very mediocre. Bought it for 19 cents, and yet I still think this might be a little too much. Luckily I can get these 19 cents from the trading cards! Positive!
4412	0	a	Haha, it's even funny. It's REALLY bad! I don't think i have words to describe it.  Good thing it was only $1.
2218	1	a	This game, Name one other game where a FU@#$ING t-rex throws rocks with it's mouth while you shoot at it! Turok has nothing on this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Fully recomend.
1635	1	a	Bought for $0.99....should of bought a 7/11 taquito to enjoy the inferno â¥â¥â¥â¥ cleaning.
6552	1	a	This game is extremely fun, especially with other players. A teradactyl was flying in the air and I shot it down with a tank projectile, and killed it one shot. Then everybody told me 'Wow nice shot'. This game is awesome. One minute you're jetpacking away from a T-Rex, the next you're helping a teammate survive the horde of 'dinos'. If you like co-op, and the Unreal 3 Engine, then buy this game. It could use the support, and you could use the fun.
4737	0	a	Its as bad as the title suggests.

4062	0	a	Don't be misled by the other reviews, this game is an unfinished piece of garbage. This 'game' is exactly the same as Dino Beatdown, and makes no attempt to hide it, as it still goes under the same name in the game files. The game itself looks absolutely nothing like a 2012 release, with shoddy textures, extremely low-polycount models and very natural selection type gameplay. As if it couldn't get any worse, the game also features a cosmetics shop, stocked with low-effort reskins and glaringly bright armour colours.  Overall verdict: This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you want giant monsters, strategy and sci-fi themes, go play Natural Selection 2. I'm glad I saved myself 99p by playing it free.
5191	1	a	A game this cheap with potentially hours of fun with multiplayer?  Don't think! get it!  Ps. You get to kill a Trex that throws rocks.
188	1	a	In this game, you play as a complete monster who spends his days killing countless people and/or stealing their memories by eating them. Yes you read that right. You are a psycho in this game and you have a big open world to play around in. So the story is a bit meh, filled with government conspiracy cliche mixed with evil science experiments, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game. And it is made up for by a stellar combat system and plenty to do in the game. Besides... sometimes it's fun to just cut loose and play a bad guy with unnatural powers.  WARNING: This game is also buggy. A particularly nasty bug I ran into was that everytime I started the game, then tried to load a save, the game crashed. My workaround was the start the game, start an all new game, and THEN to load my save file. Figured I should put that here in case someone buys this game based off this posting only to run into this particular bug.  But if you don't have such troubles or can get around them, have fun!   (Nom nom)
4871	1	a	for me i think the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. its not good at all but hey what can you expect for a 1 dollar game? Nothing!
540	1	a	Spiderman's rampage, oh and he's not a spider.
3235	0	a	it sucks!
2526	1	a	Really fun game. Got really bad reviews at release and it deserved them as far as I've heard. they really improved the game and I bought it on the 1 euro sale, played with a friend today and we had a ton of fun. Can only recommend it, especially if it goes on sale again!
4423	0	a	BACK WHEN THE GAME WAS CALLED ORION HORDE i liked this game, its was defo worth the money,team work was the key.was fun with friends and these people who say its crap they have not played enough to warrent calling it crap.a must buy for 99p/ $0.99 i retract this statment ^^ its utter garbage ...chagend the game so much its not even the same game and as for the stealling content thing well GG orion GG  DONT BUY THIS GAME NOT EVEN FOR 1P /$0.01  DONT SUPPORT THIS GAME IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM  DONT LISTEN TOO ME I'M ONLY A PANDAWW I RAN OUT OF BAMBOO THIS MORNING AND I'M HUNGRY  lol   WORST VIDEO GAME EVERRRRR!!!! (the simpsons)
1693	1	a	This game promises shooting dinos with guns and vehicles. It delivers. It's a wonderful game for just booting up and killing some time, and it's generally pretty easy to find an open match. I'd say it's a bit like Killing floor, but with dinosaurs and the occasional jet pack. Grab it while it's on sale, or wait for it to be a free weekend, though, because I can't in good conscience say it's worth $15.
5742	1	a	HELL OF A TIME I JUST HAD 
5755	1	a	When i first bought this game it had plenty of bugs, some of them game breaking, but it was unique. These developers have done exaxtly what they should have done by continuing to work on the game to make it a very enjoyable game. This is truly a great game and for a dollar you should definatly buy 12
5203	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥... I mean I got a card but â¥â¥â¥â¥...
2651	1	a	Wow. Such Dino's. Much guns. Very team-based. So kill. Ruined Doge's life. Five stars.
4495	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
6434	1	a	It's like COD but with that unexpecting element in witch you can actually rely on teammates for help
407	1	a	Choose your weapon!!!
5221	0	a	I can't recommend this game, even though I got it for less than a dollar. True, I feel that I got my money's worth of enjoyment, but this game overdelivers on concept and far underdelivers on gameplay.
3509	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.
2332	1	a	Great game for a stupid concept. Over all this game is very entertaining providing a unique survival mode where other players take on the role of dinosaurs and destroy new players that don't know what their doing. Through a simple playthrough I beleive team games or free-for-all game modes are the best. The free-for-all duel is wildly entertaining providing huge jumps, great swordplay, camo and awesome side moves.
4587	0	a	No, I do not recommend this game.  I played a few minutes of it and already knew it was just another crappy shooter game, if you enjoy shooter games, then yeah give it a go, I enjoy shooter games but not awfuly made ones.  0/10
1262	1	a	Cute little lovely cool game and i like the grafichs ther colorful and defently recomand this game
5219	1	a	It's way cheaper than it should be
189	1	a	reminds me of a john k. peta doujin
4654	1	a	A wise person once said... 'Don't go into the long grass!!!'
5075	1	a	I honestly only got this game because it was 50 cents, but I would have paid full price for it after playing it. It is one of those games you play with some buddies on a Friday night. Its really fun, and even though there are in game purchases, it is only cosmetic and don't really affect gameplay. All-in-all, its a 8/10.
4124	1	a	Great F2P Game.
33	1	a	Greatest game series of all time. I grew up playing King's Quest 1 &amp; 2. I remember drawing my own map for both games and writing down the code for the strange character ala (Rumplestiltskin). That isn't his name as it is jumbled up. So many great memories of this game.
6437	1	a	Its like Halo and a pack of diinosaurs had a fricken babu! Its great fun. *dinoshootingintensifies*
5528	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLJTAqnmHt0 
6553	1	a	I think the metascore doesnt pay justice to the game. It is a really fun game to play with friends. Get them to buy it also or buy a 4-pack. Get it when it has a discount on it. You can't go wrong!
4274	1	a	Like Skyrim, with guns!- 1gn
289	1	a	Plagued with problems, especially hen it comes to controls (this is an obvious console port job gone wrong) but brutally fun at times. The problems balance with the good stuff fairly well, so I'd recommend if you can get it cheaply and/or really need your fix of Going-On-A-Murder-Spree-In-New-York-City games.
269	1	a	2 hours into the game and i've killed more innocent people than HItler  Would recommend.
4647	1	a	Its only a dollar or in england 0.79 I mean its soooo worth it as 0.79 or a dollar is nothing for this amount of fun im surprised at the cost. BRILLIANT
74	0	a	This game was great!
2573	1	a	It's so terrible it's good.
3846	0	a	This game... Just no... No... Not worth your time... Just don't bother.
644	0	a	This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.
484	1	a	Running up walls is fun. 6/10
4757	1	a	Amazing and it's even free to play now!
190	1	a	An open-world superhero game in a urban apocalyptic setting. Pretty satisfying to jump and glide over huge blocks of the city, overpowering everything in your path, from giant mutants to army tanks and helicopters. Don't do the sidequests though, or it gets very repetitive.
2921	1	a	i paid opne dollar for this and it has to be the best dam dollar ive ever spent if you have friends this is a freaking blast :D
5834	1	a	Totally worth for the price of a mcdonalds cheeseburger!
3803	1	a	I SHOT A LITTLE FOOT IN THE FACE! WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR FROM A GAME!!!!
1547	1	a	1 dollar? Worth its price
5853	1	a	DINOSAURS! RAWR! if you like killing dinosaurs and just being an overall badass, this is the game for you.
2469	1	a	such a funny games, playable games, and enjoyable games when you play it on solo player or multiplayer.
4606	0	a	My friend said its a good game. We're not friends anymore...
132	1	a	Very entertaining action/adventure game. Absolutely worth of playing!
3535	0	a	This game is pretty much Halo with enless waves of dinosaurs but with terrible graphics and terrible physics. Even if it is on sale I would not buy it. And if you do get it, make sure you look up a tutorial first, it does not tell you how to play the game. The maps are HUGE, which is good and bad. Good because you can roam around and get away from the dinos easily. Bad because it sometimes spawns you on the OPPOSITE of the map you are supposed to be and with no vehicle. Overall do not buy this, it is a waste of money, I have no idea how this has so many good reviews.
3937	1	a	What every dev should do instead of ditching their games
6304	1	a	Half the time you won't notice a dinosaur the size of your ankles killing you. 10/10, would rage at compys again
4529	0	a	This is the most worst. The gameplay isn't as fun as other dinosaur games I've played. Who the hell manages to make being a freaking dinosaur not fun?! Movement is glitchy and slow, leaving you open to be gunned down by the human players EASILY, even as the tankiest of dinos. The sounds are horrible - either loud and screeching to punish headphone users, or bland and forgettable. Never, EVER press the roar button if you wear headphones. YOU WILL REGRET EVERYTHING.  When the game makes even walking around the map a tricky chore, LET ALONE COMBAT, you know something's horribly wrong.   Play Primal Carange instead if you want some fun dino vs human action. PC isn't perfect by any means, but it gets you what you want: violent, chaotic combat mixed with some stealthy hunting in between. Also silly cheesy dialogue, if that's your thing. And while the t-rex is loud in that game, at least it doesn't attempt to rupture your eardrum like Orion does - and roaring as the T-rex does something useful! In PC, roars trigger different abilities for the dinosaurs. Neat. Also you can make the T-Rex headbang to music and that counts for a lot in my book. 
5147	1	a	Hands down best 99 cents you will ever buy on Steam. On whim bought for son and his friends and I am blown away how fun this game is. Hope the developers can earn some money on this because they deserve something. Co-op or single player with bots only, but very well done. Get it now.
846	1	a	Named Shank 2 for a reason. Other possible names: Knives 2, Machettes 2, A lot of Blood and Badassness 2  +: woo hoo it's a fun game. Nice graphics, great gameplay, gamepad supp, intel to collect, difficulty is balanced, story, cutscenes, blood, blood, enemies, bosses, weapons  - : sometimes annoying deaths but that's because wasn't good enough :(  overall GG, 8/10 would slice through peeps again
3245	1	a	This game originally released as orion dino beatdown and honestly it was pretty damn awful. but spiral is devoted to this game and the concept. I feel this game is in good hands and will blossom into an A plus game. This game is incredibly fun and can be tough at times but for its cheap price it is 100% worth every penny. And around the fourth quarter of 2014 they are updating the game with Orion:prelude which offers siginificant graphical updates to this stellar game. Do i reccomened this game? Hell yeah
1133	1	a	Great game. I'm skeptical about games with large discounts but this was worth the money and I reccomend this no matter what the cost
5682	1	a	Fight waves of dinosaurs with your friends, what more do you want from a game this cheap?  Also, props to the developers who stuck with the game for years and made it better instead of giving up
5806	1	a	I have seen a lot of people hate this game but I'm not sure why. I think this game is great, the bugs have been worked out and I have had a lot of fun. There is incredible co-op and it is a good experience. I would recommend buying it, ESPECIALLY when it is this cheap.
2345	0	a	Pros: It doesn't crash and seems relatively bug free  Cons: I had to pay a dollar to play this crap  Might be worth it if you're me aka you have a morbid fascination with design failure   
3821	1	a	Amazing game, not even $1. It's like a mix of Halo &amp; Planetside 2, but with DINOSOWERS!
3244	1	a	why dont i get the game????
6453	1	a	it got bedder then 2012herrnotre
5230	1	a	When i first started playing this game i was like 'what the hell is going on here?!', the moment i walked outside the spawn was like entering a hell, but then with dinosaurs. I had one word for it..'Whoa...'. Everywhere you look dino's walking, screaming, running, flying it was amazing! Even better is the Rampage mode where you can actually BE a f* DINOSAUR! One tip, to change the class you play, press 'N' to change it next time you die. Also i want to say the people i played with were very nice, and i think that there are way too less games of this. One bad thing is the clipping and hitboxes. My dinosaur could not get through a space where i had 2 M left on both sides, but then again, it's still making me laugh if i see how they magically walk side of the clif edge if you manage to get lose xD
2369	1	a	best 0,39 ill evr spend in my life 
3190	0	a	There are some server issues and not only that the game just keeps sending Dinos at you I love bears not Dinos
2883	0	a	If I didn't get it for only 99cents I might feel some serious buyer's remorse. Definitely not worth $15.00 let alone the 99cents. Clunky controls, unpolished game-modes, cookie-cutter builds, and shoddy environments.
868	1	a	I want Shank 3 plxxx
3543	0	a	ORION: Black Ops 3 is a highly original game.
1530	1	a	Ever punch a velociraptor in the face so hard it does a backflip as its head turns into a fine paste? Well now you can do so for a price worth paying to see it.
6060	1	a	lol i get this free somehow
5881	0	a	not a game for me
2238	1	a	The most fun you will have with friends. This game provides exactly what I would want in a single package. The ability to fly around with a jetpack and rocket launcher and blow off a T-Rex's face. The 3 class system gives the game depth and variaty, and the level progression, although slow, is very rewarding.  Normal survival modes are good for 15-30min stints into the realm of Dino hord, but its the survival mode tundra maps that take the cake. 1-2 hour journys to defend outposts from incoming attacks, this is the mode where you will be pulling out the big guns. Loads of time to earn the big moneys, loads of time to fly around exploding face.  9/10 for pure fun. Recommended
1358	0	a	I saw this game and it spoke me. You know what it said? It said, 'My developer is a 5 1/2 year old'
562	1	a	Fun Hack and Slay game, and definitely worth it if you get in on sale :)
1053	1	a	yeah its from EA but its a very polished game well executed but bad ported to pc, u will need a game pad and the game needs some steam achiv..its charming and disturbing, its a good indie game. u should give it a try :)
2942	1	a	''The most fun I've had since watching a hippo with explosive diarrhea. 10/10''
2458	1	a	This is one of the best mothertrucking, motherpooping and motherpeeing games I ever played! Its like Call Of Duty zombies but with dinosaurs and tons more guns, perks and gamemodes. Plus i got this game for 99 cents casue it was on the sale so its a very very extremely very good gameboy advanced game for only 99 cents know what I'm sayin G? They should put this game on Steam since it so good yo. Before i bought this game my D was like 2 inches, after I bought this game my D was still 2 inches but thats beside the point. Buy this game its amazing. This is my favorite Rockstar game GTA V step aside for this game. This is also the best Halo game ever made!
4857	0	a	One of the only games on steam that is not even worth a single dollar.
2320	1	a	You can play as a dino-suicide bomber.  11/10. Game of the year. 100% recommended.
834	1	a	If you liked Shank 1, you gotta buy Shank 2. People often talk about the commands, I see no problem with them, of course they are more complicated, but you can rebind the keys, also, the most complex commands let you do more complex attacks, tricks and such, not to mention its another challenge to be added to the game, it isn't hard, but still very entertaining, the graphics are amazing, now heading to the Story. Most people say the story sucks, in fact, it does not, if you pay attention to the storyline, tips hidden in the levels themselves and the secrets(called rebel intel)you can know much better about the story, and it isn't a bad one, you can acctually understand what happened, what is going on and why. There are games with better storylines, but this one isn't a bad one, its just a matter of perception. You can unlock new characters that have an utility instead of just reskins. The weapons and Multiplayer mode are also very nice, I recommend that game.
6336	1	a	Deffinately worth a dollar But i wouldnt pay full price by any means.
4536	1	a	[EN/FR] So... A lot of people say ''That game is Poo'', but that not real. At the begin, its was a empty bugged game, but the game get a lot of update, and completely change. Now the game is really nice, that not the best game ever, but for something make indie, and with a price down to 0.99Â¥, no reason to reject that game....  Il faut savoir que si Orion est aussi mal jugÃ©, c'est tous simplement que avant, ce n'etait rien d'autre qu'un jeu catastrophique. mais a l'heure actuelle, le jeu a Ã©normÃ©ment changÃ©, en un tres bon jeu, surtout pour un petit indie, avec un prix reduit a 0.99ï¿¥. A essayer, difficile de ce plaindre pour ce prix la....
198	1	a	Prototype's major boss fights will make you scratch your balls furiously with frustation for their tedious strategies and length.  Now that I got that out of the way, I really enjoyed Prototype, I must say I'm surprised at how fluid and ridiculous the combat was. I mean, your character, Alex Mercer, can transform his arm into a giant blade, a giant hammerfist, huge muscles, a sort of sling whiplash and much more. On top of the sweet combat, the exploration is awesome. Running up skyscrapers, airdashing, and gliding across Manhattan sounds awesome on paper, and plays awesome in the game. The gameplay is clearly where the developers spent the most time, as other areas were lacking.  I know the game was released in 2009, but if I compared it to other games released from 2009, or even 2008, the textures and models are put to shame, even the special effects, i.e; explosions, smoke, water, are kind of bad. There is little reaction in the water when you fall in it, when things blow up, the explosions are weak and not very volumetric, and the smoke within the explosions are unnatural. I'll take back that last one, considering how unnatural the game is, involving a virus that genetically changes people into super monsters.  The story wasn't bad, but it really wasn't that much to talk about. A lot of military conspiracy, which has been done several times, but at least there were twists in the plot and Alex Mercer, as a protagonist, is awesome and kicks â¥â¥â¥.  Play this game for the fun combat and gameplay, maybe for the story, but the graphics are certainly the weakest part.  8.3/10
3033	1	a	lots of fun. I paid $3.99 for this game and it's better than most of my $60.00 games and that makes me mad.
5982	1	a	Addicting, Fun objective.   Pros:  Fun, Cheap, and Addicting.  Cons: Bad Graphics, Poorly FPS Optimized, Some Items in game require real money, even tho this is a paid game.
6202	1	a	Haha.  Got a 4 pack for 0.75â¬.  It's fun for a round but I can't play it much longer.^^  You can buy it in a sale tho.
313	0	a	Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.
1915	1	a	Epic and fun! dirt cheap!
4542	1	a	I wasted 99 cents
4794	1	a	LOVE IT, SOLID
3879	1	a	It's a dinosaur hunting game...Online...with GUNS !! 10/10
2229	1	a	I don't think it's very good but I have to admit IT'S FUN AND GLITCHY AS HELL 
2106	1	a	Shooting T-rexes is fun. letting yar anger flow on thouse poor dinasours. TL;DR: -Pew Pew works -Hillerious bugs -Dead Multiplayer.  this game is buckets of fun, and if your going for 'Value for money' then this 0.99$ will surely provide its worth but a word of warning tho, if u expect to install this game and jump into a multiplayer with abunch of random people then dont, the multiplayer is dead at best, bring your own friend (Hey, its only 0.99 and it will provide hours of entertaiment)
1455	1	a	If you are bored and have nothing to play , try this , a child game but fun lol
470	1	a	Despite the Resoultion and the crappy story that doesn't seem to make sense the game is just so fun to play and screw around with thanks to the crazy abilites. Besides what other game allows you to pick up a random person on the street and power stomp them for health
2070	1	a	Good with friends but needs more depth.
781	1	a	Judging by its cover, one wouldn't immediately assume Gatling Gears to be a bullet hell shooter. Features familiar to this genre include dodging insane amounts of enemies and projectiles mid-combat as the camera forcefully pans horizontally or vertically.   Gatling Gears mixes the formula up by letting the player drive a ground-based machine. This not only heightens the player's maneuverability, but it also allows him to control the pace of the camera - a nice addition that aids the less hardcore audience.  For combat, there are a total of four different weapons at the player's disposal, three of which are upgradeable by collecting gold scattered through the levels. Using them skillfully is pivotal to maintaining a high multiplier which will boost your ranks in the leaderboards and unlock aesthetics.  In terms of a bullet hell shooter, Gatling Gears is arguably the most beautiful. However, it is neither the most challenging nor the most memorable. It's also pretty repetitive.  Grade: C
1158	1	a	Not bad game, I like to play it sometime.  Im selling this game gifts for cs go skins (it can be even 3.00$ or 4.00$ ill see, what u gonna offer), invite me to friends if you need. (2 left)  And i have one more game who costs 5.00$ and im selling it for cs go skins too  Invite if you need
969	1	a	Shank 2 is a huge improvement on the underlying gameplay for the series. Whereas the original amounts to a pretty imitation of the oldschool brawler games, Shank 2 is better in all aspects (+new coop survival) and stands on its own as a worthy entry for this genre.   Dear Esther may be more artsy but this is the better game for the same amount of money. You wouldn't go wrong paying 15 for this even, in fact that's what they should've charged!
5035	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucked
3434	1	a	good game to play if you have good teammates
708	0	a	Neat Concept, but in the end too short and too easy
334	0	a	I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings. I bought Prototype and Prototype 2 and now I am out $20 because I am most likely not going to ever play them again.
3015	0	a	What the F***K is this!?
5273	0	a	I AM CHOKING ON THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME JK
3697	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Do some research before buying this FOR THE LOVE OF GOD 1/10
1166	1	a	BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game. ItÂ´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (iÂ´m a Fast Paced Action lover) Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hourÂ´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games) It doesnt really has Story.  ItÂ´s more like short explains about BEEPÂ´s Skills in the levels (There are those 'info plattform') Controls were good i do not had any problemÂ´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it! Graphics are good. EmenyÂ´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the TresureÂ´s you can collect. In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!   Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)  Graphics: 6/10 (serveÂ´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)  Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)  Price: 7/10 (5â¬ seems fine to me)  Story: 3/10 (There isnÂ´t really much about to say)  Sound: 7/10 (like the GraphicÂ´s it serveÂ´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with itÂ´s effects)  Performance: 10/10 (no problemÂ´s @ all)   FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)
1633	0	a	Badly done, boring and low quality
1692	1	a	bugs and glitches galore but it has promise. its basically what halo combat evolved was supposed to be and doesn't hide the fact it pretty much ripped it off. but in a good way, hopefully it'll get better over time
4054	1	a	One of the absolute worst game I have ever played. Missing animations all over the place, and those that aren't are stiff as hell. Taht being said, I payed $0.99 for this, and I have had so much fun making fun of it and laughing with my friend. Great concept, horrible execution.
5480	1	a	This game is very addicting! Don't let the metacritic fool you. I've played my money's worth with this game a hundred times over.
1084	1	a	-Buy this game on sale -Get trading card -Sell it  Profit $$
2945	1	a	For a while, I was looking for a game that I could pick up and play without remorse. Orion takes everything that's fun about shooters and combines it into one package... with dinosaurs. You've got dinosaurs, laser-swords, jetpacks, tanks, mechs, and gorgeous level design.   The standard survival mode is a blast. Basically, you fight waves of dinosaurs that get harder each wave. Every now and then, you have to caputre an objective that's swarming with raptors. As the waves get harder, your access to powerful vehicles improves. But that doesn't mean you feel safe in a tank with a spinosaurus, t-rex, and triceratops around.   With the release of Orion: Prelude, there's a new game mode that lets two opposing teams kill waves and earn credits, which they can spend on upgrades for themselves or detriments for the other team. You can pay to increase the frequency of enemy hordes or even to send a t-rex at them. There are tons of other game modes, too, depending on what kinds of shooters you like to play. THere are 3 classes, all with different upgrades, and a bunch of different dinosaurs that are even playable in certain modes.   If this game isn't fun, I don't know what is. Orion gets 10 pouncing raptors out of 10 power-jumps.
4008	1	a	This game is fun if you like killing dinosaurs and the game kinda reminds me of halo with dinosaurs the metascore is off.
4325	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1096	1	a	Very fun and calming game to play. The physics are amazing while the plateforming mixes perfectly with the physics and combat. I recomend this game to any type of gamers because it really does capture almost all types of gameplay in one amazing game. Pros -Includes trading cards -Puzzles mixed with physics and plateforming make it a superior game with combat -Can run on a wired potatoe -Small price for a large and amazing game -A good game to play offline in like a airplane ect. Cons -Multiplayer I would really like to see a multiplayer version of this either its just playing the levels with a companion or its a death match I would really like to see it -Level editor Same as multiplayer I would really like to see this in the game and you could download other peoples stages off the workshop  But anyways, with or without multiplayer and/or level editor I strongly recommend this game to any type of gamer. 
5039	1	a	This game is honestly one of the best games I've ever played on steam! Endless hours of countless fun with friends combined with a game which requires great skill and strategy! I would recommend this game to my first born and tell him 'This is the game which revolutionised gaming as a whole! 10/10 would buy again      'NOT!' xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
921	1	a	Rip and tear through these weeklings all while having a vast array of badass costumes you can use! SO MUCH FUN!
6020	1	a	worth the dollar
842	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best Â£3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
5056	1	a	the game is awesome went it come to the guns you can use. the one thing i have problems with is i always die by t-rexs
6217	1	a	Fun for 50cents. Need graphics card and even then a bit laggy.
6350	1	a	it was great
6400	1	a	Ignore the metacritic score.
3432	1	a	spent 99c to buy this game.    it goes free 1 month later, rip asian cheap life
3812	1	a	scammed me from my dollar. WHY IS IT FREE.
2388	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde my first impression Ignore that metacritic, this isn't bad game. Play with friends for more fun  Vehicle, human, weapon are great, many maps and game modes!  some dinos and vehicle still slightly buggy, boring music background But anyway you paid peanut you got monkey, dont expect too much for this game
5966	0	a	I bought this game because of my love of dinosaurs, and it was only a buck, so I thought, 'Why not?'. I watched all the videos provided above, and they seemed really cool! Until I started the game. Unfortunately, I am not able to join any servers, no matter how hard I try. The closest I have gotten to real gameplay is being on the server list when the game is about to start, and then it just says I have lost connection to the host. I wish I could play this game for hours and hours and recommend it, but with these issues I just can't.
3749	1	a	Way better than the game it's meant to be preluding
356	0	a	Cool idea with great potential that's completely wasted.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by inFAMOUS, but I could not find this game enjoyable.
4148	1	a	I want this game to be free to play pay to win. Then I would play and eventually buy stuff espially if you only start with one class and can level to get new ones or by them with real money.
1710	1	a	I played this game on a 3-day weekend in 2013, I can't tell you how much I absolutely loved the game.  Recently I've been thinking back to it and wondering 'What am I doing with my life to not have baught this yet?'  Then it hit me, I NEED to buy it, so I did and it was the best choice I ever made, the game is amazing, and insanely fun to play.  For anyone who loves epic battles and insane weapons, I reccomend you buy this game immediatly.
5174	1	a	Screw you, Dom.
1140	1	a	i swear to god i hear 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
6120	0	a	I really don't know... I feel like it was better as Dino Horde than this. I'm sorry, but this change made me stop playing the game entirely.
6117	1	a	Great gaem , would shoot dinos again
1742	1	a	Really fun to play with friends, funny as and atually more fun than you probably think it would be. :) I recommend buying it and play with friends.
554	1	a	I â¥ this game
1326	0	a	This game is very annoying in that it does not allow a windowed mode with reduced graphical settings and is a resources hog otherwise for what it does.
4505	0	a	i forgot what it was about but it has a nice name
3987	1	a	blew dinosaur bits everywhere with helicopter rockets, 9/10
6080	1	a	1. Buy Ori and the Blind Forest 2. Play Ori and the Blind Forest 3. Sell Ori and the Blind Forest digital trading cards to little kids. 4. Buy Orion: Dino Horde with said little kid money. 5. Go back to playing Ori and the Blind Forest  50 cent hustles are what's really real XD
810	1	a	Bloody good time, side scroller with tons of blood, action and just fun to play. Using a controller makes for a more enjoyable game.
2827	1	a	Nice, fighting dinosaur with an assortment of weapons and vehicles, team work and a lot of gamemodes, worth to try.
958	1	a	Fast pace, 2 dimensions game. And good story line.
1817	1	a	I love this game
4374	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1199	0	a	Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didnât even try. The gameplay isnât anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from itâs somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.  I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when itâs on sale for $0.19. In the end, Iâd just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.
6094	1	a	'Jurassic park theme'
1552	1	a	Never have I had so much fun insulting a t-rex's mother while doing my best impersonation of Duke Nukem.  10/10 would shoot dinos again  and again  and again.
3792	1	a	Really a Great FUN game. I paid for it when it was on special but it is deffiently worth 14.99USD. I love the game. Everyone should buy it!!! :) :) :) Hours of fun
2875	1	a	This game brings back a lot of nostalgia from other games made in the past using the Unreal engine. It plays good, things work fine and there are some handy features to adjust some options.  There are plenty of modes; pvp and pve are a lot of fun, from killing dinosaurs, or suddenly finding Santa trying to kill you with presents.  This game is hilarious and fun. If you love FPS/TPS games or just for the fun you can have with this game, I would recommend this game to play alone, with random people or just with some friends. 
6357	1	a	Edit: The developers fixed this game up pretty good! When I reviewed this game back in 2014 it was a heap of trash but it is playable now and actually pretty entertaining. I've never seen a comeback like this before but kudos to the developers!  This game literally hurt to play. As a rule, I force myself to play at least an hour of a game before I make a final opinion but if I had the chance I would wipe that entire hour from my memory. If I had the option, I would trek across the planet fighting thousands of horrifying monsters to throw this game into a deep volcano just to wipe it off the face of the earth to save people the pain of going through what I did. When I was 11 I made a map for Delta Force Black Hawk down where the player ran away from alligators, this is that.. but an entire game with annoying, swooping pterodactyls. This is Raptor Island  (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401742/?ref_=nv_sr_1)  the game. You just pour endless amounts of bullets into seemingly mechanical dinosaurs until they finally keel over. Save yourself the $14.99.   To be fair to the developers, this game gets a fair share of positive reviews as well so maybe if it goes on sale again it's worth a look. Just putting in my 2 cents.
851	1	a	What a butt.
312	0	a	Mouse inputs didn't work. Kind of hard to like a game I can't play.
724	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
4958	0	a	Worse game I have ever played!  WhenI saw it was was like 'oh ok, looks pretty good and ok for $3.74. And then when I started to try to play it(Nothing wrong with the game in proformance). It does not have a quick match!  In all only mulitplayer games, there servers are poor, there's no configures like Passward Only, or Not Full Games. Hunting down a game is stupidly hard, heres a game! NOPE! it's full.  The actual game play: If you are a starter player, then you will be kicked out of games.... a lot  Heres an example.  SNIPER! SNIPER SPOTTED! GRAB THAT SNIPER! LOOK OUT! SNIPER!  'You have been kicked from Server'  what the â¥â¥â¥â¥?...   The game play part plays like Call of duty/Halo mixed.  And they only got 2 game modes Team elimation. Horde.  Which are boring because Team Eliminate only is 10 players, and you will die alot because of the leveling system is out of wack. and Horde, it just a tower defence but with Dinosaurs, and you'll be kicked out all the time.  -1/10
2531	1	a	DEFEND THE HARVESTER! 5/5 Would repair Harvester more.  _______  Nice game, might be little bit repetive since all the gearing and stuff. You get higher gear for higher difficultie ofc. Gameplay is simple, you can play top down or in third person mode. Some say this is pretty much Destiny clone so expect that kind of game. I dont know myself about it since I havent play Destiny. There is bunch of diffrent Gamemodes, Survival and defend the objective (Harvester) Bunch of diffrent Guardians to choose from, personaly I like pyro(shotgun primary and shotgun is the best :D) Diffrent guardians have diffrent special abilities. Little bit optimization after that game is great! I really enjoyed it, and I suggest you to pick up this if you like shooting dinos, topdown- or third person shooters,co-op games or just grinding and gearing.
185	1	a	Play this game !!!!!!!
1660	1	a	oh my god, this game is exactly what i wanted. at so many points i felt like the biggest badass ever. much love to the devs
3892	0	a	Uh, what? No explanation or anything, game just throws you into a clunky lobby and even clunkier gameplay with no explanation. Lame.
4441	1	a	What i liked about ORION: Prelude: ?  What i disliked about ORION: Prelude: ?  Overall rating: ?/10
101	1	a	I jumped 50 feet in the air and elbow dropped a tank. 10/10
2901	1	a	The game has its issues like the bug of when you host the server and when you use voice chat everyone can hear you but when they use voice chat you can't hear them.  The game is great and I've played a few matches with the developers and they are cool, fun to play with but they are mostly silent. Its fun if you like pvp or team based wave survival. Not to mention the two event maps with two hard boss battles that once you beat unlockd a special hat in your loadout, Which the developers should add more of those maps like an easter map, valentines day map, new years map. It would be cool, if you got 99 cents to spend i recommend you spend it on this game because this is the cheapest and most addicting game i have ever played! good going developers! keep up the good work and i hope you guys add more maps and secret unloackables to this game to keep us completionists busy!
740	0	a	The voice acting has got to be some of the worst of any game. The navigation is incredibuly slow and the puzzle are little more than pixel hunt fetch quests. The few actual puzzles that can be called that are just, well, bad...
4172	0	a	Biggest pile of.....  Yeah its a cheap game, but ive played played much better free to play games than this trollip. 6 attempts to try and connect to a game, when i finally did game was laggy as anything, internet connection is fine, and running a gtx960 which is more than enough to play this game.  Dont waste your money on this, only worth it for the 6 free badge cards, which if you sell will pay for the game itself.
1401	1	a	I bought this game during the sale in which it was 96% off. Generally, these type of platformers make me nervous, but for 19 cents I couldn't let it down. If you love platformer games, you will LOVE this game. It's a mix of adventure, puzzle solving, and strategy.

3748	1	a	i like this game a lot however there is some lag issues i recomend checking out the steam guild to fix it but overall AMAZING!! i love shootin them dinos:)
4552	1	a	I'm really enjoying this game, they gameplay is fun and a nice twist
2819	1	a	I don't have much experience and I bought it later last year to play with some friends, but they decided it wasn't worth playing. However, I had a great time playing it and I would easily recommend it to anyone who likes or appreciates a good first person/third person shooter.
3054	1	a	Good game to play with friends. Yes the game has some issues such as the other players character levitating the entire time but that creates some pretty hilarious moments. For .99 i would recommend this game. Very nice!
5246	1	a	I got this game from a friend of mine and we played it for a tad over 24 hours total. It is actually a horrible game if you start thinking about it (bad sound ok grafics and gameplay but quite some bugs and stuff), but for the low price it's actually ok, since you can have quite a lot of fun plinking around with friends. Oh speaking of which: DO NOT play this game ALONE, it completely and utterly SUCKS alone! Get at least 1 friend to play with you, otherwise fun=0 I also disagree about the micro-transacion thing in the game. I think this is the realm of free-to-play stuff, not games you actually have to pay for, even if it's just 1â¬! If you want a more serious and complete game i suggest you take a look at Primal Carnage, especially when it's on sale (since it's a little priceier) but I haven't played that one so I cann't comment on the quality. But as far as Orion goes: 1â¬ for 24 hours of fun gamelay? Why not? :)
3796	0	a	bad fps treatment
424	1	a	Game has a highly considerable chance of not working at all, be cautious.
4822	0	a	Not worth at any price. Steam service is horrid anyway.
4607	0	a	Cheap and boring shooter about dinosaurs.
6186	1	a	cheap fun great way to burn a few hours
2504	1	a	Well its like the best of Halo with the best of your childhood dino toys. Its like everything you ever wanted in a game. Because its purple dinosaurs and explosions
2586	1	a	You can stack a medic on a mech on a tank and be invincible. Best game on Steam 12.967/10.
3832	1	a	Absolutely worth every penny, CDN$ 1.09 spent well THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR MAKING MY LIFE. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY NEXT GEN QUALITY AND IS ABSOLUTELY GAME OF THE CENTURY
3940	1	a	gr8 b8 m8 i r8 it 8/8 no h8 cuz im l8 but w8 im only 8
5891	1	a	Fantastic. For the price this game is amazing and fun. For 99 Cents you can kill countless dinos. Take a little bit to get use to the way the game works but overall amazing game.
6572	1	a	Bought it for $0.99, I wouldn't have bought it otherwise for $15. But that's just cause i'm cheap. Either way, really fun game to mess arround in..hell, you can backstab a triceratops! Not disapointed at all!
1481	1	a	Great little game, I bought it on sale, but even for $1 equivalent it is well worth buying. It is a really great combination of platforming with strategic and creative use of a gun for shooting/manipulating items in the world.  Just buy it!
518	1	a	Good stuff. Some of the boss battles were pretty tough, especially the last one. I like the protagonist of the first game much more than the second one, but the government conspiracy story about viruses is good in both of these. I'd say Umbrella has something to learn from Gentek if you know what I mean.
4918	1	a	...Broken... This is the most BROKEN game i've ever played! Terrible frame rate, and looks like it is still in the alpha stage. The graphics are very low quality and it looks like something you do as a last minute project in a college game design class. If you are considering buying it... don't... pirate it first because otherwise your gonna be cheated out of money for a game that is just a re-release patch of Orion: Dino Beatdown. ...Broken... just wasted 3.3Gb of data on my computer
3301	1	a	it is quite fun, and it seems like developers are really committed. I would recommend this game as it is continuously improving. With that being said it is certainly worth the discounted price and will soon be worth its normal price. They should however list it as early access so people know it will get better.
3782	0	a	Its alright
462	1	a	Ever wanted to run around New York like spider man but kill random ppl like GTA here's your game.
678	1	a	WOW! I mean, this is just an awesome game! It offers the wonderful stragetic aspects of poker, with the bejeweled like rush of just creating attacks and chaining them. Sure, the poker aspect can be offputting for some people, but the liberal moving of the cards makes this game a lot more fun!
676	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
4846	0	a	What you would expect from a cheap game. Buggy but simple fun. I would only recommend this game if you and a couple of friends just wanted something to goof around on and not take seriously.
492	1	a	The game plays in New York where a virus broke out. You play as Alex Mercer who lost his mind. He's also infected and he has some special abilites or rather mutations. You can move free around New York and must complete missions. You can also upgrade yourself with exp which you are gaining through fights. I like the movment you can jump high and upgrade your abilites so that you can even fly a short time and it's just awesome to move from one skyscraper to another :D  This is a really cool game and even after you finished this game you can still move around the city and play just for fun. :)
6197	1	a	for the price its asking for this game is honestly good fun if you play it with friends, there are lots of weapon types and abilites most of which stand out from eachother and lots of percs and upgrades.  I think the devs are almsot under selling the game, its not perfect thats true but its not a game i cant say i regret buying 3 copies for me and my friends to play. just dont go in with high expectations and play with friends and fun will be had. : D
2385	1	a	ORION: Prelude. Worst game of 2013? Pfft... maybe 2013, but one of the best of 2015. Okay, that's a little much. I just really enjoy it. It's a fun, fast-paced dinosaur FPS heavily based on the Jurassic Park franchise (don't try to deny the inspiration). It's constant alter egos (ORION: Dino Horde, ORION: Dino Beatdown) can be a little bit annoying if one more comes along. Guardians of ORION seems like an okay game. If I were the people behind the game, swimming in pennies I would be cautious about releasing the full game yet. Even in early access. The trailer (  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3DSl9WmnWU  ) was okay, and seemed like pretty solid gameplay, with decent grapics. I would get it for under $5.00. Maybe at a discount for owning ORION: Prelude? I do kind of dislike the aspect of turning a dinosaur game into a team deathmatch. Maybe if the players could be dinosaurs in the deathmatches, but at this point, it's not the best part of the game. Should you buy this game? Yes. Buy the 4-Pack so you can give it to everyone you know. What's that? You know more than four other people? Well, buy more than one 4-Packs! Well, that's all I have. Thanks for actually reading this. You just read through a run-on paragraph created by a kid that games.
3949	1	a	You have a gun. You shoot Dinosaurs. Why? Because you have a gun. And there are Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. That's all that really needs saying.
3872	0	a	This game has so much potential, but it sucks so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bad. everything looks like â¥â¥â¥, buggy, and controls like running through knee deep mud. 2/10
3269	1	a	really fun
5475	1	a	This game boasts many game mods and playing hours, it's fun for solo but great for multiplayer, SDK coming out soon is crazy and I can't wait to see what will cook up.  Thank you devs for your continuous efforts and good luck!
4048	0	a	I bought this game on my laptop and it ran fine on the lowest settings and now I have a pc, And putting the game on low to med settings it will still lag, I dont understand this, on my laptop I have a gefirce 610m 2GB and on my pc I have a GTX 750ti which is far supirior, I would like to recomend this game but it runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, well the way it is optimized.] Apart from the graphics the gameplay is alot of fun, no servers but solo is alot of fun with bots. I can tell it is sort of like halo and dinosausrs together.  The controller mapping works great, not sure about keyboard. (didnt try) Overall I would not recomend as it runs very porly so unless this is fixed I cant recomend.
2977	0	a	Completely and utterly awful.
1362	0	a	Game was okay but I honestly didn't like it for some reasons
3411	1	a	The best game you can get for 99 cents. Imagine Killing Floor but with dinosaurs, its 99 cents... buy it.
987	1	a	Very Challenging and interesting game, the way you aquire and use your powers to solve puzzles are nice, the challenge mode is also very nice and the story has 3 different endings, that require you to play the game all over again, however, thats not a problem, since this game manages to be always entertaining and a great time waster. I recommend it, specially if you enjoy Puzzles and stealth based strategies...and if you don't enjoy stealth, you can be an uncontrolable killing machine too! :D
3631	0	a	It doesn't cooperate with my controller which is compatible for pc gaming. It is very irritating when holding down the shooting button nothing happens. There have been times in the game where I'd try moving forward and my character would just stand there. Not enough time to get a new weapon and when spawning my character would automatically die. If that were fixed then I'd totally recommend it.
2195	1	a	There are flying dinosuares.. i love it.. so much. yeah..
3690	0	a	Like surviving in a low-res dinosaur apocalypse, but without the fun.
5677	1	a	Its a quality game, and at this price point, its almost dumb to not buy it. The gameplay is pretty solid, bug free, and fun with some mates
3390	1	a	This game is literally sex
2860	0	a	How the heck does a game get progressively worse with time? Somehow ORION: Dino Horde accomplished that. This game used to be a fun coop game in the same vein as Killing Floor, except with dinosaurs and vehicles. Now the community is dead and I can see why with the extreme lag that gets worse with every update.
918	1	a	Very good game! Fun and fast
6192	1	a	I actually quite like this game! The game is a really fun experience for 50c on sale, allthough I do have some critisism to this game, even though it is practically free.   1. Like many games that are quite generic, like this one (wheter you like it or not) it needs something more special to it. One thing that I myself liked (at least in survival mode) is the jetpack feature for the assault. Whilst if you time your jetpacks right you will be able to pick up speed and travel further, but I would like this to be a bigger feature. something available for all classes. I would also try to make it so that the speeds that you'd be able to pick up where to be higher, so that a good player would basically be able to fly across the map with incredible speed!   2. The dinos AI isn't really the best, it basically just runs for you and if theres something in the way. It may struggle (this isn't all the time but it has happened).   3. Bots, the bots are well programmed, but I do think it's a bit sad though that they will not revive you most of the time, which is something I would like. because it would prolong the gametime and would make everything a more enjoyable experience.   these are just some points that I noticed whilst playing the game, but I have mostly played with bots and with the normal game mode. I really do consider this game a great game to play on a lan party and I will certanly be playing on the LAN parties that I am holding with a fairly consistent time span onbetween. I also wouldn't say no to a sponsor from the creator to get a couple of keys to give away to people of the LAN parties!   I would give this game a 7/10 a great game for the money and it has lots of potential!
1615	1	a	Greatest game ever.
348	0	a	Awesome game overall, the superpowers, destruction and the city just feels great. The negative things about the game is that the pc port is bad. First of is the max resoltion is 720p. The shadows and graphics are outdated even if you compare it to other games made 2009. There is next to no no graphics options  Framerate problems Awful keyboard and mouse controls  Its a game worth playing, its just no advantage to play it on PC.

4193	1	a	Love this game. Buyed it like an year ago, idk why i write this now, but it's just amazing.If you hate dinos and love Halo, this is the game for you.
237	1	a	Besides graphics still a pretty rad game. There needs to be a third game this series has soo much untapped potential
2374	1	a	It has dinosaurs.
3136	1	a	This Has to be the most fun ive ever had on a game its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing EVERYONE should have it Bloody 10000000/10!!!!!
511	1	a	this game is a lot of fun, but the missions and combat can get pretty repetitive after awhile. if i have a complaint its that instead of the challenges getting progressively harder, essentially they just throw more bad guys in the frame. i bought this heavily discounted, so i dont feel ripped off at all. i will probably buy the sequel when the price drop kicks in on it as well.   its extemely fun, but i havent felt the need to replay since i finished it. all in all, a better than average experience.
4047	0	a	played the game fo about 2 hours get bored cant get my money back tried to refund cant get the refund cuz of 20 minutes to much damn this game my money real good
3264	1	a	Its like the shootiest dino blasting adventure ever!!
5854	1	a	needs a bit of work but fun feels like cod zombies
681	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
2449	1	a	Recommended with a catch:   For the full $15 price? Of course not, that's absurdly high for the quality of the game.  For the $1 when it was on sale? Can't beat it for even a few laughs with some buddies. Pick it up (ON SALE ONLY, mind you) if you're bored and want something decidedly mediocre but oddly enjoyable...for a time. It's clunky, unpolished in places, and rather uninspired at times but is good for some stupid, brainless fun.  --I also can't believe that they get away with the editing and visual tweaking of the screenshots--the game DOES NOT look that good even on highest settings at full resolution. :\
6472	1	a	why did it go on my acount when i did not buy it and i have steam support its dus let me get in it said install help me same thing with call duty ghost 2player?????????? 
2016	1	a	Kudos to the developers. When I bought it game 2 years ago, I felt that it was meh, and left it alone after playing for an hour. Today, I thought, 'might as well try it again' and played it once more. It has improved vastly and is way more fun the way it is now. It's one of the best games FPS I've ever played so far and I had more fun in it than many other AAA titles. Definitely worth the $0.99 I spent on it. You should definitely give it a go!
4867	0	a	its good but a lil bit not ... you know the graphics and the movement try it your self and you will see
520	1	a	Genetic engineering gone out of control provoked New York to enter a state of quarentine. You find yourself in the role of Alex Mercer, a man without memory, and the Prototype. You can change your form and perform vicious combos against whoever want to opose you on your search for the truth.  Excellent controls, excellent art and a perfect open world setting in the city every man has grown to love. An excellent third-person sci-fi experience.
5940	1	a	still bad like before,bad server,big pings,etc.But this games was so good.Please fix dis games 
6189	0	a	I'm happy I only bought this game for 55 cents. It wasnt worth it. Not only can you make dinosaurs fly, but you can also be sent flying by them. Unoptomized too, It sucks to play, I probably damaged my eyes.
403	1	a	Awesome Gameplay, First Prototype and Even Prototype 2 Stays the Same I LOVE IT, Great Menus and Transitions.
1452	1	a	decent game for its price when its on 96%, some levels are quite challenging if u wanna get all the antimatter things ofc, decent platformer to pass some time
4540	1	a	I wasted 99 cents
3953	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex in the â¥â¥â¥ Would reccomend
5825	1	a	I don't think I've ever played this game before. 10/10
2392	1	a	You run around, shoot dinos, buy new weapons and drive mechs and choppers, whilst playing with other (usually) good peeps... What else do you need? It also runs quite good. Only problem is, it is kinda badly optimised, though it doesn't mean that the game will run like absolute dogsh**.
2050	1	a	This game's reviews are all over the place. Let's just get something straight. Other than having not enough maps this game runs smoothly, looks decent (on ultra) and doesn't crash (if your pc is good xD) I'd easily give this game an 8/10 for just general enjoyment. Anyone who has done survival and gotten bored just do conquest. Even though I have replayed conquest it still is fun each time.  :)
2822	1	a	It's ok i guess
4750	1	a	OKAY game, people behind it seem like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s though.
6555	0	a	I bought Pulsar: Lost Colony. It was accidentally released to the public in a non-working pre alpha state. Pulsar was more entertaining than this. The Video says something to the tune of 'Ignore the metacritic score. The devs listened to us and made this game better.' If this is better, I can't imagine the state it was in before. Who designed the levels? What's the point of spawning over a kilometer away from your DEFEND OBJECTIVE? You can't even set up stationary defenses along the way. You literally have to spend 5 minutes makin the trek to your base, or get lucky and stumble upon a vehicle. WHY????
1303	0	a	Meh. Glad it was 19c. Lackluster art, mechanics and overall game. If you're awake at 4AM for some unknow reason you might spend half an hour on it.
2052	1	a	Its not the money worth!!!!!!
1794	1	a	Got rammed by a Triceratops while I was in a tank and shot halfway across the map.  10/10 Would fly again
3704	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a Indie Game Shooter, that is amazing! The Graphics are standard from what you'll find from a Nintendo Wii or a Play Station 3 and this game is alright. Why people hate is soo much is because they hate it. HATERS GONNA HATE. Overall The Game is Amazing 7/10 Co-Op Your Main Objectives are surviving the Dinosaur Horde or Get the Generators Active.  Deathmatch Free for All whoever survives wins. Its a every man for himself.  Survival Survive the Horde and win the game  This Game has alot of potential and many of them survived but others failed. 7/10 from VivaTheGamer
5285	1	a	realy good game
1470	1	a	very fun platformer! easily worth the 49 cents it cost me :)
4953	0	a	The second â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game ever released  https://youtu.be/5lQ-IVIn6iM 
3650	1	a	its fun with friends xdd, plus its one dollar    â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t time xddd    U SHOOT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAUR STHAT TRY TO â¥â¥â¥â¥IN â¥â¥â¥â¥ U AND THEIR IS A SANTA BOSS THAT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RAPS UR â¥â¥â¥ WITH â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MISSILES
707	0	a	Ho hum. Incomplete - a prologue to a vaporware game. The card graphics are simply ordinary playing cards, the story is slight to the point of invisibility and totally linear. The gameplay is mildly amusing, maybe a fraction above playing MS Solitaire, but not complex enough to reward paying it much attention. Worth a dollar or two purely as a solitaire game, but certainly not worth paying even close to full price for.
1434	1	a	10/10
3612	1	a	There are games that get pumped up with so much hype whipping people into a frenzy, parting with their hard earned cash, only to then leave the gamer wishing they had not wasted their money, and then there are games that truly deserve the hype and actually end up exceeding the gamers expectations. Bioshock without any shadow of a doubt is in the class that should DEMAND you play the game. This game has the ability to suck you in, leaves you marvelling at just how much there is to do and the fun you can have doing it andâ¦ wellâ¦ quite frankly for the last four days certainly left me with severe lack of sleep as I just could not put the game down. In short this game rocks and must be played!  Bioshock the latest first person shooter from 2K Games and considered âspirituallyâ to be the successor to their previous System Shock 2 title, is set in 1960 starting with our hero Jack surviving a plane crash in the ocean and making his way in a bathysphere (mini submarine) travels to the underwater City that is Rapture. On his journey in the bathysphere Jack is painted a picture by a man named Ryan that Rapture is a beautiful and wonderful place to live, only to leave Jack bearing witness to a completely different picture arriving at Rapture and to a City that looks to be in ruin and with Jack quickly being attacked by a rather grim looking creature that is a Splicer. Armed with a two-way radio Jack is befriended by Atlas and starts his journey through Rapture for what will become the fight of his life. Welcome to Rapture, this is Bioshock and make sure you have a good stock of clean pants, because you are in for one Hell of a ride.  Control wise Bioshock is played from the first person perspective and the buttons are mapped very neatly. Your right shoulder button cycles through all your collected weapons with the right trigger controller the fire on each weapon. Holding the RB button brings up all your weapons and makes it a lot easier to quickly change to any weapon when the heat is on. The left shoulder button cycles through all your available plasmids (more on that later) with the left trigger activating your chosen plasmid. Again holding the LB button brings up all of your active plasmid choices and lets you switch quickly when needed. That leaves the face buttons to be assigned to the likes of using a med kit, reloading a weapon or topping up on your plasmid eve, interacting with objects and jumping. Finally the thumbsticks are then left to control movement and panning the camera and clicking in the thumbsticks will activate crouching (left) and also zoom control (right) if a weapon allows it.  The first thing you will notice in Bioshock apart from the fact you are deep underwater is that your surroundings are rather dark and as a hint for the people that have yet to play the game, before you even start playing you are asked to agree the lighting levels and if you feel the need, then whack it up slightly to help youâ¦ That said I never touched any settings as the mood is perfect and fitting for a destroyed city and getting leapt on by a Splicer out of the darkness is all part of the fun really.  Now while I leap into the gameplay aspect I donât want to give too much of the game away as the plot has more twists and turns than a roller coaster so I will leave the gameplay to what you have in front of you rather than what you are doing for who and who said what. But in saying that, and just to get the ball rollingâ¦ you have arrived in Rapture with Atlas talking you through where you need to go and with Ryan the creator of Rapture watching you on the CCTV system and seeming to think you are CIA or KGB decides to set his army of Splicers and bots on youâ¦ âWell nobody ever said life was easy â ehâ.  Surviving in Rapture will come down to a few things. Firstly there will be the choice of weapons from wrench through to pistol ending in a rather awesome flamethrower. The neat touch here is that these weapons seem to have been created after the city was in ruins with people fighting to survive so have a rather home feel DIY look to them bolted together with empty tins and what not rather than being all futuristic (well after all this is 1960). You will find weapons scattered throughout Rapture but your best bet is to look to prise them from the dead hands of a Splicer you just killed. You will also find two types of vending machines throughout every level of Rapture that will allow you to keep topping up on your supplies of ammo should you be running low â that said ammo can also be collected from fallen enemies and you should never struggle to be without. You will also later in the game have the ability to create your own ammo from bits and pieces you find scattered throughout Rapture with the U-Invent machines and you will also find weapon upgrade machines that can only be used once, but will change how your weapon operates improving it in certain categories.  Your second piece of survival comes down to plasmids, and plasmids genetically modify your bodiesâ structure allowing you to attack people in a whole new way. These plasmids include being able to shock someone, stunning them so you can move in for the kill, freezing someone allowing you to explode them into shards of ice and through to setting people on fire to name a few. Plasmids can be found throughout Rapture but later in the game pretty much becomes purchased with ADAM (will cover that little bit later). Just like you have a Health bar, you also have an Eve bar, and it is Eve that is the substance needed to sustain your use of plasmids. Top ups to Eve can be found in syringe form throughout Rapture or again by purchase from a vending machine/finding the syringes on dead bodies. Without doubt plasmids make the game what it is and are damn fun to use, and you will end up on the look out for bigger and better plasmids so you can experiment over and over again with new and stronger attacks. Having a Splicer run at you only for you to freeze them, whip out your shogun to watch them explode into tiny shards of ice never stopped being funny, amazing to see in action and damn cool to do. Aside from plasmids you also find and can purchase tonics, which are designed to enhance you in a number of ways from both physical attributes to mental. These cover the likes of being able to disappear if you stand still, through to being able to move faster all the way through to being able to hack objects easier. Tonics are not to be confused with plasmids, which in effect are weaponsâ¦ tonics are there to make your life a bit easier but are not physical weapons you can see in action â just think of them as enhanced abilities.  I referred to ADAM which essentially is the substance needed to enhance your abilities but gathering ADAM in itself presents you a constant two prong problem. Little girls in the game which are referred to as âLittle Sistersâ carry ADAM in their body, but your first problem is finding them with your second problem is having to get past their personal body guards that are the âBig Daddiesâ. Big Daddies are genetically modified and walk around in huge diving suits and carry enough armour and weaponry to scare the living daylights out of anyone. To get the ADAM you have to defeat the Big Daddy and then should you manage to do that the game then switches you to a moral choice to make in order to obtain your prize. When you move up to a Little Sister that has just lost her body guard by your hand you are given two choices. Harvest the ADAM which will give you the max amount but basically means killing the child, or rescue the girl which gives you less ADAM but with another character in the game (no spoilers as to who) promising you future rewards for having done so. Your moral choices will also ultimately give you two distinctive endings to the gameâ¦ I was the good guy and rescued them all, so I am yet to see my evil side ending, but having seen pieces wrote on it
2630	1	a	At first I was like, 'ok'. And then I was like, 'POWJAM MASSEEEAAAUUUUUUU WWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMM REM REM KATEM PEW PEW PEW AAAAAAHHHHH DINOSAUR INCOMING! WE NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM!' Shortly following that I was like, 'Martin we need to get this kid a band-aid.'   'The storyline was alright' 10/10 -Martin Septim   'Well I think we should.' 9/e John McCain
4711	0	a	Uninstall simulater 2k12
2135	1	a	I cant even explain this game... ITS THAT GOOD!!!
4712	1	a	Its ok... there isnt many dino games out there so its a good idea but just the way its made is just god awful with all the bugs and glitches and nonsense but its ok for what is worth i mean 1$ seems like a good price for this game and steam sales make it 0.79 cents soo thats even better or if ur lucky it will be 0.49 cents :D anyway all in all a ok game    4/10
2636	1	a	The metascore scores WRONG its really fun to play with friends 3 hours to go but only for 1â¬!
5297	1	a	Awesome game, quit heavy on your pc and sometimes a bit laggy when playing with other people but everything else is awesome!
997	0	a	EA accout crap.
2980	1	a	10/10 Best Lag Simulator of 2012-2014
3333	1	a	i dont have this game.
5630	0	a	Its not good, like at all. Everybody is praising it because it used to suck but it still sucks. It is very, very far from being a good game. The fact that it used to be worse than this scares me and makes me wonder how it got on the steam store at all. 2/10 - Shameful.
2295	1	a	IGN: 10/10 - 'They paid us'
6533	1	a	They did the cash shop right! Cheap easy and fast, just like my favorite kinda hooke--- tv dinner!  Graphics are great, though I wish the 3rd person view could be zoomed out a little. It would also be nice to have starting weapon for survival instaead of a pistol  All around 4/5!
5028	0	a	Sukmioff 
6413	1	a	For a dollar you can't really go wrong with this game. Dinos and jetpacks for a buck... Don't expect a gta, skyrim, or cod experience for a dollar if you do you're a moron. But all in all this game rocks for the price.
632	1	a	Have fun playing this game. I like Alex has various powers to use.  But sometimes its hard to control the movement and make Alex to move around. (Although it seems to improved in 2) The Target function is quite horrblie, not only hard to target an enemy, but also even you target an enemy, Alex goes to hit other target lol. Still, I enjoy playing this game.
2184	1	a	Its an ok game but it was an awesome buy because it was 0.99c 0.99c??????? damn dat is cheap and also if you want fun outof this game make sure atleast 2 other friends own it too  because almost everything is more fun with friends.
3191	1	a	Fell thru world and killed everything while being there. 5/5
2287	1	a	This game is hilariously fun with a group of friends. Playing on survival mode and blasting wave after wave of dinosaurs is pure gold. Ignore any older reviews (2012, 2013), they are for a different (and much crappier) version of this game. This new version is much improved, with a ton of game modes and weapon upgrades. The graphics and UI are still a bit rough around the edges, but the gameplay more than make up for it.
3469	1	a	still better than cod ghosts
2854	1	a	its good buy now its only 1eu
4519	1	a	To be totally honest, this game isn't that bad. It has very good and fun gameplay, but the developers gave up on the project a long time ago. It's still relatively enjoyable, and it's worth the small price tag. If you ever have a small bit of cash, throw it at ORION: Prelude. It's pretty fun with friends (although a little buggy), and the ragdolls are hilarious!  I've had this game since the day it came out, and I still think it's pretty good in terms of gameplay - acompanied by stunning graphics.
381	0	a	Don't buy this.   Lots of consolitis in this one. A camera that wants to do its own thing and frequent slow character animations that take you out of the gameplay. Third-person platforming. Enemy AI is terrible, and enemies just spawn around you rather than following a sensible path through the city. There is no persistence to the game world, making the missions to clean up the city completely pointless. The missions themselves are repetitive. Ends in a frustrating final boss fight,
3341	1	a	Bought it for a dollar. You shoot dinosaurs. Pretty fun for LAN parties, but not the best for single-player, in my opinion.
1320	0	a	Its crap it was given to me as a gift, but is still a rip off.
2208	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3632	0	a	Literally Don't Buy This Horrible â¥â¥â¥â¥!
1051	1	a	A really tiny game and the story is simple: you are a alien. You are caught by a scienist group when you fell onto Earth and they attempt to 'look inside' you. Your power is peeled and you need to get your power back and escape from the lab.   Yet the game is very attractive in its idea. The ailen is able to walk through items( including humans ) in order to escape from traps, gunfires and deadly mechine. You need to think where to hide, where to put the items and where to go first in order to get to your destination?   As a Indie game, it is no compare to those 'big company' product, but the presentation and the creativity are really impressive.   If you are looking for a tiny fun game to smile and think, get this one and you wont regret.
4717	1	a	this game...... i have no words, this game is pure donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game makes me so moist everytime i play it. i always have to play it one handed cause im too busy fapping off to these 8k pure shitbrain graphics, this game is da absolute shiiiiiiit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! you got all these fine â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs running around, and then you got all these guns that are just pure pizza testicles, i give this game a wopping 12/10 would definitly bang
4773	0	a	The game is a mediocre shooter, but the devs are the main reason I'm giving this game a negative review. I do not want to support developers that partake in asset theft. You can google the developer for more information, there is so much shady going on there.
5330	0	a	36/100 Metacritic is too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing generous.
3710	1	a	Cool game  cool Devs  the game is insane lol is like Star Wars Vs Jurasic Park  pls you can use a light saber  and is free like come one is worth it to download
1408	1	a	Pretty fun its the best 15p i spent in along time
5060	1	a	Didn't expect too much when I bought it, but this is definitely worth the money I paid for it, and more. A surprising amount of fun in such a small package. I would recommend this to anyone.
3655	0	a	its nice but the controls are very crazy wierd and the attacks of the dinos are not very well made when u attack it feels as if ur not even doing any damage to the enemy humans players can win easily needs moore very crucial updates will change review if changes are made correctly.
456	1	a	Dismemberment, impalement and slaughter of innocents. Also, karate kicks to helicopters as Penny Arcade so aptly put it.
599	1	a	You will poop your pants with excitement!
3144	1	a	This game is somewhat unstable at random times but if you are patient, this game can be give you a good laugh. The Metascore is too low even with it updated. The online experience lacks trolls and it enforces people to stick together and communicate. The short time that it was on sale for $1 was the best time to get it. It is not worth the Store price but is worth more than $1. Very fun if you have friends. It is also a good experience by yourself. Very fun overall
2376	1	a	This game was great, I definatley recommend it to everyone else. Can't wait until my copy evolves into Orion:Prelude
3382	1	a	The best things in life arent free. But a damn good game can be $1
5781	1	a	Played this game for a mere 20min; and it was by far the most ridiculously fun 20min I have spent playing a PC game. Does it have a brilliant narrative like Halo? Absolutely not. Does it have dynamic gameplay like Deus Ex or Remember Me? Well, no. But let me just say this. I rode on top of a Triceratops, ramming it into a T-Rex which then proceeded to knock me off and trample me while my teammates crashed a vehicle into a building. Yes, that is all that needs to be expressed/said here.
5308	1	a	i liked this game because the dinos are very colorfull and that the guns and melee weapons are very powerfull
2116	1	a	Played for 5 minutes. Drove into a t-rex. Flew 70 feet into the air and into my doom. 10/10 would fly again.
591	1	a	Just perfect and,guys ,don't say :the game have lots of lag.my computer is a work computer and runs at 30/40 fps
5063	1	a	Game is unfinished and buggy, but wow. I just fired 1000 bullets continuously into a horde of T-Rexes wearing Triceratops masks.
3804	0	a	game doesn't start. 10/10 would play again
2160	1	a	Hi Billy Mays here!  Well what can I say about this piece of art. it's like Planetsides classes and vehicles made a baby with Killing Floors fight 10 waves of baddies.   But wait there is more! Dinosaurs, that throw rocks at ya! Jetpacks! And also loads of weapons to pew pew the *beep* out of dinos!  Billy Mays approved!
107	1	a	Although the storyline is pretty lame and repetitive, there is a huge amount of fun to be had in throwing cars at helicopters, slicing pedestrians in half and stealing helicopters.  Decent graphics, great gameplay, meh storyline.  6.5/10
1856	1	a	Futuristic weapons killing dinosaurs? This game is the most fun that YOU'RE not having! Many different game types to suit varied tastes; Hilarious achievements to unlock -including 'Dude on the Toilet,' which Jurassic Park fans will instantly recognize; I'm telling you... I haven't had this much fun since I was blowing up stuff on the demo range. -kniF taR
3915	1	a	its alright i guess
3008	0	a	  i've been waiting for this game to be in my library for a long time... and then, one day, it was free to play! i downloaded it and... i was disappointed, even though i love dinosaurs and guns... im sorry... graphics = bad, gameplay = bad... im sorry...
6273	1	a	It's $0.99 cents usd. Get it. It's fun.   DO IT! 10/10
430	1	a	Fun game, must play esp with $10 price. Looking forward for Prototype 2!
5623	1	a	So, Are you guys smoking something? This is worth more than a dollar.
1921	1	a	This is the best game ever it has 4 pvp modes and 1 pve mode and there will be free title updates (dlc packs) in artic dlc (dlc pack 3) conquest is returning! Man i missed that mode and i played it since orion dino beatdown
3670	1	a	Its so good you the creator must be proud
3952	1	a	Super fun for the money and lots of content.
4069	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends, and in summary I give it a 7.5/10. The only game-breaking thing I've encountered are the two most annoying enemies in video game history. Spitting dinosaurs that take forever to kill, and pterodactyls similar to rakks in Borderlands, but can grab you and 1-hit KO you. Buy this on a sale, not for full price.  ==============EDIT 4/1/15============== They fixed the annoying enemies (birds are still annoying when in the helicopter, but that's understandable), and generally made the game much better! They give you $20 of credit to customize your character at the start, which is great. The game looks and feels much better since I've last played it. Servers are a tiny bit glitchy but not too glitchy to become annoying.  9/10 great fun with friends.
5604	1	a	11/10 would play the worst game ever again :D
695	1	a	It's a solid game, very innovative combination of poker and fantasy TCG game style. Unfortunatelly, it lacks multiplayer game mode which would be fun to play. However, the single player storyline is interesting and the whole game atmosphere is very nice. I especially liked the in-game music, I must say I really enjoy listening to it.
1114	1	a	Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale.  Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it).   + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent.  + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out. + Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though. + There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle. + Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible.  + Some twist or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power, enemy, new kind of environmental hazard. Doesn't get monotonous. + Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet. - Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch. - No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.   Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.
3111	1	a	It's a cool game , pretty cheap , it's amazing.
4137	1	a	Good/Bad All I can say. There are pros and cons. Mechanics are ok. Graphics could use some work. Game needs to include a better chat system as well as an in game speach system. Overall it is fun. I recommend the lightsaber duels. :)
18	1	a	A jaunt back to an admittably frustrating period in my childhood, a return to the King's Quest franchise reminds me that modern adventure games, be they ever so complex, could not possibly be as mind-bogglingly frustrating as some of the games in this series. It's fun to look back, but I don't know that these games would be particularly palatable to a younger audience, and there's a LOT of 'mother may I' throughout the series.  Some sort of technical issue is preventing me from playing anything before 4, but I will give a callout to the series for having a strong, relatable female protagonist in 4.
390	1	a	Welcome to Manhattan Island, New York. Your name, Alex Mercer, protagonist. Roaming the city with a fractured memory, he finds himself not quite what he used to be. Infected with an unknown virus and hunted by the Marines &amp; an insidious Lab called Gentek Alex must survive in order to learn what happened to him. As he progresses throughout the infected city, he learns that the pathogen quickly assimilates every living cell in the human body, even the clothes he wears which makes him virtually the perfect shape shifter. He tracks down his sister &amp;s an old girlfriend who helps him along the way only to find out he does not like what he remembers. In this game youâll be able to disguise yourself and infiltrate Top Secret Military bases, gain control of Massively Armored Thermobaric Tanks &amp; Fully Weaponized Air Gunships like the AH-64D Apache. Customize Melee/Combo attacks, Upgrade weapons and body armor, this game a lot to offer.
3566	1	a	Have you ever felt like you wanted to play CS but also dinosaurs? Have you ever wanted to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of holy â¥â¥â¥â¥? Have you ever craved that sweet sense of pleasure you get from committing genocide on an extinct species? Then this game is for you!  There's almost 65 billion things to do! -ride cars -shoot dinosaurs -fall off of towers -ride cars -get upgrades -ride cars -ride cars  With so much stuff, this game feels like an unlimited amount of awesome! Just think of something, anything, and statistically you probably can't do it in this game. But out of the things you can do in this game, you can do all of them in this game! (Including leading those terrifying flying dudes into your friend's heli!)       420/10 3dank5me -ride cars
3140	1	a	Well worth the $0.99 its great fun
1544	1	a	Call of duty. For 50 cents. With dinosaurs. 10/10- IGN
2885	0	a	Poor quality, redundent gameplay.
1327	0	a	No windowed mode option, no video settings!
8	1	a	This collection is a must-have childhood classic for most of us. Rubbish graphics, zero mouse support for a lot of the earliest games, and yet I will still be putting hours into this for years to come (bye-bye to single-playthrough AAA titles).
2923	1	a	It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! ( Âº ÍÊ Âº)
2789	1	a	This game is addicting. The instant you purchase this game, all of your friends will attempt to disassociate with you as fast as possible, so no one will play other games with you, and you will have nothing to do outside of games. This leaves you with three options: Literature, single player games, and school. Literature sucks, so that's out. Single player games like Skyrim all seem bland after the immersive cooperative experiences you face in ORION, so they're out. What's left is ORION, which, like a fine liquor, must be taken in small doses. Your life will become a tempest of ORION and nothingness, continually honing your dino horde removal skills lest the apocalypse occur while slowly devolving towards insanity in the breaks between ORION sessions. Eventually, like an alcoholic, the tradition and care that playing ORION carries will be replaced by a burning desire to play ORION, and do nothing but play ORION. The periods of insanity in between sessions become periods of insanity in between maps. You will turn to heroin and methamphetamines as a means of escape of these loading screens, hoping that as your perception of time dilates, the game of ORION will blur into one continuous stretch. ORION is the world, and the world is ORION. ORION is you, and you are ORION. Time and space are replaced by an infinite moment, a string that coils in upon itself forever, the Mobius strip, the Ourobouros, the infinite, of ORION. Eventually, your mind fades to black, and the last thing your mortal eyes can comprehend is the image of a triceratops foot stomping on a human face, forever.  10/10 would play again
4629	1	a	Lemme tell you a story: One upon a time there was a player who was eager to get the 'You're Redikulous' achievement, so he hosted a game playing with his fellow friends. The group of dino hunters progressed as they withstood thousands of gigantic lizards. Two hours later, when they finally reached the last wave with the near victory in sight, the host started to run into a wall, followed by the message 'server timeout'.  GG  
4612	0	a	This game is a mindless, boring shooter. You are just shooting on Dinosaurs, wchich don't even pose a threat to you. Maybe the bosses are more fun, but i quit after half an hour because the rest of the game is just boring. It's not even worth 10 cents. It's just a waste of time.
1121	1	a	Simple, colorful yeah may be too much simple but it has a gravity gun! Give it a change
1808	1	a	this is a fun game especially if your a person that enjoyed something like killing floor.
6232	1	a	This is a really really good game, very friendly for most pcs, can run on mostly anything, has really good content, i love it. Havent played a lot, but from the little i have i really did enjoy it.
831	1	a	If you see this dude, just stay away from him or he will shred you to pieces.
1782	0	a	I ventured into this game excited by the void in my heart which could be filled with dinosaurs. However I came out of this game with half my brain missing. It is very poor. Furthermore this game along with Chivalry Medieval Warfare have been getting rather jealous recently as I havn't played them for a while. They have started to attack and pillage my internet connection. As a result i have rung up BT and they are sending me a new home hub. All because this game is garbage and gets jealous of other, better games on the market. Avoid if you enjoy your sanity/internet connection.
4796	1	a	make the dinos extinct again in a glitchy manner but sh:t it was (nearly) 99cents 10/10
5164	1	a	I really like this game, I honestly can't believe how cheap it is for the quality. It has a lot of replay value also IMO since you can level up to 70 and you unlock stuff along the way. There are 3 classes and in some game modes you can play as the Dinos! Lots of different guns and perks (Augments) that you can buy for the match with money you make from killing dinos in that match. There is also cool armor, hats, and blade colors you can buy outside of matches to make your guy look really nifty. For what it is, this game is awesome and I highly recommend it.
5972	0	a	Why does this game even exist?
1138	1	a	A game where you can shoot robots, and use their corpses as a stepping stone. Really smoothly controlled and it is easily worth the price that you get it for.
1805	0	a	This game can be fun at times. Playing survival whilst flying in helicopters and blowing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of dinosaurs is pretty fun, but this doesn't make up for the downsides.  The graphics in this game is meh, just meh. The lens flares can literally be blinding on some maps and the textures for the dinosaurs make them look like Jurassic Park CGI (the first one). For some reason, this game is EXTREMELY laggy. Even with my GTX 650 and 8 GB of ram, this game can only run around 30 frames per second. Not only this, but it looks made for the Wii.   The gameplay mechanics are much like Left for Dead 2, except worse. You survive wave after wave of dinosaurs trying to destroy your generator (sidebar, why the heck do they go for the generator?). Then you need to go 'hold points,' after which you are awarded with different vehicles (ranged from jeeps with miniguns, jeeps with no point, a tank, a mech, and yes, helicopters). These vehicles have the absolute WORST driving mechanics...you control your vehicles...with your mouse. It's SOO HARD! You're constantly crashing into things which damges your vehicles quite a lot. You also are able to purchase weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and upgrade your character, which overall is not that bad of a system. Other than lacking a good variety of weapons.   So there is one last problem with this game...the dinosaur AI. Literally the flying dinosaurs (my friends and I call them poops) are the most irritating mob in this game. They randomly divebomb you and have a possiblity of picking you up and dropping you from great hights. They for some reason put dinosaurs that we all reconize (ect triceratops) as bosses that try to kill you. But wait, aren't triceratops herbivores? APPARENTLY NOT!  Overall this is a good game if you get it on sale. It's hilarous to play with your friends and get a good laugh at for it's attempt at being good. DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE, NOT WORTH IT.

2248	1	a	A free-roaming FPS with very good,enjoyable gameplay,multiple weapons/perks/vehicles,character customisation. Totally worth your money! Plus,you get to shoot AND play as a dinosaur!!  10/10
4973	0	a	  idk, got it when it was free, and the game didnt work. so now that it looks like it actually works, it trying to make me buy it, so i guess ill pass on this one.
5520	1	a	Game is pretty badass but very poorly optimized
6035	1	a	I DIDN'T TALK TO NOBODY YESTERDAY, I WAS IN THE CAR TAKING A â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!
1109	1	a	Kinda fun, puzzle game that you would play if you're waiting for something.
4349	0	a	Laggs sooooooooooo much other wise id play it!
2370	1	a	Metacritic lied to me   10/10
25	1	a	Love this collection, brings me back to the old days :D
5231	1	a	as long as you don't mind losing, this game is great. When a T-rex gets ahold of you are most likely toast. It is a bit hard to win you may have to turn it down to noob. Come on you are fighting dinosaurs with a tiny gun. What do you want? You are crunchy and taste good with ketuchup.
1334	1	a	Really fun game with lots of gameplay and amazing for the price!
201	1	a	Awesome game :)  Thanks for creating it Radical Entertainment.
669	1	a	The map is a bit cumbersome, but overall this is a very good game. If you like the original Puzzle Quest, you'll probably like this.
1155	1	a	Awesome game with unique graphics and interesting level selecting design.
3839	0	a	this game is really good but the massive lag spoils what could be an amazing game
5930	1	a	this is the best game ever
2610	1	a	This game is like dinosaurs on steroids it really made you rage quit when a stegosaurus dash onto you  10/10  recommended for dino lovers  Try no scope the raptors
3961	0	a	You got caught stealing but instead of manning up and admitting you tried to play the victim.   You have managed to get a large majority of gamers to side with Activision, one of the most hated publishers...  BRAVO!  I hate activision as much the next guy, probably more, but you sir, is truly despicable and I am ashamed to have this bag of stolen assets in my game library.
5620	1	a	bought all of the Augments, Turned from a HALO Spartan IV into a Spartan I
182	1	a	My mom got me this game in 2009 for the PS3. She witnessed me cutting through hoards of civilians with bigass scissor hands, a massive smile on my face as blood drenched the streets.   Ever since then, she became skeptical about my trench coat collection.
2266	1	a	Its fun but theres alot of room to expand on this, maybe after a few addons or updates, i might get the game!
4747	0	a	Not even worth $0.49
2400	1	a	its very fun to play with friends not alone.lol. sorry if my review is bland. I just tell it like it is.
1509	1	a	What can I say about ORION: Prelude? Let's start with what it's  not ...  It's not a perfect game. It's not 100% bug-free. It's not a contender for Game Of The Year.  But more importantly, let's go on to what it  is ...  It's extremely fun. It's very well supported. It's extremely fun. It's got a great community. It's extremely fun. It's amazing value for money. Did I mention that it's extremely fun?  For the price, you wouldn't believe that this is a fully-fledged multiplayer FPS with solid progression, numerous weapons and power-ups, a decent array of vehicles and goddam  dinosaurs  to gun down! But that's exactly what it is. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it but it certainly doesn't feel like a Â£0.79p / $0.99c game. In fact, I reckon this is the single best value for money of any game in my entire collection. I've certainly got my 79p worth and then some - and I still keep coming back for more!  If you like multiplayer FPS and you're not literally penniless, why are you still reading this review? At this price, just buy it already!
1957	1	a	Definately worth it, especially since it is on sale. Ton's of game types, great graphics. Don't listen to the meta score.
2269	1	a	cool
290	1	a	YOU ELBOW DROP TANKS. also there might be a story or something but I wasn't paying attention because YOU CAN ELBOW DROP TANKS.
5204	1	a	I wish there was a so-so option for recommending this game because Orion:Prelude is a somewhat of a decent Dinosaur game, it's sort of like Primal Carnage but doesn't have as good of graphical quality. The dinosaur selection in this game is ok where you can chose seven dinosaurs, two pterosaurs,and one Deinosuchus which also makes unique because there aren't alot of games out there that allow you to play as a Deinosuchus. Overall its an ok game. Overall score: 5.5/10.
3072	1	a	The Metacritic score is wrong, the 38 score is for the first game (Dino Beatdown), not this game This game is totally fun and have 10 game modes and it's more fun when playing multiplayer of 5 players instead of single player, and the map is huge Although the animation is kinda odd, example the dino animation and player running animation, but it's forgivable I think, as long as the gameplay is fun The graphic is cool, but in my computer is kinda lag when I maxed out the graphic option in 1080p  And, the dino is playable too  I recommended this game 85/100
2439	1	a	umm... my pc is super crappy only about 5 fps but i still play this awsome game i recomend dis game 10/10 would play again. dont mind how long i playd its my pc freezzzzzzzzzzinggg alot =)
4030	0	a	It's killing floor, with dinosaurs.
3903	1	a	Pretty cool!  A lot of content/game modes.
3000	1	a	lovely game, especially if you love slaying dinosaurs. but turn down the graphics if you're computer is running slow.
490	1	a	Batman meets Resident Evil... in a good way
1290	0	a	interesting world map if not impractical. its a basic platformer which i would expect to be on newgrounds or kongregate not worth its normal price
3902	1	a	I don't own this game, but I was allowed to write a review for it, which is nice. 10/10
286	1	a	Pretty cool so far.
3062	1	a	It has its momets,but I would not buy it for more then $10.
1387	1	a	Pretty puzzle game !!! its Recommended!
650	1	a	I honestly think this is the first computer based card game I have ever played. I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer). Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.
6012	1	a	Love it. I only have one problem though. I don't know what it might be but sometimes when I open it up, it opens then once the full screen kicks in, it goes black the shows my desktop again. I try to click the icon only doing the same thing. I can hear the unreal and trek sounds then it just stops. I try to reopen it after closing it but it does the same thing. I also do wish I could get a better CPU because it always runs out of CPU power and crashes. That is all. Great game though love it. Bought it for all of my friends.
4119	0	a	Give me my euro back!

2929	1	a	Better than crysis 2
4638	1	a	Best Game I've Played in a very long time!, In the league of Battlefield 4, Crysis 3, and beats NS2 and most of my other FPS games.
5772	1	a	im so proud of the devs who put the time and care, to transform a game like this is impressive bravo. 
2232	1	a	In all honesty, I am incredibly hard to hook as far as video games are concerned. There are plenty of games that I will play once, but for me to enjoy any kind of longevity with a single title is rare indeed. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this will be one of the few awesome games I end up spending a whole lot of awesome time with. Crazy awesome dino A.I., powerful weapons, an addictive counter-strikeesque upgrade system, 5 player co-op, vehicles crazier than anything you've seen in Halo. And that's just one game type! This is an awesome game for awesome people. Any one who can remember being a child watching jurassic park and having halo welcome you into adolescence will absolutely adore this game.
6206	0	a	Terrible game, do not purshase. BUGs, bad gameplay and historyless.
2862	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA
191	1	a	I love this game. I've played through it more than once, and you could spend endless hours on it it without actually making in progress into the game.
6046	1	a	1.Bought game 2. Was extremly laggy  3. Directions not clear enough dinousuar stuck in toaster 4. Game stops lagging 5. Buy pistol 6. Buy Primary  7. Spend all of my money on this game. Orion :Prelude is love Orion:Prelude is life. 8/10
4437	1	a	it's like monster hunter with guns    10/10 would start generator while getting thrown by rocks again
3733	0	a	This was a waste of 99 Cents
2096	1	a	Its a good game just try it!
4134	1	a	Omyyygawwshhhh! Super Duper Omega addictive! It's fun, Kewlll, worth the price considering it only cost 3 bucks!
3997	0	a	Hahaha, this is hilariously bad. I mean for a game it's lacking so much. It feels more like a mod that is still deep in beta. The ratings are pretty accurate here. I won't say that you'd be hurting too much getting this for $1.00 but I don't recommend getting this for it's full $15 price. It was atleast humurous to play but I don't think I'd be getting in it again anytime soon.   Revelations 2012/ Bioshock infinite
1932	0	a	This game is a turd. A giant, messy Dino-turd. Even my kids hate it, and they LOVE dinosaurs. Nothing else to say.
2436	1	a	Most fun I have had for a dollar...except that time in Thiland
1264	1	a	BEEP is the best game in the world would have paid $20 for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5626	0	a	This may be one of the worst games I've ever played. I made it through one match before the mad animations, terrible graphics, and the lack of sounds for certain weapons got to me.
5573	1	a	Tell me why this game is so cheap?
1695	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  KILLED A T-REX BY HEADSHOT WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER, BLEW UP 17 RAPTORS WITH A GRENADE, 360 NO SCOPE A DILOPHOSAURUS DOWN THE THROAT WITH A SNIPER RIFLE AND PUNCHED A PTERDACTYL IN THE FACE IN LESS THEN 5 SECONDS WHILE USING JETPACK WHILE IN SLOW MOTION!!!!!   420/69 IGN

3173	1	a	for very few money this very much play i think i rate 7/10 good game yes ))
5731	1	a	This is the best game that im played in years. Also very addicting. If you dont have this game get it right now.
5688	1	a	Well I can use my lightsaber to fight the Dino horde 10/10!
5279	1	a	Orion Dino Horde is fast and furious (Hectic in fact). It is fun and adrenaline fuel at it's best. Gameplay is smooth and the conrols are superb. This game has evolved from a motley dog to a supreme gaming experience. Hat's off to the dev team for salvaging this as the concept was solid. There are also 250 steam achievements ...
5261	0	a	Dinosaurs? More like DinoSORES! Hah! This game is terrible. Just awful. If you play this game, you're scum. If you made this game, you're scum.
6096	1	a	I have just played this twice with a few mates in Co-Op Quite enjoyed it and wanna get into it some more
1123	1	a	This game is awsome! The level design is good and can be challenging at times. I love the sound affects from the chacters and the music. The game also has a lot of levels and will keep u busy for a LONG time.
5521	1	a	This game is great for co-op, it's like left 4 dead. Nothing much but it's fun if you're with your friends.
3410	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
635	1	a	Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker. I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event. Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing. It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.  Runespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline. Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this. If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game. However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.  Verdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem. Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well. The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features. While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into. Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.
6464	0	a	Sloppy as hell and the network is held together by a potatoe
3651	0	a	Unless you want an overwhelming urge to kill yourself after 10 min of gameplay then i dont think this game is for you...
1722	1	a	WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS GAME.
4456	0	a	LAME, uninstalled this turd soon after playing it for a bit.
1592	1	a	This game cost me Â£0.39. Its the best Â£0.39, I have ever spent. Simple game. You get cars, you buy guns, you defend points and shoot dinos. What more could you want?  10/10 would buy again
838	1	a	This game has it all, its one of them arcade games but with a great story to it. Shank 2 reminds me of 'Commando' which was on miniclip and Shank 2 made it like that, but on steroids. The art is great the becuase it is like a comic feature. The combo system and the combat brilliant, Everything is great. The best Â£3 ive spent, its been a while since ive played a fast pace action video game and this is one i'd reccomend to people. :)
23	1	a	I absolutely LOVED this game growing up. It's pretty nostalgic for me, and even though *I* can't quite get the oldest games in the series to work (it wants me to reconfigure some settings for graphics and then it looks weird), I'm sure somebody more tech-savvy than myself could.
1732	1	a	Its like halo but with dinosaurs - IGN
116	1	a	story is meh, gameplay is hours and hours of fun when you unlock all abilities
4588	0	a	To sum up my experience: it's a crappy left 4 dead with dinosaurs with blur that'd make you think your eyesight is going bad. 'but it's only 1 dollar kappa' CHILDREN IN AFRICA COULD'VE EATEN YOUR DOLLAR! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
529	1	a	Large open city and your a one man army.  Let the carnage begin.
1667	1	a	I paid $1.09 for this game not knowing what it was all about but the screenshots looked pleasing, it's very easy to learn how to play. I find this game really fun, so simple, yet very good.
3428	1	a	I got the game for like 1 buck. Really worth it when it was on sale, gave my friends and I a couple hours of fun. Though I don't think it's worth the 15. It's really the same thing over and over. Other than that it was fun for a bit.
5838	1	a	well if youre looking for a good game that is cheap this is it i think its on of my favorites because it has a good multiplayer mode and the singleplayer mode is nothing to laugh at over all it is a great game for 1 $ i think its a great deal
6124	1	a	Dont 40 hours from this game, but for 3 dollars, the four pack is worth the money, buy it for you and three friends, its pretty fun.
5045	1	a	very exciting gameplay and fun to play with your friends :D
1240	1	a	Nice gameplay! ;dd
787	1	a	Very good, polished and dissestressing
2153	1	a	Jumped off of a rock on top of a Stegosaurus and stabbed it to death with a laser knife  10/10
6551	1	a	Great game if you have some friends to play it with.
1739	1	a	The only way to interact with dinosaurs, is to shoot them in the head, while smaller dinosaurs gnaw on your BALLS. 10/10
1418	1	a	Awesome Sauce!!!! .19 cents best price ever!
3373	0	a	I just bought and played Orion: Dino Horde because it was on sale for a buck. I immediately regret this purchase. I knew the game was under development hell but itâs just so bad. And the community is worse than the game itself. Itâs just filled with kids who think the game is better Call of Duty but even Call of Duty has some polish. Itâs just so bad. The controls are so clunky even after changing the terrible default key bindings. Movement and aiming feel so stiff. There are so many missing animations. Guns sound and feel like peashooters. Even rocket launchers look, sound and feel weak. The art design looks like your generic scifi shooter. The music is bland. There is just no redeeming quality about this game. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I canât believe something like this is even on Steam. It feels like an alpha build but it isn't. Itâs a full game that has been officially released for 2 years now. And the sad thing is that was a kickstarter project. I almost feel sorry for the poor shmucks that funded this now obvious cashgrab.
4439	1	a	it is fun
2772	1	a	Anyone that says this isn't worth the 0.99 price is kidding themselves. If you can muster up 9 friends then this game will be a blast (just load up a server and play Vital mode). The second biggest drawback is that there is little documentation on setting server administration but if you have any experience at all with UDK you'll be fine. The absolute biggest drawback though is that multiplayer setup is handled poorly with password protection pretty much not working (so get your buddies to join your server quickly).  
2760	1	a	Call of Duty Zombies, but with DINOSAURS instead. Good for the price.
4821	0	a	this game sucks it lags way to much
229	1	a	Campaign is enjoyable but you'll spend a lot more time just running around wreaking havoc. Zero replay value.
2687	1	a	This game is pretty cool for his price, it's very cool
934	1	a	A good platforming blast with humour.
5447	1	a	Not a great game, but for the asking price, at least the graphics are worth it!
2846	1	a	You literally run around slaughtering dinosaurs with your friends. It is my civil duty to recommend this game and yours to buy it.
1335	0	a	Crap game with boring level design and â¥â¥â¥â¥ performance on a pretty decent laptop. Didn't enjoy having to search every inch of every level to progress.
4086	0	a	Quite stupid. It could have had much more variety.
5817	1	a	so good for being such a bad game.
1024	1	a	who would turn down the opportunity to play as an overly agressive sentient teleporting jelly that can warp inside people? exactly. 10/10 would warp agen
3523	0	a	After getting into the game I said 'It looks like the entire graphics design budget was 2 cans of Mountain Dew'. After playing for a while and seeing all the bugs and glitches I said 'Nevermind, the budget for the entire game was one can. I was in the process of figuring out how to refund when I noticed the option to write a review. I'll continue after this. If you want to waste the (fortunately very low) price of the game, go for it. But don't expect a well made game, or even a decently made one.
2149	1	a	Hilarious Co-Op shooter , with dinosaurs, shotguns, bows and bugs (THE BUGS!) Cheaper then a can of coke? i dont even like Coke, so i chose this instead, and didnt regret it. However no matter what spec your pc/laptop is prepare for some bad fps at a few times, but it is 50p so who cares?
2876	1	a	cool game AAAAAAAAA+
3761	1	a	cheap and fun 
1421	1	a	I didn't think it looked fun when I was gifted it for a friend.  In fact, I only installed it for laughs  Now, No matter how childish and simple the game LOOKS,  There is actually a challenge to the game  Some things are fun, too  Such as beating an enemy to death, with a dead enemy.  Even the unkillable beetle thingies with a powerful deathray,  Just bash it with the corpse of an enemy  10/10 would play challenging childs games and bash enemies with their fallen counterparts
5536	1	a	Why isnt this 100% positive? WHAT THE HELL HAS THIS WORLD COME TOO?
4125	1	a	It's free now so cool but i spent like $0.75 a few months ago.  Good game, but yeah like i need money (that bad i know) so i refunded it yeah cool
1060	1	a	Tight controls, colorful levels, zany enemies...would recommend for younger audiences, not really equipped to challenge an adult audience.   Play this one with your kids.
5597	1	a	Why is there not a pro scene for this game?!
4244	1	a	dont buy it
6268	1	a	Dinosaurs,big dinosaurs,small dinosaurs,flying dinosaurs and guns and some â¥â¥â¥â¥tards to play with u game
5728	1	a	10/10 BEST GAEM. It's like TF2, CS:GO, Halo, KF, and L4D had a GLORIOUS BABY.  For $1, you MUST buy this game! It is TOTALLY WORTH IT!
5077	1	a	you get to punch dinosaurs
4884	0	a	unless this game has been updated its a huge garbage factory
1045	1	a	if you like Portal games... you'll like this one... so much fun and bloody! xD
4699	1	a	  my grandma had an aneurysm and instead of helping her and calling 911 i played this game instead and to be honest it was worth it because my grandma is an absolute nincompoop xdddddddddddddddD
5197	1	a	I PLAYED THE DEMO AND LOVED IT !!!
3126	0	a	Writing to just inform people of the shady background of the current developers of this game -    http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cefrz/orion_dino_beatdown_has_just_been_updated_to_the/   and   http://www.dualshockers.com/2011/03/14/update-project-director-of-orion-prelude-david-prassel-leaving-his-employees-high-and-dry/   Basically the developer (David Prassel) took the $20k received from the Kickstarter project, and promptly fired his team.  Also, the 15 minutes I played of the game was mediocre at best.
835	1	a	Play it if you are a fan of side scrolling beat-em-ups.
4632	0	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAID FOR THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ NOW ITS FREE TO PLAY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS STEAM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
1091	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
2627	1	a	Orion has been through many phases getting better &amp; better every time, (even though it has been getting more &amp; more powerful so PEOPLE TURN DOWN THE SETTINGS) also you can be a dinosaur. There are many, many achievements to unlock &amp; this is also very fun with friends. I can reccoment this game (an even better review with a more powerful PC) with a 8.2/10 (with the update that allows ships into the game 9.8/10)
152	1	a	I love this game. I had it on PS3 when it launched, and just bought it because I wanted to play through it again. My favorite open world game, ever. I wish you could play it in 1080p, but oh well, it's an older game, I guess. I wish the sequel had lived upto the original.
700	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this one. Just play couple of battles and you've pretty much seen it all. The game is tedious even if you manage to play it through in a couple of hours. The story is pretty indefferent: something about fantasy creatures roaming in Dark age Europe and mythic religious references. Sure if you're a fan of new card games, then go ahead and invest. Something new which get old pretty fast.
224	1	a	Okay Game play wise, its okay. Nothing to freak out about. I mean you got your destroy everything, but since thats basiclly all of todays games in general there's nothing special about it.  As far as story goes. Ive seen games like this all the time, your some guy who gains powers of incredible poportions and you go to seek revenge against the bad guy yada yada yada. If you dont belive me look at the games such as, Infamous (the whole inteir series), Dishonerd, Bioshock infinite, and so on. So as far as story wise, its pretty basic. This game is nothing to aw at, but that does not mean you shouldn't get it (well at least while its on sale) My Gaming Score 5 Hungry Alexses/10
2416	1	a	i definly recomed this game Amaziing 
235	1	a	the best. enough said.buy it
3321	1	a	I first saw this game when it was on sale, and when I watched the videos and read the reviews, I thought it was a joke. So I bought it. When I started playing it at first, I had no clue what was going on. After trying different gamemodes, I finally understood the joke and began enjoying the lighthearted and jesting atmosphere. To be honest, this game is a joke. But not a bad joke that gets told over and over again and makes you want to punch whoever is telling it. No, this game is a joke that pulls you in, chews you up, spits you out, and makes you want to start all over again. And I like it.
5223	1	a	this game is fun as coop. game . i like its grafics . it suits game too. its pice is good too. i think more ppl could give it a try :D
2676	1	a	Best buy at this price. Not the best game overall, but it gets really funny when you gather up with some friends. Lots of vehicles, helicopters, great weather effects, challenging achievements, and so on. You can also download and try maps made by the community, so the game doesn't really stay repetitive or boring.
1087	1	a	 ..beep?   Seriously, though. It's a fun game if you're looking for something to waste your time on or just mindlessly explore.
2539	1	a	Good engine graphics,can be a ps2 games,cheap :) and many sarcasm in this review :)
1118	1	a	Get it soon now, as it got big discount, only cost few bucks. It's a good game to wasting your times btw
6175	0	a	The FPS is horrible, and i thought after having this game for a few years and attempting to come back they would have atleast fixed the fps. no its not my computer, i have a gaming computer, its the servers zzz
5576	1	a	10/10  Would play halo with dinosaurs again.    -NGI   wait you mean this isnt halo?
73	0	a	Absolute waste. I could not save my game. Requested a refund after 24 minutes.
6228	1	a	Great game for 82 cents a 4-pack. Bought this for all my friends.
391	0	a	This is pretty much the worst copycat game I have ever played. And there are some pretty crappy copycat games out there. I'm sure for those of you who haven't played InFamous, it was great, but please, for the love of tater chips, play InFamous. The series so much better. And no, I'm not saying this because the graphics are terrible. I've been in love with InFamous since the first one.
1517	1	a	Yes, buy this game. Its Killing floor + Halo + Turok.  It has its flaws, but the devs seem devoted and are present on the steam forums. If you played this game in beta and not again(like me) give it another shot, it is now playable(LoL) and quite awesome. The difference is uncanny. I reinstalled it yesterday and I'm already level 11. It never felt like grinding. Buy a four pack, get some friends who will play installed and have a blast together.   For me the biggest con is the limited players. That easy to solve though, buy and play this WAY under priced game.

3255	0	a	Well in my video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQqNG5YizcE  near the end you can see the overall qualiy of this game. The graphics are kinda bad and glitches run rampant.
3679	0	a	Since I was young, I have always had a raging passion for dinosaurs. My room was covered in dinosaur posters, and while my friends were playing with their action figures, I'd be cuddling with my Stegosaurus stuffed animal. Boy, those were the days. Now, back to my review of Orion: Prelude. Upon first glance on Steam, I was befuddled. My heart began to pound. A game for only 99 cents... and it has dinosaurs! Purchasing this game was nearly a no-brainer, the only problem I encountered was giving up 1/10 of my hourly wage from McDonalds to pay for a game. But hey, for some childhood nostalgia, it had to be worth it. I couldn't be more wrong. This game wanted me to kill the ones I loved. My enthusiasm for these creatures was one of endearment, and Orion: Prelude was telling me to hurt the animal I idolized. How could I agree? After completing a round of this mindless horde against cute little raptors and a righteous Tricerotops, I had enough. I immediately quit the game, and spent the rest of my Friday evening crying to myself about how the world is so morally evil, like most Friday nights... well most nights in general. But thats besides the point. This game attempted to ruin my zeal toward dinosaurs, and I couldn't take such a harsh hit to my life. I will be forced to use the Steam refund policy and spend my money somewhere else.
1925	1	a	Ate dinosaur egg and died pregnant with them 20/10
2974	1	a	Even though this game isn't perfect, it has a number of bugs and has gotten a lot of negative critique, I must say: it's fun. It really is! It isn't that fun to play alone, but with friends the game is super fun. If you're into dinosaurs and like FPS games, you should really give this game a try. I'm really enjoying it.  Also, the developers are really active and talk to the community, and they release patches often with more content to explore and bug fixes.
5023	0	a	Diarrhea.
2662	1	a	You use jetpacks and laser guns to kill acid spitting velociraptors and it costs as much as a small pack of gum, of course i recommend it.
1030	1	a	Warp is a different way of thinking but I loved the challenge and the game play.
6047	1	a	Let me start this review off by saying one thing:  I reccomend this game for one thing only, and that is the fact that it costs 1 dollar. If this costed 15 bucks like it used to, I wouldn't reccomend this game. Additionally, I have played this game a bit, and I have enjoyed my time with it. I did start playing when the game was known as ORION: Dino Horde, and this is what I will be partly basing my review on. And finally, I will be avoiding all gamemodes except the dinosaur survival, because it's the only gamemode that is actually unique and fun.  When I first bought this game, I got the four pack for 3.99 and gave it to my friends. We didn't really know what to expect, but we all just jumped right in and played survival.  At first, we all sucked, and we were just fooling around. We only played survival mode and we couldn't even beat it on medium. Nevertheless, we found ourselves laughing and having fun, joking at the audio glitches, the UI bugs, and what became known as 'the reload glitch' (melee while reloading and it instantly fills the clip).  The best part was, the game was still 'In development.' All this stuff would improve! More dinosaurs, maybe new maps, the bugs would get fixed, and the game would be replayability.  This, of course, is where we all were wrong. I believe I have had the game for roughly a year and a half, maybe more. In that time, there has only been ONE major update. Don't be fooled by the video on the store page stating that it has had 60 updates. Most of those updates just changed small things like the main menu layout, or adding in-game purchases for clothing items to add to your character (which is a really lame way to get more money). There was one long hyped update where they changed the name of the game, and the developers stated how they were planning to make sequels to this game. I honestly think that they changed the name so people looking up reviews for 'Dino Beatdown' and 'Dino Horde' would not be associated with this game. Even after the '60 + updates' the game still is riddled with stupid glitches. If you accidentally double click a perk you already bought in the armor upgrades, whoops! Cause the game will just deduct your credits again! I can't tell you how many times either me or my friends have accidentally done this and lost a bunch of money we needed for something else. The shotguns are glitchy, too. if you zoom in after shooting you don't even have to pump it. If you get picked up by a pterodactyl, you can fall in the rocks in the maps and get stuck completely. If you're a support and try to heal yourself while looking at a dinosaur at close range, it won't heal you and it just displays the health of the dinosaur (which it shouldn't do) yet it still drains your energy.   In all this time, they have barely improved anything. From what I recall, all the major things they added are just these strange cartoon-styled multiplayer maps. And no, not the dinosaur survival multiplayer, but the really basic and lame PvP. The PvP just feels forced and it is really boring unless you do it with friends. The new maps they made for dinosaur survival were just reskins of the ones that were already in the game. They haven't added any creative new additions to the game, not that it had much creativity to begin with. The weapons, vehicles, and character designs all seem like a blatant rip-off of Halo, especially the vehicles. The jeep looks and funtions like a Warthog. The Dragonfly looks and functions like a Ghost. The Helicopter REALLY looks like and functions like a Hornet.  But that's not all. The game itself is really, really unbalanced. You get three classes to pick in survival, but the support class is ridiculously overpowered. You get a medic gun that you can use to heal yourself. And because you run faster than all dinosaur types except the giant ones, you pretty much never die. Sure, the assault class gets a jetpack, which you can use to just camp on the rocks and never take damage from raptors, but you can just buy the jump upgrade on support and camp the same way. And finally, the recon class is worthless. It comes with 'camo' which just turns you invisible. This is completely worthless, except when you have to revive someone. Oh, wait: with support you don't have to stand by them and you can just shoot your medic gun at them to revive. There's really no point in buying half the guns, either. One of the pistols is way better than the rest (M40) because it is both high damage, accurate, and fast firing. Most of the primary weapons cost similar amounts, so you never end up buying the weaker ones because you really don't have to. In fact, I usually just save up for the sniper rifle which can kill large boss dinosaurs like the T-Rex in a few hits. Unfortunately, the game is really easy unless you play on hard or higher. However once you play a few hours hard will probably be too easy as well.  The developers have really just not tried with the game. I remember how, in that one large update, they hyped stuff up. 'Oh boy, we're going to add bots to single player! Now you don't need friends to play with others!' What we got were inept AI bots that are programmed to hover around objective that the player is near. They ALWAYS shoot and never melee, even if a dinosaur is in front of their face. They don't even follow you around, they just teleport to you when you go to capture the base objectives. The worst part is that they are programmed to revive you, but it feels like they only go for you if you are within a certain distance of you, so half the time they just ignore me when I go down. 'But we also added weather effects!' All that happens is rain just drips on your visor and the sky turns into fog. It's really disappointing to see the game abandoned like this.  The game isn't all bad though. It is fun to mess around with your friends, especially on some of the larger maps that require you to use the vehicles and have day night cycles. The (small) online community isn't just a bunch of hackers, and I have met some nice people. The graphics are fairly nice for what I'm concerned. The core gameplay is solid, despite having many repeating elements (Same boss dinos spawn on each round on each difficulty every time). I've had some fun with this game.    TL;DR:   When it first came out the bugs were excusable, but it's been over a year and the developers haven't improved their poor game design decisions, fixed some unbalanced gameplay like the classes, or added any decent or unique content to improve the game. Feels like they abandoned the game and are just trying to get as much money they can out of it. Only worth buying because it costs one dollar and it is fun to play with friends.  
5685	1	a	59p are you kidding me??? This game is worth Â£9.99! Killed a dino with the help of my younger cousin!   10/10 would murder extinct species again with a family member

2217	1	a	WARNING ! DINO-HAZARD DETECTED ! GRAB YOUR GEAR AND BE EATEN !  Awesome, Co-op actions !
1258	1	a	It has cussing robots in the game and random anime in the arkwork section  11/10
2580	1	a	Best dinosaur-quickscope simulator out there.  Wonna get rekt by a t-rex and fly out of the map trying to understand what the f*** is going on? Well this is game for you.
3376	1	a	It was worth the 59 cents I spent on it
1733	1	a	Would have spent $40 To get this game.  Legit. Amazing multiplayer game.  11/10
4934	0	a	total trash. should be free.
3751	1	a	New, quick-review is as follows: The game has definitely improved in almost every area since launch. Some textures on buildings and the general vehicle design might be amateurish, but I recommend you look beyond these minor issues and find at least one friend to get the game, (perhaps on sale, or if you're an indie supporter buy at full price) as getting together to mow down scores of prehistoric beasts is great fun!   OLD REVIEW BELOW I recommend AVOIDING this game, unless it is: A) On Sale; like it is today for less than 4 USD (August 19, 2013) B) Something you and your friends would enjoy playing together for some stupid fun
800	1	a	This game ought to have more attention. Side scrolling hack and slash, manly death heterosexual warfare. The only game I can think of in which a solution to a shark attack is ripping its jaws out from its mouth. Over the top violence without being lol edgy.
6325	1	a	Killing Floor with dinosaurs and capes
1519	1	a	You pay for what you get. The FPS mechanics are awful, seriously awful, but - in the end - is a fun budget sandbox game about shooting dinosaurs together.  Do not expect much more.  P.S. I'm gonna say Yes only thanks to its cost (0,99â¬) and the addition of a Steam Workshop.
2926	1	a	In the famous words of george bush, 'i did 9/11' This single statement by our former president perfectly describes what you would do to get a copy of this game. This game, coded as a collaborative project between william shakespeare and God himself, is a masterpiece of modern society. People always say that games like ARMA and HOtoful Boyfriend are real simulators, but this game takes the simulation to an entirely new level. In no other game or simulator will you ever feel like you are actually killing hordes of dinosaurs, never will you feel like you are actually going to be eaten and digested by a T-rex. In my short time so far playing this game, i have already contracted severe PTSD and need to scream myself asleep every night in fear that the dinosaurs will come back and rule the world, but thanks to this game, i will be ready to fight them. This game is worth 80 times more than steam is currently listing it, and should be fixed, i bought 40 copies of this game to give to all my friends, just so they too could be graced with the elegance and beuaty that is this work of art. I already know of more than 17 individual people who have attempted to infiltrate fort knox just to get money to buy 9 million copies of this game for the entire country of Sweden to play. Overall the game is perfect and at this point addition to the game whould only degrade its quality. You should spend no less than $144,760 for this game for not just you but everyone you have ever met. (9.00*10^100)/10
4306	1	a	Kill dinosaurs. Buy guns. Kill more dinosaurs. Buy more guns. Kill more dinosaurs. 10/8 what more could you want.
1555	1	a	For it's price, it's great. Had fun playing with friends.
3972	1	a	Rolled away from a raptor and right into the T-Rex's mouth. Got eaten immediately and thrown across the map.   10/10
3166	1	a	Awsome Game!! :D
2100	1	a	This game is AWESOME! never experienced any bugs or any glitches, the game runs so smoothly.
2951	0	a	This game is so terrible! How do you mess up a game with dino's and jetpacks? idk but somehow they did. save your self the cash and just play litterally any other game
2474	1	a	36 metascore rate? What they were thinking. This game is just fabulous. Besides that it have some minor bugs, it gives you hours of fun and teamplay. Very recommended for the ones that love big guns, ships, cars and dinosaurs.
3055	1	a	The developers changed the name of the game and now my gifted copy disappeared! wtf! I JUST WANT TO PLAY!
2365	1	a	This game is hours of fun, looks good (dat weather) and come on - killing dinosaurs! The only problem I've had is bad ping 'but â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents'
4409	1	a	So I decided to go ahead, disregard the Metacritic score for the old version and give this game a try. And after trying the free demo, I had to buy the actual game - the whole setting is so over-the-top hilarious - shooting down hordes of dinosaurs in coop mode - and the actual gameplay is a lot of fun!  There is no tutorial of any sort, so you'll have to give yourself a bit of time to figure out how stuff works and what you are actually supposed to do - but once you jetpack on top of a rock, thinking you are safe from the hordes of dinos running below and planning to snipe them off one after another - and then some flying dino dives down, picks you up and pulls you high up in the air, only to then drop you once you start shooting at the critty - then you're hooked ;)  Super fun, and a developer with tons of humour and a huge commitment to this game.
3521	0	a	The Co-op in this game is quite fun to play with some friends, but i wouldn't recommend buying this game as it is increbile buggy if your are going to play solo. Also the developers appear to be rather nasty people. D:&lt;
3702	0	a	
3297	1	a	Not the best but very very far from the worst. This is like halo, and bit of borderlands and a dose of coop mixed in.  A great way to waaste time.
6121	0	a	Amidst the plethora of multiplayer dinosaur games released around the same time as this one, came ORION: Prelude, previously going by a different name I can't remember.   Frankly, I found this game to be a waste of what short time I spent on it and the $1 that I spent on it as well. It is un-original, has some of the quirkiest physics and game mechanics I have ever seen, and in general just really fails to deliver an enjoyable experience outside of the initial learning phase. There isn't anything unique or fun about this game and it really ended up being $1 I would rather have bought candy at a gas station with.  The game got boring quick, with nothing different than any of the other dinosaur games really, and seems to have a fanbase with similar personalities to the people who drool over Nazi Zombies in the latest Treyarch Call of Duty release. The developers seem to be having fun with it, which is good, but I honestly don't see a reason to promote them for this game in the slightest. They delivered a fairly buggy, un-original title amongst a sea of the same genre.  I would not recommend this game, even given its extremely low price point.
6503	0	a	This game is downright horrible, check the reviews on youtube (TotalBiscuit, Tobuscus) for the reasons why because its g.o.d.d.a.m.n awful. Played for an hour and uninstalled. Wasn't even worth my 0.99 euros.
924	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
755	0	a	you get the character standing in front of the hotel, and you got through the dialogue up to entering the hotel, and that's it. you have no cursor anywhere on my screen you can't do anything. Why Sell Crap like this. Steam is Going to Crap Selling Crap like this.
416	1	a	Runs great on my system (Windows 7 x 64, 8Gig HD 6670). Frame rate is great during game play. At first it would have the sound and graphic hiccups everyone else is talking about but for me all those problems went away as soon as I turned off vsync so I would suggest that be the first thing you try if you have the sound/graphics problems.
2863	1	a	Jurassic Park on PCP.

4167	0	a	I tried it, I didn't like it. It has... it's... ... I DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS NOT BAD. Just not my cup of tea. Maybe it just didn't make sense to me... or not creative at all? Whatever it is... I'll pass.
6493	0	a	i'm glad I got this when it was a buck because I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if I spend more than a dallor on this trash game. The controls are sluggish, the graphics are a joke and the overall evperience gets really boring after a few hours of playing. during matched you can upgrade your weapons and also yourself but for some reason the weapon area and the augment area are to far apart to get to both curing the cool down timer between waves. Why the hell do we have to return to 2 different building to upgrade our stuff. After a match it should be a menu you pull down and can upgrade whatever you want. I don't understand how this game has so many good reviews. dont waste your money
232	1	a	All Time Best Sense of Freedom.I Love It
4800	1	a	halo wth dinosaurs just epic
2336	1	a	Awesome game! It's like Jurassic Park meets Halo! I would recommend this game for people who just love killing hordes of monsters!
660	1	a	Nice twist on poker. I liked it
2963	1	a	7/10
979	1	a	Good fun to play, but honestly a lot more fun if this had co-op. Co-op is only in limited survival mode...bah!
3622	0	a	there is too much llag and the game crashes alot 10/10 would stick a shovel in their â¥â¥â¥
6203	1	a	10/10 would waste 99 cents again
5101	0	a	Game might be fun but all I get are errors when trying to connect to a game...too early to say it's a waste...but don't really know how much more time to wait to play a game.
3979	1	a	If they could just smooth out some of the gameplay the way it is, the game itself would be fun. RIght now it's too clunky, gets very frustraiting in the higher level waves when you can't move appropriatly. Otherwise I'm looking forward to seeing how this game shapes up!
489	1	a	It is cooll running on the streets breaking everything... Hehehehe
1814	0	a	 Onion Prelube
2077	1	a	I bought this game when it first came out and everyone hated it. I've always like it but that being said I've always enjoyed wave survival games. I think for a dollar this game is a steal for a dollar and definitely worth a play with a couple friends. I bouth it for twenty way back then and I've definitely got my money's worth out of it. Great developer too, they've been updating and refining it for years since release at no cost.
6283	0	a	laggy servers, no people play this game.
3098	0	a	Applied for refund, uninstalled game. I do not want to support this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WurLQ0XLf20   To those who want a refund, you can get one through steam directly.  Follow the instructions here:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966   Hope this helps!
5389	1	a	Much better than metacritic gives it credit for
1248	1	a	Very Fun platformer. IT HAS A GRAV GUN. 20/10
5999	1	a	its a little bit laggy but its ok when you restart and refresh the game  
481	1	a	Awesome game, it reminds me of the Spiderman games, more so Web of Shadows than the other games. It's fluid in controls and really fun to play. There's multiple aspects to the game and it lets you create your own playstyle. Like sensing your opponents and then bashing their heads in? It has that. Like blindly slicing your way through crowds for fun? It has that. Do you like shooting people? It has that too. There's a variety of different ways to play and it lets you choose your own style which I like a lot. The different power-ups and upgrades alone are what should keep you playing, with each added power it gives you more freedom to do things the way you want to.
183	1	a	The game goes out of its way to give a bad first impression -- if your graphics card is half decent/recent, the game will get confused and think you can only do ridiculously low resolutions. So you fix that by installing some stuff. Next, the sound is ridiculously quiet. So you fix that by installing some stuff. Then, the game drops you into a scene with no background or context, which is bad in itself, and the visuals are really pathetic at that point (I think it's because there are many yellow cabs in that scene, and cars are the single most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-looking things in the game) -- which is misleading, as all in all, the graphics aren't great, but serviceable and quite acceptable for a game of that vintage. Oh yeah, and you can't pick your character, so you're stuck with one who looks like a dork (all of the time) and acts like an â¥â¥â¥ (half of the time).  So, the first big challenge then is to make it past the first 30 minutes. After that, it's good fun for a good while. An open world and Awesome Powers(TM) go a long way, and the game is good fun for a good while. Eventually though, the missions get a bit repetitive, and starting about 2/3 into the game, it's usually not the missions that are the problem -- getting to the mission is (travel basically implied the choice of not using powers, in which case you'd get swarmed by zombies, ragdolled by soldiers using rockets and artillery on the zombies, and it would generally take forever, or you'd use your movement powers to speed things up, in which case you'd probably get detected, and take just as long trying to shake off those pesky strike teams. It sounds like a good, 'realistic' idea in theory, but in practice, it was nothing more than a nuisance).  That said, it's not a bad game if you can get it really cheap, but one that overstayed its welcome a bit and would have benefitted from having 1/4 - 1/3 of its playtime cut. (Or, as the more expensive option, have that additional playtime be made more varied and interesting -- something that largely succeeded in Prototype 2.)  Pet peeve: The protogonist doesn't have that many voiced lines; he (as well as his sister) has a unisex name, depending on whom you consume you may run around as a woman anyway, and pretty much everybody else calls him 'it' anyway (on the grounds that he's an evil infected commie mutant), so their dialogue wouldn't even change. At that point, they might as well have vastly improved the game by giving you a choice of character, at the cost of adding character creation, and a few dozen voiced lines for the protogonist (much more easily so than in P2, for a start, which has more story, and more dialogue -- even so, Saints Row IV, which rips off Prototype mightily, runs circles around both installments in that regard, just like SR3 ran circles around GTA).  SO, DO I NEED TO PLAY THIS FIRST IF I WANT TO PLAY [PROTOTYPE2]?  You know, I can't say with certainty. While P1 is summarized at the beginning of P2 (incompletely, and colored by the agenda of those doing the summary), you'll need P1 for the full story -- while P2 has a new protoganist, it continues the same story in the same setting, and certain key characters of P1 return. As P1 feels like it has a simpler, slightly less engaging story than P2, with less 'story per hour', it's hard to say whether it'll be worth it when you really just want to play P2 and are only playing P1 for the additional background. That said, if the P1/P2 package deal is cheap once again (making P1 Â£2 or so) and you actually have the time for both, give it a shot -- if you really hate P1 two hours in, you can still fast forward to P2.  THEREFORE,  Qualified recommendation for the B- list P1 (decide whether you can stomach the somewhat retro look), recommendation for the A list P2 (whose only faults are that you have no choice of protagonist, and that it plays a somewhat cliched evil-corporations-and-uncaring-government plot straight, if rather better than P1 did).
1415	1	a	I really liked this game. Nice design and a perfect structure. You should check it out.
1749	1	a	I had this game in my library for a while. I recently picked up Trek Industries newest game, which is in early access and I was impressed by what I saw so I thought I'd delve into ORION: Prelude to see what I could expect from them in the development of that game.  When you know about the history of ORION: Prelude the state it's in now is pretty impressive. The developer clearly worked hard to turn something that was unplayable into a game that is actually really fun. There's no real depth to it but it's a slightly different take on your average horde mode game, the mechanics are solid and there's a nice variety of maps.   It is only 79p so you can't really go wrong if you want to sink a few hours into a decent game that has a small but fairly active multiplayer community. It's definitely worth more than it's asking price.
2481	1	a	Best game for the price, doesnt have the players it deserves, recommended if u have a group of friends u wanna play with from 5-10 friends
6315	1	a	Very interesting game , fun , cool comunity , BUT it is not optimized. Good job developers!
4537	1	a	Never played x3
2823	1	a	Best game ever put cod,borderlands, and a little team fort 2 and you get this game for a $1 each or just buy four and give thme to your friends trust me you will have a good time
2109	1	a	I bought this game just to see what is was and now this game is just great i had some fun but i ragged sometimes when i get killed by a t-rex so i recommend this game to anyone who likes fps dino shooting game.
317	0	a	It works for the first few minutes but it crashes afterwards. It was a good game. It's a shame that it does that. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all. It'll be a waste of your time and money.
555	1	a	One of the best Super Hero Sandbox game.
5829	1	a	[OLD REVIEW/OUTDATED] Now I know why it's a 1$ deal, this game, while having good graphics and some nice lightning effects and visuals, sadly is very poorly executed. It's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of bugs and stuttering ranging from 5 to 30 FPS, you can't even play it because it is so poorly optimized that when you move you don't move normally you teleport from one place to the other. Guys I know it's 1$ and that we're all impulsive buyers here on Steam, but is it worth buying something even if it was 0,01 cents when you can't enjoy it? No, I highly recommend do not buy.  EDIT: Since a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of updates I must update this review, due to developers never before seen change of hearth I think they themselves saw what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game they made and they decided to completely transform it, making it from one of the worst games on steam ever to the best money spent:fun had game on steam, props for all the bugfixes and updates and for admitting your wrongdoings, not a lot of people would do that and I respect you people for that. For this kind of money? Game is a steal, buy it and you'll have fun, I guarantee.
721	1	a	A great game. It is a fantasy combat/ sorta RPG game. Combat is through Poker hands. Kind of like the Puzzlequest games. Same genre as Fairy Solitaire.
6471	1	a	Epic game but only if you have friend to play with you :D
1940	1	a	This Game Is Amzing !!!! A True Testament Of What Hard Work And Dedication Can Accomplish !!!!!
5933	1	a	Fun game. nothing to say about it, it's a bit boring in a long play but what a pleasure to kill over again some dinos :-) 
4812	1	a	I have to say this game is pretty good for $1
3809	0	a	Its prettyyyyyy bad.
260	1	a	buy it cuz its good 
2110	1	a	This game cured my naked molrat from ebola! It's amazing!
3763	0	a	My only gripe with this is that it's UNREALISTIC. Humans and dinosaurs weren't around at the same time. hell, T Rex and Stegosaurus didn't even live together. YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FACTS BEFORE YOU RELEASE GAMES
3497	1	a	very nice shooter, fun to play, graphics are ok, cool dinosaurs so what else ?
6244	1	a	cool game for a cheap price but it get borring when you have killed 100 dinosoars and nothing else to do :/
2121	1	a	Put that Coke down and pick this up!
370	0	a	Not the game, but the port is poor. I booted it up to have major sound issues where everyone talked so fast they sounded like a record skipping. This was atop poor resolution issues, and I coudln't get far enough to say if the controls were wonky or not. Don't buy unless you're willing to play tech support hero to make the game run.
6295	1	a	A great game, full of action and dinosaurs. I recommend it to all my friends and to YOU!
5454	1	a	This game simply blows away those other $10-$20 survival shooters.... I just cant believe this game is priced just 99cents. Killing a T-rex..What more do you simply want from a game? I am gonna be playing this for a long time.
6499	1	a	It was so fun to play
2488	1	a	This game has almost replaced COD and battlefield for me â and for $1 as well! Itâs definitely a great purchase even if it only entertains you for a week or two. Play solo or with people online and has Australian servers. Brilliant work.  Dont forget to increase the difficulty after the first 2 or 3 hours though.
4560	1	a	I got it for $1 and it's beyond worth  Now it's 75c and even more worth!!!
6574	1	a	Very fun, could use a few tweaks to speed up or slow down time between rounds. A digital manual or tutorial would be nice. 7 out of 10 so far. I can't wait to try the next itteration.
5490	0	a	Atleast uninstal works...
325	1	a	. . .
3058	1	a	a very nice game to play :D
5939	0	a	game is my â¥â¥â¥
1476	1	a	For puzzle-platformer lovers, it is worth giving a try. Besides, It's quite cheap.
3484	0	a	OK, I did not mind the game, heck I am astonished by how it had improved since I last saw it when it was Orion Dino Horde *Watch that video by Total Biscuit by the way, I'm not being paid for it but he's just fantastic.* However it has problems which turned me away from it, or at least 2 problems.  Littlest one: The game is not very well optimized, I play this on a laptop but given I can run some high speed stuff with no problem, this is a problem....Though it is one that CAN be fixed so I will not hold it against the deveolopers.  However our biggest problem: The Community, sure the games can be fast but honestly, no one helps you either because the game doesn't do a good enough job of telling you 'Oh your teammate is down', and even if they did, there's a number that would let you die just out of SPITE, often killing any dinos you shot so that you would NOT get up.  Overall its an OK game but the community...just the community is all.
6530	1	a	Lots of fun, worth the purchase
1207	1	a	Old but gold.
4997	0	a	Not really worth the money. Yes, I know it's â¬0.99.
2366	1	a	I am not sure why this game gets such a bad reputation. I have been having a blast killing dinosaurs with friends. Its not perfect... but it is a lot of fun.
1459	0	a	As much as I'd like to give this game a recommendation, I just can't. I had a blast in the first hour or so of the game, but the fuel mechainc really threw me off as I feel like it made the levels too big and it got easy to miss stuff. The music, while being very fitting, became way too repetative and boring after a while. But the biggest issue I had with this game was a bug that sometimes made the remains of enemies appear as black boxes. It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.  It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free. 4/10
1934	0	a	Terrible game. Mosters attacking you in between waves, no time to do anything in between waves, not even close to a smooth game.  1/10 would definately ask for my Â£1 refund
2832	1	a	Great fun when playing with friends!
628	1	a	I enjoyed battling in this game. If only the story could be longer.
2741	1	a	glitchy but fun
612	1	a	This game is so good.        Ken
3692	0	a	Poorly made game! wasn't worth. good thing I bought it when it was half off not full price!
3262	1	a	Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. MUST BUY AT THIS 93% OFF DEAL!!!!! 
1542	1	a	Dude, it's cheap, it's worth it. Shooting dinos with your friends just for a dollar, cmon man. I see nothing bad here, good graphics and great fun with friends. Ok, it obviously could get boring after a while, but it's worth the price. I would say, it's even little bit too cheap for that kind of game, but whatever. Lol, believe me, you won't regret it.
6226	1	a	Pick it up with some friends if it is cheap, interesting wave suvival fun.
6275	1	a	because it is chep a lot people.think it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ game but when u try it is great and when u play with yput fri eds it is freaking awesome so u should try it
4791	1	a	Good Game but... I can't buy any items with my cash why is just freeze for 3 secs and continues like nothing happened i was trying to buy a cape
1178	1	a	  The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted
5985	1	a	Fun. Pure fun. Funniest fun ever. I don't really like dino games, but this one is awesome.  Halo + dinos. Great aesthetics. Co-op and PVP. Tons of action. What else do you want?  I missed only one thing: a small tutorial for beginners. When you click 'play' you see two lines: 'find game' and 'create game'. There could be a third one: 'tutorial'.
4559	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ OFF â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BULL â¥â¥â¥â¥ I PAYED 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUCKS FOR THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ING STUPID â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GOD â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥
5577	1	a	Choose Recon Buy x2 energy and ninja upgrade KILL ALL SONS OF BI***** with knife = BADASS 11/10 would kill T-rex with only knife again (ââ _â ) 
950	1	a	16.5/20
6571	1	a	I recomend this game if u are a fan of first person shooters and dinos but I unfortionatly cant play it anymore because the thing is done and the funny thing is tht my brother tried to buy it gor me but it dont go through and so they should of extended it for a couple more hours so tht I could continue to play this awesome game   
278	1	a	Overall the story is okay, it is expanded upon in the sequel. However the gameplay in this one is far more enjoyable than the second. The sequel takes away gameplay for story whilst this gives gameplay at the the story's sake.
4618	0	a	So if you kinda have a old computer do not get this. If you have a realy old computer definetly dont get this. I dont know if you have a brand new computer maby get this  but its probely not worth the mony
4764	0	a	I buggy $0.99 game. Lost nothing, gained nothing.
659	0	a	A pretty unique concept but another of the worst games I've ever played. First boss of the tutorial is too overpowered and I can't beat him no matter what I do. There's better things out there to play. I'm done with this frustrating and stupefying game.
4569	0	a	I bought this game when it was $9.99. I regret that decision.    3.6/10  
3966	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Optimization(for my pc anyway) but decent game.
4327	1	a	good but I now have to pay for it. I did have it free and I am a steam user
923	1	a	This game ROCKS as the first part.
830	1	a	awseome story.. but KB/mouse controls ruined the gameplay
4623	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
5022	0	a	Nope
2088	1	a	Its essentiallly just like Call out duty Zombies but with dinosaurs. There are upgrades and the ability to buy guns but unfortunately onlt between waves. Its worth it when you see it on sale and is fun with a group of friends!
1974	1	a	I have had a lot of fun playing this game. I sometimes get the COD zombies feel when facing off against countless waves with numerous hordes of dinos but it takes me back to the closest thing i'd ever like to see to a combination between jurassic park and cod zombies. Heaps of guns, augments, perks and achievements to mess around with, game is worth its weight in gameplay despite lacking much singleplayer function
904	1	a	It's fun with very good graphics. Funny violence, marvelous scenes. But it's too short, I could do it in 4 hours in normal mode :(
4879	0	a	Horribly Optimized Game That Looks Like It Was Made In 2003
2169	1	a	The game is amazing and sure repeated swarms of the same thing seems boring,but keep in-mind that the game is still in development and will change often.
4382	1	a	Honestly this isnt my favorite game. but its actually quite fun If you have friends to play it with its way better, but what would I know seeing as all my friends are playing DOTA or TF2 playing with bots is fun. but the game feels somewhat 'dead' without other player If you manage to increase your FPS above 20 and play you'll have a good time Enemies are pretty fair. easily killable in the early rounds and harder enemies as the match progresses There are some thing I feel should change however -The maps are buggy -servers are hard to get into -most servers are empty Its free so I cant complain about it in that department. its fun so thats another good thing And its buggy which leads to some hilarious gameplay like floating players or headless dinosaurs chasing you around the map probably a 7/10 (taken 3 away because of the things I listed before) If this Isnt helpful to you then keep scrolling until you find one that is
5994	1	a	I bought this game as a joke for 50 cents... i like it.  10/10
1317	1	a	I made profit from selling trading cards I got from this game.
1153	1	a	This is probably the best 79p I have spent. It's a fun relaxing platform game with some little puzzles. It looks and sounds great. To quote Bob Ross, âThis is a happy little game!â
6196	1	a	Writing a recommendation for this game because after the things it has gone through up to this date, it certainly deserves one.  If you're not one to hold grudges against developers for making some 'mistakes' in the past, you can take it from me that the metacritic score is no longer valid.. if it ever even was. The game speaks for itself but to put it in another perspective, it's basically Killing Floor except with dinosaurs. Furthermore there's a dozen of gamemodes including team PvP and Free-for-all be they with or without dinosaurs.  The game does have an in-game store utilizing real currency but it's purely vanity and cosmetics so it shouldn't bother anyone really. With the amount of great updates the game has received, it has definitely become a much more fun game. Whether it's worth full price comes down to personal opinion if you're into this type of game or not. Regardless, it's definitely worth taking a (new) look at.
1462	1	a	BEEP is a cool game. Would be cool if we could use controller but oh well.
930	1	a	Good refinement of the fun gameplay of the previous game. A bit short and lacks co-op story mode, but worth the price for me.
2868	1	a	plz get this game it is the best dino game ever
775	1	a	fan game ant goot game ant 9/10
1245	0	a	Beep. A game made for children under the age of 12. Except for the fact that it's hard, and JEEZUS the screams of a robot as it goes off a cliff, thinking there's a hidden area there... *Shivers*   TBH, only good with a mouse. And then to a point. Confusing as hell as to how the game actually works, and basically makes little to no sense throughout the whole game. Haven't played much, but doesn't seem amazing.
2910	0	a	When i've played it, it was very crazy! But the problem for me was a bit laggy really because i'm using my laptop. I don't think it's recommended for the other steam users who has a poor condition on their computers because it's just a little lag problem really.
5249	1	a	the game lags to much but its still worth the money
4709	0	a	First problem is... This developer makes you pay for the game, but then makes you pay mictrotransactions if you want to have any of the customization options with your carachter. Are you serious? A bit greed don't you think... pay for the game, and then pay more for base line options.  As for the game itself, It's fun enough for about a half hour... but then you realize there is no campaign, no story mode, no depth.... its just 'Survive X number of waves'.... over and over. Meh, I can live with that... but then you realize there isn't much depth to the gameplay either. The classes don't feel different enough from each other... and the weapons lack any distinction either.   Then there are the REALLY irritating issues like.... when you die, you have to wait 45 seconds to respawn.... and when you do, you are nowhere near your party, or the gear that you dropped when you died. Good luck making it back to the group before the wave is finished. On top of that, you lose your upgrades.... sigh,
1328	1	a	I would recommend this game to a younger crowd, it works out and is kinda fun, but it would probally be more fun for a 8 year old instead of a 20 year old. My bad impulsive steam-purchase.
3517	1	a	This game is amazing. I LOVE it when my games have ps2 graphics yet still lag. The lasers the dinosaurs shoot out of their mouths is beautiful, and the texturing is so good it makes me want to vomit and cry in the bathtub for about 3 hours.   If you like being depressed, I highly reccommend this game.
6067	1	a	I still want my Money back you f*ckers :(
443	0	a	Nothing but gratuitous killing. Where's my refund?
2900	1	a	get eaten by big a$$ dino 10/10
710	1	a	If you are even moderatly good at poker, you can beat this game. Still quite a fun game though!
6129	0	a	Gets very tedious very quickly. Even with friends the game isn't nearly as fun as games such as a Left 4 Dead or any other Multiplayer Shooter Siege-Survival. If you need a budget game there are many others but this one has ill-defined objectives, very basic gun selections, and a broken health system (where you can be fully healthy for a few rounds then instantly die to a small mob of dinosaurs which are impossible to hit).
3363	1	a	Okay, this is the only review I've ever done for Steam. The Metacritic score is not justifiable. This game is AT LEAST worth the price. Get it if it's on sale. It gets really fun sometimes.
1880	1	a	A friend just got me this game with the 4 pack, and we hopped right into it.  While this game might be really goofy, its LOADS of fun!  It really does feel alot like halo when you get jeeps, its already like turock because ... Dinos  Highly reccomend 10/10 would buy 4 pack
5762	0	a	Its not the worst and if your friends just need a break from something else go for it. However, even with the tiny price, there are far better games like it. I wouldn't recomend getting this soley because I haven't touched it since the last summer sale. I just don't like it. I would wait for the summer sale to spend your 2 bucks on, this isn't just worth it in my own opinion.
3397	1	a	Just buy it play for 1 hour and never touch it again. 'Still better than FNAF' 10/10 ~Everybody
6581	0	a	though this game is filled with great graphics and dinosaurs, this game is full of glitches and crashes, not to mention if your playing with friends it takes forever to find a server for your friends to play on and even creating a server for the host it lags out , I just got this game and it asks me to buy it AGAIN ! well i wont this is a lesson to all of you dont waste your money like I did !
903	1	a	Challenging but fun game with an interesting art style.
1771	1	a	I don't see any reason to not buy this for under a dollar. It's fun.
5032	0	a	If you're thinking about buying this game, take your money and sign it over to your parents, and check yourself into an early 20th century style asylum that specializes in giving colonics made of dried sunflower seeds. 1/8 Handfulls of sunflower seeds
5364	1	a	This is an awesome game good for you and your friends to play or make some new ones its a clean take on FPS horde games check it out!
1337	1	a	it only cost 2 quarters on a sale 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING QUARTERS
1675	1	a	Well. it's definitely your money's worth. Otherwise ugly and broken but mildly entertaining, and not (as) terrible (as you'd expect) for $1.
5399	0	a	The Metacritics were right!!
2756	0	a	this game was â¥â¥â¥â¥, i had more fun wiping my â¥â¥â¥
4114	1	a	Buy it now for Free 99
5362	1	a	Such a good game!
4360	1	a	steps to success ----------------- biuy a four paeck seind kiys to frends pley and kill dinos â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at teh saeme tyme --------------------------  would â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at teh saeme tyme and kill dinos again 11/10 
580	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is awesome !!!XD  
968	1	a	Excellent game. It's like Shank reloaded! My recommendation is to play it with a controller. It can get a bit confusing and much less fun with keyboard and mouse.
1422	1	a	I got this gem of a game for just 15p and it is worth EVERY penny.  A super fun little platform/puzzler with great gameplay &amp; graphics that starts off very easy then requires a LOT more thought!  Excellent value for such a great game...a 'must-have' title if ever there was!!! 
2774	0	a	I bought this game for $1 when it was on a steam for sale. It was definately worth it at the time even after all the bugs and horrible ai, I still found a way to have a decent gaming experience. But now the sale is gone and is now $15 so all I can say is do not get this game. My biggest pet peeves about this game is its massive frame drops making almost unplayable, from 40 frames down to 15 back to 30 down 20 and its not even a nice looking game at all, you could have a top tier gaming computers and you may have trouble running this game. Although if it ever drops the price point you might consider buying it since it does have some great moments but I should also warn you that this game totally copied their last game and resold you the same thing except maybe a few things changed here and there.
3814	0	a	What about people who play when it's not F2P ?? no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing refund for this ?? i feel disapointment so much :&lt;
3515	1	a	This game only for 1â¬ totally worth it  10/10 would buy again!
5514	0	a	Its like you pay for â¥â¥â¥â¥
2749	1	a	Miraculously healed raptor bite wounds and dino-acid-spit burns by killing a T-rex with a revolver.  10/10
4568	1	a	This game is like Bubbliscious Bubble gum. You really think its the best investment for a dollar, so you buy it. At first, the sweet, blueberry flavour caresses your tounge, then it becomes bland after a half hour, so you begin stuffing more pieces into your mouth. After about 20 pieces, you realize that you've made a big mistake, and just shoved multiple chewy, corn starch-like objects in your mouth that provided no actual nourishment. Lesson: buy trident. Best game of all time. 11/10. Would recommend
1167	1	a	It's a very nice game, where you play as a small robot that collect orb fragments scattered on the levels also 3 antimatter fragments. You have a gravity weapon to move objects, obstacles or dead robots, and a gun to shot and kill the enemy robots. It's a really good game, and it's fun and addictive to collect all the orb fragments. The level select screen is a small solar system i loved that, its better than other games where the select level screen is just something with numbers.
5779	1	a	cool cool
869	1	a	The most fun co-op mode I've ever played. End of discussion!
690	1	a	Really fun and nice twist to the games of solitare and poker with the incorporation of a fantasy storyline.
4365	1	a	Best uninstall simulator of this generation!!! 11/10 - Ign Would uninstall again!
782	1	a	Fun little twin stick shooter. Campaign is about 5 hrs long. It's enjoyable if you have time to burn.
6363	1	a	its a very unique and fun game. no other like it
3978	1	a	I don't have this game and i can write a review for it so horray.
2538	1	a	7.5/10   Orion Prelude is a interesting game, and for $1 its completely worth it.
3384	1	a	Another dino game, I know, but this one is more of a survival shooter. Plus, you can get some stuff to look good and to impress. Overall, this game is brilliant and it was worth the 1 euro I gave for it.  -10/10 was not disappointed
4449	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ copy-paste game that has been released x times on steam. Even for 1 dollar feels like a scam to me
1088	1	a	Worth every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penny at .19 cents.
2183	1	a	You could buy a soda or you could buy this funky combination of every multiplayer shooter of the last decade and dinosaurs. Blaze or slash away in more game modes than that Atari 2600 cartridge you found at a flea market for the EXACT SAME PRICE in 1987.  At the current list price - $0.99 in April of 2015 - there's just no reason not to own this game. Unless you REALLY want that soda.
3162	1	a	Good game lots of content and cant go wrong with the price
2691	1	a	This game is like a First Person Balloon Tower Defense, but with DInosaurs! I love how you cna buy perks from eliminating enemies! All in all I think Orion is a great game.
2346	1	a	 SLG's First 10-hrs. Review
6265	1	a	It's a very nice dinausor game, at good price!If you don't want to pay much money, but you want a good game with dinausors, this game is for you guys!
2672	0	a	It stills being â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4516	0	a	Got killed by a dinosaur and still had 3 lifes left, 15/10, would uninstall at sight.
3842	0	a	They â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ruined it with prelude, the game's preformance sucks â¥â¥â¥ now, lowest resolution gets 15 frames on a decent gaming laptop.  It was GOOD ENOUGH 3 MONTHS AGO, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER.  holy â¥â¥â¥â¥
2054	1	a	This game is really funny to play with friends. nothing you need to take serious :D
624	1	a	Alex Mercer. 'nuff said.
6064	1	a	One of the great game i love lmao
5783	1	a	I played it for a few minutes when it was on sale way back then, needless to say, even though it was such a short time, it was worth it. Sadly I've got burned on my alternative account so I have literally no money but still, I remember the time and it was worth it back then, don't know about now though.
6507	0	a	I would say this game is just bad. The sound volumes for some things are way too loud, when others are too dim. The character animations are bad, gunplay isn't that bad and movement system is somewhat nice. But still i wouldn't spend even 99 cents on this.
2833	1	a	brilliant game, love being the disosaurs, mecanics are very good, graphics almost perfect, controll pretty good,    could have more controll over server settings, and could have a storyline mode or carrer mode or something
1100	1	a	It's an ok game. I bought it for 15p so I can't say I was expecting the world. It has trading cards which is pretty nice for the price I bought it at. The game feels decent, it feels slightly like one of those free flash games you'd find on the internet though but generally it's a nice experience that I'm sure many enjoy. If it's onsale for a price similar to what I bought it at, get it. I don't think I would buy it for 3.99 though.
2090	1	a	Finally added 32bit support &amp; fixed a lot of game breaking bugs; but all a little too late. There seems to be no one playing, empty servers all around; although still a great game to play a couple of hours with friends on the weekends. =)
1540	1	a	Guess what? It's actually fun. And guess what again? It doesn't look that bad. MY GOD WHAT SORCERY IS THIS
1904	1	a	That first gameplay video that got me wanting to get a single copy of the game, but it was the hats that got me to get the 4 pack, well that and the price was just about 1 free game lol. Well at $0.99 it had me sold at Hats.  Edit: The game is now free. There is no reason for you to not just play it for however long you want. The game is a lot of fun but just not polished at all.
3443	1	a	Pro's- Its cheap Lots of game modes Character progression PVP PVE Decent amout of maps interesting AI Plenty to shoot Easy to play Interesting game mechanics asortment of Vehicles Addictive Violence :) -Developers participate in the forums Lots of room hosting setup options Nice UI Achievments Leader boards  Cons- -Bad graphics optimization for duel cards (not the text script glitch just optimization) Big lag problems with Depth of Field and all particle systems they can be disabled but I like my tracers and enemt tracers ect.. -People are not notified to open ports for room hosting lots of bad ping and resrticted nat rooms -Dedicated server setup is terrible- lack of usefull detailed instruction and infact still havent got it working -Hosts have no server control options in game- can't kick idle when idle is disabled -Ai textures are not solid to the camera so when a dino head is in your fasce you can see he is hollow - Some Ai path finding issues can slow the game down like hunting for a mob/ group of mobs on maps to advance game can cost 5-15 mins of search time pointlessly to find a guy caught on a rock or a teridactle thats not allowed to leave a certain area.  Game and Gameplay 7/10 overall (graphical lag -1, Host control and port info -1 Dedicated server problems -1)  Dedicated server 5/10 overall (Lack of true instruction-2 Currently woring correctly -2 Lack of useful Information-1)  Host Server 8/10 Overall ( port promt needed -1, User control in game -1)  Game details: All of the perks from Unreal Tournament, Turok and Halo3- Toss em in a blender click puree and pour yourself a cup of Orion: Prelude (AKA Dino Horde).       
5770	1	a	This is actually a really goodgame! I have fun playing this. I am impressed with the many variations on game modes and the smooth and fun game-play. There is a massive pile of achievements to strive for also.  I may update this review later after I have played more of various modes, know more about the ins and outs of the game.  I will say that a good set of surround headphones are useful to assist in finding the loot chests.
2021	1	a	Seems like an alright game if you want to relax and shoot things, I dont see why people are saying it is so bad, because I think it is just an average online fps really.
3155	1	a	Interesting game
549	1	a	Uh, I thought I liked this a lot. But it turns out I think it's a bit meh. Not â¥â¥â¥â¥ enough to not recommend though.
2161	1	a	it's a fun game and it's even more fun with friends     (TIP Play with a friend)
4565	0	a	only played it for about 20min before i deleted it. bad level desgin bad game play. only good thing was the graphics. it was 0.99 but even if it was free i'd ask for a refund
4799	1	a	Got 10 USD worth of coins in it for buying a 1 euro game.  666/10
3537	1	a	Fun game really like it. Really can't stop playin'!!! :D
961	1	a	Shank... What a gaming jewel...  Great game, great gameplay, wonderful graphics and good enough story for this kind of game.   10/10
6292	1	a	You will have some fun with it, but after a while it gets boring.   Buy it for under 7â¬
1977	1	a	This game is great except the controls make me feel like i might be having a stroke
1649	0	a	Ooo he stealin'!
3742	1	a	Great Game! Would recommend. IMO its a mix of oldschool tribes plus some new ark style gameplay. Definatly worth tume and money! Some bugs ive found but what game doesnt have them.
3924	1	a	Ignore the meta critic this game is actually pretty good.
90	1	a	Yet another gem in my Steam Library.   In case you should have a god complex, this game is made for you -  If you don't.. it still is!   Basically you slip into the role of the more or less anti-hero Alex Mercer in the city of Manhattan that was infected by some kind of Virus and is now being controlled by Elite Soldiers called 'Blackwatch'.   Once you hit the button 'Start new campaign' you get thrown right into the Open World with just a few background infos concerning the upcoming story. All you know is that you are Alex Mercer, who has been shot down and fatally wounded and later on got infected by a virus that somehow revived you and gave you shapeshifting abilities and superpowers.   Now he is trying everything he can to find out how all this happened, where it will be going, and how he could possibly end all this by 'interrogate' the ones responsible.  Making your way through the story you get sucked in by a good load of interesting twists, challenging bossfights and tons of upgrades for Alex that make him the toughest enemy 'Blackwatch' will have to face during the whole infection.   There are plenty of Sidequests to be done - some of them nice and some of them just to keep you busy finishing the game 100%. But if you focus on the Story Quests alone its possible to finish it within ~12 hours on a medium difficulty.  It can be frustrating at times (not just because of the AI) but because of overpowered attacs or wrong set 'Mission Failure' parts, but once you've beaten the game it feels really satisfying even without Steam Achievments or cool costume unlocks for Alex Mercer. The gameplay itself is (to me) almost flawless and the possibilities endless due to Alex' powers and the maybe best looking armor in 2009's video games.   With this being said I'd like to leave you the decision if you should get this game on a sale for 5 bucks or just let it be, all I can do is just highly recommend it to everyone who loves a good classic and a game by 'Activision' that is not 'Fast and the Furious' nor 'Call of Duty' but actually a GOOD game. A point some people might find interesting- the graphics are not horribly bad but neither outstanding for 2009...something in between should describe it precisely. If graphics don't bother you its a perfect game for a casual afternoon when you are off work and just want to relax..in case you do love good graphics take a look at Prototype 2 ..it has all the features 1 has to offer and even more - will write a review to part 2 aswell once I finished it on Steam.  *Note* I wasn't experiencing any performance problems on my nvidia card but I know that there are massive problems with all AMD cards... and they wont ever fix it I believe so in case you don't have a Nvidia graphics card you might want to play this one on a console.   As always I hope that my review was helpful and written understandable and made it easier for you to decide to buy a game from 6 years ago that is still more foward than todays releases...

4744	0	a	really good but lagg to much idk why but its a really cool game to get on and play XD
4621	0	a	this game is realy bad it doesant even deserve proper grammer
3723	1	a	s s s ss s s s s s 
735	1	a	Really liked this game. I'm a big sucker for card games and have wasted X amout of time on Windows Solitaire so this was a given. If you don't like poker or fantasy you shouldn't bother though.
4763	0	a	I don't remember where I heard this but 'You can judge a fps by it's shotgun'. I tend to find this to be true at least in my case. Which is where I'm sad to say the shotgun sucks.
3177	0	a	wtf i purchased it and its telling me i didnt wtf,i hate this game thats not funny nor fair
4965	0	a	Worst game ever. You stand around and defend a tiny base from hoards of mobs running in. No time to enjoy anything. Once you've done it once, nothing is different the next time. Throw it away and never play it again. Best dolla eva! This game is always on sale for 90% off $10, making it $1.   The only thing anyone likes about this game is that it was a dollar. Thats as bad as saying that it made you happy to give a dollar to everyone at the mall one day. Actually, that does sound like fun! But maybe a better analogy is that its like paying to go into DisneyLand, but instead of riding the fun rides... you start handing out a dollar to everyone. No one says no to your dollar, but no one really appreciates your dollar either, except the young children... who think your dollar is the best thing ever.  You know another anology? This game being a dollar on Steam, where you can get actual good games that are also on sale for $5, is like standing in line for half an hour to get a snow cone, then realizing your snow cone tastes bad and spilling it on the ground. The End.  Other things that last longer than this game, that are also a dollar? 2 snickers bars. a movie at the dollar theatre. a large drink at McDonalds. a can of spray paint. 4 cokes out of a 12 pack. a pack of mini flashlights. a box of paper clips. a rock that someone glued eyes on. your dignity.
2793	1	a	i'm not so sure why this game has such a low meta score its not overly a bad game in any aspect the pvp fun (but slightly lag at some points) there is a nice selection of weapons, perks, veichals and other things the only thing i don't like is the limited amount of classes having on 3 (since last time i played) and its quite a bit of fun with some friends and you get to kill DINOSAURS, FREAKING HUGE BLOODY T-REX AND SPINOSAURS WHAT ELSE IS BETTER?!?!?!
2304	1	a	It's sorta like Killing Floor. But with Dinosaurs... I've just been informed that Science has developed an equation. Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = Awesome    ...and for $0.99 it was hard to beat
2407	1	a	This is by far the best 1 dollar game i have ever played. You go through different levels of killing dinosaurs while levelling up. This is a very fun game that can keep you captured while playing it. +1
252	0	a	It's buggy and hardware intensive...even if you buy a new video card to appease it's high standards, you get through 80% of the game just to get a black screen and no way to progress.
2704	1	a	this game is alright a bit like call of duty and teamfortress 2 with dino's i found it a bit boring but if you like shooters with dino's then you might like this 7/10 forme
6001	1	a	best devs ever 10/10 would show up Bohemia Interactive again 
4524	0	a	Just don't buy ....don't... istant regret.  -low texture -bugged physics -Ai ?! 
879	1	a	Shank 2 puts you in the role of shank , looking for redemption and justice you fight countless enemies in your path with brutal weapons, machetes,shanks,pistols,shotguns and even grenades. The game lacks on enemy variety and combos you're pretty much doing the same attacks every single time. The graphics of this game are like it's predecesor very well done but not great. The story is pretty dull and the characters involved barely have any personality or screen time to develop themselves. There's a ton of unlockables which mainly consists of costumes for single player. The co-op of this game is enjoyable at first but unless you're really into being a perfectionist you won't even care for a second run.
4058	1	a	Experts have suggested that staying home and playing Orion:Prelude keeps you safe from the two contained Americans with Ebola in the United States. It's also proven to keep you away from actual threats, like the flu, ad Mormons.  Stay safe, play games, and only go outside when there are hardly any people around, because human contact is the major killer.
1375	1	a	Lovely 2D action platformer with physic puzzle elements.
2587	1	a	The game is definatly worth the dollar game wise, but when you do play, if you find a good game, prepare to never leave becuase it is seemingly impossible to get a game with actual people in it. I'm either getting disconnected while I'm connecting or i'll loose connection to host, and every other server is full so theres nothing else to do but stare at your screen. Then i thought, hey i'll just start a server! nope. Sat there for a good while waiting for people and nobody joined.  TL;DR Good game with bad matchmaking. Fix for the matchmaking would make this game amazing
2261	1	a	Hands down, best .99 Cent purchase ever. a little buggy, but easily forgiven for how great it is, Minus the fact it doesnt have Voice yet.
3929	1	a	Amazing game! Cant wait to play with friends!
6564	1	a	You get to shoot Dino's! 10/10
4978	0	a	why did i buy this this is like halo ce but with dinosaurs  why am i even comparing it to ce
6391	1	a	I'm not going to lie and tell you this game is perfect, as it's far from it. That said, it's leagues beyond the turd it was.   The gameplay itself is similar to any other number of survival shooters, with a slight objective-based element tossed in. In the most popular mode, Survival, players have to keep a generator safe from hordes of dinosuars. As long as the generator is running, players scan high tail it to a base where they can purchase weapons, turrets, upgrades, etc. There is the occasional objective point that you are required to capture in between waves, which requires that all or some of you leave the precious generator. If the generator is disabled during this time, you have 3 minutes to restore it, otherwise you lose.  The graphics aren't bad by any means. They have a very 'Halo' look to them, with some small issues of stretched textures here and there. The lense flair is very nice however, and would make J.J. Abrams proud.   I found the sound effects to be much better than they once were. Gunshots no longer sound like a tin can getting hit by a frozen pea, rather they sound like an actual gun. Dinosaurs still sound pretty ridiculous, but hey, they're a far cry from what they were.  Overall I would definitely reccommend this game while on sale. At 14.99 it's a bit steep, as the experience is far from perfect. That said, if you can pick it up on a deal (say, 99 cents?) go for it.
4006	0	a	No manual, no tutorial. Even a mouse-like dinosuar could take you down, (before you find it).
5091	1	a	Got killed by a tiny dinosaur after defeating 100's of huge ones 10/10 would do it again
693	1	a	This game was a pleasant surprise. Imagine if poker, puzzle quest, and clash of heroes were thrown into a big pot and mixed up. This would be one of the results you could get from that mixture.
943	1	a	This game is great. I just started it, but I mean I just have to write a review about sooner or later. Right? If you like games where you walk and fight enemies on your way, this is what you need to get. I like the idea that you can range attack and hand to hand combat and the story makes a great first impression. Like, Shank (I hope that's his name), he started as a prisoner and they start to get hi-jacked by these goons and everyone leaves. Except for one person, Shank. He sat there, stood up to them and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed them up. Can't wait to finish this game.  That's a great way to show that you can face your fear right there.
955	1	a	ITS LIKE MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WITH KNIVES NO WAIT IT IS JUST A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MEXICAN CARTEL
4370	1	a	10/10
6031	0	a	this game will constantly lag through out the game 
3816	0	a	Welp now that it's free I feel stung by the developers. Real insult to anyone who bought this scum for money. Hopefully I shove my 99 cents so far up my â¥â¥â¥ to simulate being â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by the developers.
3837	1	a	ORION sucks. ORION Prelude is pretty darn good. Fin. Its like $0.04 and you get 3 free copies to give to your friends. Imagine Borderlands Co-OP but youre fighting Dino's. Yeah I know, its hard to imagine. So rather than waste brain power trying to picture it, spend the 0.00005 pesos and get it. Just dont get ORION. That totally blows. Oh, and the devs are total dipsticks. I cant believe the people that made ORION also made this. Its like they were drinking while making one of them. Obviously they were drinking while making Prelude because its so much better.
4575	1	a	this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i love it
6459	1	a	awsome dinos love this game 
1659	1	a	 &gt;&gt;_Summer-Rain_ has joined the game &gt;&gt;C0LDH4RT has joined the game &gt;&gt;R4V3Z3R0 has joined the game &gt;&gt;NOVA-FALL has joined the game   So here you are again. Except this time, you're with your friends,  Ravemeister  and his brother  The Fatman , in a game looking very Halo-esque. Everyone spawns in a bunker with serviceable graphics, before all of you run to yet another bunker, buying your weapons.   'Come on, let's go!'  Ravemeister yells, stepping out before suddenly getting mauled by Velociraptors.  'RUN!'  You scream, as Compsognathus and a huge, gigantic Stegosaurus lumbers toward the base, spawning Compsognathus.   ORION: PRELUDE.   Panicking, The Fatman fires wildly at Velociraptors and Compsognathus, cutting a bloody swath in their ranks  as Summer-Rain concentrates her fire on the Stegosaurus. You clamber about on a vehicle and spin the mounted gun towards the large boss dinosaur, logic and biology be damned. The mounted cannon spins up and empties a volley of lead into the Stegosaurus, sending it to Reptile Heaven.  The announcer yells that the wave is defeated, and now a cooldown period is in effect to stock up on weapons, ammo and upgrades. You attempt to buy something with real world money, but the button in-game seems broken, and you shrug it off. Summer-Rain then checks up on you, her wizard hat the color of purple with yellow stars, bought from a time before you were with her.   'You ok? How's the game turning out for you?'  Summer-Rain asks, checking on her scoped rifle.  'It's cool I guess.'  you begin, before Velociraptors saunter into view from the horizon and a T-Rex lumbers towards all of you, spawning (you guessed it) Compsognathus again.   'We got trouble! AIYAIYAIYAIYAIAYAI!'  Ravemeister shrieks, wearing an astronaut's helmet on top of his space ranger suit which looks like a sleeker version of Master Chief's SPARTAN armor, while firing away with his rifle. You shake your head with a smile as Summer-Rain and The Fatman cover you. The T-Rex goes down when The Fatman and Summer-Rain commandeer a vehicle and use the mounted cannon, proving once more that anything that is mounted and spits lead at a rate of 600 rounds per minute is more than enough to send any dinosaur to Reptile Heaven.   'That was good...!'  The Fatman sings, his armored, anti-bomb-like form shuddering as he exits the Warthog- lookalike.  'Yeah! This game isn't so boring now with you guys, and in a  far better shape than it was in as compared to when it was first  released!'  Summer-Rain sighs, exiting the mounted weapon from the Warthog-lookalike's rear. Ravemeister fist-bumps you while buying ammo and a health upgrade when suddenly, the player prompt flashes across all your displays.   &gt;&gt;HOODED ANGST has joined the game &gt;&gt;KILLER'S CONSCIENCE has joined the game &gt;&gt;SHADOW OF DOUBT has joined the game &gt;&gt;MR. HOLLYWOOD has joined the game &gt;&gt;RA'S AL GOON has joined the game &gt;&gt;MRS. NOVOCAINE has joined the game    'Oh boyyy...'  Ravemeister anticipates.  'Oh damn...'  The Fatman shivers.  'Oh no...'  you breathe.  'Oh great.'  Summer-Rain rolls her eyes.   'STARBOY COLDHEART!'  All of them shout, seemingly in unison. Ravemeister locks and loads his weapon, while The Fatman hops into a randomly-spawned VTOL. Summer-Rain leaps behind the Warthog-lookalike's mounted gatling gun and gives you a curt nod which means  'everything will be ok, baby.'  You hold your rifle as much as you can attempt to be confident.   '...you got married...'  you state in an almost deadpan manner, your chest tight at the sight of the former Ms. Novocaine, along with the person  whom you thought was your good friend, the low-IQ  Ra's Al Goon . In between them is the devious villain  Mr. Hollywood , an inane director out for the blood of innocents.  'Yes, Starboy! Your girlfriend is now my wife!'  Mr. Hollywood gloats, as your previous 'friend' Ra's Al Goon hunches over and tries to fire at you like the deformed arab that he is.  Dodging, Summer-Rain fires the gatling cannon into the air as a warning shot.  'We're supposed to be on the same side if none of us spawn as dinosaurs!'  She says with annoyance, shooting dirty looks at Ms. Novocaine. As if she knew what Summer-Rain was thinking, she fires at Summer-Rain's shoulder, making her shout in pain and fall from the warthog lookalike's platform.   'SUMMER!'  you shout, rushing to her side. Ms. Novocaine squints her eyes evilly as the countdown timer ends and dinosaurs return, spawning.   'It's  'Mrs.'  Novocaine now, dear.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers, before the dinosaurs approach and the battle becomes an intense free-for-all.  '...and Starboy?'  You glare at Mrs. Novocaine amid the chaos and draw your rifle on your ex-girlfriend, her head dead center in your sights.  'You were never good enough.'  Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.   'DAMN YOU!'  You fire, but a running Velociraptor gets hit between you and Mrs. Novocaine before the dust kicks up and dinosaurs and blaster fire rain about everywhere around the both of you.  'Summer?! Hang on, ok?!'  You motion for her again, and she clasps at your arm desperately. You see that Mrs. Novocaine's shot cut clean through Summer-Rain's shoulder and neck, tears in her eyes as she bleeds profusely.   'H-help... help, Starboy-'  She collapses, and you quickly dispatch a Velociraptor closing in on the both of you, with the Spinosaurus of this wave charging to your location.  'RAVE! SUMMER'S HURT!'  You bundle Summer-Rain close to you and run to the game's exit.  'I'll cover you, Coldheart! The Fatman, get over here bro! Starboy must get back to his room with Summer if it's the last thing we do!'   As you enter your home from the heavy rain pouring outside, Summer-Rain in  your arms, you lay her on the couch in the living room and stay by her side. You've applied a makeshift tourniquet with your hoodie as the immersion from the game you've been playing together with everyone vanishes, and her wound is somewhat stable. The blood soaks to the couch and the floor, but all you can think of doing is whispering sweet words and telling her that you are here, that  you attended to her wound as much as you can, and honored her wishes for no call to the hospital.   'Let... let me die. Please Starboy. Let m-me die.'  Summer-Rain whispers to you through ragged breaths.  'No!'  You exclaim.  'Never! Summer, I love you!'  You hold her hand gingerly, and she returns your grasp tightly.  'I know. That's... that's the problem, isn't it.'  Summer-Rain mutters, her breathing heavy.  'What do you mean? If it's about killing the dinosaurs in Prelude, you did a great job with all of us-'    'No Starboy.'  Summer-Rain heaves a heavy sigh.  'She's right you know.'  Your eyes go wide as Summer-Rain talks to you.  'I'm not good enough, not for myself and certainly not for you.'  She looks at you through tired eyes.  'I love you so much, Starboy Coldheart.'  she whispers.  'Don't ever think that you weren't good enough for me, because that's what I was all this time for you. I love you Starboy Coldheart. Don't you ever forget that.'  Summer-Rain closes her eyes.  'Summer?'  you whisper.   'SUMMER!'  You shout. Summer-Rain scrunches her face in annoyance.  'Starboy, I wanna rest.'  she responds.   ORION: PRELUDE.   
4566	1	a	Dont let them fool you, this game is crap, but like skate 3, it is so much fun to play around and laugh with friends! Don't buy this if you dont know anyone else who will, but if you even know one other person who is gonna get it, dont hesitate!
6299	1	a	Absolutely hilarious to load up this mess with some friends and shoot some dinosaurs. This game is glitchy, has horrible graphics, and plays super stiff like an old quake or something, but still is lots of fun.
1257	1	a	Bloody Excellent indiE Platformer! Cute graphics and story, okay music, great level design. Difficulty: Easy-Medium. I really enjoyed playing this physics style platformer. The levels get progressively trickier with more strategy and logic puzzles, with well placed checkpoints to stop them getting frustrating and annoying.There is a nice variation in level designs with different environments and tools changing up how you control and use your robot. The game felt about the right length but I would have happily played more levels or perhaps a game+.
5176	1	a	Joined a game lagged so much my computer blew up 10/10 would play again
4671	0	a	I bought 4 keys... how is this game free?
2288	1	a	It's a good multyplayer fps game,and I realy like the fact that you are fighting the dinosaurs
6314	0	a	it seems really good but it runs incredibly poorly and the servers are laggy. even with all graphics setting turned to low i had an terrible framerate. The maps look really good and i had fun exploring them its just too bad i cant play a game in them. i suppose if you had an extra beefy computer and an awesome internet connection this game would be superb
5184	1	a	A rather wacky game where you shoot dinosaurs in the face with guns.  11/10
1525	1	a	How much fun can you have for 60p?  Chased by a T-Rex Picked up by a Ptera Thrown onto a tank Proceed to blow up everything  Better than a bag of Walkers 10/10 would scream hysterically again
801	1	a	This game is great. You run around, brutally dismembering the minions of the end boss, Magnus, through the use of your shanks, your heavy weapons (machetes, chainsaw, and sledge), ranged weapons (throwing knives, shotgun, and dual handguns), and explosives (grenades, molotovs, and landmines). The combat itself, regardless of weapon, is also immersive.  Also, you will die. A LOT.  In addition to the campaign, there's a survival mode where you need to work alone or with a partner to survive 30 waves of enemies by both not dying (a quite obvious aspect) and protecting three points on a small map from bombers, who put timed explosives on these points. There are many characters to unlock, including Shank's outfit from the first game.  This is an excellent game for those who like side-scrolling games.
469	1	a	Good game with an intresting story and intresting plot-twists. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but definetly a worthwhile game to kill time.
6384	0	a	  It is so bad! I had a good laugh with a friend while trying some multiplayer action. The delay between shooting animation and the sound, plus it is just so freaking clonky...
909	1	a	A decent sequel with good graphics and music, lots of blood, co-op survival mode (not many players though), weak story and bad controls (untill you get used to them).
6469	1	a	This game is currently 1$. It is the best dollar I have ever spent in my life. I've actually looked back and this is it!! Today I mowed down packs of raptors with a machine gun, I RPG'd a T-Rex, I drove a couplpe different vehicles over swarms of dinos, and even drove a whole car full of teamates to their doom!! (and got an acheivement for it!) The UI is a little chunky and not has a learning curve of about 5 minutes... So I can't complain. Don't but this expecting some sort of super polished 69.99 new-age game with all the graphics and cutscenes and stuff.... It looks like an n64 game (ok it's a little better) BUT ITS SO FUN!! I have no complaints about this game at all, I literally bought 6 copies for my friends so they can play with me. I will note that the multiplayer is where it's at and it was really easy to create a game and hace complete strangers come and cooperate with me. 9/10.
6329	1	a	For the price of a few gumballs you can run around and shoot a triceratops to death
5424	1	a	This has developed into one of the best indi games out there. If you like Killing Floor, this is your type of game. But it has better graphics, deeper custimization, massive maps, vehicles, and rediculous outfits. Very tough!
5805	1	a	better than Evolve
1829	1	a	I love this game for what it is meant to be. Gotta get that out there first.   If you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed.   This game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to. It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could.   That said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too).   The game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation).   Finally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens.   So all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.
1560	1	a	  It is a good game especially for Dino lovers it was the first game I play on PC and I loved it it is just such a good game I hope you also have a good time with it.
550	1	a	This is a fun open world/sandbox sort of game, if you like GTA, SR, and the like, grab it on sale.
2344	1	a	Well, I paid $1.49 during the winter sale for the 4 pack and I think it was worth that. It's not bad for the price if you want some mindless stupid fun. Just remember, this game costs 99 cents.
3819	1	a	this is the best game
2775	0	a	Terrible game 0/10 needs work
3184	1	a	99 cents and more fun than some AAA games out now!
6282	1	a	Sure it's a good game, but sure it has bad graphics. Yes, I know this game is kind of old but as a first person shooter it's fun. It still is fun when playing solo, as it revives an old taste of waves/survival with dinosaurs. Now honestly, I never really played with people because I kinda got bored at some point of time and stopped playing it. For others who are on this game's page and fan of these types of games, you should get it as it's just 1$.
472	1	a	This game is ridiculously awesome :D
5601	1	a	Really laggy for me.
691	0	a	I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.
3550	0	a	They changed the name of this thing three times, now.  and, now, it costs only 79 cents. They probably don't know any other way to grab cash and go.
3182	1	a	Worth a look when its on sale, lots of fun.
861	1	a	Mutch harder than the first but its good. 12/10 would rage on hard mode again.
366	0	a	The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes 'consuming' people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.
5944	1	a	When I first played Orion Prelude, it was a peice of crap... I just couldnt play it. It was near impossible the glitches were real. Over the time I have spent a good 10 hours at the time of this review. I can't even try to be negative about this game. It has some of the best co-op I have ever used. It has Evolved. It was Orion Dino Hoarde... Now it something more... Orion: PRELUDE. ITS WORTH $.99 
5673	0	a	This game is garbage, absolute and complete garbage. The matchmaking is crap, it cannot be played in full screen without crashing. Please do not waste your money on it. Here are 4 free game keys if you feel you want to try it, someone may get to it before you, but hey, possible free garbage game. The devs are not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, they gave me the free keys to give to my friends since the game is crap, but I do not hate my friends, so I am not going to give them crap. The devs say that they have fixed issues, they have not. They seem like decent, but completely incompetant people.  7MJ2P-EH42R-FZRW8 38Y8L-74QFY-A352D MFHAH-F0CN7-4N8XP 8BXK7-0VV7F-GQBX9
5280	0	a	This game blows. Trust me.
5474	0	a	This game is so terrible that it's hysterical, worth the pennies they're selling it for on sale just to laugh at it for an hour :D
4977	0	a	Bad graphics, slow gameplay, boring combat. 0/10 would never play again.
3693	1	a	DINO HORDE!!!! with a gorilla voice.
1906	1	a	Guns, Vehicals, and Dinos. Awsome!
4468	1	a	it was fun
3308	1	a	This game is so awesome. Think firefight mode on Halo: Reach, but ten times more awesome. Tons of content, lots of fun, and the community is also pretty great. Don't think i've ever had more fun in a multiplayer game before this. There are a lot of guns to choose from, the maps are absolutely huge, and the vehicles are pretty great. Everything handles well and runs smoothly. My only complaint is that there are only three human classes but apparently, there is a major update coming to this game in august which includes both a name change for the game itself and a bunch of new classes.
2017	1	a	I don't know about this game in the past, but right now in 2015 it is a blast. Seriously, it is some of the most fun I have had with gaming in a long time. IT IS A GAME WHERE I CAN JET PACK INTO THE SKY AND ROCKET LAUNCH A T-REX! FUN! This game is all about fun, and it damn sure is. Highly reccomended.
5539	1	a	so good you cant consider your self a gamer if you havent played it
3789	1	a	GRAAAAHR! RAWWWR! *Fwomph!*
2372	1	a	the most badest game in the world i had fifty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s whan i play the game much sexual very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
149	1	a	run around do sexy everywhere while comparing the game to infamous
2675	0	a	after this 'XP GRIND' came out the game is ruined i would have recommened it but now theres ppl with such high levels who dont even know how to play the game running around and its pure chaos.. other then playing with other ppl this game is great. UPDATE still havent taken notice of XP GRIND and ppl think its just a cheap crappy game and cheating wont matter.. how would you like it if everyone on GTA v was max level with everything after all the work you put into it all now for nothing?! it sucks and all i want is this â¥â¥â¥â¥ gone and at lest the leader boards and levels cleaned up but of corse the devs carely dont care enough to do anything
6062	1	a	well â¥â¥â¥â¥ i guess i should give it a second chance
3263	1	a	Played once during a free-weekend had a blast, would definitely recommend it the metascore to my knowledge is from before a massive overhaul/update?  I liked the gun selection and customization, it was also very easy to get into gameplay wise.
5393	1	a	I would recommend this game solely because it is fun to kill dinosaurs and how cheap you can pick it up for if you wait for a good sale. The graphics aren't very impressive, but it is very entertaining
5390	1	a	One of the cooles coop games out there! metascroe missleading ignore plz and watch user reviews. worth every fakn cent 
1744	1	a	since its under a dollar i think its fun as hell.
3558	0	a	Even though I wanted something cheesy and over the top, this failed to deliver. The mechanics are very buggy and the graphics are dated. I wanted to like it, but it felt like a student project, not a professional title.
5264	1	a	Great game. Love to play it with 4 other people. That way it's a full party and we can own. If you want to play with me just message.
6172	1	a	my game is very slow/laggy friend me if u know how to fix it plz. i can't realy tell what is wrong 
401	1	a	This game is hard when you are almost at the end of the game.   This is a game that you ALWAYS grab stuffs &amp; throw at the boss. If you want to melee on the boss he always hit you HARD than you hit him.... you mostly die if you melee boss. good luck  If you want good challenge this is your game.  
5725	1	a	This game is great! I bought it for 74 cents and I've been playing this game a lot (when I should be playing GTA:V which I bought for $59.59). It's nice to see developers that tried really hard to fix a broken game, and honestly this game is great. It kind of reminds me of Halo, except compared to the new Halos this is better (and much cheaper). And I've only been doing solo mode. 10/10 not IGN
5207	1	a	Orion Prelude, a game for 0.99euro wich is in terms of fun above most games of 60 euro like really after 2 rounds (and I still didnt know the controls because I was to lazy to look for them) I was already addicted to this game.  Weapons and verichels in Planetside2 style, Dinosaurs, Like ya Dinosaurs guys  if u have 1 euro on your steam buy it right now u won't reget it
6483	1	a	Most fun thing I've ever played with my friends.
2813	1	a	Very fun. and at the moment only a dollar
3591	0	a	its a piece of garbage im sorry its so bad i cant even describe it in words  
2851	1	a	Dank M8  totally worth more than $1
1662	1	a	oh buddy, you know whats up
5991	1	a	Best dollar game I have ever bought.
2892	1	a	alright so... i tired it for a few mins and i can say right away that:  -yes this game worth buying considering the price. -yes considering the price it is satisfaying. -'cute' with friends i guess... -nice costumization.  -Horibble game in my opinion  .. yes considering the price its awesome but let me tell u this:  the animations are misplaced (i ran with a gun and my hand and the gun ran diffrent timing and directions) graphics are kinda ok... sound is ok too  the game works fine but those things i said and in general... not rly fun so i would reccomand it just bcuz of the AMAZINGLY LOW PRICE! 
5148	0	a	o you ever feel like slamming your face into the wall, whether due to frustration or any other reason? This is the game for you. Everyone should play this game. If not just to appreciate every other game you've ever played pretty much. Maybe you just spent a period of time witnessing idiocy to the extreme and feel like slamming your face into the desk. Perhaps you just came from the cesspools of the internet. Just play this game. Results may vary.
4878	1	a	like a free much better version of evolve.
5438	1	a	This game is amazing and well thought out. It has not only superb graphics, but amazing music as well. The gameplay is easy to pick up on and its fun to play for hours and hours at a time, even on maps that are worlds to roam around in. Killing dinos is now one of my favorite things to do in video games, thanks to this.
4355	1	a	You are a real MLG PRO Sn1p4r against all da mothafriking dinos.  10/10 would rekt.
4526	0	a	Completely unfinished and broken. DO NOT BUY.
3193	1	a	HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥, ITS A DINOSAUR. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT THE FUUUUCK.  That summarizes the game. 10/10
5876	1	a	One of the best Indie on steam. After 3 years of post-release support it has become a great piece for any gamer interested in a dynamic, competitive or cooperative Dinosaur themed game. Dinosaurs are well made, there is a very big amount of maps (every map has day-night cycle and dynamic weather conditions), there are a lot of different game modes (cooperative survival, open world conquest, many competitive PvP modes, and 'rampage'-a team of players playing as dinosaurs protecting their eggs from an enemy team of human players-), there is the possibility to use PC bots as team mates and the graphic is good as well. Great soundtracks too, perfect to the sci-fi atmosphere of the entire gameplay. Really satisfied with this game.
4994	0	a	Got the game for 25 cents and still feel like I overpaid. I tried to like it, but I couldn't bring myself to it. Feels like it could be Free to Play and not be worth it.
4358	1	a	Shot a t-rex with a laser bow, and went all Jedi on a pack of raptors. 10/10
3494	1	a	Nice game
1910	0	a	I could recommend it, if something was done about the dinosaurs. Seriously, I'm higly doubting they did any modelling. It looks like a gif placed on your screen and they run very... weird? I can't explain, try if you want it, they did a good job on all the rest! I just can't get over the fact how crappy and ugly those dinosaurs are.
3065	1	a	Pretty entertaining game, especially for the price. if you have friends this game is buggy enough to keep it unpredictable and fun.
573	1	a	Great gameplay, for the first 10 hours. Then it's nothing but repetition
4736	0	a	Was a really fun game untill they wigged with everything...
5066	1	a	This game is game but also hilarious. I would recommend this game if you have some friend to play it with.
1128	1	a	SUPER fun! My only problem is that the gravity gun is broken. You can get anywhere by jumping, pulling the object up, and jumping off of it. Repeat until you get to your destination. Other than that (especially with the Steam sale), it's a really fun game!
965	1	a	Awesome sequel, this game is everything the first was with just a little bit of updating and better animation. Survival mode is addictive , fun and challenging. Really hoping for a 3rd game in the series.
3256	1	a	10/10 would snap dinosaur's neck irl thx m0m i luve yuh happy birfday breh got fade catch it in orion dino horde breh the last of the real dino stompers irl and in game breh got fade lets catch it breh i dont even care im trying to write a g00b review and you talking smack breh 1v1 me in rust gotr problem brew
4993	0	a	No.... Just NO 
1595	1	a	This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it.   If you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)  With that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).  Sure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.
2701	1	a	If you want to play a multiplayer survival shooter with your mates this is one of the best on offer. Just jump in not expecting much and enjoy a great laugh. I've fought a stegosaurus with a flamethrower, jetpacked into the sky and shot a t-rex in the face with a mini gun. I've pied pipered a horde of raptors to rocket jump doom and successfully juggled the slow mo perk of killing a t-rex with carefully timed rocket blasts! All this happened in multiplayer with a mate laughing alongside me. I have a Robin Hood hat, stupid purple guns and can't survive on my own above easy difficulty level even with my acquired perks, but I love it.  In the words of Smash TV, 'I'd buy that for a dollar!'
703	1	a	Solitaire with magic. Pretty fun. No online though.
2686	1	a	It is really fun either with or without friends (In the off chance you want to play alone and or don't have any)
5081	1	a	What are you waiting for??? You get to shoot rocket launchers at giant crocodile's in the face while flying, in slowmotion!!! 38/10
773	1	a	Great top-down shooter....cool graphics....xbox 360 controller works great also...best of all it is 9.99....8/10
863	1	a	This game kinda reminds me of Metal Slug
4464	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥IN' LOVE RAPTORS.
4887	1	a	Awesome game but it doesn't run on my laptop :(
1392	1	a	'what have i been doing the past few hours?'- says anyone who buys this game  9 out of 11
1600	0	a	Every time this game gets too many bad steam reviews, the developers re-release it under a different name. I think this is like, the 3rd or 4th time?
2302	1	a	This game is actually really fun :P It has definitely changed for the better in the last year. I'd recommend it, and consider everyone lucky because its so cheap!!
3900	1	a	coop multiplayer with tons of guns and jetpacks and dinosaurs. Whats not to love?
3614	0	a	Game is a horrible mess, on top of that, Dev has had a past of stealing textures from other games, Don't be suprised if he changes the games name again to escape all the critisim,
95	1	a	Still a great game, but it is basically unplayable on modern systems Here's how to fix that:  1) Deactivate all HID devices in the device manager to get stable FPS.  This is a common problem with many old games. At first i was reluctant to trying out this fix in fear of screwing up external or internal devices. Now I've had them deactivated for months and haven't noticed any difference.  2) Unlock the game's graphics setings  Prototype can only address graphics cards up to 2 GB properly. If you have more than that, your graphics settings will be automatically limited. To fix that, follow this link:   http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=23539057&amp;postcount=6   As for the game itself: It may not be as long-term motivating as GTA, but while there is still something to do / explore / destroy, you're gonna have a lot of fun. Another plus is that the game's internal Vsync actually locks it to 60 fps instead of the usual 30, which makes for a smooth gameplay experience. If you like causing mayhem and don't mind the little bit clunky mouse / keyboard controls (you can use a controller though), then you should try this one out.
5587	0	a	Think of owning this game like adopting a troubled child. Sure it'll grow, and sure chances are it'll get better year after year, but at some point when it's revealed that the child is actually a derranged serial killer, you'll wonder if it was born that way or if there was anything you could've done to avoid to. The answer is no.
3259	0	a	You can customize characters in lots of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ways, but due to high techs armors it's not really funny and you need to buy these.. The game has nothing innovative. I didnt find it interesting although it's only 0.99 euro.
5531	1	a	Best .99 cent I've ever spent. Its stupid fun and nothing is broken.  I shot a Trex with a Flamethrower, it ate me while i was on fire, I went into second wind, it died from the flames. I won.
4291	1	a	Not a bad game,but defenitely needs some optimizing in the next patches.You got dinosaurs,vehicles,a nice amount of weapons,some customization.It's a good game,not the best,but you can surely enjoy it with a couple friends if you have the time.And it's cheap :D
164	1	a	This game... cures angry thoughts... by releasing them. :3  First time I played this game, I completed half of the main story stabbing, slashing and smashing sh*t in one night.  You play as Alex Mercer, a powerful shapeshifter who was infected with a virus that grant him the use of INSANE powers and abilities in order to fight off those who are not and those who are like him. He gains new abilities thoughout the game and upgrades to enhance survivability and damage in order to survive the post-apocolyptic New York City. While running around, you also have the opportunity to complete events to earn extra EP to spend on powers and upgrades. Also, comsuming specific people will unlock memories that sums up on what the hell is going on to the world around you.  -The story has its twist and turn moments that'll leave you at the edge of your seat.  -In order to love this game, you HAVE to love the protagonist!  -Controls are alright, as you are forced to mash every button to use an ability successfully. &gt;.&gt; -Characters have their intense moments as some are worth betrayal and some worth supporting Alex Mercer. -Gameplay and environment brings out the intense destruction of the situation you're witnessing.   Anyone who favors open-world, hack-n-slash, sadistic destruction, anti-hero with a badass jacket: this is your game! 10/10 ABSOLUTELY recommended!
6241	1	a	I wanna play this at 4k ):
1653	1	a	Wow I'm suprized this game kick's A$$ 2 friends and I played co-op and it's really addictve All diff kinds of vehicles like bf4 and hordes of dinosaurs almost like left for dead but dinosaurs and A lil like sanctum 2 with the tower deffense of protecting the generators.Great amount of cool futuristic guns and jet packs if u want. What more can u ask for $0.99 I Love It
3027	0	a	Buy porn Dont waste money on this
5996	1	a	Game is super slow on my computer. I have all the needed requirements for ir, but it laggs like crazy. It seems like a fun game, but I can't enjoy playing it because the graphics that are shown are not what I see in the game. Any help for what I can do to get rid of this problem?
6546	1	a	Yep totally cool.Very good graphics and the atmosphere feels so real!
3365	1	a	Really nice and good game 10/10
2414	1	a	This game is ridiculous. While I certainly wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't on sale, this game is still worthwile if you like killing dinosaurs.
3756	1	a	Underrated but incredibly fun
5162	0	a	Worst shooting I've ever tried out in gaming.
5139	0	a	You should not buy this game, your caracter is hard to controle, dinos are everywhere and moving too fast. This is not fun.
4265	0	a	its HARD to say if i recommend it or not, its not a total waste of 0.99 cents  its fun in the begining, but the gameplay its buggy, the Dinos MAIN PURPOSE is just to rush you....RUSH you until you kill it... i would rather suggest to save the $$ for a better game like killing floor or something better than this :D ~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT ALL  The gameplay isnt smooth always buggy/shaky/etc the Bots are weak and terrible in solo play i say the bugs RUINS THE GAMEPLAY
4461	1	a	i bought this game in 2012 when it first came out and ive loved it ever since. its a great game to play with freinds
4787	1	a	Great game!
5708	1	a	Really good game for killing dinos
1690	1	a	If you want to Kill Waves of Dinos just Buy this game and you can be a dino. i give it 1/1
715	1	a	Imagine Puzzle Quest, except with Poker instead of Match 3. It's a quirky card game with RPG elements. Story is sufficient and doesn't get in the way. Gameplay seems to be balanced so it's not too hard, but not too easy either. The game does seem to go just a bit longer than needed. But it was an enjoyable game considering how different it was.
4090	0	a	runs badly on windows 7 (i got windows 8 still laggy)
1067	1	a	It's better than it looks. The gravity gun mechanic is done really well, and the physics puzzles are solid. And there's new stuff to play with introduced in each world to keep things fresh.  Plus it's really cheap. I recommend it
1311	0	a	  A friend gifted this to me last christmas. I'm rethinking our friendship
1136	1	a	i swear to god i hear 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' come out of the BEEP's mouth
1835	0	a	This is a very misleading game its makes you think these Awesome epic encounters and Amazing Gameplay in the trailer it says things like 'Paid $3.99 for this game and is better than some of $60 games' and things like that so then I try the 5 day Trial and what do I get A game that crashes contsantly and has tons of bugs and glitches and SO MUCH LAG and you may be saying you may just need a better computer and no I payed $800+ dollars for this computer and it is one of the fastes computers out there so no i had to lower my resolution disable most everything that i could and still tons of lag and its the same raptor over and over and when you try to actually play the game its way to hard even on the lowest difficulty and no I dont suck at the fps genre its the game the Allasaurus that spits acid its way to hard to kill so the only possitive think i can say about this game is that it has a massive potential and can be very very addictive with the proper updates and fixes to the bugs than I would highly recommend this but sadly no I have to hate this game and i try to not hate games heck I actually Enjoy the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 so I am an open Minded person. Please feel free to leave a comment and like this review
4011	1	a	One of the best multiplayer experience I've ever had.
2660	1	a	You could say, the dinosaurs got T-Rekt..  -Theodore Trillbilly, PhD, Moderator of /r/dinosaurs
2409	1	a	This game is probably the best you can buy for a buck. I love this game. it's not too hard and the graphics are amazing. it's not super easy either and that's what makes it great. I see it as a mix of casual and action because its not too far on either side of the scale. I love this game and although everyone sais there are a lot of bugs, the only thing i found bugged was i got disconnected to the internet everytime i opened the game. this meant i couldn't play online with friends. although that sucks, i still had a lot of fun playing and for a dollar, i say it's a great game. Heck i like it so much, I would have payed $15 for it. Maybe more. So i definately recommend it. Pick it up as soon as possible!
3518	1	a	Well just like a ton of players I also bought this game for around 1 dollar and now its free, well â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥...In spite all that game isnt that bad, you like dinos, you like FPS games, you're gonna like the game...
4504	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
4957	1	a	IGN - It's like Halo with Dinosaurs! 8/10
1642	0	a	really â¥â¥â¥â¥ game but worth the 99c price tag
3268	1	a	This is a super game for the price! It's like Halo with dinosaurs, You fight off waves of dinos in a multiplay, multigun, multi vehicle setting. I really like it for the full submersion being surrounded by attacking dinos really giving you great combat training. If your into first or third person shooters and want to sharpen your close quarters combat skills - This game is for you. 
4127	1	a	I enjoyed it when it was a free game for a while then it ran out of its freeness and i realy want it so if someone would be generous to gift me this game then that would be amazing! I do understand its only one dollar but steam is being glitchy and wont let me get it.
423	1	a	Great game for anyone who like action and hack and slash types, alot like devil may cry but much more brutal ';.;'
62	1	a	Next to Sam and Max, the funniest original point and clicks. Get it so that maybe Sierra makes more.
3205	1	a	Awesome game, very addictive, paid 0.99 Euros and I didn't regret one cent ;).
5037	1	a	big deal they stole some assets it's a good game and plus it's enough to feel like a new and different game, Thanks Developers. &lt;3
135	1	a	I remember first playing this game on the 360 when it came out but only for an hour or two. I loved the mobility and variations of transformations Mercer can achieve. Being able to play as a villian was quite satisfying and I honestly felt like I had some super powers. Now that I was able to play through it on the PC, I have to say that I really enjoyed the game for the gameplay, the story was somewhat mediocre but, the sheer power Mercer had shadowed that.
1975	1	a	Fun game for a 4 people lobby,i played it with couple of friends and we had a good laugh and a nice game,killin the dinosaurs is funny,basically it is all same like l4d but with much lower graphics!
1196	0	a	Well I was expecting BEEP to be a lot worse that it looks like at first glance - yet another 2D platformer.   Still, the controls aren't insultingly clunky, and the artwork, while really low effort, isn't the worst I've seen either.  Should you buy BEEP, then? No, not really. It's got fewer flaws than most 2D platformers, but neither is it the king of the genre.   Also, technical problems prevent the game from being run under Windows 10 if you have a high res display and use DPI (required if your PPI is at or near retina level). Overscan means you can only access 1/4 of the screen with your mousepointer in full screen mode - you have to run it windowed.   So, while not worth buying, it's worth acknowledging the game is polished enough to be tolerable, meaning at least some of the developers on the project could achieve greater things in future.
777	0	a	Its good fun, and not too hard. The only problem I have is the game getting stuck at a point (for me, the end of the first level on Katharsis) with no way to progress. It seems to be common and it's quite frustrating.
4831	0	a	So this game was earlier known as ORION: Dino Beatdown and ORION: Dino Horde, but it's not mentioned anywhere in store page and haven't exactly found any other reason for that than making it harder to find bad reviews. Thankfully I only spend under euro, but I already knew that I disliked Dino Horde and as game wasn't expensive I just bought it before realising this.   To summarize: even though it has every desireable PC options included thanks to Unreal 3, it's pretty unoptimized and looks hideous. I can't count how many times dino spawned right in front of me even when I haven't played that long, guns look, sound and feel really powerless toys, menus and hud feel like mess, filled one game with bot player and they are simply brainless and coop doesn't even seem to matter as long as you simply shoot even more brainless dinos.   Only thing making it worthwhile is price at this point, but I still wouldn't buy it. They should've just let this thing die ages ago instead of trying to rename it every week.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Eli tÃ¤tÃ¤ peliÃ¤ on aiemmin myyty nimillÃ¤ ORION: Dino Beatdown ja ORION: Dino Horde, mutta sitÃ¤pÃ¤ ei mainitakaan kauppasivulla enkÃ¤ ole ainakaan itse lÃ¶ytÃ¤nyt tÃ¤lle mitÃ¤Ã¤n parempaa syytÃ¤ kuin tehdÃ¤ huonojen arvostelujen lÃ¶ytÃ¤misestÃ¤ vaikeampaa. Onneksi en tuhlannut peliin edes euron vertaa, mutta tiesÃ­n jo vihaavani Dino Hordea ja koska peli ei ollut yhtÃ¤Ã¤n kallis niin ostin sen ennen tuon tajuamista.   Summa summarum: vaikka peli sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ joka ikisen perusasetuksen jota PC rÃ¤iskinnÃ¤ltÃ¤ voi haluta kiitos Unreal 3:sen, jostain syystÃ¤ peli nÃ¤yttÃ¤isi olevan tosi huonosti optimoitu ja nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ jÃ¤rkyttÃ¤vÃ¤n kauhealta. En enÃ¤Ã¤ pysty laskemaan kuinka monta kertaa dino spawnasi suoraan eteen vaikken ole edes pelannut niin kauaa, aseet kuulostavat, nÃ¤yttÃ¤vÃ¤t ja tuntuvat erittÃ¤in voimattomilta leluilta, valikot ja hudi tuntuvat hieman sotkuisilta, yhdessÃ¤ pelissÃ¤ kÃ¤ytetty bottipelaaja oli tÃ¤ysin aivoton ja tiimipeli ei tunnu edes sen kummemmin olevan tarpeen kunhan vain tappaa vielÃ¤ aivottomampia dinoja.   Ainoa asia mikÃ¤ tekee pelistÃ¤ enÃ¤Ã¤ pelaamisen arvoisen on hinta, mutten siltikÃ¤Ã¤n ostaisi sitÃ¤.

2734	1	a	People say this game bad but is not. It had layers. It like an onion. Onion have layers. Onion: Peepee is onion. When people say it ogre say no, it isn't ogre. All of the Shrek out of the swamp gas. Very happy.
629	1	a	Really fun game, bit jumpy during cutscenes and had the game freeze a couple times, really hate some of the controls and the integration with steam is horrible and interferes sometimes with the gameplay but overall the game was enjoyable
4239	1	a	Thrift shop style
5398	0	a	Even for 1.50$ this game is a huge waste of money, plain and boring, dont buy
2087	1	a	this game is soo buggy it should be free to play
142	1	a	Destroyed a helicopter by throwing an old lady into it Loving it so far.
2152	1	a	What i did, Buy this game say to myself dinosaurs interesting, creates survival lobby on easy on solo...........  INSANITY DINOSAURS EVERYWHERE me on the other hand Jetpack Master Rpg master Flying through the air killing dinos and prelude bots alike having the old grandest of times... until i took a list of boss dinos to the knee and they killed me dead, i could fight to survive and round 10 is where i lie here today 
5040	0	a	Ive have spent so much time on this game (as seen above) that its truly sad that im writing a bad review for it.  I understand it is a one dollar game but many free games like flash games and warframe top this game. The hard work and time ive put into this game could have been spent with family so the moral of this review is dont play this game for hours apon hours when it is a bad game, ive suffered so you dont have too......91039/12....would play again.....maybe......not.....definitely not....
6113	1	a	Need moar Playars
4615	1	a	Candy crush &gt; farmville &gt; ORION: Dino Horde
5046	0	a	Some games are quite simple, yet very enjoyable.That happens beacuse they surpass our expectations, proving to be more than just a simple game.In ORION:Dino Horde`s case, it`s the exact opposite: the games promisses too much and ridiculously fails at delivering it.Old looking graphics(not on purpose) , dumb A.I. and constant lagging and crashing problems make you wish someone more competent had developed this.No, the metacritic score is not so misleading as they say.
4465	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
627	1	a	 R.J. Macready Award.   Ever wanted to be John Carpenter's The Thing? Now you Can!
2628	1	a	Orion: Prelude is actually really quite a fun and enjoyable game. The bugs are also hilarious.
1788	1	a	Great Game!... for a dollar. I got it during a sale for only 99 cents so it was definitly worth buying it then! 15 bucks is a little iffy
3043	1	a	played as a T-Rex, spent the whole match trying to eat my raptor teammates. 10 outta 10, best game ever
5085	1	a	Yes this game is very fun. It brings out your inner 6 year old blasting dinos and such.
3973	1	a	this has been the best sence d dino day 
1453	1	a	great game! deffinatly worth 18 cents! im not a singleplayer nor platformer fan, but this game is challengeing and fun. many puzzles within the game and lots of action... im still not finished with the game but im almost done with the first world and i plan on finishing the game.
718	1	a	Runespell is a decent puzzle, nice poker mechanics and visuals. Obviously influenced by Puzzle Quest, but not that deep. It's not very short, you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it, also there are achievements and New Game+. Music is great. all 3 tracks, so it gets quite repetitive. Multiplayer and dlc would be great additions, but apparently this game is abandoned by the developers.
5320	1	a	When this game first came out it felt like a waste of money and had little content, but after thousands of updates and improvments this game is acutally worth every $! if your looking for a fun coop game with dinos! then this is a must buy :D
1793	0	a	its a really bad game dont even think about buying it even if it is on sale
2893	1	a	Love it for everything about it 
3222	1	a	Orion prelude updated review*  Orion prelude is a trully wonderful game. I still cant believe how awesome it feels even after a week playing the beta. The developers of this title did an extraordinary work to present us all with the new content update and lemme tell u, u wont regret it.  The graphics have been updated and overhauled to the best possible way. The gameplay has become really smooth and more fun. The addition of bots has made even single player more addictive. With endless mods that allow u to customize your characters/ pvp each other/play as dinos/test your abilities to the maximum/survive in open world maps, orion prelude has become what it was meant to be from the beginning. And that my friend is one of the best indie fps out there.  Although it has some minor flaws that need to be fixed, for 1$ on steam its maybe one of the best deals u will find in a game. If that is not a win deal, i dont know what is. Like i said in my previous review this game is better than alot AAA titles and damn more fun.  9/10
3582	1	a	you need to buy this.... you wont find a game with this much content, customization and polish for 10 euros....devs fullfilled everything they promised after a bad start, and vent even the extra mile.
4198	1	a	Its... cool...
5151	0	a	the AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game
5253	1	a	i always thought this game could never be better but i hope more people play it but i would still play this than titanfall i would give it 1000/10 points i mean this game could be better but i like it this way i stil think that players should be able to choose what dino to be but the boss battles i would give a 5/10 and the rest is just fine accept please higher the price's for some equipement
792	1	a	Such a fantastic and affordable game. Great story lines with over the top action and mayhem! Harkens to the games on my yesteryears (I'm 40!) when you knew an epic boss battle was just around the corner! I discovered this game first and must go back to pay the original Shank. I can't wait! Full controller support is a bonus too. Highly recommended!
3939	1	a	Oi m8 we thinkin about getin Orion:Prelude eh? Would giv a 4/20 m8 rele noice. Dont play on that â¥â¥â¥â¥in potato though m8
1127	1	a	Do not be deceived, this game is trickier than it seems... It was given to me and I went 'oh sure, I'll try it before going to bed'.... an hour an a half later, I'm still on and no longer asleep.. &gt;.&gt;   
1159	1	a	I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI! If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.  Even world 2 was stupidly hard.
4650	0	a	Wasted money on this bug ridden game 1/10 would not buy bugged games again
2134	1	a	This game is way to fun to be $1.
5643	1	a	Wow 3 years of work, you know I was going to toss â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it but instead I am going to said GG Gid Gud  I honestly enjoyed the game, and sides it's not that expensive in contrast to every single popular shooter that is out right now, thank you giving me something to do in my free time, if there is one thing I apreciate more than anything in games is being able to blast stuff with grade launchers
2308	1	a	I remember when this game was Orion: Dino Horde. It was interesting to say the least, but with the new name came what felt like a new game with better optimization, gameplay, everything really. If you're looking for a good quality, cheap game, then this is it. I'd recomend it even if it were $15.  10/10
4155	0	a	This is literally the worst game I have ever played. Not even worth the download time for its free weekend.
4320	1	a	addicting game if you like borderlands you will LOVE this
4290	0	a	The systems at play here just did not grab my attention. I thought it might be interesting to hunt dinosaurs in these large and open arenas, but I continually felt pestered by the smaller enemies, and the large enemies could be quite spongy. However, at this point, the online servers may not be as populated as they once were. More players and teamwork might make the title more enjoyable.
5122	1	a	14/10 Would pay mere cents to gut a T-rex with a lightsaber
5430	1	a	Its well made, fun and interesting . . recomended for casual gamers. 7/10
4024	1	a	Amazing, amazing, totally worth it! Great graphics ( I dont think the critics like shooters anyways!) Lots of weapons, intense, and lots of combat action. With the control of 10 dinosaurs and 3 humans with hundreds of skins and dressups. It makes it even better, it's a pure action game.   'Crushing thriller, action game!'
5031	1	a	'Ha it's only a dollar It'll be a piece of garbage but whatevs'  *plays for 20 minutes*  I have now found the ultimate reason to go on in life. I shall forever be a knight in the holy crusade against the blasphemous dinosaurs. I hereby devote my very existence to driving a tank and shooting velociraptors on the ground and failing at taking pterodactyls out of the sky. ORION: Prelude is the pinnacle achievement of humanity.  11/10 would get stomped on by a T Rex again
5522	1	a	Nice game!
4232	0	a	pretty bad, glad I spent $1 on it.  The problems are the map is too big for walking and too small for the slow vehicles. Combat is boring, AIs are boring, graphics are too simplistic.
5887	1	a	good game.. good graphics... really fun to play :D
1983	1	a	If Microsoft will not bring Halo back to the PC, Im glad we have ORION:Dino Horde  Halo + Dinosaurs = 10/10  Hours of fun for tha whole family :-)
3219	1	a	You can kill a T-Rex in a tank - or punch his feet.  This game would be worth it even at 5â¬, but it's only 1, so go out buy it and have some stupid fun!
4285	1	a	What a cool game
4391	1	a	wow. this game wanted me to do cocaine off my car windshield. pterodactyl is best in show. tru art with the copters and killing teamates 10/10 will pee pants again out of excitement
1092	1	a	Very good! Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay.  Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun. I would buy this even if it costed more. The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine. The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.  10/10
3539	1	a	couldn't figure out how to attack 10/10
4398	1	a	My friend gifted this game to me.  10/10 would accept gifts again
4670	0	a	this game is needs improving they should make the graffics better and make the game openworld survivel.
6387	1	a	No need to listen to the critics, while the devs may not be too good, the game is very fun for 1 dollar. Defenitley worth it!
1858	1	a	Totally LOVE it! I'm already addicted, tho they need more .... female stuff in the game, like accessories and such.
433	1	a	A great game, really. Your'e able to distort your body to form weapons (claws, armor, wrecking balls for hands, etc), and then tear people up God Of War style. Free roaming, similar to Grand Theft Auto. Run around killing people for hours for the hell of it, or advance the plot. Really fun game, maybe a little short. You can get through the main plot line in about 13-15 hours, depending on how much trouble you have with bosses near the end.
2626	1	a	This game is ruining my free time.
3859	0	a	its not smooth, dinamycs are not very good, if you want to buy, buy it with a good discount.
2559	1	a	Shot a Triceratops in the face with a rocket launcher while nearing death. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ him off and got sent flying to my death. T-Rex threw a boulder into my face right before a pterosaur of some sort grabbed me. Got loose and fell to my death. 10/10, would have my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me by dinosaurs again.
6588	1	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥? Or is it â¥â¥â¥â¥?
2841	1	a	You shoot Dinosaurs.... 10/10
4083	1	a	Its Awesome primal rampage
3044	1	a	Good game but has starting trouble and will get stuck always
1447	1	a	Very cool, arcade game where you have to think a little before you do that, a lot of levels, the game hardly contain and priced very low. :)
4872	1	a	This game is wonderful. Buy it, you wont be sorry. 9/10 best FPS I've ever plated
6170	1	a	Whilst flying a helicopter with my friend he jumps out and lands on a T-rex instantly killing both of them.   10/10 would fly with friend again
6487	1	a	Greatest game to exist! Dinosaurs and vehicles!
5559	1	a	This game is a riot for a goodly amount of time, but after a while it gets a little plain. One of those titles you lose interest in and then come back to. But s*** it was 99 cents.
4581	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ crashes on start up never mind fixed it still a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
3137	1	a	absolutely awful. all you do is shoot dinosaurs and jump.
6169	1	a	I loved This Game 10/10 you guys did AWESOME on this.
579	1	a	Do you like being nigh-invulnerable? Do you like rampaging unchecked through New York? Do you like being able to karate kick helicopters? If you answered 'yes,' Prototype is the game for you!
2129	1	a	Orion: Prelude provides at least $0.74 worth of entertainment.
3214	1	a	Really, this game is truly amazing. There are no dinosaur games/simulators like it, also you can fight a T-Rex in a Mech Suit....   So really your decison has been made for you, buy it! -Totally worth it.
3234	0	a	I love how hard you're trying to make it seem like this game made a comeback! No one is playing on the servers that have nearly 900 ping...... Stop trying move on. I intalled then uninstalled 4mins later. This game still sucks people....
6365	1	a	It worth the 80 cents!
576	1	a	Imagine a GTA with super powers, so basically that is the gameplay of Prototype. The story is good, has no great time but captive, controls respond well (at least q u wanted to make a narrow jump, get ready to anger) and overall is a divertio game.  The Prototype problem is the great repetition, there are basically 2 types of monsters we face (the whole game) the other tanks are soldiers and helicopters (can steer all vehicles), the missions are repeated and as the enemies is also easy to get sick. Q One thing irritated me very much is that when we are not controlling the character (standing alone, out of the water and the like) suffer damage, so it's normal to be knocked down by a missile 5x without even move power control.  I know it is difficult to decide whether or not recommend, but overall I think the fun is still worthwhile. Recommend with 75% off  pros. fun, power and playing the terror in the city, long gameplay + -12 hours  neg. camera, repetitive enemies and missions, control for simple jumps, side quest boring as hell (but of quiet to finish without making)   Imagina um GTA com super poderes, isso basicamente que Ã© o gameplay do Prototype. A historia Ã© boa, nÃ£o tem nenhum grande momento mas cativa, os controles respondem bem (ao menos q vc queria fazer um pulo estreito, se prepare para se irritar) e no geral Ã© um game divertio.  O problema de Prototype Ã© a grande repetiÃ§Ã£o, existem basicamente 2 tipos de monstros que enfrentamos (o jogo todo) os demais sÃ£o soldados tanks e helicopteros (podemos pilotar todos veiculos), as missÃµes se repetem e como os inimigos tambÃ©m fica facil enjoar. Uma coisa q me irritou muito bastante Ã© que quando nÃ£o estamos controlando os personagem (levantando sozinho, saindo da Ã¡gua e afins) sofremos dano, entÃ£o Ã© normal ficar sendo derrubado por missel umas 5x sem ao menos poder mexer o controle.  Eu sei fica dificil decidir se recomendo ou nÃ£o, mas no geral creio que a diversÃ£o ainda vale a pena. Recomendo com 75% off  prÃ³s . diversÃ£o, poderes e a tocar o terror na cidade, gameplay longo +-12 horas  neg. camera, repetiÃ§Ã£o de inimigos e missÃµes, controle para pulos simples, side quest chatas pra â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (mas da para terminar tranquilo sem fazer)
2172	1	a	Cheap, unfinished and sometimes buggy as all hell but even with these downsides it just feels like playing a B movie that's soo bad it somehow becomes really good and this game does have some damn good moments.
5058	1	a	Ran around with a knife stabbing and eating volociraptors 10/10
4866	0	a	only had a few quick games but so far nothing to shout about, gaming seems boring and dull. The only apspect that impressed me was the size of the dinosaurs..some are MASSIVE. one to avoid for me personally.
2001	0	a	God awful game. Visuals are worse than the original Halo CE. No working servers. No instructions or comprehendible tutorial. The shooting feels like a trackball arcade shooter with â¥â¥â¥â¥ stuck in buttons.  Do not buy this game. It's not even worth 99 cents.
2803	1	a	This game is dank m8, go full sanic on that purchase button. 10.5/10 Skyrim with lube.
528	1	a	Run around a city and explode people. Pretty fun.
4156	0	a	This game has poor gunplay ,the dinosaurs take almost random amounts of damage, the characters dont start with anything more then a pistol and you have to buy all other guns,When you die you go into a second wind style mode which would be good save for the fact that when you go into this mode ALL OF THE DINOSAURS RUN AWAY FROM YOU makeing it nearly imposable to respawn unless its the start of a new wave. If you wanted m to play a horde shooter i recomend killing floor or if you want a game where you can kill dinosaur-like creatures borderlands 2 also has better gunplay
2095	1	a	I liked it even if others don't!
1184	1	a	physco robot flying around killing peeps and making more beeps while the animals hang out with eachohter no hommo  420 Blaze it/10-IGN
5402	1	a	Haha had a lot of fun with this game.. well worth the couple bucks. I personally played it with a couple buddies for a co-op fps and we waisted a lot of time and dinosaurs!!! :D
3785	1	a	better than Call of Duty Ghost
1861	1	a	Great game, co-op is really nice :) Some weapons are to OP :( but it's fun to play, especially with friends :) Try it on every free weeked and then buy 4-pack :) it's worth every penny :)
6514	1	a	Great fun for some 3rd/1st person dino killing action
849	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
4584	0	a	Can't even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play it.
2719	1	a	The game is really fun, even if it looks terrible. It is totally worth the price if you get a four pack and play it with some friends.
2472	1	a	For the price of a drink from Mc'Donalds, its a pretty solid game, still needs work but just buy it.   6/10
6343	0	a	Note: this is before recent changes that have drastically improved the game, still not great but better.  I do not recommend this game. It is literally the worst purchase I have ever made. The mouse sensitivity goes only from Super Extreme to Mega Extreme, the plays worse that Carnivores from the 90âs, there is literally no one else online and it looks nothing like the previews or screenshots that I'm sure youâre looking at. You will get more enjoyment out of your money if you went to the bank and had it all turned into change, then subsequently ate all the change and waited anxiously for the aftermath.
2872	0	a	I think these devs only get money on this 'cause it's like a dollar to fifty cents at times and then someone thinks 'Oh, I can make a funny video about this game'. I assure you this title is not something you should play lightly. I have played most first person shooters of my era and this is nearly the worst one out of all of them that also tries to present itself as a finished game. 3/10 I made a video and wrote a review for it.
5486	1	a	shooting dinosaurs how can it not be good?
2903	1	a	A fps with a planetary prehistoric feel. Co-op and pvp elements mixed with rpg and an interesting line of guns and augments. Face a unique line of dinos whom are not tooo happy with humans discovering and harvesting the resources of their planet.  11/24/13 First i'll personally apologise to the devs for such a late update to my review.... Over a year has passed and the devs were true to the word. Dino horde is at a state that i would recomend it to any gamer, casual or pro. Dino horde has also become much much more than a survival co-op. They have added pvp and over 5 more different pvp and co-op modes.
342	0	a	The game itself is pretty great actually. BUT DO NOT BUY IT if you had a hex core processor. You need to turn off some cores manually in order to launch the game.
1120	1	a	Bought it for 19 cents and isn't that bad tbh
2831	1	a	Very entertaining! quite addicting with the right team too!
5103	1	a	This game went through a lot so I'm rewriting my review after the big prelude update.  So let's get directly to the point : for 1$ this game is great.   You have a huge variety of weapons and perks with which you can shoot dinosaurs, there are 3 classes each one with a special ability (even if the one with the jetpack is the most fun to play and therefore might be the only one you'll be playing) and you also got a couple of vehicles.  And that's it, there are tenth of game modes, but most of them aren't that interesting and conquest or survival are the only ones worth it. There is another playmode where you play human team 1 vs human team 2 vs dinosaurs which is really interesting but there are just not enough players to play this. You can also play as a dinosaur, but once again you need to find a rather full server which can be difficult (at least in EU)  And bring a friend to play this because this game is I gotta admit very quickly boring in Solo, but if you can just convince a single friend to play this you will be entertained a couple of hours. I've spent about 26 hours in this game and I don't think I will relaunch it any time soon because I did everything that was possibly fun with friends (survival, conquest, workshop maps, trying all classes and weapons, playing as a dinosaur)  Finally let's talk microtransaction. Well they are not interesting, you can buy a couple of skins for your weapons, characters, dinosaurs and that's it. You can also buy hats which are quite ugly ^^' So I see no interest in paying for this. But at least the microtransaction do not make the game unabalanced.  So Orion dino beatdown is a 1$ game offering something like 20 hours of fun game before it becomes repetitve. But that's a good deal I think. 7/10
1454	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!
1260	1	a	good game fun to play from time to time
3310	1	a	ORION:DH is like discount Halo with dinosaurs. I spent hours slashing dinosaurs and it was a good experience. The game is very cheap and also come with 5 trading card (each around 0.1~0.12 $ on market) thus profit. If you by chance saw this game on discount 75% or more, make sure to buy it. You won't regret it !
6528	1	a	Very fun and quick paced game! Easy to get into and improve in. I've been playing as the support class and been enjoying the war against the dino hordes a great deal. AI is decent and will try to hit you were it hurts which isn't always you :) And will try to swing around and flank you. Plenty of game modes to change the pace of the action and playable Dino's! If you like space marines blowing away prehistoric animals with all your dream weapons, Then Orion: Dino horde is for you!
2174	1	a	this game is awesome!!  #ihatethisgame
1285	0	a	pleased as punch with this gr8 game, i wish i got to play it since the cursor can't reach the right side of the screen.
3493	1	a	I've played it in demo period and i really enjoyed it playing with my friend,its cheap too so why not try to play this game? 
524	1	a	A great sandbox game with a ton of amazing powers. It's really great to just log in and kill people.
2083	1	a	probably the worst game that I have ever played  i give it an 11/10
2209	1	a	Picked the game up for $0.99 - can't go wrong there. I usually play the survival mode. It's like a wave mode with the occasional objective. Its a fun casual game.  My one gripe - the lobby hosts sometimes dont pay attention and dont start the game up. Just try a few lobbies or start your own, people will come.
1307	1	a	Worth Playing damn Enjoyable Game .
6447	0	a	ORION Dino Horde is a horrible time to be had and you will remember how terrible it is
5385	1	a	Not as bad as metascore says. Seriously, it's pretty fun when playing with friends.
2959	1	a	Much better than when it was called 'Dino Beatdown' (that when the metacritic score got so low too), the developers have addressed most of the issues and added content.  However, its still not brilliant. You may find it worth it if you can find it on sale (like it is at the time of writing).  
2042	1	a	ya buy if u want good and low priced game
1644	0	a	With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam. Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly.   the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.  I tell you with my honest point of view  - no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help) - bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic. - time consuming steam achievements. - lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky) - inactive community in forum  - repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore. - unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters. - too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game) - servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play. - very bad radar display - glitched map. - bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.  the good things are:  + a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc + has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino. + vehicles. a lot of vehicles + 3 classes to be played. + it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.  conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.
1236	0	a	Have you ever gone online and plaid those crappy flash games?   That is exactly what this feels like. It's great for bit if you are playing for free and just wasting time, but there is nothing substantial enough that I found in this game to actually warrent paying money.
1967	1	a	this is an amazing game to play with friends its funny for a laugh and not to be taken to seriously. I am completely hooked
4783	1	a	It's like a Counter Strike,with dinosaurs,and pressing Y will generate a FATAL HIT :) I love this game.
1586	1	a	Great game for sure. It is worth your money, so you should definitly decide to buy this game. After the update, it is very replayable and there is so many game modes to explore! Do not wait! Concept 8\10 Graphic 8\10 Gameplay 8\10 Replayability 9\10 
4339	1	a	I have really enjoyed all of the time I have put into the game so far. There are tons of different game modes and ways to play the game which gives it even more playthrough value. Although there are a few issues with laggy servers and lost connections, overrall it hasnt greatly affected my expirience. For $1 the game is totally worth it. Grab some buds and go take down some Dinos!
1778	1	a	I can't stop playing it.
5321	1	a	Hilarious game! This is a riot to play with your buddies. I would say don't buy it for single player, but if you have at least three friends that would play with you, just have someone man up and get a four pack (when it is on sale). The co-op against the dinoasurs is too fun to pass up. 8/10
4515	0	a	No. Just no. 0/10  Cons: - Bad graphics - Boring gameplay - Ridiculous voice lines  Pros: - I removed this game from my library
1900	0	a	It trys so hard to be a good game but fails so bad
1833	1	a	I've wanted to fly around in a jetpack and shoot a tyrannosaurus in the face since I was five years old.
1614	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed this.    11/10 Have never played would review again.
3729	0	a	im glad i spent .99 cents on this game thats all i can say
5239	0	a	Buggy, decent graphics, and repetitive gameplay lacking variety and weapons. The maps are dull and playing as a dinosaur isn't nearly as fun as it seems it would and probably should be. Also the controls for controlling a dinosaur are unclear, unstated, and a lot of the times do not even work. Not worth playing - it is a waste of time and not nearly as good as it should and could be.
3012	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!
3564	0	a	Look how many hours I have spent on this game. Look. Just look. Probably 110 of those were on Orion: Dino Horde.  Since the upgrade to Orion: Prelude the game is just an utter mess. Sure, it looks 'better' but al the 'fun' has been sapped from it. I've tried to play this game several times since the 'upgrade' and don't think I've finished a single game on it.  They added *more* stupid flying dinosaurs and made them harder to shoot. They made the 'Compy' dinos harder to kill. They made it so that when a big dino 'stomps' the ground you go flying further in a car than if you're on foot. They made it so you can be flying with your jet pack and still be affected by a stomp on the ground. Honestly.  Add to that the fact that when they said they had ironed out loads of bugs and made it better when in reality what they really meant was they made the best gun on the game less powerful than a hand gun that you start with and introduced bugs that weren't even in the previous version then you start to get a great view of the actual 'upgrade'.  Is this game worth 79 British Earth Pence? Sure. I would have paid more than that for Dino Horde. Probably more like a few quid. But it's now just sat there, dejectedly, in my Steam library. So sad.
3557	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I don't even know HOW to describe it. Its like dinosaurs, future tech, and master chief all jumped into a blender and was then consumed by the game developer. Time passed, and so did the product through the developer's intestines, leaving us with this 'game'.
3203	1	a	Perfect Game Ever!!!
4418	1	a	Good game overall, but i wouldnt had bought it if it wasnt in sale.
5715	1	a	Very nice game. In my opinion this is worth way more than a dollar. Love it. Never heard of it before and then I saw the trailer that explained how this game came out in 2012 and how it sucked and they kept working on it for 3 years. I have no idea how it was before. But right now, if you have a dollar I think you should buy this game, even if you're not going to play it the guys who worked on it deserve something.
4037	1	a	Does everyone own this game or something?
736	0	a	Appallingly awful - spent ages setting things up, then ended abruptly in a ridiculous way that bore no relation to anything that had happened up to that point. Voice acting ranged from average (main character) to laughably bad (hotel manager).
3260	1	a	Look at nice dinosaur models. Then barbecue them!
1325	0	a	Game I could only recommend for people starting their adventure with platform games and if they are under 10. Quite borring and not surprising in any way.
4590	0	a	While the gameplay itself could be very entertaining, something is terribly off with this game. While I am aware my laptop isnt a powerhouse, that is no reason for the game to have such low fps. We have come to the conclusion of terrible optimization. Sadly, 2/10 for me, but I really wish it would work.
6153	1	a	bought the game for 69p since the release. now it costs 79p. played it, lags like mad because my pc cant handle a smashing game with bad graphics. uninstalled it since it lags. lag is lag. money is lag. it was worth it..
3052	1	a	So bad that it's good. 10/10, would spend 99 cents on this again.

1223	0	a	I typically don't like hard video games, so this review might be biased. And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees). If you get it on an offer on the bundle (was on sale for 23 Rupees with three other games), then you can make your money back just with trading cards (and that's how this game got so many positive reviews). With the above in mind, here's my review:  The game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a  lot . The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is  not  a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better).   The graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game 'Thomas was Alone' looks better (or at least I think so). The 'Bonk' engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key? All-in-all, the game could use a lot of work and in it's current stage, don't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play.  Want to make money? Buy it on a sale and sell your cards. Want to play? Look into something else.
5959	1	a	jet packs, t-rexes, guns, tanks, coop all for less than $1
917	1	a	Shank is back with more brutal style combat animations. Action platform is rised to more deadly and overall are harder than the origin. The story is about conflict between rebels and militia. It's shorten and less interest than origin. For the combat, there're variaty of melee weapons, but some are cut and limited in your inventory. Enemy now can do damage even you're fell on the ground, so be careful! I'm really disappoint that developers cut co-op campaign mode off. But replace with survival mode as tradition. Well, it pretty fun with various characters. But they should maintain the old ones, not just cut them off including team combo. By the way, it's good game and great Maxican art style. I hope Shank 3 would be focused on both story and gamemodes.
732	1	a	It's like Puzzlequest with poker! Or if you haven't played that, it's like versus poker!
5975	1	a	Very fun and casual game!  All the vehicles are just great and gameplay fun. i will give this game 78/100
1559	1	a	It does worth playing, is fun. I'm addicted.
5156	1	a	It's not the deepest game in the world but it's hard to complain at that price.
5384	1	a	Never before has humanity faced such a great evil as the invasion of dinosaurs, This series of revalations have shown me the true light of how we must face down the threat of a dinosaur invasion, i have ridden on a dinosaur, that much is true, i am the son of god, that much i hope, but mum could just be covering up for an affiar she had. Back to the point at hand, i reccomed this game, it has shown me how to save humanity from a threat that is like no other, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the nazis they are nothing on this â¥â¥â¥â¥. We need to deal with this threat and deal with it now! BUY THIS GAME AND JOIN THE FIGHT TO SAVE SLOTHS FROM AN INVASION OF SMALL ARM FART MACHINES!
3188	1	a	Super Fun if you have friends to play with. You just shoot waves of dinosuars!
6271	1	a	Great game, absolutely love it for the price, got more for 1$ than in other games for 20. A must have for round based fps defense/survival lovers and the leveling system is a great motivation.
3458	1	a	HOW DO I GIFT THIS GAME TO MY FRIENDS WHEN THEY GOT IT ON FREE WEEK AND THEN THEY UNINSTALLED IT BUT IT STILL SAYS THEY OWN IT
1160	1	a	I love indie games that have a story with them just like this one! And for those of you guys who do like these types of games be sure to check out 'Thomas Was Alone', another awesome indie game I played a while back.
936	1	a	Had so much fun playing the first that I picked up the second one. So much fun too! Hoping there's a third, forth and fifth!
4082	1	a	this cost me 99cents i bought ark for thirty bucks this one for a buck minus a cent is more fun i love people because Jesus loves me
4758	1	a	A worth it dino horde game of all time
4583	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
916	1	a	Not a prison â¥â¥â¥â¥ simulator, I was disappointed.
1187	1	a	BEEP is a pretty decent, challeging platformer featuring slightly unnerving robots.
1712	1	a	This is Hands down the best Dino indie game out there, first of all its only 99cents, and second of all it is just a brilliant and a magnificent piece of game, The graphics are gorgeous, and the gameplay is impresseive. If you thinking of buying this game i definatley recommend it.
3640	1	a	havent played much, but so far, it wasnt the best but it was decent, great game seeing as i got it for 99 cents but i wouldnt pay 15 dollars for it
1156	1	a	It's like Mario with guns. 9/10
3617	1	a	Way too laggy here in Central America....
2838	1	a	fun for 2h, then, it Sucks a$$
1537	0	a	ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs. The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores. Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.  The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason. Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting. Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.  Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game. Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me 'homey' one more time...)  Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde. If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars.   The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.  Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult. Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.  So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.  In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point. Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.
1599	1	a	I love Orion Dino Horde. Don't listen to lowell he doesn't know â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5507	0	a	Absolute rubbish do not buy it
3552	1	a	Was a good Game to troll your friends with by just gifting it to them.... Aaah the good ol' times...  11/10 would spend 15â¬ again!
5533	1	a	this game is the best. all i could ask for is bots in PVP maps
5951	1	a	This game still has some broken elements, but it is still entirely playable. It just takes some getting used to. Once you do get used to it, it's incredible fun.  it's $1. Go buy it. Why? Because guess what else costs $1?  A McDonaldss happy meal. And IMO McDonalds is disgusting.
5404	1	a	Fun game. A little confusing at first but you will get the hang of it
4544	1	a	Its nice all u need to know :)
4275	1	a	For those of yougoing by the Metacritic score, I ask you not to. While I have only played this game for eight minutes, I can recomend it IF and only if you have three buddies that also own it, I have only played solo and it is near impossible, but it can be done, definitly pick it up on a steam sale, I got my copy for a dollar. I haven't encountered glitches or bugs as of yet, but I can tell a lot of work has been done since release.
245	1	a	Great    This was one of the best games I've ever played. I reccomend this to anyone that likes open world games. A lot of gore but that is the powers. Very good. I liked the powers. They were very creative. Prototype 2 is out and you should definitley play it.
2991	1	a	YES â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was only $0.99. Co-op, Dinosaurs, Guns, Sci-Fi. Combat is decent. Remember $0.99!
3827	1	a	All of the reviews are steam ones.  10/whydoesthisnumberevenmatter.
4183	1	a	I'm Not seen the System Requirements of this 1 dollar game Goddammit,.. I never thought this game Will be like Call of duty System Requirements
1018	0	a	Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all. Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.   Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people. You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive. They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is. You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account.   *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.
1426	1	a	its a cheap little game its very fun doe
5051	1	a	Epic fun. Amazing game for the price. Tons of fun.
2930	1	a	AHHHHH!  DINOSAURS!  Games goes F2P -&gt; salty players that paid for it rant -&gt; games goes P2P It's not like that stop TF2 from being F2P, although granted at least you got a hat! 
2473	1	a	The game is fun with friends but if you play it alone it is pretty boring.
1554	0	a	Even for 99 cents, this game is a waste of your money. It's funny at first but the glitches and bad gameplay take their toll on that fun. After playing this for a while I just couldn't take it anymore. Still, it was 99 cents, not the worst waste of money.  EDIT: I will have a new look at this game soon, people have told me that these bugs have been fixed and the game is a lot better now. Until then you can pretty much disregard this review.  EDIT NUMBER TWO: I played the game some more, and honestly not much has changed. My review remains the same.
3845	1	a	Full Review: Orion  dino horde  Prelude might have rough animations, (Not only the derpy animations of players and Dinosaurs, Try doing a melee attack with the CV-10 Pistol. I dare you.) and I have no idea what the heck the story is (I ASSUME it's about humans going back in time to the period of dinosaurs because earth in the future is all ruined and stuff. It might be another planet with dinosaurs on it. No clue)  Game Play: 8/10 As for gameplay, well, Orion is quite fun, and plays quite like one of my favorite games: Killing Floor. The addition of Jetpacks and Cloaking is great, and while it's twitchy like the ORIGINAL Killing Floor (2.5 for UT2004), it's still a blast to play with friends when you get bored of (Insert party game here. Probably CS:GO)  It also has deathmatch, which i don't really play, and PvPvE mode (Deathmatch WITH Dinosaurs!)   Graphics: 9/10 Orion: Prelude has some pretty graphics. While my laptop can't fully handle them, the game looks great on my buddy Damieok's Battle station.  Hats: Hat/Hats This game has hats. Hats are fun. Not a lot of Hats like TF2, but a nice little selection.  Music: 9/10 The Music is pretty damn epic. Nuff Said.  Price: 10/10 BUT â¥â¥â¥â¥, IT WAS 99 CENTS.  SERIOUSLY. IT IS A DOLLAR. LIKE, LESS THAN A CHICKEN SANDWICH. AS MUCH AS 4 TWINKIES. THIS GAME IS WORTH 4 TWINKIES IN MY BOOK.   TL:DR Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoHFWd1qi0c 
4219	0	a	I regret spending 74 cents on this game that is developed by amateurs. Don't be fooled by their game trailers. Why do you think this game costs 74 cents?
1613	1	a	THIS IS THE SEQUEL TO BAD RATS, ITS CALLED: BAD DINOZ. ITS A REALLY COOL GAME THAT KICKS A LOT OF BUTT AND IS CRAZY WACKY GOOFY FUN FOR ALL THOSE NUTTY DINO ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS ALL OF PANGEA AND BEYOND!
4752	1	a	good game but not the best single-player experience 
6450	1	a	Played it dispite the bad reviews I never played Dino beatdown before but this version is far better and lots of fun well worth 1 doller or even the normal price of 15 dollers but why not get it while its on sale.
1811	1	a	Actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
3420	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
2396	1	a	It's like Halo with dinosauars.  A pretty fun game particularly in co-op modes. The game still needs balancing in order to be fully enjoyable in the long run. Overall, it is worth the price of a buck.  EDIT: Now the game is going to be free to play? Everyone, this game is worth your attention. Even when it was a dollar, it is still worth having some fun!
4064	0	a	6/10 I'll play it only when friends are playing and I'm glad I only paid 99 cents. Really weird collision detection, hitboxes, dinos can do a zero G turn like a snapper lawn mower, game crashed on my first launch, and I've encountered several bugs during my first few hours. One bug being people were freely able to join into my 'Friends Only' game. Still fun to play with friends.
1750	1	a	Only paying a $1.49 it was money well spent. I have never had so much fun shooting dinos and playing as dinos. I would get this game if you dont have it already.
5465	1	a	Awsome game!
5265	1	a	looks great i would recommend this to those who like halo and dinosaurs
89	1	a	Make Prototype 3 and bring Alex Mercer back as protagonist
2696	1	a	The short version of why this game is awesome: YOU KILL DINOS. MANY DINOS. IN THE FUTURE. WITH AWESOME GUNS.  I had a lot of fun playing this game with my friends. I got the 4-pack when it was on sale for cheap. Mindlessly shooting dino's in coop is just straight up fun.  The gameplay reminds me a bit of halo, but if the spartans where fighting dinos. It's a bit more than that, but I think the compairison is fair, as many elements of the game give me that feel including wepons and vehicles.  My only problem with this game is it got kind of stale fast. Killing dinos mindlessly in waves with a few random objectives does get old eventually. I hope they put in some more varying modes, otherwise I'll get bored with it and have to take a week off to make it interesting again.  The game also has pvp, but I'll be honest I didn't try it very much. It seemed ok.  For a game though that I got super cheap, it was worth every penny. The developer also seems to be adding improvments constantly, so I think I'll stick with it.
1641	1	a	This game is unoriginal in the sense of the weapons, vehicles, gameplay, and layout. But don't think i disliked the game, it is phenominal. The action and co op make the game perfect for multipalyer. At the heart of it, this game is plain fun to play.
6142	1	a	but shiiiit it was only 99c
125	1	a	Fairly Enjoyable, I'd say it gets old a bit before you are done with it though, and very difficult in parts.
5318	1	a	Its a fun game that kinda reminds me of the old game called 'Turok' . If your not into the worlds best graphics but you like how the game is set up/gameplay this game is for you .
3276	1	a	I think this game has a bad first impression. Especially if you're not into 'horde' games. The learning curb is pretty small if you've been introduced to games like this before. Just kill everything and upgrade as much as possible. It can be somewhat easy once you know what you're doing and can kite a bit. Making it into late game can be very satisfying because there's so many smaller dinos and several bigger ones running around all trying to get you and you can single-handedly take them all out if you're a good enough pilot. The clash of futuristic weapons and armor with ancient extinct reptiles is nice. The mode I've been playing is survival, basically Killing Floor with bigger maps, vehicles, and upgrades. There's many more modes to try out though. If anything I'd say it's a least worth trying out. It's also pretty cheap so that's nice too. Of course there are some bad things about this as well. The good outweighs the bad, but still. One of the biggest things I've noticed is that the skies usually aren't that great compared to the landscape. Could just be a texture bug, but I dunno. If anything they're just boring. Another big problem is getting stuck in rocky places of the map. Can be very problematic if you're trying to get an object last minute. This game is great and I do look forward to future updates to help with some of the issues it has.
474	1	a	This game has you as a person who can morph his arms into claws, hammers and â¥â¥â¥â¥. What else do you want?
5495	0	a	.99 cents and it still isn't worth the money.
2317	1	a	Though this game may not have cutting edge graphics, the best voiceovers and some dodgy controls here and there. It is a beautiful piece of work that has adapted greatly from it's release. This game is proof that if you work hard at a game, it will come out great. The Dev team could of left it how it was. A heaping mess. But they looked at their mistakes and improved on them. Making one of the greatest PvD game i've seen. You can play solo, solo with bots, or with friends and either one it is great fun. All for a super cheap price of $1/79p. It's worth way more then that. Best part is that there is not a single pay to win feature on this game. No '$10 for 10000cr' I highly recommend this game to anybody that loves shooters and/or dinosaurs.
6088	1	a	'Rain sound xfects 10/10, nxt gen af'
1511	1	a	Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.  For Â£0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing Â£30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.  You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.  Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.  However this game does have a few downsides....  1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade. 2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine. 3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls. 4. Soundtrack is really stock. 5. Small, but very friendly commuinty  Overall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!
250	1	a	best game play ever, story line and all
532	1	a	Assassin's Creed meets science fiction, this game dumps you in the role of a guy with no memory, infected with a virus that gives him incredible agility and many other abilities, hunted by a shadowy government organisation. Wide open sandbox world, plenty of challenges to take on, and an intriguing storyline to uncover make this quite a solid gameplay experience.
4970	1	a	My jurrastic D!ck. Part 1.  A dino â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my â¥â¥â¥ so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard there was blood and â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥ everywhere he poared ice cream on my chest he ate it and called me a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   The End.
1984	1	a	Its got decent graphics, fun time killer especially if you get it on sale.
2010	1	a	I got 4 hours game play out of it so far and im planning to play more so I would say it's definitely worth $1
1902	1	a	This game isn't anywhere near as awful as I expected given reviews. It's not really good either, but it's a great way to kill an hour or two with friends. Like Killing Floor but with dinosaurs and vehicles.
4720	1	a	I love this game, best like 50 cents ever spent.
5067	1	a	Gotta say, It's a fun game. Super cheap,   if you play with friends in a versus game (taking off all the abilities of the human team) it feels more jurrassic park-y to me. Sure jetpacks are fun, but the real challenge is doing it all without any special help.  9/10
96	1	a	Prototype is what I always dreamed of as a small child. My small, sociopathic mind always dreamed of running around, shapeshifting, and casually dismembering people with my badass claws or sword arm or whipfist. It's the offspring of gore, action, openworld gameplay, and glitchy stealth that was greatly improved in the second game. I enjoy it. I don't know if everyone would, but I like it better than a lot of other games.  10/10
5780	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a funny game, especially when you're playing with friends!  Pluses: +Cost less than 1 euro. +Good co-op. +Many achivments. +A lot of fun.  Minuses: -Boring after few hours. -Not best optimized. -Many buggs.
4598	0	a	are you serious? i payed for this game and now its free...
6048	1	a	oy mate this game is pretty yeet
5395	0	a	Got game for 99% off... Should've waited for a better sale, was not worth -1/10
438	1	a	best open world game for: action and stress relieving.
5168	1	a	This is a game which you can play in Noob or Easy mode to get awards, or just when you don't want to try too hard, or you can play in Medium or higher mode when you want a challenge. Great to play solo or in a group and plenty of PvP if you like that, too. Best .99 Euro Cent game I have ever bought, in fact better than a lot of other more expensive games. This game is not perfect though as there are a few bugs, but nothing that would make me stop playing: bots getting stuck against rocks (happens in the larger maps when they have to travel cross country). One of the few games which it's fun just to play for 15 minutes, before you go out etc, or play for a few hours. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and NO weapons can be bought using real money, only in game money which is reset every match and not too hard to get, at lower levels ;) . The only things that can be bought with real money are cosmetic, like hats etc.  The graphics aren't cutting edge but they are good enough and the weather effects I really like. Try spotting a flying pterodactyl(?) at night when it's raining and the rain is running down your visor (I love to hate pterodactyl as they mob you when your hiding in the rocks shooting dinos with one of the sniper rifles). The snowing effect is great, too! And if you don't buy the heated visor opion, lookout when your visor freezes over (on the snowy maps), shoot the blurrs, LOL.  When I'm tired, after playing a demanding fast paced game, I usually end up playing this at Noob or Easy level just for some relaxing fun and to gain a achivement or two. If I want a challenge I play in Medium or Hard, although there are two harder level: Insane and Redikulous!  If one of the main boss dinos is killed the game goes into slow-mo for a few seconds and if you shoot a Raptor in the head, at this time, it looks great when it explodes in slow-mo, too. :) One last thing: watch out, the Raptors will swarm you!  It's on sale 0.59
5214	1	a	Definitely worth the dollar
5702	1	a	its $0.99 just buy it already
3974	1	a	Metacritic is wrong. Now with all the updates this game is a very cool horde game. It's very fun to play with friends.
5266	1	a	its a fun game and i reccomend it makes me feel like a bad â¥â¥â¥ 
5041	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYKupOsaJmk 
1465	1	a	Very fun game. Good physics
3545	0	a	I've only put a half hour into this game but..  What the hell is this game?  No, seriously, look at actual reviews on it. It feels like a game made in Unity engine using 3D assets you'd buy in a pack to use (but the reality is they just fired the workers that created them after they handed them over). The idea that this game could ever get a 10/10 (as shown under reviews) is ridiculous. This entire $1 sale is just a con to squeeze the last bit of money they can out of this turd of a game.  Do your research before buying it, you'll see a trail of unpaid workers, crowdfunding scams and general distrust over this developer with only a little bit of googling. No reputable person or gaming website would ever give this game a rating over 10.  Bugs, bugs everywhere, assets that clearly weren't made for this game.. the list goes on.  Stay far, far away from this.
1374	1	a	A cute little platformer made by a super small team of people. Actually a lot of fun especially for the price point. A few glitches here and there, but overall it's a decent game. Fair warning though it's a bit older of a game.
618	1	a	sick game
5580	1	a	ORION: Prelude might possibly be................ the best game in our solar system. It's advanced understanding of the way human and dinosaur love would really be in the year 1916 is amazing. I had â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ic reactions upon opening ORION: Prelude. Dinosaur is another word for gaming experience with a new, captivating, yet sentimental brutality. ORION: Prelude is the type of friend that you could just make love to 3 times before getting bored. i r8 9/8 gr8 game
510	1	a	Want to become a super-villain terrorizing a city full of civilians, military personnel and infected? Want to hijack choppers mid-air and blow up some hives and military bases? Want to park near Central Park with a tank/apc and kill everything in sight? Want to pose as a military officer and just shoot infected while civilians run like scared little children?  If you answered yes to any one of the above questions, you should get this. If you didn't, you are not fun at all and you should read Fun Manual 101!
5575	1	a	I am not going to go into depth on this game, but I will say this. The Developer has really done this game justice, constantly updating it, making it playable, and making it enjoyable. For $0.99, this is a steal. If you can find friends to play this game with, it's amazing.  VERDICT: Halo + Killing Floor + Dinosaurs = ORION: Prelude
1202	0	a	At first, I thought this was a great game. I soon found out that on one of the levels, it is literly too easy to get stuck. I got it during this steam summer sale, so I thought why not? But then, I ran into the level. A few weeks past, and here I am, writing this review. If its on sale for cheap, pick it up, I had a blast on the few levels I did.
3332	1	a	This game is a really fun multiplayer 'shoot-some-dinos' fps for one dollar.  +Graphics +Variety of equipment/guns/upgrades +Leveling plus permanent bonuses for leveling +Get to shoot dinos for fun +1$ -Could add more types of dinos and maybe a HUGE horde mode :D  Seriously, no cons really. Especially at 1$ no point in not buying it. Seriously a really fun game. Happy hunting.
937	1	a	Try out this bad boy while waiting for an update on your favorite game.  It has it all and only for 9.99.
2987	1	a	fun and challegning at the same time
2515	1	a	This game is good. It is basicly like COD zombies with dinosaurs and Halo guns.
4485	1	a	Its so baws.
2631	1	a	Fun game! Only $1 right now (June 6). It's sorta like cs or like cod but more realistic and with dinos! a little buggy at times and sometimes the servers arent too good. :)
5047	1	a	NIce game  Really cool with friends
4111	1	a	BUY THIS GAME! Its always cheap enough that you always get your moneys worth and more! i had 13 hours of fun in 2 days and kind of got bored. BUT! Its a great game!
4517	0	a	Has to be the worst game i have ever played. I am shocked and appalled that this has a rating of 'very positive'  I could plug my controller into a log of my â¥â¥â¥â¥ and be more entertained.  
507	1	a	i will recomende this game to any one its fun and a very griping storyline
4865	0	a	Good game, but the problem can hurt each time you starting ERROR.  Personally: I really like, I am very pleased with it.
3320	1	a	The Metacritic score is indeed misleading. It may not be as polished as some AAA titles but its not as bad as its metacritic score makes you believe. Its a fun unique game with tons of content, lots of game modes, a 50 level leveling system, 3 classes and tons of weapons and upgrades that its meant to be played with other people. The devs keep releasing updates adding and fixing stuff and there are many people playing atm.  I'd say that its worth a try, you'll enjoy it.
3024	1	a	its a awesome dino game i enjoy it but it lagged and deleted in the 3rd week 
1367	1	a	This game was on sale for so much that I actually made a profit selling the trading cards it drops.  10/10 even better than Free2Play!
5564	1	a	fun shooter game reminds me of halo shooting stiles 
5602	1	a	This is awesome, have fun with friends.
292	1	a	ok so this is a great game but the blackwatch are everywhere! The longest time I spent not being notorious was 3 minutes, this was due to the sheere amount of blackwatch troops everywhere!! Other than that i'm having alot of fun playing this game!
6428	1	a	GET IT WHILES ITS ONLY A DOLLA, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ILL EVEN BUY IT FOR YOU! THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS SO FUN, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥S BE LISTENING TO REVIEWS IN 2012, TIMES A CHANGING! GAMEPLAY IS â¥â¥â¥â¥IN AWESOME GOD DAYUM HOW IS THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ A DOLLA FOR N OW? BECUZ â¥â¥â¥â¥ MARKETING AND WHEN IT RELEASED IT WAS SHIOOTTTTT, IT AINT SO BAD NOW, 8/10!!!
5802	1	a	Like Halo + Call Of Duty Zombies + Dinosaurs. Would recommend. For the price, you cant go wrong really.
4964	1	a	im just a mailman passing through.
3853	0	a	Bought it for 0.66 cents for no reason now it's free to play.
2289	1	a	Not bad for the price. Really get a solid group of friends to play, so much fun.
2450	1	a	'1/10 there was no FOV slider' -TB
4136	0	a	Cancer.
4840	1	a	The best developers, the best community, the best dino-killing game. You just to hear that and watch a fast gameplay, so you can buy it.
1912	1	a	The metascore is misleading, it's from the old build This game is awesome and frenetic Recommended
5476	0	a	its a bad game. i bought on sale 2 bucks and it still wasent worth it and even though its only a $1 now its still hard to justify. the gameplay is repititve and not very satisfying. i played maybe two hours before i got super bored and never touched again. graphics suck as well. the action is decent but it still gets old fast. 3/10
118	0	a	Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without 'unexpected results,' and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.
2801	1	a	Far from perfect, but still incredibly fun. AI needs a little bit of fine-tuning and the whole game could use a coat of polish, but that doesn't detract from it being good fun.
3300	0	a	The factor is that this game is simply terrible. When I first picked up this game, it seemed like it was going to be something fun to play with friends. Boy was I wrong, first off lets take a look at graphics. Listen, I know that graphics are not everything but this game looks like it was thrown together in a day. The animations are so very basic and so crappy that it truly does take away from any positive gameplay expierence. But perhaps your the person that could care less about any type of graphical fidelity and instead are content with a good gameplay expierence. Too bad it doesn't provide good gameplay either. The game is full of glitches, such as during a wave of dinosuars, the dinosaurs remaining count doesn't change at all, leaving you with a never ending wave. Or perhaps the factor that only certain dinosaurs bring down the counter, despite the factor that there is not a singal indicator as to which dinosaurs to kill. Then lets look at the factor that this game has so many elements from other titles. Now, there is nothing wrong with utilizing previously exsisting features in games to improve your own (Borderlands 2 driving mechanic, fight to revive etc.), that's what helps push the industry forward. Sadley this game does not have an original bone in it's body, and the features it does take from others, it does incredibly poorly. Overall this is a pass, I would NOT recommend buying this game.
5974	1	a	I've played this and the reviews don't lie! This is a super fun game! Anybody that dosen't like this game should burn because they ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GAME CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WORST GAMES OF ALL TIME INTO ONE THE GREATEST DINOSUAR GAMES OF ALL TIME!
2006	1	a	10/10 BEST GRAPHics best grameplay best dinosaur shoot 9/10 GraphicS AND GAMEPLAY PRETTY good 9/9 game game gAME GAME GAME GAme 10/10 worst game ive ever played remove it from earth before i shoot myself in my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ eye
4153	1	a	Best nonsensical game of all time?
6535	1	a	Shooting Dinos instead of zombies! very fun!
5018	0	a	I wasn't paid enough to play this.  From anim files that lose sync of each other to poor optimization, this game takes the idea of a dino shooter and turns it into hot garbage.
3292	1	a	awsome/cod/halo/tf2/juassic park/
4805	0	a	It sucks i got this game along time ago and guess what the first minute of gameplay it sucked IT SUCKS it sucks at sucking thats how bad it is IT SUCKS 
5192	0	a	you get what you pay for. The game is about as confusing to play as if I were making the game myself. That being said, it does have potential. BUT, if the developers do not clean the game up it's going to just be Call of Duty with dinosaurs. with just as many 'spinoffs' if the rumors are correct.
1938	0	a	Not even worth a dollar. Leave it to die.
4215	1	a	I only have to say one thIng, AWESOME
3248	1	a	Welp....if it is 99% off go for it.Worth 10 hours but not any more.Ill just recommend the game but Im actually neutral on this one...
5718	1	a	I'm killing about 100 pera however you spell it with a starting round gun. This game is tops.
4523	0	a	I have to say that this game isn't good :( i thought it is awesome but it is only lagging ...and all is *****  3/10
2680	1	a	You can have a party hat with small dinosaurs on it. 10/10
4901	0	a	Absolutely horrible, don't buy this game at any cost... there is a reason it's price has been cut so much, they couldn't pay me to play this garbage. I could forgive a lot of things in it, the bugs, horrible graphics, and boring gameplay if it was a early access to a degree, but this is a FULL RELEASE. Avoid at all costs.
5901	1	a	For 1 dollar it's an awesome and fun game!
1895	1	a	It's a good game. You have the Asault clas there you ee jatpack on. The suport clas, reco class each class has more weapons and contain some wapeons can you buy for each class.Thit is a nice game, Its so cheap for it.  i give it an 8/10.
1218	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
2802	1	a	got eaten by a giant crocodile and a T-Rex in less than 5 minutes 12/10
5767	1	a	Most epic 99 cent game! :D  Dinosaurs are awesome!
5739	0	a	the game lags like hell and i cant even play it the game iss to laggie and no one cant play it cuzz one small dino kills you
1618	1	a	Awesome game , really it is well done guys
2679	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
122	1	a	I freaking love this game.  There's no such thing as too much caos and destruction :3  Also, big giant worm.
1344	1	a	Nice and simple look, great physics engine, what's not to like.
5020	0	a	i get kicked from every game just for being a low level? well â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
3408	1	a	Theres Dinosaurs :D that is all
4578	1	a	Better than Aliensâ¢: Colonial Marines.
5686	1	a	look its simple guys: 1) Mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinos 2) Guns and weapons 3) Cool arenas 4) Mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinos  What more do you want?
6127	1	a	Absolutly love this game! I've had the best fun with this. definately recommend getting this game
5889	0	a	Oh my god. Worst game experience ever.  1. The hardware requirements are ridiculously high. I can play many games on high settings. Here I have input lag in the menu and low FPS even on 720p .... 2. 'Connection to Host lost'. Joining a game (with decent internet connection) is like russian roulette. 3. Map design is confusing. Makes me miss battlefield or basically any other shooter. 4. Shotgun: 25-100 Damage. Fists: 4700 Damage. Why the hell should I buy weapons?
6383	1	a	Cool arcade like game that you can jump into and have a decent experience, without too much of an investment.
2703	1	a	...
4714	1	a	one the the best good graphics games ever 
4790	0	a	Gay, Its Bad 
1080	1	a	BEEP... The BEST...ROBOT...EVER!
582	1	a	It's fun and surprisingly balanced when you take into consideration the fact that you're basically a demigod. There is one cheap boss, though it's only one.
68	1	a	Have you ever had that game(s) that you just really wanted to like but couldn't it? Well this was one of those for me. Before I forget... played on a Win 7 32-bit OS, all 6 games played, sound, (insert usual computer specs that make me sound like I have best gaming rig ever or it's only a step up from grandma's dinosaur computer you stole from the nether regions of her basement)... blah blah.. it plays just fine for me.   Collectively, these games' initial learning curve is significant if you haven't played the style-genre from this era. The manual is useless. Seriously, google the games on  gamefaq.com  or watch some gameplay videos at  youtube.com . If you do youtube approach, stop after you get a sense of how to interact with everything. The core mechanice / fun of these games is discovery.   The humor is also a bit odd. The more you are into 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', 'Dr. Who' style of humor mixed with Star Trek / Star Wars; the likely you are to love these games. The premise of the games is awesome. The hero / protagonist of the game is a janitor. As opposed to, you are some orphaned child who grows up to be the guy that saves the world after finding out his parents are some god / king. Better yet, someone who has this tragic backstory to overcomeâ¦ aka Mommy and Daddy died due to some terrible, natural disaster (planet blowing up); killed by some evil (shot by random person A outside of a movie theatre) or (insert your favorite character defining moment here).  While I love the new BBC Sherlock and the humor in it, I couldn't get into this game.  So in short... plays fine on Win 7 32-bit OS with GeForce GTX 960. If you like British style humor and are willing to invest to get past the initial learning curve... this probably a great game for you.   If not... buy the game, try and request a refund in less 2 hr gameplay if not for you. This way if you ever are confronted by some retro-enthusiast and they ask you... did you ever play 'Space Quest'... you can say 'yes' and they will leave you alone. If you don't answer 'yes', be prepared to endure while they express all the virtures of this game and why should play it otherwise you will die a terrible, horrible death because you never had this one game experience. Nevermind the myriad of required, retro game experiences that you absolutely must have besides this one in order to not experience before mentioned death.
57	1	a	A good oldie game series that I wish they would continue on. Much nostolgia had!
1333	1	a	Great game i love how when you order pizza and they deliver you frosted flakes ceral, its just well made game, you guys took your time in fixing my car and making me cookies, you're such a doll, this beats mw2 and csgo put together and a dash of mtn dew. thanks and have a wonderful doritos
536	1	a	Prototype is like inFAMOUS but without the terrible attempt at a moral choice system. Decent storytelling with fun sandboxy superpower gameplay. I concur with Penny Arcade's review. You can karate kick a helicopter. What more do you want?
4932	1	a	pteroerdactelyeyl scooped me up whil i was dancing 4 da ladiez  
3091	1	a	Great game! :)
4192	1	a	I think that ORION: Dino Horde is a pretty decent game with a lot of awesome features. There are a plethora (huge variety) of weapons that can only be found here. The graphics are awesome, though it slows down my computer a bit, but that all changes in the options which make the ORION experience worth every cent.
2230	1	a	I only paid 99 cents for this and the graphics are pretty good..I kinda suck at killing dino's but I am having fun with this game :]
4678	0	a	Sucks. Game it self is fun but it is very hard to find a match that is not full, does not lag, or boots you. Fix that issue and game will be great.
3460	1	a	I would recommend this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 (and I even have some ideas that could make it a lot more fun)
5336	1	a	A grand old stupid time.
5578	1	a	ORION: Prelude is fun in some aspects. But, in others its pretty bad. I like it though.
15	1	a	King's Quest VI ... Still as fun as it was 22 years ago. A must-have adventure game!!  10/10
4488	1	a	Great game, many great, fun, and scary times. first time i played. i cried, spinosauros are scary. played with friends. we all cried because T-Rex is much harder than spinosaurus. playing more than N00B difficulty makes it very boring tho. overall great game 8.7/10  My metascore would be 87/100
199	1	a	Excellent people murdering simulator, got me to where I am today
1611	0	a	This game give you some amount of â¥â¥â¥â¥ in ur â¥â¥â¥ cuz you eat large D while shootin dinos. BAd game Like 3/11teen
3100	0	a	complete pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥... sold some cs:go skins and bought this game for 0.99â¬... after 30mins, immediately requested refund... ABSOLUTE WASTE OF 3GB. much regret.  game is buggy and laggy, missing sounds, multiplayer doesn't always even work and bad texturing.
1356	0	a	this game is not a good game do not buy
1572	1	a	Today I've played it for a first time with my friends (thanks for the 4pack) and we had much fun with this game. :-) And for sure we're goin to play tomorrow again! 
3128	1	a	Some of the most fun I've ever had in a multiplayer game. You want this game.
3616	0	a	This game feels like an alpha. Fun for the first 2 games of survival. No explanations of game mechanics (so you end up wasting a lot of ingame credits). Needs far more work to be a functional, complete game.
4724	1	a	You kill dinosaurs, whats not to love.
2337	1	a	This is a great game. It has hours of fun, replayablity, huge maps, weapon upgrades, wonderfull graphics, and great multiplayer. What else can you ask for? This game could cost 10x what it does and still be worth it. Everyone should own it. Great for mini LAN's!!!
3359	1	a	Totally worth the price (especially when on sale). It is an entertaining game where you shoot dinosaurs with your Sci-Fi friends while equipped with cool guns and grenades and jetpacks. Seriously why would you not play this game.
4989	0	a	This game gave me polio
2535	1	a	this game is good but if you dont like something that can get repeatitive then dont get it I got it because it was a dollar so I got my moneys worth so if you want it get it on sale it is on often
1029	1	a	A really good puzzle game that has three different endings. Graphics and sound were ok. 8/10
426	1	a	Crap port, good game. Certainly one of the more entertaining mass-murder simulators I've played. How many games have you played where you can kill and old lady, eat her, take on her form, run up the tallest building in the city and perform a dive bomb that turns half a city block into jam?
6009	1	a	Well you see in mathematics this game can be defined as:  $.99 (Got it on a Steam sale for $.49)+Dinosaurs+360 No Scoping+Multiplayer=Usually Failing and sucky games  This one however, = Amazing  Buy it, it's a buck. Why the hell not!

2632	1	a	this is fun fast paced fps where you kill or be jkilled battle your friends or endless waves of dinosaur in this explosive game.
2693	1	a	This game is the $h!t. You get to wear a jetpack and shoot dinosaurs... What more do you want? Oh u want to be a dinosaur? Well you can do that too. Just drop the 99 cents and start playing this game
4491	0	a	wad the hell am i doing with my life
4987	0	a	My friend gave me this game as a gift.   We are no longer friends.  0/10, would delete troll gifters again
5160	1	a	Highlights include: Sniping a Trex in the face as I jetpacked to safety Mowing down dinosaurs with a jeep like vehicle Beating velociraptors in the face Battling several very large dinos  Cons: Graphics are a bit on the simplistic side, especially for UI and player model Controls not configured to ideal setup on get go Different modes other than survival not as enjoyable (opinion) Some content must be purchased in game (not required for game to be fun, but still)  Very well worth the price, especially with friends
3644	1	a	1000 HOURS INCOMING  PLASE PLAY THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS  I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2005	1	a	it a dollar and its functional
855	1	a	Shank 2 is the bomb, quite literally. Itâs an action packed title, filled to the brim with tons of gratification, a beautiful outline, tight controls and great replay value. Cynics can argue that it doesnât offer a ton more than the first game, but itâs still just as appealing as it ever was, now with more stuff.   Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] .
1717	1	a	its an awesome game 
1951	1	a	too many orions 8/10
1913	0	a	Not necessarily bad, just not really amazing. It seemed like after you've played one wave you've played them all.
4200	1	a	This game is pretty cool.
6518	1	a	Great game with terrific dinosaurs and guns. This game perfectly integrates our love for dinosaurs and call of duty mechanics. Couldn't be better 10/10
962	1	a	I havnt spent alot of time playing Shank 2 and havnt played Shank but its a fun game and reminds me when I used to play metal slug in the arcade. Fun game.
3143	1	a	Got bored of killing guys with guns in TF2. Got bored of killing robots in Robocraft. Got bored of killing zombies in No More Room In Hell. This game is a perfect change of pace if you like killing different things. Killing dinosaurs was very fun, I killed a lot of them. 10/10, should play again.
6502	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Dinosaurs, vehicles, jetpacks and plenty of guns.
3813	0	a	If you didn't think you could waste 50 cents, look no further.  
6312	0	a	Lag Central. My system is above the recommended requirements, and with every video setting at low or disabled, it still lags when the dinosaurs attack.
5496	1	a	Very fun game for only a dollar. Just get it
268	1	a	i recomend prototype cause it is FLIPING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! And at times challenging
4311	1	a	U shoot Dinos Nuff Said 10/10
3835	0	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. it's a waste of download space boring repetitive and servers are extremely laggy, if you shoot anything 1 ft in front of you it's gonna die 4 years later.
3253	1	a	Idk how this game got a bad score!!!! It's like badass but there has been allot of updates since then...
5947	1	a	Unstable and broken, almost impossible to play. First I had trouble finding a server that I could connect into, then I had trouble trying to play because of the lag, and finally I was always thrown back to lobby because server disconnection. After this happened couple of times, I quit playing. There are free games out there that are more better and intact than this.  From what I gathered, the game is about surviving a wave of dinosaurs and then upgrading your weapons. Each wave of dinosaurs gets a bit more difficult after each wave, but you have about a minute between the waves to buy better weapons or abilities. All the action happens in a one huge map, that consists somewhat of desert sand and canyons. Sometimes the game gives the players a side quest, which is just an assignment to go and kill even larger dinosaur somewhere in the distance. Yaahoo.   I bet there were more game modes and possibly more map types, but fuggetaboutit. There is no chance of me going through this laggy crap again.   EDIT: Okay, been playing this with my wife and it actually is quite enjoyable. Changing my recommendation to 'Yes'! Still broken though, but LAN co-op is somewhat satisfactory.
1035	0	a	The gameplay was fun but the boss fights were way to hard
4154	1	a	  This game is better then the 2end game  and it's fun with friends!!!
3375	1	a	It is a really awesome game :)
5890	1	a	best co-op i've ever played. is fun, edgy and spicy.
155	1	a	This is a game that'll make you want superpowers more than anything else in your life.
2032	1	a	Not the best graphics, but quick and fun to play - if you like shooting small, big and huge dinos! :-)
1355	0	a	  -
590	1	a	This game belong on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3852	0	a	This game is unbalanced as HELL don't buy!!!!!!!
0	1	a	THEY FINALLY FIXED IT... YEARS AFTER BUYING THIS.. NO MODERN OS SUPPPORT... THEY EVEN TOOK IT OFF THE STEAM STORE FOR A YEAR OR TWO (EVEN THOUGH I HAD ALREADY MADE MY PURCHASE) GOG galaxy or wahtever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ has had a proper version of this available for quite some time now. i logged in randomly to my steam account and saw that after years of zero support or patches i randomly got an 'update' for it that was suddenly downloading... i quickly rushed to see if they fixed the support so it would open in a dos box. boom. it was fixed, thanks steam... oh and i checked the store page to see if it went back up... sure enough.. it's back up. Can't wait to relive these classics. This seriously made my day.
3585	0	a	Did they make it horrible on purpose? After how many years and this is what you came up with? How does one make unreal engine look so horrible... if not on purpose.. There are a ton of built in smooth animations for free in the engine that apparently they didnt use. And those textures??? wth.. are we still in the days of quake? and physics are horrible.. you get stuck walking next to a wall.. If this was a school project.. id say Nice work! you're def going to make a great game after you graduate.. but .. its not , its a full release of a 'completed' game that from what I hear the devs take pride in.. I know I wouldnt.. at least make the textures and models look a little better that would be a good start. Oh and the sounds... ugh.. am I firing a cap gun? anywho..
4205	1	a	Solid upvote! I played the Free Trial about a year back and had loads of fun blasting dinosaurs and opponents in halo-styled fights. If you like halo or turok, welcome to the game-child. Worth the try!
2023	1	a	A philosphy of gaming for all you poor souls. $1 should means at least 1 hour of gameplay. I spent $0.99 and got some little bit of time over 13. #worth? Not really. But kinda.
4479	1	a	is good game, but is not quality game
5469	1	a	Ever wanted to play a game where the support class doesn't work? Ever wanted to be utterly destroyed by tons of dinos? Ever wanted to buy useless upgrades that won't affect gameplay at all? Ever wanted to win a ps4? Ever been ready for freddy?  No. This game deserves to be worth 99 cents. pls fix it tho
5624	1	a	This is so much better then the original game! so fun and time consuming I would love for anyone to play the game, although hard at first and laggy i still love it.
1038	1	a	Bloop! This game is adorable. Dunno why it didn't get more attention. The PC port isn't super great, but it works okay. Show it to your kids! They'll love it. Fun/5
1759	1	a	This game, oh my my...   Beyond the initial metacritic score for the earlier version of this game; it is worth giving a chance. I picked it up on sale; after seeing the game on sale for 99 cents; I was like: The hell with it, I am buying this. No I am not rich and no it is not disposable income; you can be unemployed and living on welfare checks and still understand the whole idea of impulse buying a 99 cent game.. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a cup of soda, which adds 1 extra dollar to your bill..   So the game itself is actually pretty fun. Don't play this game for 'intense lore'. it is simply such a derp game in terms of atmosphere (storyline and background); simply because it is minimalistic.   How about instead of writing a 7 paragraph review like I always do, I will give you this:  Imagine being in the US Marine Corps, and you are in a Supercobra attack slick; and you are swooping over the marshlands in georgia bored to â¥â¥â¥â¥ because you are bringing the chopper to a new base. Lets say you spot several crocodiles in the marshes; and you decide 'F**K it', and start shooting them to millions of pieces.  Now take this image and turn it into sci-fi, where space-dinosaurs are on some random planet; and you bloodthristy bored-as hell soldiers stationed on some remote planet want to have some action.. Well pick up em guns boys! We have freaking space raptors to murder!  In a nutshell, the game is simply amusing. It is funny, and I think the developers have strong wit they intentionally put into this game. It is fun, jetpacking around the maps with guns and slaughtering dinosaurs with friends has never been so fun of a pastime before!  Now.. Someone bring me a pizza!
920	1	a	The cutscenes are terrible, the story was â¥â¥â¥â¥, the 5th boss is a massive pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥, but somehow I still throuoghly enjoyed it all the way through. The level design was great, the combat quite fun and overall its a fantastic short game.
3178	1	a	You Can kill T-Rex using Rifle and you can fly using jet pack what else do you need? It's Already Awsome
1701	1	a	This is a game. You can play this game. I like playing games. Do you like playing games? I do like playing games! I wanna build a snowman now and stuff a dinosaur's kidney inside it! Yay!
3181	1	a	It has a smooth way of playing if your computer isnt to crappy. It can be either really easy or you can make it really hard on yourself if you put the difficulty higher! Also please note that leveling your class up is a must in this game. I don't think you will get far with a level 1 in your class on the highest difficulty. Mainly because if your a higher level you can start with a primary weapon instead of the pistol only! Still a fun game to play and a lot of fun to see your friends running from all the dinos while you laugh at them from afar!
3551	0	a	Don't even bother. Even if it remained F2P forever, it's terrible. SWTOR tier.
2307	1	a	Review:   When I first saw this game, I saw many bad reviews. I thought about buying it, but left it alone when I saw a review video of the game a while back. I got really bored today, and was like, 'Are there any discounted games that are good?', and thought of this game again. This time, I just looked at the reviews, all positives, and it looked much better. I yolo'd it and got this game. I messed around with the options, than hopped onto an 'Easy' game. I was having trouble, not very much fun. Than I went on to a Prehistoric server, kinda hard at first. Than I started getting better after 10 minutes. I started having a lot of fun. This is a GREAT game, considering is only 99c. 11/10, would T-Rex again.
1545	1	a	they should have made it free 2 play, the minute they put that money harvesting store in the game.  trek industries a.k.a. spiral studios a.k.a. Dave Prassell, isn't doing anybody any favors.  the game however, is still pretty good. i recommend it, begrudgingly. at least, now, you can't beat the price.  still, the company that made it is just as shady as any other video game company because they are ALL shady. it's an inherently shady industry, so you can't show me a game publisher who is not shady because there aren't any of those.
3870	1	a	Its fun. Get some friends to buy it (or get the 4-pack) and play. Some people have had some trouble with connecting, but I've never had this issue.
2267	1	a	The most fun you can have while killing dinosaurs. Very friendly community, challenging game modes, and addictive play. My favorite action co-op shooter by far.
4384	1	a	Halo with Dinos.
2037	1	a	Personally I thought it wasn't going to be the best game for a dollar, but I read some other reviews and DID NOT go by the meta game score because thats dumb as hell, I mean why not try it out eh? its only a dollar lol. But I really enjoy it, its fun, challenging, entertaining, a lot of customization. Fun game all around IMO. 8/10
2460	1	a	This game is the best! It mixes a epic co-op experience with hard core gameplay and strategy! Your either fighting dinosaurs with epic looking futuristic weapons or battling each other!   I give this game 10/10 stars!  Even when i first got the game and played i knew it was gonna be one of my most favorite games!  Here's any example of my daily happy fun times in this game....  Step 1-Walk around the map and enjoy the peace  Step 2-Turn on the generator  Step 3-Get your butt to the weapons depot and get a machine gun you idiot!  Step 4-Take your freaken gun and kill some Dinos!!!!  Step 5-Get to any round i feel like because i love this game!  Step 6-Kill myself then end the game  Step 7-REPEAT!!
5456	1	a	This is the most fun you will ever have in a game for 99 cents. From the aerial attacks, to the breakdancing T-Rex ragdolls, this game is fantastic with friends.
566	0	a	I tried really hard to like Prototype. It has an interesting enough story, tons of power to murder many, many people with, but simply put, it runs terrible. It averages maybe 20 FPS, dropping into low single digits if more than just the main character are on the screen (often). The menu is clunky, and the controls and uninutitve and unresponsive.
2011	1	a	This game is great but not for the $14.99 it costs. If you were to buy this you should wait till it gets crazy cheap like how I did and got it for around .99 cents.
3921	0	a	I meet the maximum requirements of the game and more...   yet on lowest settings i get 20fps what is this
6055	1	a	got the game as a gift. i spent an hour killing dinosuars, and yelling turok was a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at people and then i was kicked from the server. best hour ever spent in a game
402	1	a	It's an open world game where you run faster than the cars. I've been wanting this since Vice City.  I really like the action in this game. There's a good variety of weapons, some of them (the ones growing out of Mercer) have very wide move sets, which expand as the game goes on. The combat overall feels tightly paced, what with all the recovery animations and slow-mo, but I never really felt it was overdone. There's a nice bit of escallation, too, with both the mutants and the army getting a bit sillier with every chapter, and you getting new powers to deal with them.
608	1	a	Great story, loved the combat, and the bosses were a fun time. One of my most favorite games that I've ever played.  11/10
1645	1	a	I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth $0.99, I should've spend more money on this!
3006	1	a	This is a fun game for a while. but it gets boring quite fast.
2983	1	a	Take Killing Floor, replace the zombies with dinosaurs, add vehicles &amp; wide open areas &amp; you have the potential to be one of the best games released in 2012. The game does however have some bugs, although the majority of them are not major. The worst ones I have seen is where you fall through the ground when getting out of a jeep or the game attempting to continue onto another round when you have technically finished the game. There is however an extreme clipping issue where dinosaurs can actually attack you through the wall of a bunker you may be in, although this is easy enough to dodge in most cases if you stay away from the wall, provided a T-Rex doesn't throw a bolder at you that somehow gets through the wall of the bunker due to the clipping issue. Another interesting bug is when the healing pad may inadvertently be healing the dinosaur, which isn't a big problem with Raptors, but is a huge problem when the T-Rex had his head stuck through the wall just above the pad.  The developers insist that Dino Horde is not a re-release of Dino Beatdown &amp; is banning anybody who states it is on the Steam forums for the game, but let's be honest; the fact that it replaced the original game is proof enough that it is. What sets it apart from a straight re-release is the fact that it was improved on; further game modes/dinos were added, bugs were fixed, among other changes. I don't really care that it is a re-release, the people who previously owned the game got it for free (which is a $5 discount if you purchased Dino Beatdown). I still say it's a great game &amp; a great value for the price even with the bugs.
4057	1	a	ORION: Prelude in one word is Nazi Zombies (from Call of Duty) with Dinosaurs! What could get more awesome than that! The game builds off the (slightly overused) you are doomed! Make a last stand and survive as long as you can kind of thing. You start with nothing but a pistol and your class ability and as you kill dinosaurs you earn credits which can be used to purchase weapons and augments which upgrade your character! (Sounds familiar, right?)   The game also features versus modes but because of how few people play versus I was never able to find a game to join which means I am therefore unable to review the versus and will not be including it in my final score.  A major thing to point out is that the game is full of bugs, I often found myself being headbutted by a dinosaur before being sent flying over half a kilometre, then face first into a rocky cliff and I would penetrate the wall and be stuck inside the cliff. Another common bug for me was driving through any sort of water in a a vehicle, and I would fall under the map, unable to move and forever falling I had to quit out of several matches because of this.   Final Score = 7.5/10 
3038	1	a	You'll either love this game or hate it. I happen to really enjoy it; it's amazing fun with friends and is all-out chaos when you get a full server going on any game mode. Is it game of the year? No. Are there some obvious faults with it? Yes. But I definitely think it's worth a try, especailly for the relatively cheap price.
2598	1	a	I am not normally a first person shooter type of player, but Dino Horde definately lets me break out of my norms. It isn't just myself and my friends randomly trying to kill each other, but instead we're all trying to figure out new and faster ways to brutally murder the big bad dinosaur!  The hilarity of it all is the fact that I'm fighting long-extinct dinosaurs with futuristic weapons, and I'm still barely on par!
4751	1	a	Very awesome game for less than 1â¬.So much action and the enviroment is just astonishing
4896	0	a	needs update and help graphics drains to much cpu and speed sucks need more charecters
3965	1	a	my honest review:  + the price! it's only 0,99â¬ if you like FPS by 1% u should 100% buy! + fun, fun, fun + just good ol' FPS Action - no story + basically the multiplayer game u wanted after Turok came out + a lot of upgrades to buy from credits you earn by shooting dinos (weapons, class upgrades, various gear, etc...) + Coop + lots of players play all the time + you can kill and play dinosaurs and also a T-Rex, and it's for a buck (in sale under a half buck!) SO WHAT THE F ARE U WAITING FO? TUROK?! + jetpacks + dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos + jetpacks &amp; dinos for under a buck   - with graphics all on High the game doesn't look like in the videos - graphic is more than outdated - ingame communications?! (only a text chat, which looks worse than worse) - microtransactions for better gear not only cosmetics - not only the graphic also the gameplay mechanics are kinda outdated, for example the dino 'physics' are just 'not there' ^^ - basically no atmosphere -&gt; just action (i hoped for a little 'crouching-in-the-bushes-hunting-t-rex-creepy-atmosphere')
2130	1	a	If you like shooting BIG â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs in the MOTHERâ¥â¥â¥â¥ING face with BIG â¥â¥â¥ guns FOR ONE DOLLAR then this game is for YOU. 'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time.' the devs are rad af too. get this game.
4795	0	a	This game is only really worth it to play with friends. Even then its way too glitchy for my taste coupled with poor gameplay. I only put the number of hours I did because me and a friend turned the difficulty high up and laughed at the newer players getting slaughtered by an ocean of meat and teeth.  Would it be worth trying out? Maybe. But I would not recommend it unless you want to play a game with cartoon stupid enemy ai, cartoon bobble-head accessories seen on players, and a musical number that repeats itself so much that I have to listen to heavy metal to get it out of my head.  Oh yes and the Rex himself likes to throw giant boulders at you with his mouth
3877	0	a	Orion: Prelude caters to the zero demand in first/third person sci-fi dinosaur shooters, it's continued existence and updates is one of the great mysteries of life
1582	1	a	I've only spent 99 minutes in this game as of writing this review, and already I have been; Blown up by my teammates. Swallowed whole by three different large dinosaurs. Picked up and smashed on a rock by a pterodactyl. Swarmed and devoured by chickens with scales. Forgotten to buy ammo and then murdered by a horde of everything. Bullrushed by a triceratops. Had the time of my life.  Buy it. Now.
4117	0	a	Audio clips for the guns and everything sound terrible or sound like they've been ripped from another game, graphics look like dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Glad I didnt pay 99 cents because it wasnt worth it. 0.1/10
6508	1	a	More fun than you will find with Killing Floor and for Â£3 less ($5). This game has more to offer than the usual 'kill hordes of things' gameplay and gives more in the way of customization than one might expect from this genera of game. We were plesantly suprised with the comeback that this game made, and not to use the feaux-statement of 'New and Improved' (as how can something be new AND improved?) but if there were ever a time to use it, it is now. The game feels different than it did before and, with luck, will bring players back. 8/10 [Deductions] -There isn't much in the ways of plot or writing. -No emotional or immersive investment in the game.
1216	1	a	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE THIS GAME IS DA S#@T BEST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CHANGE IVE SPENT EVER!!!
6211	1	a	This game is awesome, 50 cent for 4 copies? WHAT!?  Do the developers even eat? Are they even real?  Buy 4 copies of this game, play with some friend who have a wooden pc/ laptop and awesomeness gonna happen.  Aside from that, the game is actually not bad. I thougt that this game is really cheap because it is s***ty. But i played it a little bit and i had a good time.
3858	1	a	Please nominate this for game of the year 2017, This is seriously one of the best most innovative games on the market. It is wuite a shame that people are missing out on this gem, if you have $1 and a friend who doesnt have this game, buy them this game and they will love you forever. Basically this is the best game ever made and will easily win Game of the Year if nominated.
2354	1	a	earrape
6356	1	a	Worth the 1$ no joke. Its pretty fun.
889	1	a	Great game, very fun!
1672	1	a	It has its problems, but is lots of fun. lol
1351	1	a	Fun physics platformer, probably not worth $5, but well worth $0.19.
3975	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
4630	1	a	I've been having so much fun playing Dino Horde that I forgot to eat and died!
3613	0	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ the graphics on this thing is as bad as those hentai movies that are out of snyc
5513	1	a	Killed a T-Rex almost cried. I love Dinosours. But it's a nice game and easy to learn.
2828	1	a	I cant understand all the negative reviews! The gamemode are great, expecially survival and with 3-4 friends its incredibly fun. Multiplayer is a different thing. The servers are often filled with griefers and its just not fun.Anyway, 0,99 is a super cheap price for this great game and you wont regret buying it.
230	1	a	PC port is surprisingly decent. Worth the buy
4139	0	a	  Is this game 0,99 cents? This game should have been free, or even better you should be paid 0,99 cents for each minute you play in this mind numbing game. I played for 50 minutes and i feel like throwing up. The driving is awful and the weapons seem to go right through your hand. The only positive aspect of this game is that it made me rethink my life choices. I rate it a solid 2/10.
4596	0	a	Totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing booring game, spent 5 mins in spawn while wawe completed... I donÂ´t recommend this game.
6036	1	a	Is this a good game? No. Is this a bad game? No. Is this a good game for 1$? Yesyesyesyesyesyes. It's still pretty broken at times, but it's a lot of fun.  What do you do in this game? You shoot dinosaurs. That's it.  Of course, there are upgrades and new weapons, which are awesome. But basically, you shoot dinosaurs. So if you've ever wanted to shoot really mediocre looking dinosaurs with cool guns while flying around with a jetpack / on a chopper, buy this.  Is gud.
4858	0	a	I'm glad i tried before i buyed, the game is only $1 on special and i wont even pay that. It may say single player but there is no real single player story. It's just you in a multiplayer map. I lasted for around 10-15 mins before i got too bored to play.
5814	1	a	So Bad, Its GREAT!!!
2752	0	a	The game itself is a great game that can pass time and bring some fun, I am not talking about something that you would invest time into but a sort of game like a Zombie Mode on Black Ops, It's just a good game that can satisfy your needs for killing some dinosaurs in a huge arena that also has Objectives as well as Cars and planes to help you go around, but really other than a game you are only going to really play for around 30 minutes and never touch it again this game apparently is fraudulent or something along those lines from what I hear which is obviously not a very good thing for anyone, God just thinking about this makes me triggered about insurance fraud and crap from faked whiplash, but we are here to talk about the game.   -Pros  A good timewaster Cheap as â¥â¥â¥â¥ - I mean at around 1 dollar why wouldn't you try it out, (don't try it out)  -Cons The game is not buggy but it is far from fully optimised FRAUD Only going to play it once a year No radar system to tell you where all the dino are so you get buttraped  Graphics are pretty bad  Did I say FRAUD already? 
6078	1	a	Im sorry but, this is problay 1 of the best game in my entire life, before, people said it was so bugged and glitchy, and now they transformed it to something so awesome, I can never stop playing! Add more updates too ! :D
3810	0	a	awfull is a kind word
4434	1	a	support for this fantastic and it so fun espically assult JETPACKS FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1907	0	a	This game would be good if it didn't suck so much.
1172	1	a	Great, cheap, platformer game. One of the better ones. I recommend buying this game. Don't forget that there are trading cards dropped as well!
5594	1	a	Great game fast pased shoot em up. would like to see a ambient sound bar and a seperate gun sound bar. graphics are beautiful and the action is real gameplay on youtube. well done really happy with this :)  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFzwvmFrUtWUVJh19TXkuw/feed 
3753	0	a	Well what to say about this game...great premise. Execution is...well not so good. Tried it,but after 5minutes of playing i had no idea what was i doing, what should i do etc. Good game,but needs a lot of polishes. When its in sale and you have nothing to spend your money on, i say go buy this game just for lulz.
4499	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
3223	1	a	The game has been released over 4 years ago. Since then it was constatly being developed, and worked on.   Game has received MAJOR overhauls over the years, all of which to appeal to players who still disliked the game. After the huge graphical overhaul the price was ever reduced to 1 dollar, and all people who purchased the game before that, received their money back in form of ingame currency.   TREK Industries is one of the most reliable game developers. From the time this game was first released, major companies have all released a few games. A good part of which were exactly the same games with different names, and charged 60 bucks for each of them.   Orion : Prelude in the meantime, has changed it's name 3 times, after the game changed so much, it was the same game only on the grounds of the basic mechanics used. All of which was done completely for free. No DLC's, no paid content, no reselling the same game (There is a cash shop in game for visuals. But there is no benefit to using it, it's just different skins.).  If you want to be sure the game you buy will not be abandoned : TREK.  Now, the game is being massively hated on, because of the activity of the drama lords. Seriously, the DMCA claim, has been proven to have grounds, surprisingly the person resonsilble, decided to admit it to the CO and even listed other things that nobody noticed, and thus agreed to take responsiblity.   However everything outside the DMCA claim, all of the things you can read on this game from the ones hating it, are mostly pulled out of context, or straight on misunderstood (Like the name changes).  If you have already read a lot of them, you probalby will not believe anything that I am writing, whatever, however if you have even a tiny bit of open mind, you should ask yoursefl, why do so many people stand strongly for this game, even though there is so many 'proofs' against them.   And the answer to it is : because these are the players who have seen all the love and work this game got over the years. The stolen models, which were already removed from the game, didn't influence the game in any way, nor they didn't harm Activision. Let's be honest the selling point of Orion is not that one gun, it's not the guns at all. It's not even the graphics, though I have to admit, that graphical overhaul update coming with Orion : Prelude was so good, my old PC actually stoped being able to run the game.   So really, it's a great game that is a lot of fun to play, especially with friends, features many gamemodes, and mixes the mechanics like no other game I know of. It's a perfect mix of sillyness, gameplay, replayablitiy and ideas.   You should definetely get this game if you have whom to play it with. And if you are hating on the game without knowing anything outside of the drama lords posts, please don't. Even if the models were knowlingly taken (which, again were not, case is solved already), TREK at least doesn't steal from you, the player. Which I can't say about some AAA titles out there.
6449	0	a	So good that they give a -91% on it. Please avoid this game.
5938	1	a	I really wish that this game didn't get so much flak after its initial release. I mean, sure, I hear that it was a fairly buggy, garbage game. But now it's definitely a blast to play with some friends or to just pick up a round now and then. You get to run around killing dinosaurs with some cool weaponry! Sure, it's not the most involved game out there, but not every game needs to be deep - sometimes a game can just be fun, ya know?
4534	0	a	THIS GAME...... no, this THING is awful  The Ai is completely broken, just jetpack to the nearest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rock and they will sit there thinking 'â¥â¥â¥â¥! I wish I evolved to jump instead of choosing to inhabit a world full of deadly cliffs, eternal rain and trees that look like they exist, but don't'  At least the devs and dinos have a few things in common, like brains the size of wall nuts and trying to sell anything so they can buy a slab of dry meat.
3916	1	a	good nice dinosaur mabey ark try to get stuff like this!
1773	1	a	Good, Dinosaurs are in it.
227	1	a	Yo mum would love this guy , he can make his hands into tentacles. 20/10.
2796	1	a	many may look at the price and think the game is bad, but it's a fun game with wonderful graphics and solid game play over all 8.5/10 a hidden gem.
6335	0	a	Its not bad for what it is, and honestly if deathmatches (and a couple variations) on a few small maps with dinosaurs that die with one shot, limited feelings of progression, and a microtransaction store sound like fun...fill your boots. Hardly anything that even hints at the depth and scope of SC.
5089	1	a	i thinks anyone can buy this game :D (becouse it's really cheap), slay some dinosaurs with your friends :&gt;
4981	0	a	.
1350	1	a	Great! Finished collecting the cards and you have made me the happiest hamster that has ever lived :SaddenedRobot:
283	1	a	lmfao idk why i have this game
3886	0	a	4 Million copyies sold isn't a selling point for a $0.99 game.
1720	1	a	This Is Better than Primal Carnage 100/100
4422	1	a	Its a good game, you kill dinosaurs and stuff. You can use a shotgun to literally blow the head off of a dinosaur. :P
4364	1	a	My friend told me none of my reviews where 'helpfull or constructive' sooooooooo here goes............................umm â¥â¥â¥â¥ I don't know how to make this game better it's perfect as it is. It's so bad it's funny................waaaaaiiiit no I know how to make it better, MAKE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MULTIPLAYER WORK SO I CAN LAUGH AT YOUR GAME WITH MY FRIENDS.
6252	1	a	Its a really fun game i really recommend it and not to mention its very cheap it cost less than a dollar if u dont like this game i dont think u should dislike this game just because its a really cheap game since it cost less than a dollar ill give this 8.5/10
5365	1	a	Decent game. 7/10 would play again.
263	0	a	couldnt get it to load kept crashing a shame it looked fun
1958	1	a	fighting â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs. awesome!
3672	0	a	Wish I could have my $0.50 back
3170	0	a	Might aswell cut you leg off with a spoon, cause this game hurts your soul by simply being in the main menu
4195	1	a	I do recommend this NOW. But I do feel bad for the people dat pay for this since many of em really wasted their money and on other games even tho its .99 the devs really just want ur money and then make it F2P to rip em off. I recommend this game just for fun nothing else nothing more. since this game is actually pretty fun and I enjoyed it. I would NEVER pay for any of their games tho since i saw many MANY negative reviews to not make me pay for ANY of em. If u play with friends u will have fun other then dat its just a game for fun and its not perfect which makes it more fun. And since its free try it wont hurt to try but I suggest people to not use money for this since the devs are after ur money and basically ripping u off.
1546	1	a	I spent over 5 dollars on this game for other people...  I say money well spent, I enjoyed this game.
3442	1	a	I gave a weird review, so now here is a more specific review on why you should buy this game. Now when I saw the game, I wasn't expecting a lot from it. That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.
2038	1	a	this is a fun game. def worth the 3 dollars i paid for it. like another post say's in some cases it better than most high dollar games out there. its a fun little run and gun shooter. dont expect anything more than that. get it to just mindlessly kill dinos with your friends.
4986	0	a	Developer steals assets and lies about it.  Game is absolute trash.
4050	1	a	I have had more fun with this game than I have most budget titles, highly reccomend
1953	1	a	This game is full of Bexes that just walk around you and derp. Some of them also gets stuck under tanks and makes stupid Bex noises! It's focking derp as hell.  Otherwise, pretty good co-op experience
6015	1	a	Jurassic Park? More like low budget Jurassic throwdown! â¥â¥â¥â¥ my ratskins, the dinos in this neighborhood won't hesitate to bring unprecedented rainfall and atmospheric pressure to your neck of the woods! You can level up so much I don't see how you'd ever g et bored! Unless you play for 1+ hour at a time am I right? In all seriousness, this game needs hella work but is a solid 7/10. I've had some good tmes with it. Buy it. Buy me. Hilary Clinton. Anal beads. Orion: Prelude. Stegosaurus.  ~â¥â¥â¥â¥bad
10	1	a	'All right! I'm going to play through them all in a row!' *Starts Kings Quest 1* *Walks into woodcutter's house* *Dies by falling into hole in the floor* 'That was Awesomeeeee!'
3822	0	a	  The game costs a dollar and is always on sale for a reason.      cuz its bad         It's a good game if you're 8 years old I guess.
680	1	a	Good game, although about poker, none poker skill require. Kinda half strategic gameplay (make your hands stronger, while prevent opponent from getting stronger hands and using powercards) and half luck (all cards come out ramdonly). Still, the only thing I really hate in this game is some enemies' powercards are cheating.
2327	1	a	I recommend beacouse it's cheap :)
1655	0	a	You know its bad when they use Steam reviews in there trailers
698	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
3195	0	a	Half-Life 2 looks better than this game, which I can run on ultra with 60+ fps. My computer is fairly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, yet I can run a few games on ultra or even low and still get playable framerate. In this game I ran on low and got less then 10 fps, which is extremely unplayable. It may be bad because I have a terrible computer, but if I can run Far Cry 2 on ultra with 60+ fps, I should be able to run this on medium at least with 60+ fps.
2887	1	a	Don't believe the metacritic rating. Fantastic constantly updated co-op shooter in the style of L4D. Here's to hoping that dinosaurs are the new zombies.
5625	1	a	Very nice.. need some graphic improvement :O
2008	1	a	NEWS FLASH! This game is DINO BEATDOWN...yes, the overpriced, broken, glitchy piece of software that was released almost 2 YEARS AGO. For those that bought the game back then, you've probably noticed it has a new name...and that it actually works now! This game finally offers what they promised at the point of sale. Is it perfect? Nope. Is it worth trying out again? Absolutely. And...for .99 cents, you can invite some friends to try it out with you, too.
2787	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a wonderful game involving, yes, you guessed it, pigs. The game opens up new possibilities in the genre of first-pigson shooters. It includes a variety of maps and gamemodes to spice up the normal pig-shooter formula, and many customizations to make your pig stand out from the rest. Additionally, the visuals in the game truly shine. I was amazed at the Xbox One's new pig physics engine, where even the curly tail is visible and incredibly detailed. Compared to the predecessor, ORION: Dino Beatdown, pig AI is vastly improved. Instead of running around attacking you for no reason, the enemies now act like real pigs! You can play as many different classes of humans to take down the evil pigs, such as Medic, Medic, and Medic. The Medic class is my personal favorite. As for the modes, there is classic Survival, Conquest (a longer version of survival), Gun Game, Team Deathmatch, and more. It even contains a rampage mode where you can play as a pig! I had a lot of fun oinking my way to victory against 3+ friends.   Overall, ORION: Dino Horde is a masterpiece. Spiral Game Studios has made a huge leap in game design. The game benefits greatly from new capabilities of next-gen gaming, and provides a new and refreshing experience for those tired of pig-related FPS. I give the game a solid 4/5 stars.
4687	0	a	Crap game.
2948	1	a	This game is gr8 would buy for my friends and i again.
3313	1	a	Rode a vehicle full of teammates into a dino and it blew up. Won an achivment 10/10 id suicide bomb again.
5142	1	a	Its aight
5484	1	a	Killing floor with dinosaurs and tanks.
1161	1	a	A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for the most time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided in 6 'worlds', and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.
1083	1	a	It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.
2707	1	a	Played it for a while but got bored soon. But since its super cheap give it a try.
2754	1	a	Basically what you need to know about this game is that it takes place in the middle of Turok and Crisis where some of the idividuals in both games are in need of some serious dino â¥â¥â¥ kicking. Play as your favorite characters like master chief, the medic in TF2, luke skywalker, and the guy in crisis (you know the main guy who can be invisible). Then fight hoards of mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs, and for some reason santa? with all you friends.
5165	1	a	For the dino killers
1385	0	a	A flash game worthy of newgrounds but worth paying for.
1584	1	a	I recommend this game if you love dinosaurs or things with dinosaurs on them, like blankets, towels, little baggies. Dinosaurs fo'eva.
1061	1	a	 B  rilliant  E  ntertaining  E  xcellent  P  latformer
6411	1	a	Is the best game to send the dinos back to their extinction! + Multiplayer CO-OP! THIRD PERSON-FIRST PERSON! Multiplayer Human vs Human! Steam Cards Slashing dinos and a lot of fun extinguishing the DINOSAURS!...  IM IN.
4828	0	a	Oh god... at first I thought I was going to be able to write some hilarious review about how it was the best Dinosaur Survival Simulator of all time... but it's not.   To be quite blunt with you all, this is the worst game I have played in my entire life. And I have played a lot of games. This game takes the cake for being the most worthless piece of garbage that I have ever had the misfortune of wasting time on. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO FIGHT DINOSAURS - I REALLY DID! But once I started playing, I realized that it just was not going to work.  I was able to make it through the first wave of a survival match, and after shooting down 8 velociraptors, I realized that this was not the game for me; or rather, this was not the game for anyone. Anyone who tells you this game is decent is a child with absolutely no experience with any other games, because I'm pretty sure this deserves the title of not only Worst Game of the Year, but Worst Game of the Decade. The only thing I was impressed by was how bad it was...  Graphics: 0/10 Gameplay: 0/10 Sound: 0/10 Fun: 0/10 Premise: 10/10  0/10 Would not reccommend to a friend.
1282	0	a	pleased as punch with this gr8 game, i wish i got to play it since the cursor can't reach the right side of the screen.
5789	1	a	when kids ask me how did dinosors die i let them play this okay this game 11/10 {Great Buy] buy really amazing game for the money
17	1	a	GET YE FLASKE. YOU CANNOT GET YE FLASKE. Oh no, I've been turned into a snail! And now I'm dead. Lament! 7 out of 10.
212	1	a	Thats the most incredible Game ever!!! I dont know how to explain but look at some Gameplays and you will see!
1960	1	a	ORION:Dino Horde. this game has a great potential in the future and right now is still a good game. The dinosaurs are not to overpowerd nor are the guns. The vheicals all have thier weaknesses and strengths. and also the classes have been well thought out and put together well so that when all three work together it is a good team. But one of the main things this game has to offer is the community it contains. The community is one of the nicest you can find, they help each other and most of them are playing to survive as well. So make sure you get this game, come join in and have alot of fun 
976	1	a	Lots of action, classic story and BRUTALITY.
5600	1	a	Fights dino with ''lightsaber'' always die 10/10
5867	1	a	great game would recommend ^^
3366	1	a	I'm mainly a coop gamer and this game has a fun coop gameplay, pitting humans against dinosaurs in huge world maps with weather effects. Kill dinosaurs to earn XP, upgrade your abilities, buy new weapons, vehicles and survive the waves! Anxiously waiting for the august 2014 update.
6084	1	a	I havent smoked anything in my life EVER but i sohuld start now because this game already gave me cancer, Fun cancer. 10/10 - 'dont do drugs kids'
4293	1	a	The video says to ignore the Metacritic score. I agree with this statement! Well worth the dollar paid for it, and I dare say it's worth the regular $14.99 price. It's not perfect by any means, but it provides a good bit of entertainment with friends.
234	1	a	yeah i am a shapeshifter
5443	1	a	The lag sucked, and i can't play as Dinosaurs, But for the most part, COMPLETELY AWESOME AND I RECOMMEND IT!
5185	0	a	This is one of the only Steam games i own that i wouldnt reccommend buying. When I first bought it, I was super excited, but whem i lunched the game, I found that the graphics were terrible (and slow), and that the overall idea of the game was kinda stupid too. Some people might enjoy it, but it certainly wasn't for me.
2242	1	a	its cool very hard in ways like the lag and such but yeah thumbs up 
3314	1	a	Better than before '-')b~~~~
5135	1	a	I paid 49 cents, killed some dinosaurs, had some fun.   Can't do much else with 49 cents these days.
5376	1	a	First time first person shooter.. and I really like this game.
6191	1	a	but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was 99 cents
2086	1	a	Good for approximately 3 hours of fun before getting tired of killing the same few dinosaurs over and over again. 10/10.
2226	1	a	Hello, I am a T-Rex. I will throw â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boulders at your unsuspecting face. Come to play with me so you can rage. You can level up your character and shoot all my tasty friends. Bring all your tasty friends too so we have full course meal. Don't use metal friends or flying bags or ninja skills to fight me. Just run a-way and shoot. Or I will take giant Dinoâ¢ dumps in front of spawn. GG tasty n00bs.
2895	1	a	great game.
643	1	a	Its a card game first, and a fighting game second. Each fight is structured by the cards played. And by 'cards', I mean a 52 card deck.  Your attacks come in the form of stacks of five such cards. Following Yahtzee Croshaw and Poker rules, getting say, a 5-of-a-kind will increase the damage that can be dealt.  The end all goal, of course, is to slay whoever you're fighting. Artwise its beautiful, but the lore of the game is handed to you via text, and wayyyyy too much of it.  8/10
3400	1	a	Despite the many criticisms surrounding this game and its history, it's actually not bad, especially after all the free updates that the dev team has been rolling out, an unprecedentedly generous feature compared to the larger, corporate imperiums that dominate game design today, who not only disregard bugs and their player base, but would have them pay extra for such to be fixed in the way of expansions and DLC.  The game itself isn't exactly a revolutionary genre, but it incorporates popular aspects from several games and melds them together to form a unique and generally enjoyable experience. If anything, I'd say jetpacking above the reach of hordes of raptors and blasting them to smithereens with a rocket launcher is my idea of a good time, but take it or leave it: It's only a buck, yet worth quite a bit more in replayability.
5396	1	a	This game is very broken but is very fun if you are looking for a laugh with friends. My rating 6/10 It would be 8/10 if the sounds weren't f***ed up.
2533	1	a	This game is fun, and a great value.  -Coop and PvP multiplayer modes. -Coop has bots for singleplayer and Multiplayer. -A variety of flying and ground vehicles. -Tons of achievments, some of them are quite funny. -Plenty of weapons and upgrades to choose from each play through.
2058	1	a	The game is good. Not absolutely perfect but also Its only just 1$. And I think for that price this game is Amazing.  Its one of the most fun Fps I have played.  The game is a little buggy but thats another problem.
886	1	a	Just as fun, if not more so, than the first game.
454	1	a	Play this on anything but easy and ur in for a challange but overall epic game plus fun on herd gameplay
6212	0	a	'In 2012 we released one of the worst games of all time'                         Still sucks 
6208	1	a	Got stuck between stones while climbing a mountain. Had to ALT + F4 out of the game   -would play again
64	1	a	I have never played a Point-And-Click in my life, but I like it.
5808	1	a	Bought a knife and stabbed a t-rex to death for $.49 10/10 would stab again
5186	1	a	This game is fun any easy to play. Also it is very cheap. What I am saying is ever one should get this game and at least try it. I just wish it had more vehicle to play with in game most air.
486	1	a	Orchestrated destruction and elbow dropping on helicopters.
5963	1	a	What's fun about this game:  1.Killing Dinos!  2. Vehicles and jetpacking!  3. Shooting the T-Rex and jumping to higher ground and laughing at them becaue they can't get you (Unless they throw homing rocks which are easy to dodge with super jumps.)  4. Random Ragdoll physics  The Bad:  1. Getting stuck in random places  2. Dinosaurs clipping through buildings and cheaply killing you  3. Getting stuck on and underneath dinos  4. EXTREME lag at random moments  5. Bad texture pop in  But I do heartly recommend this game, it's only $1 and it's tons of fun with friends! If you had to describe it to someone, I would says it's a mix between Halo and Left 4 Dead. Hopefully with further updating and help from the community we can make this a great game.   It is glitchy, but it is a blast! Give it a try you won't be disapointed with your purchase! :D
4216	0	a	The server connections and server browser are horrible.
1436	1	a	no need to buy ammo. better than csgo
1812	0	a	On modern standards the game feels and looks like a work in progress. It does provide for some fun with friends, and there seem to be larger updates down the line. I don't particularly regret my purchase, but this is not something I would suggest buying.
946	1	a	Alot of fun :)
2673	1	a	is cheap and great get it
210	1	a	This is a pretty good game. Another zombie apocalypse, except this time you aren't human or truely zombie but something else. But whatever that something else is shapeshifts into a ton of amusing and deadly forms for all your killing needs. And lets be honest, the shapeshifting is awesome but so is shooting a helicopter from the sky, picking it up and throwing it hulk style to bring down the next.  This game is mainly combat, and has many places for wanton destruction, and some where you better know what you're doing if you want to survive. It also has some 'stealth' if it even rates that name, but this component is amusing none the less. Also if you enjoy dashing around cities at high speed, running up walls, jumping increadible distances and gliding around this is definately for you.  The story is completely linear, but the world is open and contains a number of fun challenges all around the city which unlock as you progress through the story. The narative is fairly good, and I personally enjoyed tracking down the backstory components, but that is not essential.  Overall it's a pretty great game and you should probably get it; though it won't provide the hundreds of hours that you would get from say Skyrim.
2821	1	a	So terrible, it's pure entertainment and fun with friends. Get it if you want a bad game with almost no redeeming qualities which can remain entertaining for how broken it can get.
1828	1	a	Lol. Orion is a hilarious game. Worth the 99c. Get the 4-pack, and play with your buddies. You will not regret it. Graphics: 5/10 Combat: 7/10 Running around killing T-Rex and laughing your â¥â¥â¥ off when your buddy gets wrecked by a baby compy: 12/10.
1015	0	a	It's not Portal -- that 's for sure. Stupid people just should refrain from making puzzles. Beat it in a few hours. Challenge mode leaderboards are polluted with hackers' fake records.
3220	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with a partner. WATCH OUT FOR THE FLYING BEASTS!
5902	1	a	it is so fun
6219	1	a	This game looks like it was some computer geniuses response to 'Well, Why don't you make own game if everything else sucks right now?'  So, they made it in a garage and molded it into an awesome Halo/KF2/bored group of friends/Dino-genocidists 'special' dream.  It plays well. Buy it. Do it now.
6446	1	a	Fun game definetly better than what it used to be, awesome game to play with some friends.
1606	1	a	This is a real interesting game, and I don't understand why people give such awful reviews about it. It has a fun twist with survival, and should recieve more fans.
6128	1	a	One of the most enjoyable silly games around imo. great survival game tho i wouldnt bother with other modes tbh. 8/10
5931	1	a	This Pumpkin King 10/10 would fight again
157	1	a	Alex Mercer must return in prototype 3 11 out of 99% Game of the year
4888	0	a	It's like Ark but without everything that makes Ark a 10/10
1785	0	a	This game is horrendous. It's built like a free-to-play game with microtransactions, but this game has the audacity to ask for $15, but the only reason why I purchased this game is because it was 99 cents. I want my 99 cents back. This game is terrible and deserves to be taken off of Steam.
3379	1	a	Halo meets Turok! This game is all about survival and it does a good job of challenging you. This game is a BLAST with friends, it is still fun solo, but amplified many times over with more people. It has an addicting gameplay that rewards progress. All DLC is free and will be free, customization is simple yet fun. Where else can you punch a Trex in the face, get rewarded wtih 750 credits AND unlock an achievement?   Breakdown 8.5/10 (In it's current state an 8.5, but IMMENSELY strong potential to be a perfect 10!)  *High replayability *Tons of achievements to unlock *co-op or adversarial multiplayer *DINOSAURS!!
1982	1	a	This game is hours and hours of fun! With a group of friends of even by yourself! How many dinos have you killed lately?
2113	1	a	I shot the dinasour. Ran out of bullets. Dinasour see me. I out of bullets. Teammates out of bullets. I die gg 4/10 reccomend would buy twicw
3657	0	a	After several attempts of playing this game, like for real. I didn't manage to shot a DAMN THING. I've spend over 20 minutes waiting , searching , sprinting... but I couldn't play it.  Why I couldn't play it? Because this game has tons of random crashes that random things causes them. Just no.
3099	1	a	  Thsi is an amzing buy for just under adollar its worth it ive played five hours i feel thats definatley my moneys worth
5908	1	a	the graphics are kind of old, but that isn't a very big deal. This game would be affordable even if it costed 4000% more. Many gamemodes, weapons, cosmetics, vehicles and dinos are included in an awsome co-op, pvp game for just 0.99â¬. There's no reason why you shouldn't buy this game.  Loved it from the very first beginningâ¤  The only - is those weird acidspitting dinos....
55	0	a	Does not run on modern systems. Somehow they've buggered up the dosbox config. So you'll need to fiddle around with this. Or just get the GoG version...
910	1	a	Great beat-em-up platformer. Put on the Pendulum In Silico album in the background and it's perfect.
6284	1	a	the price and the game play this is my favorite game why are you even reading go ahead and buy/play the game right now!
687	0	a	Play Solitaire instead.
3875	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCMRpia6K_o  just watch that video, and YES this game is ORION: DINO HORDE NOT Prelude.... the only reason I own this game is because it was a gift from a friend over steam.I joined a game, IN THE LOBBY, and when the match started, I was prompted with wait for next round to respawn.Round timer: 45:00 minutes left, so I left.
5309	0	a	I got this game for free and I only played for 15 minutes. What a waste. The graphics are awful, the animations are terrible, and the combat is a Halo ripoff. It's a really bad Halo ripoff with ugly dinosaurs. Avoid this game.  0/10
3575	0	a	This game is a scam. Valve is backing up scumbag developers and allowing false advertisement on this Steam page and not allowing refunds. These developers fired their dev team and took money for themselves using a KickStarter campaign. They have stolen props from major video game companies and small dev teams. They released this game in a pre-beta state. They are using false advertising tactics to get people to purchase this game.   I've supported Steam since 2006, and this is the first time I've been disappointed with Valve for allowing devs like these onto their store, and then fiercely defending them on the Steam forums and on Steam Support. I cannot be issued a refund of the four-pack I purchased because of the Steam Subscriber Agreement. However, they falsely advertised this game as a complete build, and they are using the agreement as a way to prevent having to take a publishing loss.
3272	1	a	This game is does not deserve a 36 from Metacritic. This game is fun, fast, and sometimes stupidly hilarious. Sure, the textures and models aren't amazing, but the enjoyment and playability of this game is quite high. The dinos will sneak up on you and sometimes you'll wonder what the hell is happening, but you will ALWAYS have a fun time playing this game.  I played this game when it was free about 6 months before writing this review and I loved the game. It has been on my wishlist ever since, and I picked it up when it was only one dollar. It's a steal for a dollar, pick it up NOW.
5226	1	a	I like shooting zombies with friends. Dinosaurs is not that far of a leap I guess.
1181	1	a	A good platformer especially for the 19 cents I paid for it on sale. I just bought it for another title in my collection though and it probably won't keep me entertained for long since puzzle games just feel like a chore, but the game is made well enough to enjoy if you have a lot of patience. I don't. 7/10
4572	0	a	At first, i thought the game looked cool, you know, dinosaurs, guns, eplosions, Michael Bae, etc When i first started the game was on high graphics so i wasnt too fussed, turned it to low and i still got 20 fps when i can run dino d-day (much better dino game) at 60 fps on ultra!  i bought this game for my friends and believe me..........don't get this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
2966	1	a	I Was Flying with my Jetpack and killed a TRex with a Sniper Rifle Headshot in Slowmo 10/10
4676	1	a	I still enjoy it. For the price of one freaking dollar per copy this is insane.
4946	0	a	Cs 1.6 all over again
2322	1	a	if you want to fight dinosaurs and look swag then this is the game for you
1591	1	a	Every time this game was on sale, the low metacritic score made me keep my distance. I was still skeptical when the developers offered it at 90% off, but it's hard to not try something for a dollar. And that was a good decision. Burnt out on Killing Floor? Give Dino Horde a shot. There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind. I've had an enormous amount of fun so far with this game. Ignore the useless metacritic score and check it out--a welcome addition to the coop club.
1955	1	a	This game is the best worst game I have ever played. It has such a bad starting menu and no tutorial and it runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ for average PCs and who ever did the sounds makes me wana laugh my â¥â¥â¥ off. A T-Rex is ear deffaning from miles away on the lowest volume possible, while a 44 magnum in your hand being shot sounds like a silnced bb gun to a def old man. But for some reason this is just to fun. The first hour or so of actual gameplay and not trying to figure out how to join a friend is proboly the most fun ive had in a multiplayer experince in a long time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-af9TT75A  Buy this game, its by no means a 15 dollar game, but its 1 dollar, and if someone can play it with you, you will have a great time.
4728	0	a	This game is a trainwreck
4619	0	a	The worst FPS game I have ever played.
5019	0	a	Stay away! Dont give them anymore money please!
2496	1	a	no matter what all the reviews say, this game is fun as hell. especially when you have a good friend or a couple to play with. i recommend to anyone who has a mic and likes playing as a team.
176	1	a	nice singleplayer game
5119	1	a	Killed a T-rex, it glitched into the earth and then flew 1km into the sky.   10/10
5906	1	a	rather get this game than any f2p game out there 100/10
5574	1	a	1: Watch this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQ3GBFI4KQ  (Official video) 2: Buy this game. 3: Profit.
1830	1	a	This game is good. It's not like Primal Carnage, or Primal Carnage: Extinction but still it's a nice game. If you can't buy these two, get this game. It's really cool if you like dinosaurs or shooters. There are many gamemodes, much classes with their unique abilities and you can customize your character.
4789	1	a	-10/10 Would get slapped across the map by a dinosaur again
2995	0	a	terriable game graphics are overrated when u cant even perform baisic mechanics like capping points  also didnt have fun with it either. i would rather play dino d-day at least i had fun with that. this game is a laugh to the original people who paid 15 dollars and yet i wouldent want to even pay 1 dollar. this game HAHA BAD. 0/10 go look into something else.
3018	0	a	it used to be good, and i dont mind it being free to play although i bought it, BUT at least give us stuff for supporting the game?  â¥â¥â¥â¥ you too developers
406	1	a	Very odd controls for keyboards and mouses, it gets pretty horrific at times with how awkward switching infected modes can be. Overall though, a solid game. Main character wears a tough jacket and has a surly name. He goes around and eats people to sustain his big Elizabeth Greene butt-kicking muscles. What's not to like?
53	1	a	Space Quest originally came out in 1986 -1995, so computers today were much too fast to emulate the games properly assuming you still had copies. This neat little collection brings these classic EGA and VGA hits to Windows XP/7. The 6 games included follow the tales of Space Janitor, Roger Wilco, and his quest to (somehow) save the galaxy, single-handed! Presented in Graphical Text-based to Point-and-Click, these adventure games are sure to bring you some good fun (and some frustrating times figuring out puzzles.) Being a major fan of Sierra Adventure Games, I definitely recommend this. Also check out Kings Quest, Quest for Glory, Police Quest, and many more great hits from Sierra of old.
5017	0	a	Loaded up the game all excited to try out the updated version. Got my video settings set, went to the join game menu and servers loaded up and game crashed. Ok, checked out the workshop, loaded some mods, started the game up and got into a game in progress... waiting for round to end. I spawn, run around for a second. 'You have lost connection to host'. Back to main menu, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this piece of gorilla â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
5428	1	a	Awesome addicting game
3495	0	a	I wuz lok oooh dinisore big and it lok kilt meh and i wuz raelly maad
3325	1	a	I drove a jeep. Ran over triceratops. Went flying and hit the skybox. 11/10 would do again
3691	1	a	It's worth every penny.
1398	1	a	I like the art, despite cartoonish but isn't childish. And I like the game mechanic.
6359	1	a	Its a great game just for 1$
1863	0	a	For the love of god avoid this game in its entirety. It's god some decent ideas but the execution is the absolute worst of perhaps any game ever made. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
500	1	a	This game's alright, can be abit boring at times but if you're looking for action and adventure, this is the game for you.
5455	1	a	It's Good More Then CoD Ghosts And Cheapest ! Buy it Cool Graphicks and Cheap !!!
395	0	a	Edgy McEdgeface runs up buildings, 'assassinates' dudes (by brutally beating the to a pulp in front of his enemies) while zombies, hulking behemoths and attack helicopters chase him down.  That's not even a mission - just a normal day in New York. Sounds like fun, was fun when I was edgy enough to enjoy it and unlock most of the powers but soon enough it just becomes a slightly worse version of GTA.  Between the graphics and samey gameplay, I cannot recommend this game while it's more than Â£4
771	1	a	 https://youtu.be/OsnaGt0NXbA   Fire up your engines and tighten your twin sticks for 'Gatling Gears'. Overall a very solid game with minor flaws of aggressive forced scrolling and a little sluggish turning on your character.
6156	1	a	nobody is playing this game again!
4250	1	a	BUY IT!!!IT'S SO FUNONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!(especially with friends)
2022	1	a	Cheap game with great EXP :)
2435	1	a	Orion Prelude is an cheap FPS game.   Before the review, I would like to preface something, Orion Prelude is not the best FPS game. In regards to FPS, a gamer could boot up the classic TF2 for casual gameplay or CS:GO for a competitive, skill-based game. Orion Prelude is an FPS to play with a group of friends.  The player will usually play as a human (excluding game modes which allow the player to be a dinosaur). Playing a classic game against the AI is fun, until you realize the difficulty curve does not scale. The developers did not make the dinosaurs harder with each incoming wave, they only programmed more dinosaurs to spawn. Therefore, in games with more than two people it's simplistic to defeat the mission.  Playing with friends makes the game more fun. Doing 1v1 gun games can occasionally take 2 hours, while a deathmatch is full of paranoia and adrenaline. Every weapon in the game is more or less creaetive to a certain degree, whether it be light swords, arc guns, or giant robot mounts. The game can provide you and your friends many laughs in regards to dinosaur physics.  Should you buy Orion Prelude? Yes
3895	1	a	10/10
3197	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is a gem! Very entertaining. Not meny games that are going for one dollar are good at all. But this one is a steal. Yes there are bugs and yes the AI is kinda dull; However, the entertainment value is hard to beat. Halo, Star Wars, Call of Duty, and Jurassic Park in one game. Worth it.
5361	1	a	It's like Battlefield with dinosaurs.
294	1	a	Brutal, gory, and tons of fun, oh yeah and something about a plot I think. Oh yeah and there's an emo kid    11/10 would cleve peopel in two again
617	1	a	Not even at half off would this game be an ideal one. You'd need to wait for it to be five dollars to consider it worthy of purchase.  It sounds good in theory: badass guy, shapeshifting, conspiracy, etc. But the problem is, as far as the main missions go, it's very linear -- you have to do EXACTLY what the developers wanted you to, or you will fail., Gameplay is numbingly repetitive. You're out for revenge, and for this tough guy you're playing, there are still some enemies that can whup you (like humans, or infected humans) which make you seem weaker than you're supposed to be.  So, if in reality you want ridiculously annoying missions that feel rigged sometimes, and to chuck cars at people and buildings, leap up into helicopters and kill the driver and subsequently drive it yourself, fine and dandy. This, however, doesn't bring anything new to the table. Huge letdown.  Also, there's a weird thing with the sound. Seems quieter than it should be.
6494	0	a	It's like comma misuse but worse.
119	1	a	transformed into an old lady and ran around the city throwing cars at everyone 11/10
310	0	a	So, i tried playing this game on my Windows 7 PC. It is pretty much as good as those with Windows 7 go, but the game is stuck on constant 5 fps, making it barely playable. Apparently it is connected to HID, which would be fine. IF this was the year 2009. Seven years later, this gamebreaking error is not fixed, and has to be manually looked up and dealt with by players who want to play this. To people who want to play a singleplayer game for once because their internet is too â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play online, this is just infuriating. So basically, i bet i would like this game, if i could play it. But due to this error, i wont be able to, and seeing as this is left unfixed for seven years now, there is no hope for me to play this game in the future either.
6293	1	a	if you have a dollar i say go ahead and buy it or what for a steam sell and buy it for 50 cents either way it really fun
2223	1	a	Awesome Game! And totally underrated.   Spiral Studios care about consumers, free dlcs, regular updates.  Dinos are way better then zombies.  If you can, Buy it!
1512	1	a	Broken in all the right ways
3250	1	a	at $1 a copy, why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ not
4963	0	a	They rerelease it under a new name when the rating drops. It's pretty crappy, but s*** it was 99 cents.
3861	0	a	Pathing AI is hilarious.
54	1	a	Bring back the nostalgia where a janitor can save the universe, time and time again. Take on the role of Rodger Wilco as he battles Sariens, saving his home planet from being annoyed to death by door to door robot insurance salesmen...to trying to get rid of those stubborn mildew stains. Or just play it for the comedy.  This is old school gaming right here folks. The pack includes Space Quest 1 to 6. I really wish they made a Space Quest 7..
42	0	a	Apparently, there is a hardcopy decoder that shipped with the CD waaaaaaay back in the day when this game was new. No one bothered to tell Steam about it, or to provide it to the player. As a result, I can't get past the first few steps of the first game. MAJOR FAIL. That's just ridiculous.  Playing Space Quest I, I can't even get out of the ship before it blows up. I tried EVERYTHING. I even resorted to trying every combination of wierd symbols on the cartridge device. In the game, there is a guy that dies and his last words are supposedly tied to this cartride retreival system that has some buttons with symbols on it. Presumably, the player has to enter the symbols that correspond to the words (and there's several words that are cycled through as you restart. over and over and over again). HOW IN THE EFF AM I SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE THE WORD INTO WHATEVER SYMBOLS?  I finally caved and Googled the walk-through. That's when I found out about this decoder that shipped with the CD as some 'copy protection' wierdness. Luckily someone out there saved it and I can decode the message.,,,, Just ridiculous. I haven't even bothered to continue the first quest outside the ship - this whole debacle leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Steam should have known about the bizzare feature of the game and provided a PDF or something.,,,
2608	1	a	First of all I want to say congratulations TREK Industries, for making a revolutionary product that will change the way we look at games forever. I have logged over 500 hours in this game on a seperate account and bought it again for this one and all of my friends just to prove my loyalty to the product. Now for the actual review.  Orion: Prelude is an amazing game that can be easily compared to AAA titles such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the Halo franchise, the Counter Strike titles, and is better than mostly all FPS indie titles out there.   Graphics: Oh my god the graphics. This is a timeless piece of art that will be revered for as long as video gaming is alive. The graphics are simply timeless and they make the enviroment look absolutely beautiful. Low graphics in this game are basically equivilent to Ultra graphics in Far Cry 4. Water reflections are amazingly vivid, the dinosaurs are textured amazingly. Really nothing else can be said but this is an absolute must have game for anybody who enjoys beautiful scenery and amazing gameplay.  AI: If you can call it AI... it feels like you're actually playing with real people when offline. The grunts that help you move and act like they were real war veterans and move into and out of cover as well as taking positions to give them the upper hand. Advanced manuevers are no problem for this AI. Aside from the humans, the dinosaurs are superb as well. Amazing tracking, great movement recognition. Be careful, these things can spot you from a mile away.  Gameplay: This gameplay is honestly some of the best I have ever experienced. The best way to describe it is a mix of Call of Duty, Halo, and the balance of Counter Strike. While in the game I have had extremely intense situations where the entire team relyed of me to win. Its stuff like that that makes the game fun. In one instance I was being charged by several velociraptors and a T-rex. I turned on my absolutely flawless cloaking device and fled the scene back to the hut where i bought my sniper rifle and killed each and every dinosaur to win the game. Lets say i was sweating after that intense experience and was extremely proud of my self and my abilities to master this amazing game.  Overall I think this is a must have for any video game player looking for an amazing, intense FPS situation with not only good graphics and fun gameplay, but with balance and a cheap price as well. Honestly, this game should be at LEAST 10$ for a copy. I have bought it for all of my friends and we currently all enjoy the game together and play it whenever we have a chance. Keep up the amazing work TREK and make sure you buy this game before the price goes up! It's definitely worth the money!
2742	1	a	This game is awesome, I love dinosaurs
814	1	a	A Fun, simple, throw back of a Beat Em'Up. It has wonderful animation and is somewhat of a challege. Fun for the whole family.....except for toddlers...
6071	1	a	this is one of the best cheapest games ever but i still like tf2 but orion dino horde i mean dino beatdown I MEAN prelude they change names allot for some reason but i like it buy the game for 1 dolar you get 20.000 free orion moneyz and the graphics are better than freaking tf2 but the only problem that holds is the bugs but even if they have bugs its okay they will fix it sooner or later its not permanent about the bugs almost like magicka that has like a few bugs but evrything is perfect 9.5/10!
6079	1	a	awesome game great for its price and just an amazing game that you could enjoy with a bowl of pop corn or nice cold chocolate milk co-op is awesome and over all the game it self is outstanding
4328	1	a	I joined my first game. I asked someone how do I switch weopons. I got kicked. gg no re this is a game you would find on the App Store. but +1 because I don't want to seem like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
6298	1	a	It's like if Halo and Primal Carnage were married but one day Halo cheats on Primal Carnage with Killing Floor And Halo and Killing Floor had a baby. Primal Carnage sees the baby and thinks 'What the hell? That's not my kid! Where are the Dinosaurs?!' And then one day Primal Carnage cheats on Halo and has a baby with Quake and then realizes that Halo has been cheating on him so he kills Halo and then himself and then Quake's and Killing Floor's baby had a baby which is this game.  So yeah, ORION is pretty good.
5675	0	a	PLAYED IT GOT SOME CARDS NOW SELLING THEM BECUASE NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME SO THEY ARE WORTH SOMETHING AND IT IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
1406	1	a	the use of both w,a,s,d and the mouse is awesome   really fun game
1947	1	a	I was taunting my friends and a dinosaur picked me up and dropped me from the sky to kill me
5463	1	a	Dinosaurs, that is all.
1685	1	a	This game has come a long way since it was initially released upon the public and made quite an impact for being a terrible game. At the time of it's release this game was clearly a half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and unfinished game with uncountable amounts of bugs, only 2 or 3 maps and about 3 types of dinosaurs. This is all the past now, and though this may not be a perfect game it is a fun arcade style shooter to play with your friends.  The game now sports about a dozen different game modes and maps, a nice selection of weapons and powerups, a working progression system with 3 class types, over 200 Steam achievements and most bugs have been fixed. If you have a couple of friends with you and you just want to mess around and have a fun time on a game with a silly premise and don't mind mediocre graphics and audio then this is absolutely for you, if on the otherhand you like to play a serious survival game then this might not be for you.  This game as I mentioned is no where near perfect, the graphics are pretty mediocre as are the visual effects. The audio quality is quite good especially with the Dinosaur sound effects like the T-Rex's roar (you might want ear defenders for that), the voice acting however isn't the best but that's to be somewhat expected of this type of game. The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival. Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.  Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?
4938	1	a	Have a much value than 0.99$. Could get a better score than 36.  Olny problem is they release this game too early. :(  Not a bad game like you think, if you have a chance to play it, I recommend to do.
5419	1	a	So cheap So fun So Simple. Buy the four pack and play with some mates for a few hours. its a bargin. unlike other some other games out there.
1168	1	a	The game is alright, and at a fair price.
335	0	a	crashes at startup no solution in site prototype 1&amp;2 Don't buy
336	1	a	iz gud gaem... but prototiep 2 is betar. i'd rather go for 2 tho
273	1	a	Slash people in half as an old grandma
841	1	a	you have knives. they have knives. knives.
5516	1	a	It's actually pretty fun
3401	0	a	 Unless You Have Friends To Play With... Really Only Worth It For The Trading Cards
1807	1	a	Apparently the meta critic score is for the original of this game entitled Orion: Dino Beatdown. I'm going to presume that's true because there is no way this game is only a 36 out of 100! It's fun as hell, nice graphics, loads of weapons, different classes and perks, cool vehicles, AND FREAKING DINOSAURS  WHO DOESN'T LOVE KILLING DINOSAURS WITH LASER RIFLES WHILST FLYING IN A JETPACK?! 
730	0	a	Cannot change volume
6423	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. You get to play as a soldier fighting to protect the galaxy from the dinosaur menace. There are no better things you could better with your time. There's progression, mechs, jetpacks, â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAURS â¥â¥â¥â¥, and even hats. You're a sub-human troglodyte if you write off the game before you even play it because of some stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ that leaked into your head at some point during your useless existence. Turn that useless existence into a meaningful and productive one by pouring hours into this game, you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pleb.  All in all I would say it's a fun game.
5861	1	a	Get it on sale but it is still worth it
6424	1	a	Pretty fun, basically Killing Floor with Dinosaurs, jetpacks and and objectives, not worth $15.00 bucks, but totally worth it on sale.
3983	1	a	If you don't have one or more buddys to play with, this may not be worth your dollar. But if you have people to play with, this game is actually really damn fun. I mean, yeah it's kind of trashy and after a while it will probably get too repetitive to play kind of 'actively' but it costs just a dollar. So if you have one or more co-op buddy/s, grab a dollar and enjoy the best game on Steam that you can get for this price.
519	1	a	Absolutely badass fun.
4786	1	a	After getting a buff PC I can say this game is completely worth the .99 cents.  I honestly love this game, I wish more people would play it, I mainly have to hop in 100+ pinged servers.
6118	1	a	10/10  good for 2012 Game , Would play w friends
6207	1	a	Co-op dinosaur wave clearing. We bought a four pack for 80 cents and had a blast playing it.
2382	1	a	Very fun game. It has a bunch of different modes that you can play online, with friends, or alone! From survival of survivng waves of dinosaurs, to a mode where you do PVPVE. Its a really fun game! Also, its $0.99, so won't hurt to try!
5166	1	a	8/8
5629	1	a	Legit THE BEST 74 cents I have spent on steam. This game should be worth 10 dollars. It's so awesome. I just played 3 hours straight, It's awesome. 10/10 Great Dev's
5955	1	a	Best $1 I EVER spent. Must buy, just sell a couple steam cards and buy this.
447	1	a	Prototype is probably one of the best games I have ever come across! The powers are amazing,the abilities are awesome,and the story....oh the story! You also kinda get feels when you play as Mercer for a while......*sniff*.....anyways,get this game! Throw cars! Eat people! Whip Helicopters! Kill everyone!  Hunt.  Kill.  Consume.   Become..... 
2192	1	a	Metacritic score is misleading  this game is totally JURASSIC
4223	1	a	Buy it I mean its freaking 99 cents! 
2386	1	a	This is one of the best dinosaur/fighting games, I've ever played! Other than Primal Carnage, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! I also really love the weapons in this game, especially the pump-action shotgun, since that's always been my favorite firearm in general. This game is also like a combination of franchises I love, such as Team Fortress 2, Halo, and Jurassic Park, which I definitely think is one of the most kickass combinations of all time! I completely recommend this game for anyone who loves dinosaurs and first-person shooters!
1531	0	a	English (US) Look, the game is not bad ok, but the multiplayer community is pretty much dead, so... for a multiplayer only game, like battlefield, you won't have much to do, only buy if your friends are going to play with you...   Protugues (Brasil) Olha o jogo nÃ£o Ã© ruim mas a comunidade morreu, poucos ainda jogam, e como Ã© um jogo exclusivamente multiplayer nÃ£o hÃ¡ o que fazer mais, por isso nÃ£o recomendo... Somente compre se voce tiver amigos que querem jogar com voce e vÃ£o voltar...  Nota: 7/10
2119	1	a	Best Gmae ever full on legit graphics and stuff also the dino's ai is very good i suppose and the gema is not ever boring and the game is very very very unlike halo and or destiny. i can currently also say that austin is a poo head and such. that is all.
3864	0	a	Nope.
88	1	a	Prototype is what happens when you combine the urbanized open worldness of GTA4 with the plot of Crysis 2 (except the virus is a Left 4 Dead / Resident Evil-esque virus instead of aliens) with a protagonist that is essentially a cross between a biological human T-1000 and DC comic's Parasite (he consumes people to gain abilities, knowledge, skills, etc). The superpowered gameplay is definitely my favorite part, there are many ways to win the major story battles and sidemissions with the various moves at your command. As Alex Mercer, you can either pick up guns and rocket launchers or become a weapon yourself by shape shifting your body into claws, blades, bludgeons, whips and even a cannon ball move that launches you toward your target with enough force to blow up armored vehicles later in the game. Speaking of armored vehicles, you can hijack tanks and skyjack helicopter gunships (and this even looks exactly like that scene in T2 where the T-1000 gets on that chopper and tells the guy to get out LOL). When on foot and exploring Manhatten you use your augmented abilities to parkour the landscape, at full upgrades you can leap over 5 story buildings easily and glide / airdash through the air very similiarly to how mario from Super Mario World glides with the super cape. There is an element of Metal Gear Solid in this game too since you can shape shift into other people that you consume, ie soldiers or pedestrians in the street in order to blend in since the military is constantly looking for you. The story mode is pretty unique: your character wakes up having exactly the same knowledge the player does as to what is going on, and through a mechanic known as the web of intrigue you eventually come to understand the game's story and background on everything that is going on around you. As you explore Manhatten you will find people with the Web of Intrigue icon over their head indicating that they can be consumed by you to learn what they know in connection to everything that happened. This game features sidemissions that show up on the game's minimap that will showcase your skills with the various abilities you acquire and see how fast you can be parkouring from place to place and get bronze/silver/gold/platinum medals depending on your 1337ness.  I started playing this and finished it in about a week, making sure to get every sidemission completed on platinum. Because the plot is advanced through Web of Intrigue it is possible to finish the game without getting every bit of story out of it so I did a new game+ to find the remaining consume targets to get the whole story. For the most part the main story missions are easy with some tricky boss fights that really make you use all of your abilities to some degree, the most challenging aspect of this game is definitely getting platinum in every sidemission (think classic NES game level challenging). Overall I give this game a solid recommendation for its fluid gameplay (I love the parkour!) :)   
5512	1	a	very fun. i never played the original, so all i have to go on is what ive seen here. Picked it up on sale, well worth the $1 i paid for it. Cool weapons and augments.
59	1	a	It is so good to rejoin Roger Wilco and The Two Guys From Andromeda after so many years!  For those that are new to Space Quest... It is a series of stories about a young ane brave space janitor, Roger Wilco, as he struggles through the galaxy to fight aliens and save the universe.. again and again. The games are set in clasical adventure game concept from 80s - 90s from using your keys to move and typing command for action - to point'n'click interface. As for story, it is one of the best I know, and You can be sure You will have a looooot of fun with this game. Don't be discouraged by old interface or pixel graphics - the game is worth it, and even if some puzzles are difficult, You can always find the solutions on internet. But try solving them by using, talking, moving, combining, etc.. everything with everything :D  As for some problems with launching the game, as I read in some other reviews. I just installed the game on my ASUS X53S i5-2430M, Win10PRO 64, 8GB RAM with GeForce GT 540M. After lunching the game, You will see a menu which allows You to choose one of the 6 games to start. I tried lunching everyone of them and everything works perfectly. No problems with graphics, sound or interface. No problem with Win10.   I strongly recommend the whole Space Quest series for everyone!
1082	1	a	BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.
1822	0	a	they have made a lot of changes and whatnot over the years but i still think it was much better back when it was Dino Beatdown with just three giant conquest maps. i wish it was still like that.
5442	0	a	The game get's really boring with just PVE, it's all people play. The is no PVP community. 4/10 Community runied it.
1191	1	a	LocoRoco is that you?
6438	1	a	If you have Friends on mic you'll love this game.  It has bugs but who cares ? The devs are updating this game like crazy ( 2 Go for an update, add'd maps/ games mods vehicules etc ... )  Survival FPS with friends you just need to play it.  Btw awesome music !
4436	1	a	Lasersword fight with T-rex
5245	1	a	So I don't know if this game is bad or sorta ok. I'm conflicted. On one hand this game is not really polished and there are a lot of iffy things about it. You can't buy ammo for guns you run out of, the kill cam is weirdly stuck on the enemy's face, the music is incredibly heroic for some reason and I find things aren't particularly well explained.  HOWEVER you can play as the dinosaurs and eat humans. That's fun. It's not fun for the humans because the dinosaurs are too stronk.  I'm giving this game a posivite review because it's given me some good â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles but if I could give it eeeennnhhh I would.
2998	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5014	0	a	Is one of the worst coop games I played on Steam. I bought it when was $10. Also Prelude has very very poor performance, worst than Watch dogs and same like AC Unity but with worse graphics. The first version didn't have several optimization issues but still had and lot of bugs. Dino games aren't very good too. I can't recommend this game, absolutely. Is too bad, just play a F2P game or do something else, don't waste your time with this.  Uninstalled and will never be installed again. OVERALL: This game is too bad. 2.5/10
2507	1	a	It will be better this game use COD's engine.
1206	0	a	It would be fun if i was four again
4975	0	a	I want my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing refund i take no â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my pawn shop
371	0	a	Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.
3878	1	a	Really feels like a beta of an upcoming free to play game, and has a lot of issues, but if you look past that and realise it's just a 1$ (or less) game and realise how much fun you can have killing dinosaurs with your friends, then you'll def. like this game.
1536	1	a	Is it a great game? No. Is it worth the price? Yes. Can you get some absurd fun out of it? Yes.
4353	1	a	Enters Rampage server 3 Spinos Disconnect from server Plays singleplayer T-rex roars, R.I.P Headphones I is rip in pepperonis 10/10 would have more glitches.
3192	1	a	Imagine ark the new game for 25$ except entirely different except for the fact they have dinasours and you have this game. 10/10.5
3355	1	a	this is cactus :D :3  IM DONG so a;caguash man
2352	1	a	A very fun and intense horde mode, the pvp is not as good as i expected but surely worth the money. Very fun and very addicting. 7/10
218	1	a	I think this game was somewhat ruined by a long development cycle, during which other games (such as Assassin's Creed) were released, and some ideas ideas from those games were borrowed and smashed on top of the original concept, instead of polishing the gameplay balance. Although the game is fun, it gets boring after a while. I never got myself to finish it, but I'd still recommend it - when it's on a sale with a considerable discount - it's got a few hours of uncomplicated entertainment in it. Running and jumping across buildings is kind of cool.
5444	0	a	The games fun. When it works. Buggy as hell.
5703	1	a	It's worth your money.  720 no-scoped a dino with a bow and arrow, then used my lightsaber to kill fools. 10/10
4260	1	a	At this point they might as well be paying me to play this. How many times has this game been free again? 10? 20? Anyway, you get your money's worth, which isn't much of a feat for 99 cents.
3514	0	a	WTF, THIS SUCKS, NOW IS F2P, WASTED. I QUIT THIS GAME CUZ IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ LAGGY. HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHOLE GAME TO SPAWN BACK. SUCK LIKE â¥â¥â¥â¥
3117	1	a	my opinion if you can afford junk foods better to dump your dollar into this. ps, this is my first review of all time usually I never did.
4301	0	a	The concept is nice but the controls are crap. Sometimes you're able to move normally, sometimes you can't strafe for some reason, and sometimes you just can't move at all. It wasn't worth the dollar I spent on it.
6394	1	a	brilliant game. Love it!
499	1	a	I love this game more than I probably should. Normally, I'm really not into games with massive violence potential, but I've fallen in love with Prototype's characters. The moral dilemmas and irony are golden, enough to spur me into writing a ton of fanfiction for the game. Haha, yes, I'm a fangirl. Cower in fear before my rabies.  Anyway, Alex Mercer is a badass, and there is something wrong with you if you don't enjoy jumping over Manhattan like everything's a giant trampoline, via what parkour wants to be when it grows up. So if you're not too squeamish, check Prototype out.
982	1	a	You warp into people and turn them into blood geysers, is there anything more to say? Good atmosphere, nice sounds, good looking animations. Unfortunately this is pretty much a direct 360 port so the controls are not as tight as they should be unless you have a 360 pad, there are no video setting outside of resolution and vsync, no mouse usage, and mixed control prompts. It's a shame about the lack of graphics options because this game could go from nice looking to gorgeous with ease. Overall the mechanics,unique, well executed, and so much fun it is well worth the full price and a steal when on sale.
6182	1	a	A very good game compared to the price  Full of Dinosaurs, jetpacks, vehicles, skills and weapons stuffed in maps with future tech
2470	1	a	Broke my computer 10/10
746	0	a	still have,no mouse the only patch i can find is not in english so i cant play the game ,can anyone help please .
3669	1	a	Ever wanted to play as a dinosaur and eat people? Check! Ever wanted to kill dinosaurs? Check! Want to customize your weapon loadout and persk/abilities? Check! Want to face off against increasing odds against hordes of dinos? Check! Like faster action? Check! Like teamwork and teamplay? Check! Like driving tanks with your buddy as a gunner? Check! Like flying aircraft and decimating the field from above? Check! Enough reasons to like the game? Check! Check!  TL:DR Its a game that you can jump in to play 15 minutes or 4 hours. Its simple to learn, yet difficult to master. Offers the ability to customize to your play style. Annnnnnd it has Dinos!!   Super duper important facto: You can melee headshot a T-rex with a lightsaber. &lt;- Need I say more???
2446	1	a	This is absolutely THE BEST game you can EVER get for 50 cents.  IM NOT KIDDING, BUY IT
720	1	a	Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage. This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -&gt; do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use. As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the 'Overture' in the title. The art style is quite good though. In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.
6360	1	a	This game so far has honestly has been quite a good experience, however, note that this game does NOT have the best graphics ever but 7/10 on this game. I may edit this further through.
3064	1	a	If you like call of duty zombies than youll love this. its just like it but with dinosaurs instead
5561	0	a	the trailer makes it look gret but the graphics glitches and driving are terrible and theres not even single player missions or bot matches, i could get better free to play games. Im so disappointed i wasted my money.  3/10
2244	1	a	This is an awesome game lol, not everyday you can play an FPS game and shoot dinos! As for graphics, they are decent, reminds me of halo based layout. I bought the 4-pack on sale at 96% off for $3 lol it was worth it for sure to have 4 people play for just $3.   If you got friends who play and want to join in its worth the non sale price but if your alone might want to try and get some others to get it with you, much better with friends.
6412	1	a	I find this game fun. It is enjoyable for me because I have been waiting for a dinosaur game like this and I have finally found this game. It may not be everyone's game, but I personally enjoy it.
6561	1	a	heard a lot of hate originally, then the game came back out of no where awhile later, and now i cant stop playing!
1198	0	a	And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd 'supergrain'), the least you could do is to make sure that: - Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately - The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases) - Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beam  I like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.  It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.
6179	1	a	Very Underrated game.
2577	1	a	awesome game for its price. A lot of fun with friends
2384	1	a	  This is a good, fun game.
2185	1	a	Despite what many people have said, this is an incredibly fun game, especially to play with friends. Albeit, it isn't a huge AAA $60, and it wouldn't be worth too much money. But this is honestly one of the best gaming experiences ive had with my friends playing games. With up to 5 people in a game, and games that can last from 20 minutes to 3 hours, it is truly a fun and unqiue experience.  Try riding on the helicopter wings with a sniper while someone else drives. 10/10
3728	0	a	Where is Orion 2 
509	1	a	Pure action
6030	1	a	Turned On Game  Started Playing Looked Up  Got Chomped By A T-Rex   100/10 Would Recomend this Game
5293	0	a	Stupid and only fun for a short period of time.
2236	1	a	This game is amazing. Combination of Halo and dinosaurs I think. Super fun worth your money
172	1	a	fantastic action game, story is hard to follow tho
3168	1	a	$.99 for lightsabers and dinosaurs. 10/10
6102	0	a	I rate this game 2/5 Nearly Ok but it's actuallly bad.  Sure this game is cheap. Sure this game is fairly free. Yes the online community is friendly. The graphics are okay. But this game is also extremely repetitive and it lacks any great music or sound effects or anything to really keep me interested. You Hunt dinosaurs on alien planets with futuristic weaponry. The dinosaurs die (mostly) and wave after wave of them come at you. There are some other game modes but in my opinion they all lack challenge and are variations on an underlying theme of repetitive gameplay leading to boredom. This might be a lot more fun if you know someone else who is really into this game and wants to play it with you but I know no such person.
4838	1	a	Why can't I have a game in which I kill dinosaurs with â¥â¥â¥â¥ing LIGHTSABERS WITHOUT CONTROVERSY
563	1	a	Totally worth buying. While it is not the most sublime experience, this game is perfect for venting out frustration, and the story is actually quite good, with some fun mechanics involved. Also throwing people at helicopters and helicopters at people never gets old.
5911	1	a	this is a combo of star wars, halo and jurassic park all rolled in to one   what more could u want   definetly buy this 9.5/10  if u like to fight dinosaurs with friends and a combination star wars, halo and jurassic park this is the game for u definetly get it  and also i would defenetly recomend playing online or with friends to get full expiereance because the AI isnt very good
2125	1	a	this game is actually really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun
2383	1	a	Sup. The name's Vuki. I am a game reviewer for the time being to get some cash but after my mixtape drops, im set. I only play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and if you dont like it... well lets just say the big Vukster is comin for ya. Anyway... this is Vuki, im Out!
4859	0	a	  I'd rather get stabbed with a Jagdkommando tridagger than recieve this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ as a gift.
291	1	a	you should play this!
1658	0	a	I never enjoyed this game anyways because it always seemed choppy and unfinished. Now that there's controversy about the dev stealing assets (and trying to blame Activision for stealing THEIR assets) it just adds fuel to the fire. Bad game and bad devs.
2084	1	a	Good game with amazing graphics, i usually come back to this game a lot, really recommend because cheap. the bugs tho 8/10
3473	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The game looks nothing to the gameplay trailers i said well a waste of space. I dont recommend it
1574	1	a	This game is worth only with friends.
5961	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex to death. 10/10
2432	1	a	This is really fun o.o The art style is a little incoherent/has the looks of a mobile game sometimes but It... It's fun! Like the video quotes say, it's like halo with dino horde mode.  And for 99 cents? Get it!   
3507	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
5993	1	a	Fun game with friends and cool developers. 'Games can't fail only developers' The indie devs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about steam refunds could learn from these amazing developers.
3296	0	a	'If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything'. That about sums this game up for me.
4470	0	a	there is a reason this masterpiece is only a dollar.
577	1	a	Alot of people gripe about how this was a infamous wannabe, but its a good game in its own right. Get this game especially now with how cheap it is
2044	1	a	worth the money.
4625	0	a	I would like a refund this game â¥â¥â¥ af and not what i expected wathc gameplay before buying not worth 50 cents
1382	0	a	I bought this game as part of a bundle, a very bad bundle. this is the best game in the bundle but thats not saying much since the other three games in the bundle are abysmal. This is basically a cutesy casual platformer that gives you the gravity gun from HL2 but suffers from bad level design, an uninspiring barely existant story, no boss battles, and a few bugs. There are better platformer games out there to buy.
5431	1	a	It's Awesome Game
5005	1	a	I think this game has a lot of potential. It could really use a campaign mode and just a few touch-ups. One thing that really buggs me was when raptors get up in your face, your screen is just a blob of pixels. The firt-person view on this game also seems unnaturally close to the ground.. like my character is a midget or something. I don't have a whole lot of time invested into this game, but based on first impressions, overall, I think the game is really fun and I don't regret buying it (although I bought it when it was on sale for .99c, If I paid $14 for this, I would be very dissapointed). I keep reading comments about how buggy it is, and I didn't experience any. Then again, like I said before, I don't have much tiem invested into this game. I'll definitely give it another go soon though.
5084	1	a	This is such a great game for such a low price. I would pay more. Pros - like call of duty zombies except its dinosaurs - intense and immersive - I got it for 39 pence  Cons - Can be laggy - Controller is kinda needed in my opinion  A great game to gift to a friend
5418	1	a	If you have friends buy this game. If you dont have friends buy some. If you dont have money get a job. If you cant get a job rob somebody. if you cant rob somebody well you cant get this game :-/
622	1	a	It's a great game, but be warned:  -This game will likely run very slow (10 FPS) unless you know how to fix it. From what I've seen, different people have to use different fixes based on their system. I had to disable some HIDs and unplug my keyboard.  -This game is much more fun if you have a controller. Keyboard and mouse feels too clunky for this game.
4340	1	a	It sucks, but for a buck it's worth the buck.
3326	0	a	This Game even on sale is a real dissapointment, but because of the marketing strategies used by the dev's they make this game look like game of the decade so dont get suckered in and bight the bait. All and all there isnt much to enjoy playing this game even with friends because the whole game is as the title sais; you are killing hordes of dinos and nothing else ever sure there is fancy guns mechanics and vehicles but it doesnt take away the fact that its only killing A.I dino's. It would be the same thing if tetris threw in mechanics to send blocks backwards and get upgrades its still just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blocks
2520	1	a	Killed T-Rex with lighting sword 10/10 would kill again
4471	0	a	This game sucks. You're probably here because 'Hey it's a dinosaur shooting game! Let's try it', trust me I felt the same way too but when I started playing, it's not how it is in trailers and videos. It's really boring, weapons are really dull and the environment is bland. The dinosaurs sometime looks like they're floating and chasing after you. You know, i've tried the other dinosaur games like Dino D-Day and Primal Carnage and have both. They are much more worth than this! You're only gonna buy it if it's free or under a dollar, other than that don't get this.
2839	1	a	This is, im my opinion, the best game I have played, if I were to compare this game to any else, it would be impossible as it is the best experience you could possibly have. This game has never been beaten nor it will be beat in the coming generations as it has features that other games have not yet compared to.  ORION: Prelude is a wonderful and exciting game to play, it has graphics so good it could not be matched, personally whilst playing this masterpiece of a game, I felt like I was really experiencing the game IN REAL LIFE!!!  While playing with my many friends on this game, I have come to realise that the co-op/multiplayer is the best I have ever encountered!  Playing the new games in this generation seems to be too mainsteam and unrealistic but while playing this game with my buddies, the EXCITEMENT AND JOY can not be compared to other 'Boring and Laggy' Multiplayer games.  Overall I rate this Game 10/10, as features, connection to servers, co-op/multiplayer and fun you get out of this game could not be compared to other games in this generation.  ~Pingu~     
2934	1	a	ORION: Prelude is really simple. Just get your damned weapons and shoot the damned dinosaur. Recommended weapon would be rocket launcher. P.S. I don't remember much of this game.
5065	1	a	If Bungee made an 'A Land Before Time' game this would be it.
3519	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
970	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;

270	1	a	This game is a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and impossible gameplay 10/10
5218	1	a	Bought this game only because wanted to know what kind of a game can you purchase for 0,79 EUR. The first time I turned it on, I understood that you play what you pay for - outdated graphics, very simple physics, small maps which don't differ much from each other...  After a month gave it another chance. I must say, that even considering all the cons mentioned above, it still can be pretty fun. Not sure If I have been very lucky, but the community is good (At least in all of the servers I've played in).  Final verdict: The best fun I've had for 0.79 EUR!!!
6176	1	a	Great game 1000000/10
1442	1	a	worth it for 21 cents i sold the cards and got a booster pack so its basiically prphit from buying a game 
5446	1	a	Great game. I recommend a lot! At first its hard learning controls and how the game works. Once you figure that out it's a blast to play. 9/10
5423	1	a	love it must play
5367	1	a	I've only been able to play survival mode so far but have been having a blast doing so. It certainly requires team-work, especially in the final waves, to take down the hordes of bigger dinos before they smash your base.   Credit based weapons and augments are available between waves though in some cases getting back across the map in time can be difficult if you happen to be stuck on foot. There is also a teleport device available by pressing 5, but if you've burned it up and it's on cooldown, hopefully you are paired with other players that realize this and stop to pick you up in one of the multi-seat vehicles.   The amount of upgrades available really let you customize your class uniquely from other players. I played medic in all matches and each time was different. In one case I was able to get an augment that allowed me use of other class' weapons, very cool.  The controls were something I still fumbled over with at the end of the night (even after remapping keybinds). Keys 1-4 seemed to have no visible use for changing weapons, althought 4 does bring up high-cost weapons like turrets once purchased, and 5 brings up a teleport device to return you to base quickly (found completely by accident on my part). Scroll Wheel does little to help with weapon switching as it will only cycle your primary and secondary weapons. For the case of a medic, there is a 3rd healing gun which I had to bind to Mouse3 just to have fast access to it. Quick switch on Q had me repeatedly bombing my team with grenades. Out of habit from other FPS games, I've become accustomed to subconciously hitting this to go between primary and last used secondary which never included grenades. In this game however, grenades are looped in. I'd like to see them removed from the quick switch cycle. These are minor adjustments the devs can make if other players felt the same way I do.  Lastly, the AI of the infantry dinos (raptors) seems like it could use some work. They are way to easy to take down in packs as they come at you line up in a row with no signs of deviating when being shot at. It was effortless to rack up killing sprees and higher on them. There were also times entire packs of raptors would run right passed me with one of my teammates firing on them; not very raptor like. The larger dinos seemed to have more intelligence as they would knock me away from the group often and keep us divided by distances. I would see the T-Rex target snipers by hurling rocks, so I wondered if the devs spent some time tuning them with actual objectives.  Other than these minor encumbrances, this game is fun and I look forward to playing more.
1905	1	a	Halo style (and vehicles) + Open World levels + Dinosaurs + Killing Floor gameplay...  it's not perfect by any means, but for those who don't take things too seriously, it's a fun time killer with friends.
346	1	a	I think its a good game. But I think you get overpowerd sometimes. And the AI is not that good. I hope they fixed that in prototype 2. And when you have claws you can chop the to two I like that. Other then the AI pretty good game.
5637	1	a	It's a no brainer. I felt like playing a new shooter, I bought this for a dollar, it was fun for a few hours. Even if I never play it again, it's a dollar well spent.  Seriously, just get it. If you looked at it and were mildly interested, just get it.
3977	1	a	I played this game so much that it didnt even start.
2759	0	a	This game was 99 cents and I bought it for the laughs with a group of friends and we had laughs and never played it again.  It's got an unpolished UI with icons that look like they were made in paint. Gameplay just handles terribly (as do all the vehicles) and while it looks graphically fantastic it really isn't anything more than that.  The gameplay is boring and repetitive and you need to be playing in a squad to go anywhere.  I don't know why people are recommending this game (but as with most steam reviews, 90% are just bull and have no purpose to help you). But this game, it is honestly not even worth the time to check it out.   Don't waste your money on this even if it is 99 cents again, buy some other random indie game or some trading cards because at least you'll look at them more than you will ever play this game.  Gameplay: 3/10 Graphics: 7.5/10 Sound: 3.5/10 Overall: 4.6/10
6008	1	a	Saw this game for 49 cents and it looked fun so i had to get it. It is such a fun game to play with friends and has many different guns/maps/dinos/augments which make it awesome. Hands down best 49 cents I have ever spent :)
1352	1	a	FâUCK YOU
2280	1	a	Well, this was quite a bit of fun. Imagine Turok meets Halo and you've pretty much got this game.  Fantastic! I would highly recommend getting this game while it's on sale. In fact, I'd probably even recommend it if it weren't on sale. Just play this game!
1486	1	a	This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?  It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel.
4067	1	a	Hey, this is a really good game.
2848	1	a	A round based dinosaur survival which can be team based or solo. I would recommend this game as it is good quality and fun for the price tag.
4129	1	a	At time of writing this i only have 2.7 hrs of gameplay, but that was with my friends, i bought it for all of them and we had an awesome session. the graphics are good, the gameplay is daft but fun, and quite frankly unlike almost every other recent review, i dont care if some of the assets were stolen or not, it looks good, plays good!  Well done DEV, keep up the good work!  Try it, its cheap, in fact get the 4 pack, and have fun with your mates, you wont regret it!
2020	1	a	Fun game to play with friends.
6291	1	a	Now don't get me wrong, this game is awful, but hear me out! It's the kind of game you play with a few mates for a little while when you're really bored. And it's that alone that makes it worth a few pence on a sale.
4473	1	a	this is the best game if ever played 
1841	1	a	As a kid, I've always loved dinosaurs. I've wanted to live with them and love them. Thanks to this game, I now know that dinosaurs are a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pain in the â¥â¥â¥. And â¥â¥â¥â¥ having them as a pet, imagine the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ they take. Reuplsive, huh?  Well anyways, I love this game. It's very fun to kill dinos with random strangers and friends. No complaints really, just a fun survival dino thing :I
2067	1	a	It cured my cancer
72	0	a	well, back when competition was null and void, this used to be fun. Now, though, this is utterly outdated and painfully crappy. There is no nostalgia here. You do not need to see this collection. Kappla! Engage the â¥â¥â¥â¥ away from this. Do you think I talk too much? I don't think I talk too much. Instead, I just had a perfect bubble of nostalgia painfully punctured by this putrid piece of meh.
4016	1	a	cheap but verry good
5278	0	a	4/10 gets boring quickly i dont know how maybe the atmosphere of it. only get it if its on sale
1508	1	a	if(price &lt; 1.00 &amp;&amp; fun==true &amp;&amp; online==true &amp;&amp; payToWin==false){  wasteTimeWritingThisReview.stop();  while (true) {  playLikeABoss();  } } return null;
5316	1	a	This game is a mixture of Call of Duty:BO 2, with killfloor, Haloesque themes combined with Jarassic park! Somehow it works. I mean survival is fun the game modes are fun. Hey you could say it has a bit of battlefield. The neat thing with this game is they can combine all of the various shooter modes into different game modes and keep them there. Like counterstrike style or halo style etc. It's a pretty neat game for $1-3. It's probably a $40 value! All the great things are fairly obvious. Best thing 3rd person first person shooter.  Some things to add note (minor tweaks.) (all negatives.)  I wish each of the characters were male-female. The shop purely is aesthetics which is nice if say you wanted a skin. It's a dollar but steam want syou to use a 5. So sells ome stuff for the skins. Another problem is the pvp game modes like capture the flag sometimes are non-halo. I wish you could do one where it's just pvp with the counterstrike style (choose your weapon.) If the animations worked a little better, the game would be more fluid. There are some issues like the vehicles aren't that classy, and the dino's are seethrough if you phase through them.   The main two modes I really want is a pvp where I can choose. I love the free for all with the cryo sword. But they need to expand on the game modes. Make a slightly better UI when interacting to make games and bingo! It's a triple AAA title. The best thing about the game is the graphics scale! My computer can handle halo 1-2 graphics no problem! My friend had on the shaders and it ran fine as well in 400k Perfect! 1080P? maybe, but higher rez great!  Have a 64 person mode with vehicles. and dinosaurs in the mix. IDK!  This game is going to be the next COD! No joke. If they added a few AI trianing players with dinos running around and then had pvp. That creates the best game ever. Thus far there's no real point to leveling up. NONE! It's something that they probably are adding on in the future. 
6229	1	a	cool game
5445	1	a	Much Dinosaurs. T-Rex, Power Rangers.  Good Game, GG, No- RE, Cluth or Kick.
2145	1	a	Got in multiplayer game for the first time. Saw a pterodactyl flying sideways. Decided to shoot it. Pterodactyl kept on flying even after death. Flew off map.       10/10 would shoot a haunted pterodactyl again.
5634	1	a	I actually liked it and for the price of 1/5 kebab, why not?
2557	1	a	Bought 5 four packs for $15 and sold the game for a key each on TF2Outpost
5761	1	a	This is the first time I have ever changed a review from negative to positive. They did a lot updates to this game, it is still not the greatest but it quite a bit of fun, I highly recommend this game.
5233	1	a	This game is top. Buy it now
2279	1	a	In my opinion , in this game , we need to run very more. We have a huge map and the checkpoints can be to 2000 m , and when you don't find a vehicle you need to run , and this run can take more than 5 minutes ...  But it's a nice game.
4459	1	a	Running with a knife looks like you are the duck from the swiggity swooty gif. Double jump makes your screen glitch. Dying crashes your game Its like Halo if Halo was not fun and had dinosaurs.  Overall a fun time for the price, buy it now before price increases. 7.8/10 Too much rain animation on my visor.
279	1	a	This is a great game good story line, fun gameplay and awesome abilities. I only have a few complaints one that the soliders are stupid it was humorus and that the dialouge is EXTREMeLY QUIET even at full volume but other than that it's a great game and im suprised for all that the makers made in the game at the time. Now Prototype 2 may fix my complaints but playing the first game will most likely let you know    the villain in Prototype 2   better and feel more remorse for him. Anyways in all if you find interest in the game or idea im only saying it's a damn good game.

6261	1	a	Sure, it's buggy and glitchy at times, and it seems as if the devs are not going to complete or fix the game, but for $1 there is still a fun time to be had. The game has a few people on every once and a while, but this game shines best when you play with a friend. And even if you don't want it it's only a dollar what will it hurt it give it a try. You could always return it if you don't like it.

410	0	a	The game is a glitchy hunk of junk. Frankly you will be lucky if you can get it to work.
1369	0	a	ONE BIG ISSUE: Kind of wish I could recommend this game, cute, simple, light, but there's an issue, an issue that only hits me now. You see, I bought this game a while back, I had one monitor, the game worked fine, come back some time later with two monitors. if you have not caught on, the multi-monitor support is bad, the game stretches out the game across displays, I tried many things in effort to fix this, turn off second monitor, disconnect second monitor, restart computer, look around the files. Now with no luck and with the same results, I gave up and I can't recommend this game while this is an issue.
685	1	a	A bit of poker mixed with a turn-based RPG feel. Overall, very addictive!
3544	0	a	Even after the update and name change, it's still the same bad game as it's always been. Buy DIno D-Day and/or Primal Carnage instead. Both are much better dinosaur games. 
1500	1	a	Its like Cod Zombies without Zombies or Cod and theres Dinosaurs
4960	0	a	This is literally the worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ i played in a long time
4668	1	a	Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ i bought that game so give my back my MONEY!
5672	0	a	Silly, not my choice
3696	1	a	Such a truly terrible game. It's full of bugs, the sound is awful and it looks like a free HL2 mod.
5109	1	a	With very basic controls, and an all-to-familiar gameplay style, I still have to like this game. Very good price to pay for a fun FPS with dinosaurs thrown into the mix.
1111	1	a	Super Shooter Mario.  HL3 Confirmed.  10/10 would no gravity noscope360 again.
5609	1	a	its .99 cent. its multiplayer. theres guns. theres dinosaurs  
2187	1	a	So, just think of it like this. Christmas morning you open up a present to reveal it's BO2, so you excitedly pop it in your PS3. However, while it's disapointing, it's basically the zombie mode with CS-GO and Halo elements. Oh, and dinosaurs. While the graphics look pretty descent, it's doesn't feel like a complete game. There is no story mode to speak of, and too many stages are one of two things. A.) An uninspired rocky jungle level or B.) IT'S TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING WHERE AM I GOING level. There are a few mechanics that can be annoying as well. For example, a boss dinosaur can spawn at random depending on the round. But that's not to say how many and what type. What's worse is you have to track it down, and at night, where you can barely see anything, this is going to be a problem. And the icing on the cake no one wanted is the fact they can spawn even more dinosaurs! So if you can't kill it and it turns to night, you have to wait 'till it's morning, hope to God you got a good team, or get killed! Besides that everything is generic. Wow, cool robo-suits guys, it's not like I've seen them everywhere! A couple of stages are a nightmare to win too. Hell itself is a map, and you must fight the pumpkin king! And while this is a nice switch up from the norm, EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS BLACK AND RED DOWN THERE. I FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING IN SOME SUMMERTIME SADNESS. But teaming up with your buddies is a blast, and for only 99 cents this game is a blast. So, overall Orion is a blast for it's price, but don't expect a masterpiece.  Pros: A blast with friends +  A bargain for 99 cents +  Decent Graphics +  A couple of really fun guns and items. +  A good amount of levels.. +  Cons: ..But a lot of them feel the same. -  Nightime is the absolute worst in this game. -  The Boss dino respawn BS. -  Generic Design. -  FINAL VERDICT: 7/10 RECOMMEND: YES.   
106	1	a	I elbow dropped a tank in the tutorial. Best $5 I ever spent.
3597	1	a	}Double Kill }Triple Kill }Monster Kill }Uber Kill }' Bring me some pizza '... Â¿WTF?.   Would bring some pizza to a multi killer and get 360 no-scoped by a T-Rex rock again.
2905	1	a	Great game, my recommendations!!!!!!!!
722	1	a	Interesting twist on Poker with RPG elements
3041	1	a	the trex is loud so turn down your volume, actually everything is loud, but its a dumb game 9.1/10
6279	1	a	This game is fun, addicting, and cheap! GET IT RIGHT NOW
2475	1	a	The game feels raw and cheap all over, yet it can be fun with friends and in spite of all the flaws, YES I can recommend this game... for 99 cents.
1336	0	a	this game instantly reminds me of a low budget, robot mario kind of game. You get what you expect for the price you pay.
1458	1	a	Fun to mess around in. It has a nice overworld and fun gameplay with nice-looking levels.
1823	1	a	Pushed a T-Rex off a cliff 10/10
296	0	a	Rubbish Game engine  need tune my sound card quality to 24bit 48khz! WTF
802	1	a	The edgier version of Shank 1. The gameplay got some upgrade that is both good and bad (why would you leave out block just to give me more dodging moves when Shank 1 gave me both) and most of the game is just you killing people for no real reason so no good story that goes well with the gameplay this time around. This time the Co-op action was moved to a new mode called survival; in survival you'll have to kill whatever comes at you for 30 waves and thats all, no Co-op story mode this time. Shank 2 is an okay beat em up that loses points when compared to Shank 1 but works more than fine if you look it as a standalone game, get it if you want some mashy mashy gorey edgey action
5866	1	a	it's a fun game for a great price 
2434	1	a	I used to hate dis game. Now I liek dis gaem. I'd buy that for a dollar.
2706	1	a	Good! Best played with friends or randoms. When playing co-op or multiplay, there are like hardly any Australian servers to jump on that are free; they are either full or there is none. So you need to make up your own listen or dedicated server(or get one of your mates to do it) if you wanna play with people. And the servers overseas, yeah unless you like playing with 400+ ping, don't bother....  Otherwise fun game, to me it feels like a cross between KF and Halo, except instead of killing zombies or aliens, it's dinosaurs!
3078	1	a	This game is just wicked. Dinos and overpowerd wepons! Massive levels. Meca robots that you control. Tanks!  Just buy this game. Its so cheep and a good laugh with mates 
630	1	a	'I am something less than human, but also something more''............. I told one of friends to refer me some different type games, then he referred me Prototype. Then I google it and read the storyline of this game. After reading all articles I searched the game in steam store, watched the trailer and other videos. I decided to purchase this game. I played all the levels and events in the game and fully satisfied with this game. I also recommend this game.
6390	0	a	1 hour of my life I will never get back! Thanks Mr Majestic!
1209	1	a	Pretty good
762	0	a	A Stroke of Fate: Operation Valkyrie is a typical point-and-click adventure containing dry, emotionless, and uninspiring voice actors. They really should have done the game in German with English subtitles or at least cast actors with German accents. But even then, when you supply actors with no personality, it wouldn't have mattered much.  The story takes place after the failed attempt of the original Operation Valkyrie and you play the role of an SS Officer with a secret desire to carry on the mission. Many of the clickable objects provide a mini 1940s German history lesson. It's slightly interesting, but the storytelling is pretty bland making this a boring experience overall.
1020	0	a	I Demoed this on console and it was was fun, but this pc version a terrible port. Origin account making and constantly logging in is terrible, game constantly crashed, never got to play this download.
6443	1	a	DUDE! this is freaking epic! i will keep this at the top of my play list! fun for the whole family to boot! i give this a bannana out of blue. 10,000,054%
3102	1	a	More stolen content than a reaction channel. Unlike reaction channels tho, its actually enjoyable.
4991	0	a	In 2015 you released one of the worst games of world...  10/10 i didnt enjoyed or i just dont like that style games.
1304	0	a	  Although cheap at the price of $1.00, this game gives very little even for the small price tag. The game has nothing to offer, it's bland and holds no real cards, and if it does it doesn't play them when it should (I.E to grab my intrest). It's 'My first game' should go on newgrounds not on steam. Don't buy, not worth your time.
2666	1	a	Laggy, Buggy and 99 cents, yet its still one of the most fun games I've ever played.
4755	1	a	The graphics for this game are amazing. On the highest settings you can see the detail put into the maps. The AI in the game is pretty well done, there are only a few times where a dinosaur will get stuck in a wall or rock. guns are fun although the sighs are all the same so hip fire is the best option. overal a really good and fun game.
1527	0	a	  It's A Trap!
4392	0	a	the music is really laggy aswell as gameplay
2967	1	a	I played with a latency of 950, but still killed some dinos 10/10
5914	1	a	I saw this game and said, well it costs less than a dollar, let's try. Spent couple of hours playing and it's awesome, it has some glitches but doesen't matter. It's really fun to play especially some friends to play with.  Give it a shoot, it's just a dollar. (And you can knife T-Rex or roadkill raptors as well)
4241	0	a	Very very bad game...
6457	1	a	This has no story mode, but it doesn't need to. DINASAURS! and I got it for 99 cents
4823	0	a	yeah, bought a full game several years ago and now i have a f2p moneygrab game instead that doesn't even show up in my libary anymore! i call this a huge scam and a facekick for everyone who ever spent their money on that game!!! i demand a compensation other than some ingame crap i can't even access for this -.-'
847	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10
6106	1	a	This game is Superb! 10/11
4433	1	a	Maybe its not so bad if you turn all your graphics to low so you can't see the garbage you're playing.
411	1	a	reminds me of ultimate spiderman, where you play as Venom, but better! if you like blowing things up and mass distruction.... this game is for you.
4998	1	a	I would be more harsh on the game if it wasnt so cheap. This game gets old in 30 mins. feels like a N64 game and looks like one too. Poorly optimized. The list could go on but for under a buck and you are looking for a mediocre shooter that will give you an extremely short burst of entertainment look no further.
3666	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
4899	0	a	I would rather eat a dollar bill than use one to purchase this game. The name of the game may change but the development time might as well been put elsewhere, and even for a dollar there are better games out there that will allow you to keep your friends and your dignity. My love for dinosaurs is officially as dead as they are.  Overall 9/10 some of the art is 'kay.  EDIT: The two friends I played this with are now lovers and refuse to speak to me.
4247	1	a	I recommend it for kids.

6002	1	a	For 0,79â¬ you'll have a good game with dinosaurs, robots and lightsaber, what do you want more? 7/10
5198	1	a	My friend said it was a bad game......but it's alright if you have friends to play with
4601	0	a	Sucks, runs horibly with terrible graphics and glitches. It looks good on the trailer but not in real life. Maybe its just my computer idk.
653	1	a	I've always liked Poker, but this game I like especially well.  The things it adds to the 'combat' like spells and combo chains is really interesting. The RPG elements, quests, and story added on make it pretty interesting as well.  I got it for $3 and it's definitely worth that, and certainly worth at least $10 as well but I'd still say you should get it on sale.  Great game overall, I recommend it.
1102	1	a	Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it!
2299	1	a	I bought this game when it was ridiculously discounted (I paid $.94). Me and a couple of friends tried it out later that night and we were having so much fun poppin' a cap in a T-rex's â¥â¥â¥. Not perfect, but great for playing with friends. Oh, and there's an achievement for getting eaten by the T-rex called 'Man on the Toilet'. If you don't get this reference you have live a sad, unfulfilled life.
857	1	a	good game, had a lot of fun smashing things and destroying people
4207	1	a	No Screenshots, no Let's play video are going to tell you how fun it's this game, you really need to play it to discover it, I had been playing this game since Dino Beatdown, which really was the version I enjoyed the most, yes this game was nerft and yes this game has some bugs but nothing that stop you from playing it.
2621	1	a	They turned this from one of the worst games of all time to a pretty decent game. That is some dev willpower.
3580	1	a	I want to be the very best, Like no one ever was. To kill them is my real test, To end them is my cause.  I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Dino Horde to understand The power that's inside  Dino HORDE!!!, (gotta kill them all) its you and me I know its my destiny Dino Horde, oh, you're my best friend In a world we must defend  Dino Horde, (gotta kill them all) a heart so true Our courage will pull us through You teach me and I'll teach you Di-No-Horde, gotta kill 'em all 
5934	1	a	This is the greatest of all time. I played a little bit of Dino Beat Down and knew that it could grow into something amazing, and it has. If you play with friends you can play for hours on end, enjoying every second of it. It is a unique game and although it has a few minor bugs and glitches, they are not at all game breaking or even noticeable by the average gamer. I recommend this game not only because it is an amazing, fun, addicting game, but also because it is only $1.00. Like, seriously, it is $1.00, just try it.
1301	0	a	Can't play because the game loads in a resolution too big to play or even see more than 1/4 of the game, changing screen resolution does nothing  0/10 would not buy again
35	1	a	Space Quest was the very first PC game I ever played. I was addicted the moment I got it for Christmas way back in the 80s. Since then I was a huge adventure game fanatic and the Space Quest series were awesome. They had humor, fun puzzles, and good eye candy for the time. I have a lot of great memories spending all day at the computer playing the Space Quest series.
1322	0	a	how to get past the story? it wont let me click anything.
3890	1	a	Finally I just started playing this game after the 1.3 update.   It sat on my library for almost a year, you know, it was $1, why wouldn't I buy a 1 buck 3D relatively decent graphics game that was accepted by more than a 50% of it's owners?  Well, to me, this game actually deserves a try, and definitely, it is worth the $1 I paid for it, would pay 2 or 3 times that price.  It pretty simple (learnt how to play it in 1 hour), it's fun to play, 3 classes, many weapons to choose from, many upgrades, good graphics, nice maps, good Dino's AI, good multiplayer system, and the best part, you do this all in a relatively short period of time. There is a game mode where you play 5 matches in 35 minutes or less, by then you already upgraded all your skills, bought the best weapons, and killed 150 dinos... =D  You can think of this title, like the best mobile 3D FPS with Dinos game you have ever seen, but running at 1080p on your PC screen, with a mouse and keyboard attached to it.
4535	0	a	Terrible game. You know it's kind of red flag-ish when it's one dollar, so you should stop there, but if you're like me and get this game, you'll see what I mean. Introduced immediately with really shoddy-looking menus, and overall terrible interface, you see microtransactions everywhere so you can level up too. Then, once finally joining a decent game that doesn't kick you out after the first minute, you just see really, really, really ugly gameplay that's like a bad version of Killing Floor, but even worse. It's an open map with waves of dinosaurs that progressively get harder after waves where you get better too, but the dinosaurs just have a weird way of fighting that's so awkward and clunky it isn't fun. I could rant on for hours about how lacking this game is, but I think this summarizes it. Verdict: Awful game and should be never played by anyone.
11	1	a	I loved these games when I was a kid. Loved them. My father and I would play them for hours.  I have never seen anywhere near as convincing an example of how much patience we have lost as a society in the intervening twenty-odd years, because holy crap are these downright unplayable now. These are some of the most obnoxiously, unnecessarily obtusely-made deathtraps in gaming history.  I died because I stood in front of a knee-height rock. I died because the game didn't interpret me hitting the left arrow. I died because there is a screen in the early game where there is a 50% chance you will simply unavoidably die and there is nothing you can do about it.  I have no idea why I kept playing video games. I have no idea why this was fun. I have no idea how I sleep at night, or indeed how I have ever.
4271	1	a	That's a good game but it need more improvements like  1. There should be different character models like : a) Male b) Female in all classes  2. Dinos must have slam system so players can't avoid them by going on rocks
1278	0	a	why is this game even exist? 
5544	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with a shiny purple bow . 11/10
4677	0	a	dont buy this game evn if its for 1 dollar this game lags everytime. THE WORST GAME OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2115	1	a	I swear I thought my friends were messing with me when they told me to buy this game, but I never regret the moment when I bought this. Since I was so forced to get this game, I needed it ASAP. I couldn't sell any skins on the market because I met my max, so I gave the skin to my friend and he gifted me the game because he could sell it. He then continued to give me a note with the gift. So poetic that I first thought he copied and pasted it off a Shakespeare sonnet. The message read:   Dear Zaque,  Please kill yourself, drink bleach, overdose, etc.   XOXOXO  -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥    This stunned me because he has never written something so poetic in our english classes. I then downloaded the game after multiple thoughts of suicide and right when I opened the game, I knew I made a great decision. Orion Prelude was written next to multiple dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes that I wish I knew wtf they were. Should've payed more attention in the third grade. I then changed all the settings to be fully optimized to run on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the PC I have. I was then invited by my friends and a few other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play some co-op. I joined the game and a stegosaurus had one of its multiple stages of her menstual cycle on me. I had no clue what to do, I was lost, just like in real life, So I knew I was screwed. I instantly panicked and I ended up getting puked on by a so called 'Spitter'. This mothaâ¥â¥â¥â¥a's puke looked like it drank 3 gallons of AMP before this battle. Puked like it just had its night out on Las Dino. I learned some of the mechanics of the game, and got the hang of it, but I pressed one button that ruined my dignity, V. I pressed V and I was introduced by a melee that looked like my guy was a 9 year old child trying to kill a butterfly. You're telling me they are trained to fight dinosaurs and robot santas, but yet swing like Ronda Rousey. Jesus H christ. Besides the hideous so called 'melee' animation was horrific, there wasn't too much else. Other than me getting stuck in a rock for 10 hours while my buddies kicked some prehistoric â¥â¥â¥. I got stuck in a rock because a wolf gave me a bruce lee kick to the back and sent me off a mountain into a pile of rocks. Also of course, I was a support or medic so I couldn't jetpack myself out. I sat there for a good hour taking a roast session. My friends called me a poon and said I should kill myself. BUT, this game is actually very nice for the money. This game passes time easily and is super addicting with friends. Graphics are very similar to Borderlands, and I like it.
5646	1	a	Complete MADNESS. Instant ACTION. Fixin GENERATOR,for some REASON. No really,why im fixin it?
6109	1	a	This game is one of the best FPS's i've played in awhile. Lots of destruction and mayhem and lots of cool weapons and vehicles. It's a lot of fun and it can keep you entertained for hours.
2219	1	a	Don't let the metascore fool you. It may not be a very well-known game but I absolutely love this game for its bare qualities. A shooter that mixes marines, futuristic guns with dinosaurs? Jetpacks, medi-guns, stealthing, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in' weapons? Not to mention some pretty fun vehicles. I got this game for a dollar on the Steam sale. I would happily had paid the full 15 dollars since I have over 30 hours so far on this game.  Great to play solo, with strangers, and DEFINITELY with friends! Create your own lobby easily and play with friends. If only I had friends.  Each game you earn credits for kills and you spend said credits on weapons and perks for the current game. You also earn experience as you play with the classes and you earn passive perks (and can even unlock weapons to start out with instead of just a boring pistol) or unlock perks that you normally would buy. Saves you some credits.  More people need to buy this game and give Orion a GOOD name. I know Orion: Dino Beatdown had a sullied name for what the developers did and the bad metascore, but since its release it has been updated lots and is now a very fun game! And in NO WAY are any of the additional fees required. If you WANT new armors or a new blade color, go ahead and spend 5 or 10 extra dollars. I spent an extra 10 and bought a new blade color, TWO new armor colors (applies to your weapon too) AND a taunt pack for only 5 dollars.
186	1	a	I bought this game on the Halloween sale, not really knowing what to think about it. But as I launched the game I had no idea of the fun I was about to have. The characters are crap, the story is boring, but that doesn't matter. You know why? Because this game is fun!!! I can't think of any other game where you can surf a person,
36	0	a	Very buggy - All of these games freeze when you die and try to restore, rather than having to start over. Space quest 6 crashes during initial load-up. Loved this game as a kid, but this release of it is super disapointing, its barely playable.
6463	1	a	game was fun when it would play. could not play any conquest games and my computer is almost double the requirements the game recommends.
5	1	a	King's Quest VI is where it's at, son.
4942	1	a	If you're wondering whether you should buy it or not - it's pretty funny shooter, definitely worth it's price, especially on sale. But the real reason I'm writing this review - maps sucks, they are awful.
4175	1	a	this game suck balls
4956	0	a	stop stealing assets and pay ur damn employes. is this is what u call a finished product? the culling is more finished then this and thats in early development right now. take this game off the store and give refunds. the multiplayer is dead anyway so i cant play this.
131	1	a	This game is statisfying to play.  I'm a major fan of the inFAMOUS series, but you could never unleash that absolute, unbridled destruction that everyone always wanted.  In Prototype, you can.  As Alex Mercer, you have the abilities of a god: fly, scale buildings, jump accross city blocks, disguise yourself or turn into a human tank.  Or you could walk around as a civillian, doing minimal damage. Whatever you feel like.    Prototype's strong points are:  Gameplay, good controls, challenging combat.   Prototype's weak points are:  Convoluted story
2234	1	a	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Seriously it's $1. I dare you to have more fun for a dollar.
3083	0	a	Oh what to say...   This game was dropped unto steam as an early access before that term even existed. There was a few spare updates to the game after launch and then nothing happened. None of the promises that were made about the game on launch ever happened. A poor lackluster game from a poor lackluster dev.    But wait, there's more...    In an effort to avoid the absolutely terrible scores the game got, it was renamed and relaunched on Steam at full price. Twice. Apart from being borderline illegal, it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ move that usually only EA reserves themselves to.    But wait, there's more...    People weren't as dumb as expected. They complained about it on the game's Steam forum. Then they got banned from said forums, actively, by the dev trying to cover up that the exact same game with a new name was in fact, a new game. Which it wasn't.    But wait, there's more, apparently...    So this game got released twice under the pretention of being something new while in fact nothing has happened since a couple of weeks after launch in 2012, THREE YEARS AGO. And now there's a 'new' game up on kickstarter. Apart from the game itself being in a sorry decrepit state, the developer is one of the worst and greediest people I've ever had the bad fortune of encountering.   The game currently costs less than an icecream. Is it worth it then? Well, depends on wether or not you want to finance a person who treats people like livestock with wallets. (Buy an icecream instead.)
4925	1	a	ayy why you bustin' my balls uh? I'm walking 'ere
3454	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
3422	1	a	best 1 dollar purchase ever
1764	1	a	Pretty much freaked! This game was so Awesome! SO FREAKIN' AWESOME! I love it, but you should make it faster (mean that this game would work on an i3 laptop like mine :) actually it is working but not in a high res) So hope you fixed this!  Anyway, still, you guys are a good developer! I liked the way you survived through bad comments! I always support y'all!
1308	1	a	Cheap game, trading cards, pretty fun. Reccomended!
767	1	a	Gatling gears is an oldie. but goldie. i have to be honest they just dont make games this good anymore. you remember the days when there was a big buzz about games. and massive interest not just by gamers but by the guys making the games. and the way they was describes in demo mags. they use to love showing off what they done. showing you how much better there games had got and giving you demos etc so you could see for yourself how good it was. those days was golden. its just not the same anymore.   i definatley recommend this game. its an arcade shooter platformy type. you run around in what they called a walker back then. and you can modify it build it up improve it get better weapons and even change the way the walker looks.  its just one of those games that got a lot of love and attension. and its so easy to see. as soon as you pick up the controller the movements feel great, everything is very well put together. its also a really nice looking game. with nice lighting and shadows and sun glare. black smoke effects that look great. nice explosiojns. and so much more to enjoy.   i promise you this is a game you wont regret buying and its so good value now. a must buy ive loved this game for years. its kinda special. and big.
749	0	a	Uhhhhh...yeah...  Great price but I could only play it for 5min. The voiceovers of the characters is pretty dry and non-interesting. Didn't catch my attention so I'm deleting it from my computer.
4276	1	a	Ma turf foo' dino

5313	1	a	This game is definitely still in beta. Some server functions don't work, and there's still a fair amount of glitches. All that aside, this is one of the most fun games I've ever played. If you're looking for a team-based shooter with a fairly fast pace, this game is for you.
2585	1	a	One of the sleeper hits of 2012!
4185	1	a	I WANT IT
4283	1	a	Pros:  - References to Jurasic Park - Cool weapons - Interesting Objectives  Cons: - boring sound and ambient, not inmersive at all. - it seems it get stuck in some development state, alpha maybe? - Achievement 'Manly Man' (boys club) - the same dinosaurs that we've seen in other games, over and over again.  It's a cool game in alpha release, if that's the case. Recomended for boys 
998	1	a	Fun little title. IMO it's somewhat underrated.
5107	1	a	This game is pretty awesome, I love it.
1556	1	a	+ Environmental visuals were very well presented + Maps are extremely large, and you'll find yourself traversing them on your way to capture objectives + You get to shoot dinosaurs in the face; I really cannot stress enough how ridiculous and awesome this concept is + Weapon selection is not extensive, but the developers did a good job making sure that EVERY weapon is fun to use + Weapons also felt balanced, in that there weren't one or two that seemed to stand out as the best; if you rely on skill in this game, you'll be able to get away with using pistols and a knife and that's it + You can play a game mode that makes you a dinosaur + Very fun and numerous character customization options that further serve to show you this game does not take itself seriously + Vehicles were very fun to use, and had a contorl scheme reminiscient of the Halo franchise + Still frequently updated; you can tell that the developers just adore their own game  - Sound effects for the weapons were disappointing - The maps can be TOO big, turning a trip to capture an objective into a walking simulator - Needs more game modes; it has multiple game modes, currently, but they're all variations of a wave shooter
1976	1	a	nice mashup of a lot of familiar weapons. Good coop
4442	0	a	This is ark 26 euros cheaper  NAH LOL KAPPAPRIDE1234 GOT YOU FOR A SEC
3435	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
1743	1	a	This is an amazing game, no doubt about it. I don't know what has happened with the metacritic score, but this game has been judged misleadingly, and unfairly.
4379	1	a	some may say that killing dinosaurs with lasers and rockets isnt fun, these people are missing out on something really cool. you can shoot them alone or knife them with friends, build up strategies or just leeroy jenkins straight through with only a knife. all in one, its a good game and i picked it up for 1 buck, look out for sales dudes ;)
6028	1	a	I'll admit i did buy this game for a dollar, but damn that was a well spent dollar. A wonderful platform to fight TREXs with a lightsaber probably wont hold your attention for long but definatley fun pick it up on sale.
31	1	a	I have been waiting for steam to fix the issues with this collection and bring it back up for sale. It works like a charm!I have windows 7, so I am able to play KQVII, which was my biggest reason for purchase.  If you have never played the series before and you like the point &amp; click genre of games, I highly recommend these! They are puzzle-filled fun and have some hilarious voice-acting to go along with them (well, IV-VII does). NOTE: Be sure to read the requirements on the page as not all the games work with all new operating systems.  Overall it's still tons of fun to play. 10/10 would rescue Etheria again.
1380	1	a	Really FUN!!!!!!!! I recomend it to everyone! 
1204	1	a	I spent the first 10 minutes in mode A flying around the universe wondering what the BEEP am I doing wrong. Once I figured it out I got to the platform side of things where I found it very enjoyable. I am not big on platform games but this one I could make an exception for. This is like a little hidden gem that everyone should try at least once and for the lovely price of 19 cents, how can you pass it up.
1057	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
1516	1	a	i got my 99 cents of fun from this game, better then buying a soda.   9/10  
6322	1	a	Dinosaurs, lightsabers, and pvp. What else could you want in a game? (Semi-OpenWorld) 10/10
6397	0	a	Barely worth one dollar. If you can afford the computer required to run this, you can afford a better game then this. Reminded me of a horribly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ knock-off of halo: combat evolved mixed with dinosaurs. Most of the dinosaur models look like inflatable pool toys and the games motion blur hardley obscures the plastic looking models. Deresolution is so bad that my teammates look like the character from pitfall at 100 yards.  2/10  I would have said buy this if you've got no games on your steam account but TF2 is free-to-play now.  On a side note: HOW DARE THEY USE THE QUAKE KILL STREAKS.
5348	1	a	You can be a dinosaur buy it
3721	1	a	Fun. Horde. Survival. Simple. Exciting. The graphics aren't amazing but it's 99 cents. GG. 7/10
6139	1	a	You can play as a tiny dino with tnt strapped to its back and detonate it on will 54/10 would compy suicide bomb again
2373	1	a	I paid a dollar for 7 hours of killing T-rexs with a lightsaber. 10/10
303	0	a	if I press the mouse the whole game just closes
1416	1	a	I like the game alot, it's fun to play. And it's always a time killer. This is the kind of game that you play when you're bored or when you are live streaming and you're not in for any serious action games.
5350	1	a	are you serious? GET THIS GAME! 10/10 kill dinosaurs
3123	1	a	Wonderful game, worth every penny. Got a 4-pack of it too play with friends and after logging 33 hours on record I can say that I will continue to play this game. There is just something about killing hoards of dinosaurs that just feels so relaxing. I saw it go free for a while, didn't care I had payed for it. This game is a game worth playing!
5831	1	a	Very very good game. The dev team is putting so much work to this game, you should be happy its about a dollar.If you dont apriciate the dev's job your life is a misery. Really worth 1 dollar. I rate it 10/10
4913	0	a	this game is as homosexual as i am. not homosexual. it's still bad.
2943	1	a	play at free week. I think it is well worth playing.   some may call it junk, says the textures are outdate or something ,but I do have some fun from it.  The game play is simple and easy, the open world environment , the foes,the gameplay remind me of the game --Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon, which few people know about ,but I think they are quite alike .  Lower you expectation. Buy it if you like to enjoy simple fun game , and you would have more fun from onlineplay. Good to see that the dev team is still updating the game ,adding some new map and feature.  I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
138	1	a	This is just straight up a dark, tall can of kickass awesomeness. I wish I wasn't played out of it, but there's only so many times you can replay a game. Actually excellent story, well above average for todays market, its very enjoyable. The gameplay is also very fun, I played it originally with mouse and keyboard and its very very solid despite being a port I believe. If you enjoy good gameplay and a good story to go with it, this isn't a bad place to be at all.
5773	1	a	By no means is ORION: Prelude the best game you will ever play. However, if you're looking for a fun way to kill a few hours here or there with a group of friends, its hard to find games that fill that gap so well. For $0.99 this game is more then worth while, its a ton of fun to just sit through its horde mode and kill wave after wave of dinos with a few friends and just enjoy it.
2074	1	a	I think it's a fun game. Most of the problems with this were upon release and not long after but now it seems there is not much wrong with it. I've played 12hrs so far and recommend this for people who's ears tingle at the idea of using jet-packs whilst killing dinosaurs or stomping 'round nomming on humans as a dinosaur.  The early reviews of this are now oudated as this has gone through a few years of updates and adding content. I feel that people should re-consider their bad reviews at it's release. I see this as a cheaper alternative of primal carnage (and could be cheaper). It's generally a fun game but people just seem to over-anylize and focus on the bad which is a terrible shame. I hope to see more games like this (without the controversy would be nice).
2464	1	a	Yanno... I didn't have any expectations to be blown, but, ended up quite pleased and rather surprised with this game. Excelente time waster, very fun to play, good dynamic, and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of different game modes to last quite a while. If you didn't grab it yet, do it. Filthy cheap for the no attachments fun provided.
246	1	a	Reminds me of Parasyte.
2648	1	a	Great Dinosaur First persopn shooter and really Action packed Teamwork is really important and has a variety of weapons , 
5892	0	a	Right,,,  So I got this game during the free weekend, and played it for a little bit, and was lucky enough to get a free key of it by the end of that weekend, I would load it up when I was bored, and would just play for a little bit. And now, after 6 hours of this game, I can safely say that it was terrible.  The game is a mess, even after all the updates. For starters, graphics customization does almost nothing to fix the frame rate, which went from pretty good to PowerPoint levels of slow by the end of a game. The AI is just awful, the Pterodactyls in particular being a major pain in the *** (imagine trying to hit something flying through the air with a PowerPoint frame rate). The game is just littered with technical issues, many of which render it unplayable. I can't think of a single time I quit that wasn't due to some technical issue.  However, I still liked parts of it. Its a good concept, just terrible delivery. The developers know this, and dropped the price down to just a dollar. Even then, it goes on sale all the time. So, to wrap up this crappy review for a crappy game, buy it if you want to, but don't expect much
3623	0	a	Quite frankly, this game is awful. Simply put, it's bland, boring, and the videos make it look like a completely different game. I bought this while it was 99 cents, and you shouldn't.
2897	1	a	Great game so far!
4545	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, dont buy!!
3490	1	a	for a one dollar game, this is really fun and has pretty good graphics it may not be perfect but its really cheap and i would pick it up if you like kiling dinosars or like jarasik pakr 
6254	1	a	This game is neat, at first you may be a little opposed to playing it... keep playing for a while check out the weapons and powerups plus the vehicles. Neat game!
4116	0	a	Yellow its me    So pretty much this game is so bad its good. I had wanted to purchase it before when it wasnt f2p but when it came out i was psyched. I played this for 40 mins and had to stop because it couldnt connect to server. Its addicting in a weird type of way. Its pretty good besides the fact that it lags when i have an i7 and nvidia gtx 960 so yeah...        bai      r8 5/8
1427	1	a	Thanks for the 96% off sale! :D &lt;3
5868	1	a	I played this game for like 2 games and it blew my mind. I really recommend it for anyone who loves sci-fi and shooters.
2678	1	a	Honestly,  One of the best experiences I've had with a game. Heres why...  1. The game mechanics are superb 2. Teamplay is excellent and fun 3. The game never lags  4. Graphics are second to none 5. Massive online community 6. Frame rates NEVER drop  All I can say is enjoy.
3563	0	a	Horrible graphics Laggy for no reason â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ maps Full up cancer Randomly getting kicked from matches They worked on this game for 3 years and its still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.  
4063	1	a	It's really fun with friends, but pretty boring alone. Lots of stuff you have to pay for but overall great game for $1.
6545	1	a	No idea how the game earlier was, but I played with a friend the demo and was blown away. We are now 4 and all bought it and play it and it's amazing!!! You need to play in a team to win. It's fast, simple, needs strategy... It's a blast. And I'm very very picky with games. Would buy again even for 30.- Euro plus. Everything lower is just a steal.
1738	1	a	SO I WAS RUNNIN ROUND WITH A 3 ROUND BURST LMG...WTF RIGHT....ANYWAY IM SHOOTING A TRICERETOPS IN THE FACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IM FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY WITH A BIRD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN I FALL DOWN TO THE GROUND AND A COMPY KILLS ME. SO I UNINSTALLED. WOULD RECOMMEND THOUGH.
14	1	a	Works like a dream on my Window's XP &lt;3  Window's 7 however it is completely useless.  But seeing as it works good on my main computer, I will have to say I am very satisfied with this :3
2663	1	a	Once I bought the game I was like the game will probably be OK but after playing with some friends for a few hours. This game should NOT be 1 buck it should be at least 30. The devs pretty much made this a give away from a really good game. It reminds me a lot of Black OPs Zombies only you got Dinosaurs, jetpacks, Invisibility , Tons of maps, cool skins and customization options, and some other cool features. To be honest only thing this game needed was a story mode. Other than that, great job Spiral Game Studios!! Keep up the good work you've got a fan now!
3085	1	a	Fair.  Fair price = Fair content.  Why low content? well you do the same thing all over and over and over again. It gets boring quick, i see no character progression (jump in the game, buy stuff in that game, rinse and repeat). AI will charge the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you, well as long as you're out reach you're fine. But hey! you get to crack dino skulls for a fair price.  I had fun especially when you knife a freakin T-rex and it goes down. This is a lot more fun with friends, but I have none(sobs a little). Kidding aside This is a lot more fun with friends that're into dino skull bashing. However I do not see the game as a daily staple rather an appetizer from time to time.
3221	0	a	
4333	1	a	A lot of people â¥â¥â¥â¥ on this game. A lot of critics apparently too; that metascore is the lowest I've seen.  Graphics wise it's nothing special, but nothing worth complaining about either. It looks like an unreal engine title from about 2008.  Which it is.  It needs an ingame tutorial. The level system, just like in EVERY shooter that has EVER had a level system or XP, is out of place and in the way.  The animations are a bit wonky and even the big dinos, if you get them one on one their AI is rather lacking. The game has a bunch of bugs. The difficulty curve is a bit too steep- you may find yourself at a point where your current difficulty level is no longer any challenge, but the next one up is nearly impossible.  That said, none of this got in the way of enjoying the game for me, because this game has the great advantage of being one of the extremely limited number of titles in which a person can utter the phrase 'I just shot a T-Rex in the face with a tank cannon' in earnest. If you like cooperative shooters, get this. If you want a PVP experience, this game has pvp modes but they are NOT a focus of the game. Perhaps its novelty will wear off faster than a more polished game like killing floor, but I still reccomend it.
598	1	a	It's kinda stress-relieving if tearing people apart is your natural high.
1113	1	a	A gorgeous little game where you play as a jumping and flying little WALE*E robot. I played it for about an hour, but then I fell asleep. In that hour, I had loads of fun playing this cute game. I highly reccomend this if you have a rough internet connection, or none at all, as it can keep you occupied for hours on end.   Things I don't like: *The 'rogue' robots, they die too quickly. *The unlimited ammo on you and the 'rogue' robots, it just gets a little unbalanced. *The death screen, It could be a little less 'horrifying', instead of the 'YOU ARE DEAD :(' It could instead be replaced with a soft depressing jingle, along with a little less dramatic or terrible death screen.  7/10
3911	1	a	i have bougt 8 games and given to my friendÂ´s and all all of them liked it super good game!!
2298	1	a	Amazing game. We must to work together for battle the Dino (y). I love it !
2151	1	a	-T-REX does flips -Best Graphics I have ever seen Fun for the whole family! 11/10 IGN 
915	1	a	Super fun brawler. Lots of really gratifying combos and button mashing. Combat is simple, but complex enough to keep it interesting throughout. Campaign is only about 3.5 hrs. Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing. The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!
4278	1	a	For years (er, 2001 actually); the only game I played was Halo: Combat Evolved..  If you liked/loved Halo, you owe it to yourself to try this game..  It costs a dollar dammit- buy it just for the hell of it.
1298	1	a	I left it running by accident.
3739	0	a	The first borderlands has better graphics. This game is a little fun when it works but, it doesn't work very often. This game is s**t, even for .53 $.
6370	0	a	Good for an evening of playing with friends but not much else. Once you've had one fun go it never seems to capture that magic again.
3836	0	a	Pretty terrible game, looks like it's from 2005 and plays like it too. Good then, but not now.
1432	1	a	Easy to play and I like Its simple graphics.
656	0	a	6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.
5381	1	a	.....
1435	1	a	It's as if someone took Winona's Gym from Pokemon Ruby, put in a shooter element, and extended the puzzles.
4497	1	a	Wtf i payed 1 Euro for this game and now it's free???? Give me my M4A4 Griffin back plz  (still a good game)
5976	1	a	Remembered playing Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Sucked weenie. Play this. Still suck weenie. 10/10 Will Attempt to Kill Dinosaurs Again
6451	1	a	If Samuel L. Jackson and Jeff Goldlbum had Steam accounts, this would be the only game in their Library
3396	1	a	The Sharknado of video games.
5001	1	a	  We combined a hover bike with an upgraded rocket launcher to make a weapon that surpassed Metal Gear.
1237	1	a	It reminds me Wall-E :) What do you want for 19 cents ? :D :D :D I made 5 cents profit :D   9/10
6526	1	a	dinosaurs vs guns and jet packs....and it's still a real challenge! get this if you have buddies to play it with. worth every penny!
2240	1	a	BEST GAME EVER CANT WAIT FOR THE BIG UPDATE
4910	0	a	i want my $1 back .-. this game is so bad
6126	1	a	This is an awsome game where you kill dinos. First lets get to the problems. A whole lot of bugs to do with walls + lag. they can be good and bad depends on the situation. This game overall feels like your playing halo, but killing dinos. there are cars that you can drive, upgrades, lots of weapons and tones of stuff to do. This game goes on sale all the time for only 0.99$ each and 2.99$ for a 4 pack totally worth it. Again some problems, but the game is great and even better with friends. It's worth it if you can get it on sale
3381	1	a	Fun game, good deal for the price.
696	1	a	Good game, but much too short.  The game has a good premise, good storyline, great mechanics and is fun and at times challenging to play. The only downside is that the main storyline of the game is much too short. I finished the game in two nights and was really left wanting more.  Having said that, if you can find the game on sale it still is a good value. 
1985	1	a	It's silly, it's weird, it's fun.   I killed a T-Rex in a mech, then got picked up by a pterodactyl only to shoot myself free and jetpack away.   For a dollar, how can you beat this game.
1386	1	a	Kinda like Wall-E looking robot, quite fun little game.  Why is it fun? Well you fly to a planet with the mothership, get to drive the robot (probe) on the planet. Get the gold, sometimes through physics puzzles.. then you have to shoot enemies as well. Later stages you can fly as well. Oh you can throw around your dead enemies with your little tractorbeam, stack them and use it to jump on higher platforms.  Recommend? YES!
1607	1	a	Well..   its a good game just need more server and people to play this game
4546	1	a	boii haven't even downloaded yet but i already love this 17/14
2342	1	a	I really don't understand why this game got only 36/100 from metascore. I bought this because it was -93% so it costed me only 0.99â¬ . It's really fun to play with friends and won't get boring too quickly, I know this because we played this 3 hours straight with my friend. People are saying that the singleplayer sucks, I really can't say anything to that because I haven't tried it yet and won't keep my hope too up because the bad rewiews..  8/10 I do recommend this game if you have somebody to play this with :)
3358	1	a	literally the best game ever made. totally not a halo rip off with dinosaurs. 10/10
1280	0	a	Pros: - Makes you want to do speedruns. - Has the platform feel you look for. - Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!  Cons: - Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives. - Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around) - Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs. - Graphics could really use an upgrade.  There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).
5217	1	a	-Playing by yourself: 8-9/10 -Playing with Friends: 11/10  Really, the only thing that i do not like about this game is that it has no windows 8 support. Even then, it runs OK, but i guess its really up to your computer at that point.   -For those of you who have played CARNIVORES, you always get super bored of hunting and shoting over and over and ogre again. You never have any cool weapons, and hunt the same freakin dinosaurs over and ogre again. You always wish that there was something cool, something where you could play with others, something a little more upgraded than crossbows and forrest maps (with the exception of like one desert map, which is also mainly forrests.) When i saw this game when as browsing the winter sale, i clicked on it and it seemed fun; especially for the price. In the past 4-5 days, i have racked up like 15-20 hours on this game. This game gives everything that a carnivores fan would desire and waaaay more. lightsabers, Compound bows, sentry turrets, jetpacks, invisibility cloaks, healing guns, a revolver, tanks, mechs, helicopters even, warthogs, APCs; this game packs all of a dinosaur fans wet dreams into it.   -Ogre all review: 10/10
5337	1	a	Brilliant. Amazingly fun. Have you ever wanted to blast dinoz with friends? This games for you. Simply the best relaxed shooter ever.
4319	1	a	There's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs in it. Don't think, just buy it.
4770	0	a	how has this game been released three times and still isnt done 4/10
2798	1	a	10/10 It's like Halo with dinosaurs PROS: -Always fun to play -Requires strategy and cooperation to take down large waves and large dinos -Large veriety of weapons and upgrades -Medeocre amount of vehicles -Small variety of special Dinosaurs -T-Rex underpowered -Spinosaurus extremely fun to fight (challenging because of speed, damage, health and size) -Interesting and original art choices and style -Missions are an interesting feature, not too challenging and premote moving around versus camping on a rock -This list can go on for a very long time  DOWNSIDES: -Needs more vehicle variety -Needs more special/boss Dinosaur variety -Needs more map variety
2013	1	a	For .99 cents you really can't beat this game. I've payed $60 for games that were less fun and less complete.
3444	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5924	1	a	Killed a T-Rex by punching it.   194/10 game of the year every year
4356	1	a	this game is awful, but you can shoot dinosaurs
4875	0	a	could have used a dollar somewhere else
1602	1	a	Yes, it is worth $.99, almost all games are.
3077	1	a	When dinos be screeching, ears be popping
6174	1	a	This game taught me how to survive the impending dino apocalypse.
2505	1	a	But hell it was 99 cents!
648	1	a	Fun little card game. Nothing special, but try playing this instead of reaching for your solitaire game.
2030	1	a	This game is amazing!
4947	1	a	If you're wondering whether you should buy it or not - it's pretty funny shooter, definitely worth it's price, especially on sale. But the real reason I'm writing this review - maps sucks, they are awful.
1235	1	a	This game is cool! If you can't start the game because of resultion problems, you have to press the 'F11' button on your keyboard, then you can press the full screen mode view in the up-right corner in your screen. And then you can play in full screen without any problems! Super cool little game, I like it!
5787	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥ it was 99 cents
5325	1	a	Purchased this game on sale and it was worth the buck. It could use more polishing though, there are times when it gets too buggy and the graphic's latency can also improve.
2946	0	a	steam pls
551	0	a	Let me start off by saying, this game has over 250 collectables. 50 of those...are tips on how to play the game. Yes that's right, you'll be searching for tips on how to play the game, that you've mastered to the point that you're concerned about getting collectables....Yep.  Apart from that, the art direction is cool, the pre-rendered cutscenes are awesome, but the story and in game cutscenes leave much to be desired. The gameplay is fun, but has way too many poorly planned challenges and mission requirements which will make you pull your hair out.  Buy Saints Row 4 if you want to run around having fun with super powers. Buy Resident Evil if you want an outbreak storyline about mutant monsters. Don't buy this game (unless there's a steam sale, then why not right?)
4348	1	a	11/1 would lightsaber a trex again
1569	1	a	AMAZING. Now,I haven't been here since the beginning of this game but I can tell you one thing . . . it's AWESOME. It's entertaining and fun,I can never seem to leave the computer. ORION: Prelude is the best $1 game I've seen.
5130	1	a	It is so bad, it is good.
1395	1	a	It's Great! It's a lot of fun playing and I really do enjoy the game play experience, as well as the story line. Travelling the universe, exploring and discovering new planets, as well as creatures. The fighting is fairly straight forward and I always dispose of my enemies by using the gravity gun and whack them around a bit before I throw them into a pit of despair! Overall, a fun and adventurous game.  Great job! :D
4627	0	a	Don't get this game. Spend your $1 on a frozen coke at MC Donalds.
6034	1	a	I think that this game is definietly worth $1 its better than most of my $20 games.
4454	1	a	Meh, it's a game made for kids. You can shoot dinasaurs for a little bit but not much depth or polish to the game.
126	1	a	Became an old lady lifting a car and sprinting up walls  69.69/10
299	0	a	Worst optimization I have ever seen.
6519	1	a	addictivly fun, reminds me a bit of halo, section 8.
1135	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
3570	0	a	The price is reasonable for what you get, and the developers are charming, but a bad game is still a bad game...
6522	0	a	while i only payed a dollar for the game and got more then what i payed for i have to say the reviews of improvements of this game are greatly exaggerated. the hit boxes of the dinosaurs are something even red 5 would laugh at. (infamous for hit boxes that counted necks as part of the head). the connection even with a ethernet cable was horrid. the character models are so outdated that even models from star wars clone comando look better in comparison. the store's ui is cluttered and has no way of tracking expenses for items put on a character. the taunts and various animations.... i think even hi rez put more effort into their emotes and they were free. now for the REAL gameplay.  first off i bought the LMG assuming it was a large machine gun... apparently LMG = burst rifle..... thats a simple error to fix in 30 sec.. you dont have an LMG you have a burst rifle. bow was fun but kind of impractical. (however bow weapons tend to be heavily connection dependent to be practical). using the mouse to steer the vehicles when most controls for tanks rely heavily on the wasd keys and using the mouse for turret control was aggravating (but tolerable... tom clancy games have button mapping that was worse) .  settings are set to all optional parts enabled (motion blur, bloom, etc) and high settings. disabling most of the optional settings makes the game playable but connectivty issues and wonky hitboxes are never good for a game no matter how pretty.  the hats.... just.... just no.... i mean if the hat replaced the helmet instead of being on top of it maybe .... other wise... no. even tf2 knows better then to allow clipping of cosmetic items.  however.... this game isnt something from the bowls of hell.... its kind of a fun idea though i was never into being a sci fi dinosaur killer and this game has raised a slight interest. I also have to give props to the developer still putting the time and effort to at least try to make the game better. something we dont see enough of these days in an age where companies like hi rez and activision make a game cash the paycheck for a year then abandon it for a new project in a different genre.  In fact id love to see this game on a new engine with updated charcter models.... and working hit boxes -_-....and a more intuitive UI.  people are arguing its worthy of an 83 or an 80 on the meta critic score... after my expereince that is not the case. the game has definitely made steps forward from the 30 it originally received but not worthy of a 82. this game id have to say a 63 would be a much more accurate score of the game. its no triple A title and with a setting such as sci fi soldiers killing dinosaurs i already had low expectations... which surprised me in good ways and bad as well. there are large areas for improvement just to make the game a 75 worthy score and even an hour of gameplay is enough to see that. it was fun for a dollar and i hope it gets put into their next project. these guys have a nice idea.... just need to do a bit better job of executing it.   if ya got a spare buck give it a shot for a couple hours have a little derpy fun.... and never speak of it again. 
1673	1	a	If you like goudging out your own eyeballs and setting them on fire while partying with knifed in your feet you will LOVE THIS GAME.

They don't deserve it.
5946	1	a	It's just a dollar, and I can guarantee you it is more fun and longer lasting than a candy bar of the same price. Basically crappy Planetside with dinosaurs. Just buy it you nerd.
3918	1	a	Great game but no servers still buy and play cant beat 50 cents thats like the price of a potato chip bag but chips taste better then Orion.
3584	0	a	Terrible game.
2757	1	a	A fun and entertaining game. As you go along you learn new tricks to trick and kill dinosaurs, you learn the best strategies for killing dinosaurs and for unlocking eapons. It's a splendid game with decent graphics. The only problem I have is some of the Dinosaur AI... This is coming from someone who only played the free weekend.
2855	1	a	This game it's masively muliplayer and very nice price =&gt;&gt; Best dinosaur survive ever ! Ilove this game because this game it's awesome ! I don't say this , all people and me say this !
4445	1	a	What i liked about ORION: Prelude: ?  What i disliked about ORION: Prelude: ?  Overall rating: ?/10
2609	1	a	I managed to hang a tank off a cliff and shot dinosaurs with it. 11/10 would physics again
2331	1	a	very good game such dino wow
4708	1	a	Its really fun when you arent feeling a competitive mood and you dont feel like playing Counter Strike xD Super fun game with friends, really chill if you dont feel like doing anything
2965	1	a	I got eaten by a Spinosaurus. If you don't know what that is, it's basically Godzilla before Godzilla. If you fps games, or dinosaurs, or both then buy this game. It's so fun. If you don't like dinosaurs.... then â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.
6238	1	a	very good  Update :  Well looking back when I bought it it was just a better than average early access game. NOW it's the best value for money game out there that has fun co-op, dinos, jetpacks, lightsabers, mechs, cosmetics and it's price is only like less that 1Euro (about I 0.75 I think).  Must buy.  Also shout-out to the devs for giving me free points for skins.
533	1	a	Uses the Spiderman Engine but still is fun.
5590	1	a	I fought someone wid yellow light sabers den he told me he is my father  i crieded ;*(  10/10 would cri agen
4217	0	a	UPDATE: Spiral changed name, and the game changed name- it is now orion:prelude- and it does not change anything that is written in this review- so make your own conclusions on how bad this game that is now on its third name is.  Bad. Do not buy.  Killing Floor is a hordemode shooter that focuses on one thing and does it damn well- only objective is to shoot well-designed enemies with well-designed weapons, and the sounds, music and feel are all tehre to make that fun. Weapons are powerful and feel powerful yet balanced between eachother, enemies are dangerous yet 'fair' and react to shots.  ORION DINO HORDE however, does the exact opposite: it give a player tons of guns and vehicles and makes all of them very bland. it gives billion game modes out of which 1 or 2 are worth playing and rest are dinosaur carp. Enemies feel plastic, hitboxes are wonky and movement is hideous. all animations are f-grade be it enemy, friendly or vehicle. The entire sound design is hideous: the loudest weapon in game are dual pistols, which deafen out tank gun and dual gatlings 100 to 1. weapons are laughably underpowered and imbalanced, only this enemies do is rush you like kamikaze planes.  Most of the flaws in the game are obvious to anyone who stops to sit for 5 seconds on 'what should good gameplay include', but Spiral is content on pumping out 'more is better' without a single thought on quality of the game.
3925	1	a	it sucks so much id rather play cod
5654	1	a	Its fun but it need optimization
6429	1	a	Great Game Just like sort of jerracisisdisjadiobeasuhyvaeod
6513	1	a	Stupid, awesome, dino-killing fun. Bit basic as far as today's shooters go, but that's where the stupid fun comes into play. Tons of game modes too. Vehicles are fun, I didn't expect there to be mech's, a tank from halo, and a choppa. As far as weapons go there is a Light Saber, laser guns, assault rifles, and a 'perk' system that can make you into a different fighter each game.
2071	1	a	Addictive gameplay!!!!!!!!!!!
5134	1	a	One of the funnest multiplayer games i've played
4221	1	a	Can't hate the game even if I was told to (I have played 200+ hrs with multi accounts). Fun Co-op game with great difficulty settings, as well as 4 class to choice from. Overall its an incredible game  8/10
5432	1	a	Worth the dollar but i didnt pay for it so i dont care 
1873	0	a	That game is Bad. And i doesn't mean idea, idea is pretty present. I mean the way it realized. Game is Raw, controls feels Clumsy, game is Glitchy, Models looking like axe-crafted wood ... it feels like - game was coded by feets, not by hands. It's looking like school-project created by something like 'build-your-game' tool, it doesn't even looks like Game. It's Awful, Uncomfortable, Embarrassing and Stupid. It's not just doesn't cost fixed price, it shouldn't have any price. I swear, i seen indie Games that has Much better Quality than That.
6461	0	a	tried it on a free weekend. not worth any amount of money. (This is for dino horde, not whatever it was called before)
2417	1	a	It's alot of fun with friends. That being said, I need more friends.
5052	1	a	If we move aside some visual bugs and that the modeling of the characters is not like we used to see in newer games, this game is absolutely worth the money and time.   Very fun to play, excellent co-op game with survival - would recommend to buy!
3589	0	a	pretty awful
5510	1	a	The best game ever
3780	0	a	Just terrible.
328	0	a	The console version is better, an obvious port, I do not recommend.
3433	1	a	Why do I love this game so much!? Idk, but it's a lot of fun, that's for sure! &lt;3
6185	1	a	
5029	0	a	Just....          Don't.......
926	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
5049	1	a	It's a dollar, if you're reading this and its not in your library, you don't deserve to exist... simple as that.
2779	1	a	Often cited as 'The Halo series true origin', news of this gem have been spread widely through gaming communities. Regarded by many as the pinnicle of modern-day gaming, competing with such titles as Bad Rats, Mass Effect 3, and others of their caliber to take it's place upon the best of 2014. A true emotional thriller, bringing out the deepest reserves of the audience's primal urges in an accute reflection of modern societies, trying teamwork, testing courage, and pushing those who take the challenge to limits they never have never dreamed.  I shot a T-Rex in the head while flying with my jetpack, it was rad.
4457	1	a	it was fun
6539	1	a	Combine Killing Floor and Halo, what do you get? Instead of zombies, there are dinos, but in a futuristic world similar to Halo, very COOL and fun.
4199	1	a	It`s Ok, the store aint working doe but gameplay is chill
702	0	a	it's like solitaire with someone punching you in the face every few minutes and then slapping your cards off the table
5922	1	a	Good Fun..still a bit to go gameplay wise
3871	1	a	Dinosaurs can blow up the power plant 10/10
6566	1	a	Great fun! very simple yet addictive, well recomended.
4189	1	a	Kill Dinos HAHA but overal I really enjoy this game
4420	0	a	In short, this game is Killing Floor with dinosaurs, but subpar. You survive waves of  zombies  dinos, earn money for killing them and buy progressively bigger and nastier guns with them. Sounds pretty straightforward, and it is. The problems with this game are that it's unbalanced, looks worse than Unreal Tournament 2004 (but still runs horribly) and feels very amateurish for a comercially sold game.  For starters, there's only one class out of the 3 you are offered that is actually worth anything, and that is the Assault class (the guy with the jetpack). The other ones have a cloaking mode and a healing gun, but they aren't worth giving up the ability to NOT DIE when you are picked up by a pterodactyl, stop yourself from being mobbed or casually fly around the triceratops that you are pumping full of lead.  There are a bunch of purchaseable guns on offer when you finish a wave, but most of them are either too weak or have horrible accuracy/recoil, so expect to use the same guns on every match. Or you could drive around in a warthog-ish buggy and have some guy man the turret (or man it yourself) to become almost invincible to the dinosaurs.  There are some things that Dino Horde does right, though. It mixes it up by having you defend generators, fight boss dinosaurs, and move around to different bases, which breaks up the monotony quite a bit, and it is rather satisfying once you get a hold of one of those badass turrets, admittedly.  I feel a bit bad for bashing an indie game, and honestly, if you're the forgiving sort, you may get a good amount of fun out of this game, but there are better games you can play about surviving waves of enemies. There are better games about blowing dinosaurs up. There are none to my knowledge about surviving waves of dinosaurs, though, so if you have a fixation for surviving a horde of prehistoric reptiles (perhaps it's the only way you can get it up, i'm not judging you :-D) then pick it up in a sale or something.
3164	0	a	I have no idea what I just played, but then again, it's 0.99.
2563	1	a	This is amazing with friends and very intense. 7.25/10
6345	0	a	PLAY THIS GAME IT TOLD ME TO TELL YOU     
5543	0	a	complete utter â¥â¥â¥â¥ do not download, hopefully as people give it â¥â¥â¥â¥ reviews they wont change the name again. Rest In Pestrami
6037	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is by far one of the greatest games I have ever had the plesure to play. It is seemingly genius how the devs immerse you in it's gameplay. For example the loading screens and trailers all show moe or less amazing artwork and gameplay but when you actually play the game it is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. This gives the player a sense of confusion, similar to how an actual space marine would feel when being told the greatness of war and seeing how it actually is for himself. Another example is the attack animations. When you are being attacked by a dinosaur in real life you won't pay attention to how it moves so in ORION: Dino Horde there aren't any attack animations. Also the iron sights don't really do anything there is an in-game store where you buy various taunts and hats. Just like that game Team Fortress 2! But they did what valve never could do with their game. They not only unbalanced the weapons but made the in-game store even more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that in Team Fortess! Do you see what I'm getting at here? It has some of the most advanced immersion tactics I have ever seen and is a must play 10/10 and I'm totally not being bribed to review this.

376	0	a	Get Saints Row 4 instead. Or Just Cause 2 even.
5671	0	a	Game plays like a 90s multiplayer Turok + Left 4 Dead with jetpacks and medics. It's clunky, amateur, and very poor overall. There is an element of genius and fun in this game, but that potential is never reached due to the shoddy dev work. This game is one that should've been left in the bin. Some things are better not revisiting.  2.0/10 Terrible. Plays like a HS project, worse than most subpar mods.  Reviewer has played ORION: Prelude as his first outing in this series.
2953	0	a	It's not really that good, and even though I have only played it for a few minutes, I can tell already. It's mainly the controls, they feel pretty weird and don't work well. Good thing I played it on a free week instead of paying 15 bucks for it. 3.5/10 
4040	1	a	This is a really fun game. Its a wave based FPS that has you and other players shooting Dinosaurs. You don't really get to see that in a game formated like this. The weapon selection is good and the controls work fine, however if you are on a lower end or dying PC you may have to turn the graphics down by a significant ammount. Not to meantion that no one really plays this game! Its only $0.99. This game is well worth your time and could use support for servers. This game gets an 8/10
3149	1	a	I guess there's dinosaurs or something.
4570	0	a	other than it being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's still pretty bad. models are janky as and it's badly optimized
3883	1	a	so cool and you can fly
4506	1	a	its all about the gameplay. Graphics arent the best, but arent bad. What brings me in is the unique stlye of play that is lacking in so many FPS's today.
4936	1	a	Really fun, which wasn't expected. Spent hours playing this with friends.
558	1	a	If you are an Infamous fan, this is a really good pickup. There are many similarities between Infamous and Prototype that made me feel like I was back in Empire City (at times). The overall feel of the game is a lot like Infamous. While the storyline is a little less intriguing, the free play in a lot more enjoyable, something you and a friend can do for fun for a long time.
2189	1	a	I absolutely recomend this game. It's a ton of fun, nice gameplay and mechanics. Briliant
5605	1	a	Fun game.If only it wasn't for the lag(but that's probably because of distance, not the game). I can't really complain about anything. Got it in a 4 pack for myself and a few friends, glad I did.
1795	1	a	M8, DINOSAURS! DINOSAURS ARE UP IN YOUR GRILL AND YOU NEED TO SORT THEM OUT! 10/10
4855	0	a	Everytime I shoot my, gun is delayed, but it did cost me just one buck. I wish I had never played (this crap), but I can't be bothered to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ (because it did cost only one buck. Still not worth it)  Just in case you wondered, this was an 'alternate rhyme scheme'. (ABAB)
2441	1	a	I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME. Orion: Dino Horde is not only good-looking but it combines two things i love, dinosaurs and guns. This game is a must play for any dino fan or any fps fan.
6547	1	a	Paid next to nothing for this game and after playing for a while i'd probably buy this game at full price if i had too. Awesome game once you get into it and the PvP game types are just fun (if not more fun) than the game types with dinosaurs. I would recommend getting this to anyone especially if your the FPS gamer typer.
5108	1	a	I won this game in a giveaway, at first it didn't seem like it was going to be fun. Then i connected to my first server...  Its great fun a great survival wave based game (if that makes sense)  Its like Call of Duty : Zombies but without the Call of duty, and with dinosaurs... Plus Halo  Its actually a fun game i do reccomend buying it becuase for a cheap game its very good, because most 'cheap' games are Â£1+ and don't include much fun or effort. but for such a low price this game is by far the best on on steam! why not give it a shot :D  10/10 would win again
3318	1	a	METAscore was sooooo wrong this game is very fun and takes some stratgy or teamwork in some game modes and i love how u can play as the Dinosaurs.  78/100
4500	1	a	Abselutely worth it
2685	1	a	Got this game on Steam summer sale. After five hours of game play, I can say this is a fantastic game! I love playing the Recon class and use the bow alot. It is very cheap and you can get a lot of hours on this game.
1231	1	a	Gr8 Game  It seems Mario and Wall-e meat each other. There are many ways to solve Puzzles. I'm in love &lt;3
4889	0	a	Jurassic â¥â¥â¥â¥ up by the devs what were you thinking you cheeky micebummers, ill have you know i once visited an eskimo reservation and they thought i was a god, to bad this game doesn't do the same amirte could've been the new civ 5 2/10 had some good times but never really did find out what happened to jacob degenerate 2 it was my favorite movie because when they fell out of the closet and samantha saw lucy with the gun i think i backwards exploded into the review section of blockbuster
1340	0	a	This game is very simple but the levels arn't the same but the objectives are very much the same.
2747	1	a	This game is actually kind of okay.
2624	1	a	You kill dinosaurs... That's it. 10/10
6334	1	a	I keep forgetting I bought this game for 50 cents.
3289	1	a	You take a FPS, put on a hard mechanic, combined with HALO's engine and add Dinosaur AI and Skin, mixed with OP Guns and hard system requirements. Overall: 5/10, game has a huge lack of players and servers.
6470	0	a	I read some of the reviews, and watched the trailer video on the store page before trying this game our for the free weekend event. Let me tell you; Killing floor is fun..Jurassic Park is an alright movie. This game just wasn't what it was made out to be. The metascore is not misleading; it is dead on. This game rates a 3/10.
5026	0	a	Wanted to buy the new IL-2. This game got voted up. This game is really good, but really cheap you should ask your selfs why you didn't buy it yet. If you still didn't picked up this game for 1 dollar/euro/pound you should have yourself checked. Now it's even 0,49 cents dammit.
2984	1	a	This game is sort of like halo, BUT WITH DINOSAURS!!!!!! There are cool weapons, nice outfits, many game modes maps, and more. in my opinion, dinosaurs are awesome, and if you like halo (i dont personaly, but i still love this game) then you should get this game. (GET IT NOW, ITS CHEAP, i think)
428	1	a	This is a game that really shows it's age. AI is pretty poor. Storytelling method is pretty cool but the story itself is kind of a mess, with random event after event making a shaky framework to tie the missions together. No real character development ever, which just makes it so funny when they reveal Mercer's sins and try to paint him as a tragic victim after he brutally murders and eats thousands of people. The dialogue is almost laughably cliche sometimes. Controls can be pretty finnicky resulting in some frusterating moments.   Dispite that, it's quite fun to play. You get an aresenal of powers, and you get to be a sort of antihero as you run around town killing people and fighting abominations. I think the central game mechanics are pretty solid and well executed, and that was enough for me to play it through and reccomend it.
3110	1	a	Whoa. *Insert Whoa. face here*
453	1	a	This game is friggin awesome. If you like mass killing, fun, destruction, apocalypse games, this is the game for you. The game may be a little old, but it'll sure entertain you.
1011	0	a	PC port not so great, controls are sketchy and can be frustrating. Story is meh at best. Sad really, great premise, bad execution.
5753	1	a	This game is incredibly fun and will fill you with awe and joy. With this said, it can also drive you crazy, the rouge-like nature of the game, causes you to loose your mind over and over. You keep dying to small things such as bees, you set fire to yourself or you couldn't pick enough flowers. Overall it's pretty fun.
4151	1	a	This is a great underrated fps you should definitely buy it and play it woth friends!
5115	1	a	This game is pretty awesome. If you are a fan of the Halo feel and dinosaurs, love muliplayer slayage, then you would really like this. It is easy to learn and adapt to, and it is very fun to kill the dinos. For a game without a campaign story, this is defintely a game that exceeded my expectations. Besides, for the price, you can't beat it. ($.53 at the time I bought it).
4798	1	a	Fun game, really. I love the Halo-like feel of it and the various classes are a nice touch. Some of the maps are repetative (and no I'm not just talking about the day/night maps), but are overall fun. I just really wish people played more of the other modes other than survival.   Them ost SEVERE problem with this game is the crashing and lagging.. the developers of this game really need to watch the 'Leroy Jenkins' video and find out what happens to a computer when you have too many enemies spawning at once! Hard to shoot dinos when they are lagging the Hell outta my computer! That and coupled with random disconnects makes this game almost more of a frustration than a game.   But Hell why am I complaining for $1?   This game is fun and if your computer won't take a dump while trying to play it, you're in for a serious thrill.
139	1	a	I first played prototype at my step cousins house when I was little I was amazed by the game so years later I find it on steam and pick it up first off I dont get bad performance so I dont get why everyone is saying that its a bad port the game is fun but it can get repetetive but if its on sale you should pick it up 8/10 pretty good
4518	0	a	Plagiarism is no joke. Do not buy this game. The developers stole art from many other studios and do not deserve your money.
1201	1	a	  Worth every penny
1762	1	a	Despite the multiple unpolished aspects of the game, for some reason it is addictively fun. Dunno what to say... something about shooting endless waves of dinos in the face that is theraputic... and FUN! I think this game is definitely underrated. I wish there were more flying options. The one 'plane' thing is a bit cumbersome.
1414	1	a	:)
3889	1	a	More addicting than sex on cocaine. 69/10
2092	1	a	RECOMMEND BY ALOT This Is A Good Game For $0.99 9/10
1056	1	a	Excellent little puzzle game, the only down side is having to login to EA/Origin at every play.
6200	1	a	Pretty great but stay out of the heli-planes if you want to keep things interesting. Love the massive dino fights.
1680	1	a	Cool game there bro, needs more d... Oh wait.  10dinos/10mothatruckindinos  P.S. This game needs to be renamed Halo: Dino Edition (screw the rights to the name Halo the truth must be known) 
5188	0	a	zero skill involved in the game. Guns have zero recoil which shooting a bore. Fun concept but bad execution
6240	1	a	This game is so damn fun. You can drive airborn motorbike-like vehicles, mount tanks, troops-transportation thingy with a mounted machine-gun, and a mecha-robot thingy. There's just so many ways to kill the hordes of dinosaurs. Only disappointment was the lack of blown-out intestines while walking through dead dinosaurs. 
3387	1	a	I remember when i bought this game when it came out, and i must say it was horrible. Like there was so many bugs that everyone was just mad at the devs for releasing such a bad game. But now i see they have improved and i wanna give it a try again. And based on other reviews, it seems like a good try (its also a buck)
4644	0	a	This is just....
5680	0	a	If I diden't know any better I would say it's still in alpha. It looks like crap,sounds like crap,and runs like crap. Sry just calling it as I see it
995	1	a	In the distant future: the year 2000, a small alien named Zero is kidnapped from his home planet and taken to an underground science facility known as Black Aperture. He and his mysterious crystal-like companion begin to fight back against the cruel and unhumane scientists by doing cruel and unhumane things to them. Days passed and there was no sign of progress for Zero and his follower, the scientists and soldiers just seemed to keep coming back through the floorboards. Proabably beause they did. Zero was becoming very frustrated and began to question his allegiance, so he did what any logical alien with warping abilities would do. He played by the rules. He would concede to every guard he met and acted politely to everyone he met. But his follower didn't like this. So he got over it.  And you should too.
79	1	a	I got this to replay Space Quest 6 since I was unable to finish it as a kid, worth the nostalgia.
6491	0	a	THIS GAME IS NOT PRIMAL CARNAGE - bought it for $1, still not worth it. Super boring, super repetitive, and the multiplayer doesn't work.
5937	1	a	This is truly a great game. I've played this game for A WEEK STRAIGHT and I haven't gotten tired of it! It's AWSOME!!
2546	0	a	no seriously. no one should ever buy this game. not even for â¬0.99
4715	1	a	I paid 0.99$ on a game that is now free. 0/Ï â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU DEVS.                            I actually really like this game.
345	0	a	bad game for PC users. The game will crash all the time. Not werth the money. 
1040	0	a	I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial &amp; error.   I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.
5140	1	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10

6433	1	a	I paid $1 for this game.  It feels like Halo vs Dinosaurs.  Worth it.
2925	1	a	THIS GAME COST LESS THAN A PACK OF GUM, AND IT GAVE ME MORE FUN THAT A PACK OF GUM. YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT I CAN DO WITH A PACK OF GUM THAT IS EQUALLY AS FUN AS ORION: DINO HORDE? SHOVING THAT GUM UP YOUR â¥â¥â¥ THEN BLOWING BUBBLES WITH YOUR GAS IS JUST AS FUN.
3031	1	a	Once every lifetime or so, a game comes along that defines an entire generation of people. It may not be the most popular game or even the most well-made (though this one is). But it is a game whose vitality--whose culture and mission--is guided by the spirit of the times. A game that is of the same soul as its rapidly-evolving player-base.  This game is a leather-skinned, ten-tonne, befanged zeitgeist of the 2010s; it is filled to the brim with content, but as empty as the Dadaists who hurriedly cranked it out. A work of passion? Absolutely not. It was an accident. A beautiful, remarkable accident: Like life itself. It was a market-savvy cynical heap of a game, desperately trying to hitch a ride on the bandwagon of dino-themed entertainment. The game ressurected Michael Crichton--may he rest in peace--for the express purpose of tearing down everything that he could have been, in addition to everything he already was, and replace his memory with a plastic artifice and the lowest possible form of American consumerism.  This is why you need this game. Not because it's good, but because it's the most important game of this--of any--decade. This is the game that defines the 2010s better than any other; in all its flaws and successes. And it could not have come sooner.  In this game, you take on the role of Captain Henk Mercer, an intrepid planet-hopping paleontologist-slash-warlord with a heart of solid dino dung. You are tasked with killing every dinosaur that every existed, to protect future generations of hyperreligious Galactic Federal Citizens from the complexities of an increasingly secular, science-based culture which would become distracted from its faith by the presence of ancestral lizard bones. With a ragtag team of up to 17 other cyber soldiers (your fellow players), you must defeat hordes of enemy dinos (specifically, all pterodactyls) using four different unique guns. The guns depicted in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game have essentially never been made before. They defy any description: But imagine a rocket launcher that has acquired sapience, knows its enemies' fears and hopes, and concludes to murder them anyway. That's generally how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sweet the guns are. But--again--only playing the game can imbue you with the visceral knowledge of how the guns work, because it's 100% feel and 0% logic. The game proves that there is no logic greater than raw emotion and, in proving this truth, the dinosaurs have finally killed Nietzsche; God is alive, and He is you. Read on.  The game is among the first FPS games to utilize a 'healer type' class: A player whose sole purpose is to increase the Hit Points (or HP) of the other players, should they suffer Dino Damage (or DD) during the game's progress. Keeping your healer class alive becomes essential and difficult, because there are T-rexes. Think about it: Prehistory's greatest fighting machine. And instead of having a gun, you've got a splint and some rubbing alcohol. But it's okay: Captain Mercer is--by the game creators' own admission--so overpowered that no dinosaur will stand a chance. The other 21-or-so players who are working alongside Captain Mercer are basically there to server his every perverse whim, while contributing little else. In many cases, these 'whims' are a rich tapestry of scatological sex acts that would make the Marquis de Sade blush. Make sure you are playing this game with a mature, open-minded party.  My one complaint with this game is that it deviates from Robert T. Bakker's important vision of the dinosaur. The dinosaur's cladistic roots indicate a shared ancestry among lizards, birds, and even early mammals. It's fair to say that all modern birds are, in fact, dinosaurs. Science has shown this time and again, however--to this day--anyone working in the burgeoning field of Dino-themed FPS games neglects to promote these new scientific discoveries. When you're standing on the shoulders of intellectual giants, and those giants are standing on the shoulders of sweet-as-hell stegosaurs and â¥â¥â¥â¥, you need to learn how to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing act like it. Show scientific progress a little respect, and maybe put some feathers and talons and beaks and â¥â¥â¥â¥ in there. Is that so much to ask? Jesus.  It goes without saying that I've awarded this game the highest score achievable by an FPS: 1800 value points. If you've not yet played it, then gather up the requisite party of 4 humans and 2 dinosaurs and given it a proper go. You owe it to yourself and you owe it to the future of gaming to support such a monumentous project.  There will be no more important games this decade. Buy nothing. Play nothing else. Keep travel expenses to a minimum. Save your money for 2025, when all games will come with syringes and phone-jacks that you put into your forehead.
5133	1	a	Halo with Dinosaurs for 49c...i'll take it.
6477	1	a	This game.
4444	1	a	nice in the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
432	1	a	This is by far one of the most amazing games I've played. I really like it!
6410	1	a	Conquest mode is awesome! Open world base-to-base defense and progress, you need both transport and sustain for your team, love it!
1323	0	a	Release Date: 1 Apr, 2016  My â¥â¥â¥!!!! Liers mOFOS!
163	1	a	Kill everything, throw everything, never ending enemy stuff and you are a jackass who does virtually anything you want, even glide through the air and HIJACK HELICOPTERS IN MID AIR!!! Love it.
2339	1	a	this game is stupid fun shooting dinos and gets better with a few friends. Just don't expect more than a few hours of fun for the gameplay gets very repedtitve but that first time you 1v1 a T-rex with a lightsaber and win feels amazing. So buy it if you have money to waste and want some dumb game to play with friends for a few hours.
1433	1	a	Bought this for .17 cents during summer sale. Played first few levels nice indie title for the price. Play it with family 10/10
2039	1	a	This game while receiving many bad reviews over the interwebs, has proven to be quite enjoyable and i plan on spending many hours with friends slaying dinos with high powered weaponry.
1809	0	a	Glitchy online play, if you can even get into a matchmaking game. You're forced to start out with a crappy pistol and the dinosaurs aren't as exciting as the trailer made them seem. Don't waste your money.
621	1	a	Have you every wished that you could run up walls, shape-shift into military soldiers, or morph your arm into a weapon of mass destruction? With this game you can do all of that and more!
1424	1	a	A pretty solid little game. I enjoyed it enough for the price.
6473	1	a	awesome game with good game quites needs more dinosuars that u can play as
766	1	a	A solid twin-stick shooter set in a mech/steampunk world. You can upgrade your vehicle's weapons and armor, and even get a cool pet to follow you on your dangerous exploits.
3071	0	a	The game had horrid performance issues despite looking terrible, the gameplay was VERY clunky and it felt like a chore just trying to take aim at something. The combat is boring, the weapons are bland, and the whole game feels like a gimmick.
2429	1	a	Quite unusual shooter. Fell in love within the first 10 minutes. Well done!
5090	1	a	Great Game. I love to play!!
6475	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
2461	1	a	10/10 would play again Has Dinosaurs
1824	1	a	While this might not be a title for everyone, it is hard to go wrong for a dollar.
3955	1	a	is cool has big dinosaurs has flying dinosaurs has robos pew pew and lazer gunz pew
5812	1	a	it's... it's beautiful, it's godlike, it's goooooood GET THIS GAME NAOWWW
3059	1	a	Good game, I'll say its better than most games I purchased, and for the price its great. Good fun with Dinos, Tanks, Mechs,Jetpacks, lightsabers, vtols flamethrowers and alot of other stuff that adds to the fun. Good updates aswell.
4046	0	a	You could actually have more fun just going to the restroom
2583	1	a	Just bought the game, seems good so far, not too many problems, really fun but then again I like fps.
3416	1	a	this game is like COD zombie but it is dinosaurs
5640	1	a	Fun FPS sci fi game killing dinosaurs over and over with sweet gamemodes best game ever!
1474	1	a	BEEP is a cute little exploration platformer game. You have to explore three planets and collect golden nuggets. There is enemies, annoying platforming, jetpacks and more. Definetely something you need to have in your library
4930	0	a	This game is just pure trash ...
3247	1	a	This game is buggy but it is really fun.Its a really good time especially if you get it for a dollar.
5021	0	a	This game has low fps for my laptop and my laptop isnt a crappy one. You should reconsider the Performance issues. Even on the lowest graphic settings im still getting 5 fps max
824	1	a	If you have played the first one, there is no need to recommend this one. But if you haven't play the first one - play it! And then you'll come for more here!
2913	0	a	This game is as if Satan and Hitler had a baby.
5511	0	a	First game I join. Dinosaurs with pirate hats attack. I then uninstalled.
1699	1	a	8/10 would play again
162	1	a	Yet another underrated game. Iâm starting to wonder how the major reviewers make their reviews: it seems that most games to receive good reviews are sequels to existing AAA titles, specifically shooters or RTS games. Anyway â back to the recommendation. Prototype is basically what you would get by mixing GTA3 and Spiderman, with a lot more superpowers, with an original but forgettable government-zombie-virus plot. The gameplay is fluid-smooth and the camera is /usually/ pretty good (especially using an XBox 360 controller). Both gameplay and story have a very good pace, and the difficulty is spot-on, where it ramps up but is rarely too easy and uncommonly frustrating. The only issue I had with the game was the repetition in side-missions and a /few/ usless powers; otherwise this is one of my favorite games this year.
5158	1	a	pretty rad shooter for a budget
1625	1	a	So everyone on the web apparently dislikes this game a lot. I don't see it.  Dino Horde is a delightfully fun Horde shooter with various modes including pvp that pits friends up against waves of dinosaurs. Similar to Dino-D-Day, there is pvp modes where one team are the dinos, and the other are humans. It's pretty fun and works about as much as dino d day does.  The survival mode is where the game shines. You fight increasingly hard waves of dinos as you try to defend yourselves and various generators around the map. The maps are huge and the graphics are really nice to the eye.  Right off the bat, the HUD looks like it was straight from Halo. The gameplay is a mix of Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, and even TF2. When you go down, you have to either revive your teammate, or kill a dino to get back up, similar to Borderlands. The game is highly customizable, and is insanely fun.  The Metacritic score can go â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself. This game is great.
3474	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
922	1	a	It's the kind of game you want to play with friends in your spare time.
4511	1	a	This game is fun, little old kind graphics but worth giving try, specially its just 1$ , for sure NOT waist of money !
2138	1	a	LOVE IT :D best game of 2015  dinos skins hats gunz jetpacks everything i dreamed of is in here 'just not world of warcraft'
1588	1	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥, good and fun at the same time. Totally worth it.
1894	0	a	Same game, different name. Would not recommend if you're looking for something different from ORION.
148	1	a	I recomend this game. First, the combat; true the combat could be better, it would be nice if there was a more stratiegic way to dive into the combat, but it makes up for the lack of difficulty with a lot of heart-pounding, edge of the seat action. The combat animation in this game is beautifuly gory, and well animated, and brutal and it makes you feel like a walking weapon. However, an open world is only as good as the way you travel through it, and when you move through this game you feel like a SUPER HERO. A mix of parkour and power-based traversal it is so, so satisfying. As is the open world, a sandbox is only as good as the contents of the world. The map is filled with these little side missions that are a good distraction for about a minute, but going on a masacre and slaughtering the militery makes up for that. As far as the story goes, it's...okay. Now I'm only about two hours into the game, and there are some aspects of the story that I love, however the game makes me hate those. I want to unravle the mystery surrounding the main character's past, but there's this infection spreading through out the city, I'm just gonna go deal with this and...oh wait, no I'm not. That aside I do LOVE this game and I can definety reccomend it for $20.00. I'd say it gets an 8/10 - a great game.
6323	1	a	Even if you like it or not, you won't lose much due to low price of 0,99â¬. It's pretty much like Killing Floor with dinosaurs but with more gamemodes and vehicles. Good graphics for indie dev game and gameplay is enjoyable for the most part. Since last time I played it had glitches and weird animations but nothing serious.  I will write longer review later when I have time (and if I'm not lazy).
6455	0	a	I have never seen a more buggy game. The menu system is so bad I had to restart the game just to get rid of the lobby select screen. This game is so bad the developers should feel bad for it.  EDIT: After 2 more attempts to join a game and having to restart the game after each failure, I am STILL not able to actually get into a game. Absolutely shameful.
3356	1	a	I was really surprised how much fun this game actually is, and for only $1. I had little expectations for it, but was so surprised, I spent the first whole weekend playing the game non stop, I even reguarly host my own server there too. There are many modes in the game too Iprefer survival, and conquest the most, but also they have 1v1 duel, and FFA, and CTF. you should stop reading this review and just buy it already.
3139	1	a	Really nice game though, worth the money i would pay 10 dollars to play this game really really good (:
4649	0	a	Silly gameplay occasionally glitchy with floaty controls,wouldnt recommend
2989	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
4689	1	a	At one dollar, I would highly recommend this game.
244	1	a	What a spectacular game.
5488	1	a	I highly reccomend this game. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is very good, and the design is very nice. It's a lot more fun to play with friends than alone, but still fun regardless. And shoot, it's only 99 cents!
1037	1	a	Great game, nice mechanics. Few skills that work together perfectly. Just the final boss is a slapp in the face because it requires hardly any skill but mostly just dumb luck.
1765	1	a	Just like the trailer says, the game went from zero to hero :D
6005	1	a	Very good price-performance ratio.  10/10
1751	1	a	Well, i really didn't have high expectations when i first bought this game for 0,99â¬, which i consider pretty much 'free'. But this game turned out to be great, and not just great - I prefer it over 60â¬ games such as GTA V, which means something. This game is NO.1 on the 'Fun for the money' List in my opinion. I don't know any other game where you can use your jetpack to power-punch a flying dinosaur, or blow up floating heads with a grenade launcher (Gamemode called 'Silly mode'. Well the graphics are... are... Well, not so good, but that makes the game easier to run on low-end systems. For anyone out there with a low-end pc (laptop?) who does not want to spend much money on expensive 60â¬ games they cant run, this is the perfect game for you to buy. Its extra fun when playing co-op with your friends, even tho the game maybe doesn't feel 'complete'.  So, fun for the money rating:  7/10 -IGN  KILL DEM DINOS!
4743	1	a	Boy do i feel sorry for you if you didn't get the early games hwen they were free. You would have got ths 100% free, and boy it is fun.  9/10 Would Slow-mo Shoot a Trex in the face again.
601	1	a	A very intense, often disturbing, man versus city, death and destruction action game with an intriguing sci-fi conspiracy plot. In terms of action intensity, this easily owns GTA.   There are plenty of special abilities to be unlocked.  Most memorable and entertaining element of the game is the ability to jump from helicopter to helicopter high above the city, pulling out pilots and throwing them away, then flying the chopper yourself!
4753	0	a	Unless you enjoy playing endless rounds of killing dinosaurs...then I guess this game is here for a reason...but if not, as usual, then don't even bother to look into this game, even when its on sale for 99% off, becuase trust me...its still not even worth it...like seriously, I am still doubting myself of purchuring this game...I want my $0.99 back fow
5310	1	a	Best $1 bill I've ever spent. I've logged several hours now in to this game and it's fun. It has it's bugs and minor glitches, but if the devs give attention to this game it can only get better.
1463	1	a	There are alot of cheap platformers out there that I have to get a refund for, and theres alot that I look at are rubbish, but this one stands out as a GOOD cheap game it runs well and the gameplay is good for its price I highly reccomend if you are looking for a cheap puzzle platformer!
1570	1	a	Bought a four pack and gave it to some friends. We're not friends anymore.  10/purple.
4004	0	a	This Is The Worst Co-Op Game I've Ever Played.
3130	1	a	Gotta Admit that this game is kinda repetitive BUT There's something about this game that makes me wants to play more.Coop is fun with vehicle and stuff.Don't Worry about the low MetaScore because this games has been remade.
4810	1	a	One of the funnest dong hopping gaems of all time. If you like dino-based autism and want to kill fugging dinos while smokan weed and circlejerking with your gayass â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ friends, then this is the game to get. The leader of the company however is a greedy sociopath however.
3472	1	a	Definitely worth a try!
5596	1	a	IT GOOD GAME
4972	0	a	For whatever reason you may have to get this game, do not. It has worse graphics than Team fortress 2 and runs about 3x worse than tf2. It's fre to play now, but back when itwas 0.49, i would have never reccomended it. It's free now, but my statement still stands. This game is NOT worth playing.
1818	1	a	I love this game
5882	1	a	if i knew how to cry, i would do it now
3284	1	a	0/10 Dinosaurs are extinct SOO UNREALISTIC!!  But no seriously its pretty fun
1205	1	a	Good Game!! Recommend!
2975	1	a	This game is fantastic fun. Bought it on sale as joke but it surpassed my expections and the bad reveiws.   Explore detailed scenary filled with freaking dinosaurs then you're defending your base from waves fo the buggers. Easily to get to grips with, fanstic fun with friends, good interface and ballanced. All in all a great game, deserves more credit than it gets.   It feels like a work in progress but it gets better with each update, the artic update signifcant improvement. Weather works well and the buildings are good. The vehicles look and feel good, you can play as 3 classes or 10 dinosaurs. It's not a blockbuster game but it's fast becoming a favourite, easily up there with tf2 and l4d2 as a fun multiplier game. If you like those games with a bit of influence Halo and dinosaurs, you'll probably love this.
4962	0	a	This game has more cons than Dinosaurs.
3717	0	a	  The game is running really slow for no reason, all settings on low, not too many people playing it and some dinos take lots of time to die.
1105	1	a	game of psyco or you can throw any onbject do you like xD and some shooting POWER pew pew :U
1677	1	a	Top notch banter, with added dinosaurs. Hours of entertainment, though is better with friends. gr8 m8 8/8.
4404	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super Â£10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
3499	0	a	I forgot I even owned this game.
1747	1	a	was worth $0.99
3368	1	a	Its got dino's and guns, nuff said!
1604	1	a	Shooting T-Rex and driving crazy cars for 0,79â¬
964	1	a	I like this game even more than the first one. The violence is even more satisfying (I'm not crazy. My mother had me checked.) and the extra weapons &amp; characters are a nice addition. It still has a nice challenge to it. I only beat it on the easiest setting and was still pretty challenged to finish some levels.   Here are some videos I did of my play through of Shank 2:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Shank 2 Ep1 - The Dark Road Home&nbsp;
3956	0	a	no..... you still failed IT IS STILL A PRETTY BAD GAME Its not bad in graphic support but... THE DINOSAURS FTW????!!!! they glitch like s**t! and when the velociraptors stand still... the head is showing up 90Â° looks just like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ guy who saw an airplane for the first time but its not very bad... fix the glitches plz... then its 10/10
5263	0	a	I wish i could sell games on the steam market...
2640	1	a	An amazing game for it's super low price. Even beats some games that are far more expensive than this. Don t question it, if you have a bit of extra money to spend and you want a game to keep you busy, just buy it. 
2762	1	a	LoL i want this game ;D. I played the 'demo'.
6332	1	a	Bought this game JUST to support the DEV team.  They stuck it out and put more work into making this into something, where most dev teams just drop promising titles. GJ Dev's. IDK how much I will play it, but I will pay it.
3270	1	a	Okay, listen up. Back when this was released, it was quite the mess, game didn't really work, wasn't fun to play and i just felt like i wasted my money. They later released more patches that supposedly would fix the game, they did not fix it, they gave away free Limited-Edition skins to Early Buyers, i still was not satisfied.  I ignored the game for about a year, it just wasn't fun anymore, it felt like i was just wasting my time playing this bug-riddled mess, i tried to enjoy it beacuse it looked stunning on the trailer, sadly the game wasn't the same.  However, during Christmas 2013, Spiral Studios released a Christmas Update, along with a huge new Map called The Arctic. This was when i decided to take another look at the game, and i noticed how they added a Levelling system, kind of like Killing Floor's (This was heavily requested by the game's community) some new Maps, and fixed tons of the bugs that had been plaguing the game since release.  While still being a quite flawed game (as you can notice while playing the game for a bit, ESPECIALLY those third-person player character movement animations, they look beyond terrible, sorry it had to be said!) i can finally say that i had fun with this game, and at the current 93% Sale price, it is WORTH IT.  The game is even free right now, all week, so why not give it a shot? 
6534	1	a	A mixture of 'halo' 'killing floor' and 'jurassic park' this game is so unbelievably fun that i can guarantee even the most boring of people 50 hours total game time if not more
239	1	a	Freeroaming, chaos inspiring &amp; able to do what ever you like, you can mess around and not do the story if you like with this game.
271	1	a	*Can crack open reinforced tank with elbow in single blow* *Can't just break down the door to the stupid military base*  9/10 for military realism
5440	1	a	Cool because it has dinosaurs
6432	1	a	Sorry to say but this game is really bad, my advise: stay away from it.
421	1	a	I've come to call this 'Assassin's Creed: Imma Eviscerate and Eat You edition.' Drags a bit in the middle, but overall a fun sandbox murderfest.
1180	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
1252	1	a	  Absolute masterpiece. One of the single greatest games i have ever had the joy of being able to play. Its portal mixed with mario on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ flash engine with awful graphics and puzzles an autistic person could solve blindfolded. 10/10
1229	1	a	This is a videogame.
1682	1	a	Jet packs and Dinosaurs. What else do you need?
2990	1	a	People are being to hard on the game, even in its early stage it was stupid fun. you dont dis oldschool games for having bad animations, graphics, and lack of story. you enjoy this game because its good killing floor dino killing fun
3931	1	a	This game rocks. The graphics aren't top notch, but who cares? Battles are fun and addictive and it's awesome to kill a T-Rex by yourself :) For 1$ this is a super bargain!
4262	1	a	Played for 5 mins got bored. ^^ Whoops left my comp on  I I I  I I I  I I I
3118	1	a	What could be better than shooting dinosaurs with awesome fun weapons? Although not highly polished, this game is great fun.
30	1	a	I absolutely love this series, and I would recommend it to any point-and-click adventure fan. As long as your ready to deal with dosbox problems (which I find stupid), but if you can't wrap your head around it, buy it at a discount price.
1150	1	a	It's 2 dollars and could probably be worth 5. Spend the money! Super fun concept in this game.
5144	1	a	It's pretty sketchy if you have a laptop full of crap but works nicely for Desktop.  not much conplaining but if you play with a laggy friend that has  a slow laptop, on top of that a whole party (plz for your sake don't ask!) with laggmiksagqarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr all over there laptop.   (.nur dna lla meht lliK)      Desktop: 8/10 play then  laptop: 6/10 kill your friend.....
6416	1	a	It was great ^^
2099	1	a	Jurassic Park meets Starship Troopers, WITH elevator music; what more can a man ask for? Oh, did I forget to mention, I am the only person playing this game on planet Earth.
2589	1	a	This is my favourite game that definitely isn't similar to Halo if Halo had dinosaurs in it.
196	1	a	-takes old lady- -climbs tall building- -aims at helicopter- -throws old lady at helicopter- -it explodes in a giant ball of gas and blood- -jumps off building- -elbow drops a cop car- -wins-
5377	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME!!!!   That is all.
5128	1	a	It doesnÂ´t seem a complete game, it has a lot to improve. But itÂ´s cheap and funny, worth the price ^^
2702	1	a	especially great if YOU DONT WANT IT TO WORK
5821	1	a	Killed a Pterodactyl with a lightsaber 10/10
223	1	a	It's like Infamous.
3470	0	a	Not only is the controller so horribly optimised that you can't use your controler in any menu, but the game literally crashes every 5-8 minutes... and I have a $2,200 PC.  .2/1 Morgan Freeman's :(
1914	1	a	A split between Halo &amp; Primal Carnage. Great Game!!
706	1	a	surprisingly fun - something you can play while you have your lunch
5788	1	a	It's not bad.
1017	0	a	This piece of crap goes with a hard lock of mouse filter (meaning coursor movement is forcefully smoothed and sharp aiming is impossible). Be aware!
4904	1	a	I love it, worth all of the 0.99 cents i spent +50. The gameplay is fun, killing dinosaurs in mechs, tanks, aircrafts, with bows, lmgs, rocketlaunchers, 3 classes.. It's awesome. Don't see what all the hate is about.
738	0	a	'A call button... purple maybe....'  OPTION A: *PRESS IT?* OPTION B: *DON'T PRESS IT?*  *SELECTED: OPTION A*  '...PRESS it...!' *Presses button.  And then... well... yes.  CONS:   1) Bad voice acting: Atrocious. 2) Gordon Ramsay didn't give his permission to be the main character, or in costume. 3) The ending.  PROS:   1) It's so stupid it's amusing at times. 2) A dog is a scholar, apparently.  Do I recommend? Oh gawd, no.   Was it gifted to you? Good luck with that!  ..then again, it's so bad it's amusing... watch a 'Let's Play' or something instead :)
5083	1	a	My expectation were low as I bought this game for only 0,80$... But its been a big suprise as I think this game is awesome. Its pretty simple, the learning curve is low and its nothing new. But I found myself getting addicted to simple but yet fun gameplay. If you bought it just because it was cheap really give it a try!
65	0	a	Do not waste your money, unless you enjoy the puzzle of configurations to get it to work.  This has not been designed to work on modern computers and requires significant manual effort.  I feel I have been ripped off.
3421	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
1222	0	a	I hate when I accidently go into a portal and I have to start over to get all matters.
2522	1	a	Great CO-OP Game. For less than $3 it's a must have! Buy the four pack and you have a night full of fun with friends. Like COD:Zombies? Then Get This Game!
4431	1	a	Someone get that sniper.
6260	1	a	This game is like a cheap mexican restraunt with good food. Once you get through the disgusting parts it is great. So please don't hate it because of lag get a few of your friends and it is really fun.
4109	0	a	Yeah 0,99â¬ Is still to much for this shity game!
2879	1	a	I rode around and killed a T-rex on my jeep with a machine gun mounted on it, shortly after, a Triceratops came from around a rock and ambushed it, hurling it 50 feet up into the air. It then blew up and i nearly died but escaped. Once out I hid in a dead stegosaurus's hollow body to shelter from the hordes of raptors. 10/10 especially with friends
6415	1	a	This is a really fun game!
399	0	a	Does not work on pirated versions of windows, would not reccomend
854	1	a	I liked the first one more but that's probably because this one is really anal about using a 360 controller.
3446	1	a	It's a very enjoyable dinosaur survival game, but it does have microtransactions and that is not what i was expecting from a game 9/10
332	0	a	I didn't run into any of the porting bugs (resoluion, sound, graphic, et al) but the story and game plan on this are hard to suggest to anyone that values their time.
3211	1	a	It's basically Bioshock 2 except there are Dinosaurs. 10/10
1144	1	a	Beep  Pros: -Great art -Easy gameplay -Cheap -Trading card  Cons: -None (imo)  Summary: this is a puzzle game with some arcade. the art is great. the gameplay is easy. This game got some trading card too so its worth it.  9/10
3587	0	a	Even if you were being paid to play it, it would not be worth it.
4895	1	a	I belive it used to be $10.99 when I got it. Good game though.
5378	0	a	I DON'T LIKE POLONIZE
4941	0	a	I really wish someone would've tagged this game with a 'Horror' tag before I bought it. I bought it today to play with my friend, then all of a sudden bloody raptors come screaming and trying to kill me! I was so horrified I literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants. Please tag this game with a horror tag to avoid such things happening again in the future.
5970	1	a	9/10 This game is incredible! Dinos 10 times your size all waiting for the chance to tear you to pieces. This is with out a doubt my favorite dinosaur game of all time. If it only had some more boss dinos...
597	1	a	Badass game if you like to kill soldiers like a crazy and kill infecteds like a Badass Also a good game if you like parkours!
2263	1	a	hit and run, but teamwork is better :)
4912	0	a	No Dont
5945	0	a	It's boring, too repetitive, dinos come in waves and that's pretty much it, because I don't even know what's the point of the game or what do I have to do because there's no tutorial or introduction. Thank god I only paid 0.59â¬ and can get back some of it from the cards. Not to mention it crashes if I try to play it on fullscreen for some reason.
3004	1	a	Awesome. You should play this.
1844	1	a	Like Halo But with Dinosuars,  I like it. :D Nuff Said~
862	1	a	2D brawler with sense of humor. Kick some â¥â¥â¥'s with this very well made game.
1107	1	a	This game is sooooooooo BRILLIANT! Its addicting like addicting games and coolmath games and that one game RUN 2!
2950	1	a	This game had a horrendous start. The developers; however, stuck with it. They are constantly working to fix issues, and add new content. They also crave community feedback. It's nice to be a part of a game like that. The game is immensely fun. The visuals aren't the best, but they are quite adequate. The animations (raptors) are laughable, but the solid gameplay, large variety of weapons, the different playstyles of the classes, map and mode variety, and the occasional hilarious bug (i.e. a Rex that flies threw the air upon death) make this game an incredible experience that I keep coming back to. Grab some friends or lone wolf it and frag some dinos!
3601	1	a	}Double Kill }Triple Kill }Monster Kill }Uber Kill }' Bring me some pizza '... Â¿WTF?.   Would bring some pizza to a multi killer and get 360 no-scoped by a T-Rex rock again.
1708	1	a	Its Halo if the main objective was to survive/eliminate The Flood. More or less.  Only fun when you play multiplayer, so be sure you have friends willing to try it and get the 4-pack!  
1959	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ies game ever made just buy it
4113	0	a	uhhh. dafuq is this halo/cod zombie remake?
4334	1	a	IT WAS $.99!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5169	1	a	nice game for a quick and fun play
4302	1	a	Very VERY fun to play.
4528	0	a	it does not work on my screen so i cant play it
354	0	a	Crashes upon starting a new game or loading a save
5183	1	a	my first payd game on steam and is BEST!!!
2650	1	a	This game is way better than you expect. I bought the 4 pack for $.59 and had to convince people to play it. Everyone thinks its going to suck because its cheap. The 3 copies I gave away all three liked the game very much. The game is not perfect but if you have a couple friends and want to kill some time this is fantastic. Even at $1 this game is a winner. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a coop shooter. Game in a nutshell: dinos, tons of weapons, vehicles, survive. Im going to pick up the next orion game because I like this one so much.
2045	1	a	Pretty fun and big game and it was only 0.39 $  I think its totally worth a buy!!!
4784	1	a	Great game,  to idle for cards.
677	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
5298	1	a	15 out of 10 stars.best game i've ever played!whats better than lag, bugs, and dinosaurs!worth the fifteen dollars.
5354	1	a	it be cool yo
1496	1	a	But sh*t, it was 99 cents.
5958	1	a	BEST AND MOST FUN AND AWESOME DINOSAUR GAME THEIR IS OUT THEIR IN THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DINO/10 :D XD
6378	1	a	Caught it on sale for 50 cents. I do not regret my purchase.
4641	0	a	dinosaurs had feathers  this game has no feathers
3866	0	a	I was foolish enough to buy this game because I thought it would be a laugh. I was wrong. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective. Take the objective.

739	1	a	This was a very dull game. There was no humor that I could tell. The dialog was dull and boring and very mono toned. It was as basic as you can get with a clicking game that did not have alot to explore. The overall game was really hard to understand what was going on and what the main objective was. There are 4 different endings to this game so that is the one thing i found enjoyable. It was really hard to understand were to go and what to do in the game while playing since the dialogue didn't give much hint to it. The graphics were decent for how old this game looked and played. The music came in at the worst times. The only mini game that was enjoyable with this game was billiards, but that had its downfall due to the computer having mad skills when it needed them. It was a complicated point and click game that wasn't satisfying at all. I kind of wished I didn't buy this one but am glad I finished the game to tell you guys not to buy it, even if you are a fan of this genre.
3258	0	a	Should've been free. To many bugs and lag if you ask me
2243	1	a	This game's PVP feature is extremely limited. However, I found the cooperation of the survival mode quite challenging and enjoyable for hours making it a worthwhile purchase. If you want a shooter that is unique while still familiar, this is definately worth trying.
3483	0	a	Steam should be ashamed to have this in the marketplace.  Worst game that has ever been made.
4885	1	a	The dinosaurs are just too easy to kill. Except for those god damn flying things. Worst enemies I have encountered yet. Think you can shoot them? No, they'll just fly out of aiming range. Think you can melee them? No, they'lll just warp through your fists unharmed. Think you can learn to aim and dead them? No, the game will turn to night out of nowhere and start raining so you can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥. These â¥â¥â¥â¥s are the bain of my existence and should be eradicated from existence. Thank â¥â¥â¥â¥ they were along with all the other dino â¥â¥â¥â¥s millions of years ago. They can all â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.      Buy it now. 
2615	1	a	Come on d00d, its a dollar, need I say more?
165	1	a	Realy fun game, if you like open world combined with beat em up, this is the game for you. It isnt GTA-Like though, all you cant buy stuff or anything.... if id have to compare it to games, i would say Infamous on PS3 is very similar... Story isnt realy big unless you do all the assimilation thing. Yeah so i feel its worth giving it a try, on my side, i liked it a lot but PC controls arent so good (read under)   'Cons' - Mouse and Keyboard controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥, they lag for some reason (and im using good material, W8, I7 core, 12GB ram, 1To Disc Space, Good graphic card. Gaming mouse and Gaming Keyboard + Headset.), they wont stop you from playing but will hinder your experiance a bit. I then decided to use a Gamepad, it worked realy well and felt like the console version. You can either use an Xbox 360 controler, or use Motioninjoy's DS3 Tool (which i was using) to emulate a 360 controler with your PS3 controler, you probably could use a logitec controler or something like that but im not sure.
2807	1	a	Very glad this developer stuck with their game, they have turned it into something unique and fun. Nothing like gathering some friends and taking on hordes of dinosaurs together. A solid FPS action, my heart still pumps when i see a T-Rex trying the bite my head off and the panic when a pterodactyl grabs and flys you high in the sky. Great price as well.
1515	1	a	This game is really freaking awesome. The metascore is bull!! This game has been remade from the start. Great Survival Action against dino's. Great weapons ,upgrades and vehicles. Ill do a larger review later, get it basically for free now!! 99 cents is more than a steal!!
5349	1	a	I can pistol whip a raptor in the face  11/10
1330	1	a	BEEP is very good game because it's very fun and easy.
6166	1	a	Very fun and tactical game. Many diffrent things to do from killing dinos, buying guns, buying perks, driving cars, flying planes, controlling mech suits, being dinosaurs and KILLING MORE DINOS!
2513	1	a	Best game ever made! buy it now its awsome :)
845	1	a	Great Platformer and time-shoter :D
3554	0	a	First off, The devs of this game, Absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Everytime this game gets too many Negative reviews on steam or Metacritic they 'Update' The game (Breaking it even more) and give it a new name. The HUD? Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
4706	0	a	There is a reason this game is $1  Firstly, for a multiplayer game there are rougly 20 servers at any given time, oh and about 18 of those are above 200 ping.  Secondly, the graphics are awful, they would have been acceptable about ten years ago. The game mode balance is hoorendous, some modes being ridiculously hard for the dino's, some the other way round. The gameplay is slow, clunky and badly designed. There is nothing good about this game, go and play ARK survival evolved as it is a much superior game.
6488	1	a	This game is actually pretty fun. It's by no means perfect, but I definitely don't think that the game deserves the low scores that it is getting. Also considering you can pick this game up for cheap on sales (I got it for $1) there is really no reason not to give this game a try. No it's not a AAA title. No it's not going to replace your favorite game, but it's an interesting game that is enjoyable and has a low entry price which is a win in my book.
3025	1	a	It's an OK game.Definately worth 0,99$.You will have fun for a couple of hours.
6148	1	a	Great game! Got hooked on my first game! If you like team based shoot em ups or fps games then you're getting way MORE than your money's worth with this game. The graphics are okay, gameplay is solid, the upgrade system is interesting. This game is good if you want to burn some steam off!
4186	0	a	I thinkt the fact that the creator had to use Imovie to make the trailer says alot about this games budget
5117	1	a	if you can get it cheap buy it, the game its fun to play with friends and it's dirt cheap.
3768	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, funny for half an hour but doesn't excuse it for sucking. Bought it out of curiosity, wasted my money.
3196	1	a	I remember getting this game when it was worth much more than 99 cents. Was fun while it lasted but for 99c, it is very much worth it even though I bought it at a much greater price. From killing dinosaurs to an all out pvp this game is worth a try.    5/10  
5078	1	a	This game is actually Funâ¢.
3319	0	a	Don't waste your time.
1840	1	a	Absolutely worth the money while its on offer 99p or 75p is such a bargain for this game, and has a fantastic multiplayer element to it, and its easy to set up your own servers and start playing right away! Definately buy if you want a fun multiplayer game to play with your friends :)
3108	0	a	omg i am buy this game and now free wtf
2089	1	a	Driving a buggy with a friend off a cliff and into a horde of Raptors, T-rex and Triceratop. The buggy flipped over and we both died. Best 50 cents ever spent!  10/10 would drive without license again.
5043	1	a	I like it and hate it.I hate it LAG!!!Like it becuase its cool just not with all the LAG going on, is there a way u can change it to 64. bit? :3/&gt;:[.Plz dont remove it, I just hate the LAG!!!
694	1	a	The gameplay is very unquie and is great for people who love card games/deck building games. 1 part solitaire, 1 part poker and adds abilties on top of that.  Downside- Game is not really difficult and the achievement Runespell XL: Play all battles once, has to be done during a single campaign. Which is diffcult as certain enemies only appear at certain times.
3668	1	a	Love the game, good graphics and nice bots, but id like to have more colors and able to change them for free. Still, u cant get a better game for 1euro.
3067	0	a	spend my immortal dota item for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game its sucks
6578	1	a	A little rouch around the edges but fun to play in small intervals. The price tag is a bit steep for the product that is offered, although the developers do keep updating the game. Hopefully this game will evolve into a more polished experience.
141	1	a	A fun open world hack and slash game.  Pros: +Amazing movement and freerunning +Fun open world to explore +Plenty of stuff to destroy +Huge variety of fun moves ways to kill people +Lots of cool upgrades and powers +Killing people feels REALLY good  Cons: -Story is mediocre -Combat is sometimes clunky -Escort missions -Unnecessary use of driving vehicles and shooting firearms -A lot of escort missions -Repetitive side missions -DIFFICULT VEHICLE ESCORT MISSIONS  Total score 7/10. Buy it if it's on sale and enjoy slashing people to bits, but be wary of escort missions.
5319	0	a	As hopeful as i was for this game, it did not turn out so well.  Playability is 1/10 because once you find the groove you can easily win any game mode.  Graphics is decent 5/10  UI is about 6/10 but vastly could do for some maintance with some buggy area's.  Lobby and Server waits/connect is 2/10 because it seemed like the first two times booting up it didn't let me join or respond to click imput.  Overall 3/10 because it doesn't suck you in and has you replaying over and over. If you really want to try it out, wait for free trial periods then if you want to buy, get it on sale because 15 bucks is way to much for a sub par Killing Floor type game.
5794	0	a	Sucks.  generic fps with dinosaurs guns sound like airsoft sounds are gross vehicles are clunky or overpowered stores are meh its not satisfying  2/10
3229	1	a	I punched Spinosaurus to death. 10/10
3022	0	a	First of all I had to pay for this game, then it becomes free and then I couldn't get a refund for this game. After some couple of months they want you to pay for this.  These devs like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up alot, like they did when they released this game In the begining. It's the only thing they're good at. I used to like this game and It's cool to see that they supported It for so long when they got â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by people whom bought at the begining. But now it's just a lost cause.
4851	0	a	This game is bad and I mean BAD. The dinosaurs are either know where you are they act stupid. It seems that they attack with the force because when raptors hit the arms don't move. The dinosaurs are just plain out OP.
3546	0	a	What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this mess? Honestly, this is the worst game I've ever played on steam.
4915	0	a	I want a refund, il take it in a ramen noodle pack or a can of coke
4723	1	a	This is great game that is also cheap.
5095	1	a	Like dinosaurs? What about laser guns? Or maybe fast and strong vehicles? Yes? Then this is the game for you! 10/10
5973	1	a	awesome fun gameplay 10/10
5659	0	a	This game is a very poor, POOR game. It runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my PC which was 600 euros a year ago which handles BF3 on high at 60 but nevertheless, I can't understand why this game makes my GPU cry in horror, the textures are beyond â¥â¥â¥â¥. This game looks like an early PS2 game. It looks like GTA Vice City in terms of texture work, and to be honest Vice City is kind of beating Orion: Dino Horde or 'Orion:Prelude' to make people think its not the same â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The game is utterly boring. Wave after wave after wafe after wave of uninspiring enemies that look like they came from a Jurrasic Park movie...that was made in 1950. Its only wave of murdering t-rex after t-rex. The guns are all about the same, I only used the Dual pistols to feel like Max Payne, which didn't really work. There is absolutely nothing good about this game, NOT EVEN THE NET CODE. Me and my friend were trying to play together, we are both in Dublin and I was getting a ping of about 200.  0/10 DO NOT BUY.
2736	1	a	I love this game its really fun and I didn't find out about the special abilities until I was playing rampage and I accidentally pressed LCTRL, and yes I know I'm a dinosaur but I don't care what others thinks.
3565	0	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad, I wouldn't give it to my one year old neice to play. Everything about this game is absolutely terrible and is broken to â¥â¥â¥â¥. How the hell did they charge $20 for this game when it came out, This isn't even worth it being free; it's just a peice of garbage on my computer. But as for the game play driving a car sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ and is laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥, every gun is absolutely useless and doesn't work, many of the animations are broken; and they're making another one! That's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. Please nobody buy this game, don't even consider looking at it at all; it's not even worth the space on your hard drive. I played almost an hour of this and I regret every second of looking at it.
973	1	a	Love this game
2996	0	a	Is it worth 50 cents on sale? maybe Is it worth the time invested to install, boot up load and play? Not really.
2816	1	a	It has dinosaurs. And guns. And I got it for free.
5008	1	a	It was so bad, that I thought Infinite Warfare had been released early.
3818	0	a	  THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME BLOWED MY EYES AND CAUSES TO ME A MENTAL PROBLEM
5792	1	a	I actually change my mind. At first didnÂ´t like it, but well it is that cheap that you can have a go. It will bring you fun for a few hours
3627	0	a	The game uses stolen assets. Negative reviews are being swept under the carpet to keep the game from looking bad. They are currently suffering from a DMCA because of stolen assets, again. Just stay the fudge away from this game and don't ever support this developer or publisher, they have dishonest morals.
1787	1	a	Fricking Awesome!SO MUCH FUN!I THINK I'M HAVING AN â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!This game has good graphics,A variety of Dinosaurs,Lots of guns and weapons,different and fun gamemodes,Cool Maps,enough server slots and just DAMN FUN! It's worth the $14.00 and on sale it goes for only $1.00!Honestly,if you bought it and didn't like it comment down below(Be truthfull please).WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO BUY IT AND GET IN ON THE FUN! My Rating For ORION:Dino Horde: 10/10 (THE METASCORE IS SO DAMN MISLEADING!!!!)
32	1	a	No matter how many times I go back to these games, they never get old. Classics through and through.
326	1	a	Viral infection in a sandbox world 10/10
4531	0	a	Aside from the dev being super shady, this game is just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it's price suggests.
733	1	a	Poker styled card attacking game...  If that hasn't sold you then i don't know what will.  Definatly a 9/10!
1636	1	a	WORTH BUYING!! 10/10  Highly recommend this game, I simple love playing it! - Reminds me of playing UT - Reminds me of playing Halo  - Reminds me of playing Killing Floor. - But most importantly it reminds me of playing Turok back in the days on the N64 &lt;3  This game is very underrated, metascore 90/100, easy..   Way better then the high priced games in my list, so why are you still reading instead of buying? HURRY UP AND BUY!
1171	1	a	It's really good for a cheap game. Well made little platformer. I like it!  7/10
3562	0	a	First off, The devs of this game, Absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Everytime this game gets too many Negative reviews on steam or Metacritic they 'Update' The game (Breaking it even more) and give it a new name. The HUD? Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. They were too lazy to change the Menu icons to keys instead of xbox buttons. Even when you have this game at the highest settings it still looks like it was made in 2006. The lack of difficulty is baffling also. After killing a few of the easiest dinos you can go and grab yourself An lmg, SMG and upgrades to your ability that is determined by one of the 3 classes.  TL;DR: Its a terrible port from the 360. Barely even worth $1. I Got it for $0.27 and i would gladley take it back.  Update: Many people cannot gandle the truth
2191	1	a	Dinosaurs and Lightsabers. $1. I have no regrets.  11.5/10
3202	1	a	Bought this game as it was on offer and it was well worth buying. Anyone into mmo/fps games should buy this game.
2423	1	a	Cuddly baby dinosaurs rampaging around to chaw your d!ck off. Would recommend.
6430	0	a	Its an OK game but thats it just OK. Nothing to write home about.   You start off with just a pistol. Really?!? And there is no way to play with just a controller you can fire with the controller but cant interact with anything eithout a keyboard so whats the point.   Visually it looks nice, not the best but not the worst either.   Worth $0.99? Eh, maybe. However, I dont find this to be something I would keep coming back to.
5206	1	a	it's a bit buggy and sometimes not that pretty, but it can be really fun to play!
4005	1	a	Halo totally ripped off of this masterpiece of a game, sad to see sell outs these days. Play the original FPS Orion: Dino Horde today 10/10 must buy
5200	1	a	This is a must have for your game library. You will get countless hours of enjoyment out of 99 cents. There are other game modes besides survival and great online community.
5210	1	a	Even though the Game is very cheap (1â¬, u wot m8), its actually fun to play. While its not the best in means of graphics or gameplay mechanics, who cares? You can fight a T-Rex by just hitting him with your itsy-bitsy gun, or shred a small Dino with your Rocket Launcher to pieces.
3153	1	a	nice game for the price :)
1316	0	a	I wish I could write a review about what the game was like, but It wouldn't work so its impossible. Im disappointed that I wasted my emoticons to buy this game for 19 cents.
1992	1	a	The graphics remind me of Borderlands. Very fun, and is better than some of my other games that cost way more. Def a game everyone should pick up and try.
3476	0	a	No tutorial, play/pay to win mechanic, choppy effects when using jetpack, odd UI, spectator mode can't move through walls and is slow as molasses, and buggy weapon issue (with primary not reloading).
488	1	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome
4375	0	a	This game poopy.
5613	1	a	it's great but i didn't get time to play it much. 
2284	1	a	Fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥, ignore the metacritic â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you like horde mode games, this is the â¥â¥â¥â¥
6495	1	a	I bought this game during the free week event. After trying the free version for one hour, I realized that it was good enough to spend one dollar on it. Well, I was mistaken. This game is worth its full price. Actually I love it. Maybe the graphics are not according to the new generation but that is not important for me. Once some bugs are fixed, I think this game is going to become one of my favourites. If you like games like counter strike, buy this one, you will like it too.
5822	0	a	Eh... it's a dollar. Grab it, have a bit of fun with it.  Honestly though, I just didn't find it fun. It's still really unpolished and clunky.  The menus are just horrible. Both in looks and in feel. The customization menu is terrible. Like... it all works, it's just not an enjoyable experience.  It's hard to complain about it considering the price, but it's just annoying to look at.  
2081	1	a	Awesome Co-Op game. Don't rely on Metacritic only. The game rocks!
5584	1	a	It's an alright game.
1182	1	a	good game! you will smart by playing this brain games
5352	1	a	10/10 would shoot dinos again, hey thats rhymes
259	1	a	unleash the inner edgy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ inside you when nobody liked your sub-par tumblr share  10/10 fun for the WHOLE FAMILIO
2220	1	a	Good game, and the developer still updating the game. it's fun, awesome plane, tanks, and robot. Kill the T-rex
5116	1	a	This game is so bad.
4926	1	a	A glorious game. 360 mageshot a scrub â¥â¥â¥ raptor.  10/10
49	0	a	Bought the game... feeling nostalgic... thinking.. at last.. gonna play all... I only finished 5 and 6. Ups.. game doesnt work.. try again... nope... again... nope... again...  again... again.... again... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lost of forums later..  uninstall the game and ask for a refund!
4661	0	a	this a very gud game  They have me at gun point here plz dont buy this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥     
1941	1	a	Its like jurassic park without electrical fences and space guns.
4453	1	a	This game is worth 100 times more than it cost. Best player: Assault Best gun: AWP for 15k Upgrade gun in weapon shop for 20k Upgrade urself for more than 30k EASY MATCH!
1767	1	a	It was $0.50 on sale for the best 2 hours of my life
5803	1	a	'There are two conditions: first, I'm in charge. All you have to do is sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition: my fee? You can keep it. All I want in return for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male, a buck only. How and when is my business. Now if you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. So go ahead, set up base camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas, OK?' 
5734	1	a	This game was the most fun I've had gaming with my friends in a long time! Hours of ridiculous dino hunting will be had in the future.
66	0	a	Awful, total waste of money, hasnt run, wont run and support non-exsitent 
1047	1	a	Great Game. I need Warp 2 now!
2381	1	a	Not a bad pick for $1.25. Very similar to the first 2 Halos (guns, vehicle that looks lke the warthog). If you play with friends it's fun, and having cards is a plus also. $10 or more isn't worth it however.
3035	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer... I have cancer
384	0	a	Runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the work around to get it to a point that's playable is stupid. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
3086	0	a	It cost me less than the price of a Mars bar, Im pretty sure a Mars bar has more thought put in to its coding. It lags, it hangs, it crashes harder than a malasian airlines passenger jet. The Gameplay is dull and repetative, with no clear direction given on how to complete given tasks. In short, save your money, go buy a Mars Bar!
1997	0	a	This is the worst game since I played Apocalyptica back in 2003. I don't understand how it is worth more than 10 cents. It should be free, or the developers should pay me money to compensate for my suffering.
3598	1	a	Best played in Co-op...
5992	1	a	Very very very very very very very..............AWESOME !!!! P.S ITS AWESOME (GET IT NOW OR ELSE!)      (If you like FPS you will like it because it ROCKS!!!)
5709	1	a	Co-op dino fighting! Radness.
4389	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME
4815	0	a	Like a poor man's Evolve. A VERY poor man. Just terrible connectivity, the menus are a mess, the dinosaurs are all glitching across the field; It's near impossible to shoot a pterodactyl. This one is an AVOID game.
274	1	a	The movies are sooo choppy though!! Fun so far but idk what's going on in the story line because the audio cuts in and out during the movies. Anyone know how to fix this? Let me know please.
3750	1	a	WTF Valve? Where is my game what i got for free? Return me back!!
5949	1	a	Do you want to shoot T-Rex with RPG? Or slash Stegosaurus with lightsaber? Or rather just casually drive throught hordes of small dinos in a tank? Then look no more as this is game just for you! And i cost just about â¬0,50 Absolute WINRAR
581	1	a	I was so chuffed as i had not realised this game was released for pc. I remember being quite jealous of those being able to play it on console and it does not disappoint. The graphs are great , burning my laptop into the table. Some very innovative ideas for gameplay,. Multiple layers of progress and of corse and most importantly, lots and lots of gore, gibblets and oozing splays of body mattter all over the place. I love the idea of being able to smash a tank with my malformed chunder fists. Reap my disease infested body, armpits and all.
3208	1	a	I've only played this game for a few hours but it's okay so far. Not great, but not that bad.  You can play alone, with bots, or with humans. Waves of dinosaurs spawn in and you have to defend your base whilst shooting them. Some fly, some run, and some are just big. You get credits for killing them, which you can spend between waves at the weapon bases.   There are vehicles you and your team mates can use to travel around the map, and some of them you can fire from by using co-op, one driving, and one shooting etc.  After a few waves, better vehicles are unlocked.   Tips:  + Revive team mates + If you die during the wave, you lose your guns when you respawn + Dead team mates drop their guns ;) (lol) + Headshots do more damage + Use the Augment shop to upgrade your player + Shoot everything, buy the best guns + Stay off the ground level unless you're feeling brave 
4085	0	a	No dont get this game this is a wast of time and money this game will not let you play it and worst game ever in history and never should have been invented in the first place screw this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5700	0	a	An improvement atleast
4326	1	a	So, i just downloaded the game and actualy payed the money to keep it in my library. If you are obsessed with polished graphics, effect, animation etc. Get out of here right now, this is not your game. While having some decent graphics, they actually look very dated and the animation are very sloppy and baddly done.  But the thing is, if you don't look very much into those aspects, it's a pretty decent game to have fun for a while.  The modes are pretty fun and killing waves and waves of dinos keeps you playing for a good while. It's kind of addicting! It remembers me Killing Floor but with dinos. Kill waves, after the waves arm up, repeat.  Is it worth it? maybe. For me it's worth it. i really like the game!   Pros: Addicting Tons of fun DINOS! MORE DINOS! vehicles (actualy this would go in the 'meh' section)  cons: Animations are crap Graphics look like from a 2008/2010 game, not a modern game.  Veredict: A nice game if you want to play something different since most games like this are just about zombies etc. It's a nice alternative! and as i said, if you don't put importance to the graphics and the animations, try it out! And more now because it's just 0.99$!  6.5/10 
1149	1	a	Good game, a little too short tho. 8/10.
4225	0	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a fun game even solo I enjoyed the gameplay and the wave after wave of dinosaurs heading toward me with killer intent BUT then it started crashing. After about 2 hours or so after playing I took a break and started up my steam account and launched the game only too have it freeze on me every 5 or so minutes. One of my friend's computer started doing the same thing later on. My computer can run most games on their highest settings but even turning down the graphic to a lower setting did not help. The developers need too fix these bugs if so they'll have a enjoyable multiplayer game on there hands
2765	1	a	REALLY CHEAP, REALLY FUN. MUST BUY FOR THE MONEY!!
1705	1	a	if you bought this game before last month and thought it was â¥â¥â¥â¥, you're right. play it again and it just gets better every match
2500	1	a	cant even start, game of the year 10/10
4562	0	a	ORION: Prelude is a game about people fighting dinosuars in multiple game modes with weapon upgrades and player buffs as well as having the ability to play as a Dinosaur from Raptors to the giant Spinosuarus. On the surface, it seems really fun and a LOT like Primal Carnage, but this game is VERY buggy, which probably explains why it's regularly 99 cents. (I got it for 40 cents on sale.) There are very bad camera glitches as a dinosuar that make playing correctly impossible with the only solutions being either dying or re-joining the game. It's also isn't very balanced with players on the dinosuar side being able to pick boss dinosuars like the T-rex and Spinosuarus from the get-go, which are dinosuars that are VERY hard to kill with starter weapons. The textures aren't that great, the controls, especially for the Dinosuars, are very bad, the animations will kill you on the inside, and it gets very boring after a short ammount of time. This game may be cheaper, but I'd save for Primal Carnage or The Isle if you want to play a Dinosuar survival game. This game DOES give you lots of easy awards, though. So, there's that.
2698	1	a	The new update(s) have definitely put this game on a better place than what it's earned on Metacritic. It's what the newest trailer explains: Killing Floor x Halo mechanics vs Dinosaurs. If you haven't tried it yet, do so.
2139	1	a	this game is so good it makes my nipples          happy
6379	1	a	Now this game is actually pretty fun. With its ok graphics and somewhat buggy gameplay, it's actually quite fun to play. The basic idea is that you and your friends are the survivors, and waves of dinosaurs come at you. It's an fps-game, so a pretty familiar idea for many. There are three 'classes' or so in the game, and each has its own perks; a jetpack, a medigun and going invisible. However, there are a few problems with the game. I'm from Europe, and there aren't really that many servers close to here. Most of the servers on the list have over 100, over 200 ping. And another problem, at least for some, is the buggy gameplay. However, I really didn't seek for an awesome storyline or the sickest online game when paying like 1 euro for this game. Still pretty fun to play, 7,5/10
726	1	a	Cool game. If you like poker, buy this.
6119	1	a	'vrooom vroon' - the sound of the hexagon makes as you dreive out of the garage. you take a left turn, then a right, bulling onto the main road you know so well. you join the same traffic queue you always do, changing a lane here, making a mistake on the changing of the lane there. n ot a big mistake though. you come off of the road at the exit and get into the work area. where your office is. 'hello' you say to no one in particular. orion prelude is a video game where you shoot dinosaurs a lot and have an exist until you die from a dinosaur byte. there is a building you can climb which reminds me of other struggles in my life also.
6409	0	a	Controller support is laughable at most... 'USE' was not mapped out by default and there are no options that allow me to invert the axis or sensitivity. Those alone make this game not even worth .99 to me.
160	1	a	fun game a little buggy with the sound but really fun
3759	0	a	lame all around. bad graphics, bad game play, hardly have time to grab new weapons even. does not allow you to level up//no story line or campain mode.
600	1	a	Prototype is an awesome game. What you do in it is run around and shape shift everywhere. You can unlock new abilities and stuff. Its a lot like Saints Row 4 and you should play it if you love superhero games.
5777	1	a	Truly worth getting  This is Were HALO meets Zombies Then Zombies Replaced With Dinosaurs
137	1	a	This is a lost gem. I don't know why nobody speak well about this game. It's a way more destruction and power than mostly new games...
4337	1	a	Halarious game. The ragdoll physics are especially funny. Nothing better than punching a dead t-rex into a tree with a car.
6337	1	a	Nice. This game is so fun.
2348	1	a	First things first, before I go into detail about my experience with the game there are a few things that you need to know:    This is a niche FPS/TPS game    While it has PvP options, the focus is PvE    There are enough glitches and bugs in the game that it feels more like an Early Access title   With that here is a bit of information about this game.    Pros:
380	0	a	Buy Prototype 2 instead. The original is a terrible game - as the game progresses, they use more and more cheap methods to prevent you from getting your attacks off - interrupt upon interrupt upon interrupt. Your targeting seems to target the WORST possible targets, no matter what weapon you use. Again, this happens more and more as the game progresses. This game sucks. Prototype 2 on the other hand, is a fantastic game.  Don't buy this stinker. Save your money, and use it to buy Prototype 2.
3342	1	a	Doesn't suck.
2294	1	a	An amazing game to play with friends, Dino Horde is sure to bring about some good laughs and fun times.  - Easy to set up a multiplayer game - A wide array of game modes (PvP, PvE, Co-Op) - Feels like an old school shoot'em up - Stress-less team play, no need to stick to roles and such - Passionate developers - In-game store is mostly for cosmetic items, no pay to win - Just plain fun  Overall Score: 8/10. The game still has some minor issues, but nothing game breaking, and when it comes to having a good time gaming with a couple of friends, Dino Horde is at the top of my list.
6041	1	a	This game is soo cool!
5267	0	a	I gave the game an honest shot, I really did. I just could not bring myself to liking it, it felt far too generic and shoddy. I can imagine the game being good fun for a couple of buddies on LAN but that's as far as I would go. Accounting everything from graphics, game mechanics and accessibility i'd give the game a 5/10.
4257	1	a	You have to buy this game! It's just so much fun. I played with my friend for 2 hours in a match against a robotic santa that flew overhead and dropped bombs on us. It took us over an hour to kill him!
4666	1	a	RAWR IM A DERPY DINOTARD RAWR FEAR MY FANGS AND MASSIVE DINOCOCK I WILL CRUSH YOUR PATHETIC LIFE WITH IT  somethings wrong with me, I should stop typing now
5407	1	a	Fun game, you get to shoot dinosaurs
1189	1	a	hahah what a good game! i got it for 15p, i dontn know if its worth Â£4 but Â£3 would be good. i played polarity witch was good so i looked at this game made by the same people, 1337 times better then polarity!
2534	1	a	It is a really fun game with dinosaurs. Halo with dinosaurs is the easiest way to describe it. The game is really, REALLY cheap and for that reason alone you should get this game. The optimization isn't amazing, especially since this game looks like a launch Xbox 360 title. The framerate sometimes gets pretty bad, at around 50fps, and it is bad because this game looks pretty bad. Surely, it is not too bad - definitely acceptable, but nothing too special. Anyway, you should totally get this game. It is fun, if not a little easy for some people, but worth playing for at least 4 hours.
5568	1	a	The game is about dinoasourse and shooting a t-rex can throw a rock at people i mean honestly what do you people want.
4354	1	a	'Somebody get that snoipah!'  10/10 would snipe again.
4829	0	a	YOU KNOW A GAME'S BAD WHEN THEY TRY STEALING CONTENT FROM CALL OF DUTY
4850	0	a	This is probably the worst fps i have ever played
383	0	a	Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.  I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.
2551	1	a	Good Game, worth the money!
394	0	a	Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.  Sounds 5/10 Graphics 5/10 Gameplay 6/10 Atmosphere 5/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
1085	1	a	Somehow the soundtrack is more expensive than the game itself.
434	1	a	Open world with a nice plot, great mixture of pure badassness and stealth and generally fun.
2290	1	a	A really fun game just to unwind. Simple and straightforward.   And what's not fun abt shooting dinosaurs??
5307	1	a	Well worth the price, still buggy and a work in progress but a lot of fun!
2556	1	a	I'm not entirely sure why the score is so low. I quite enjoy this game and find it to be an extremely fun romp with a friend. We played for hours and didn't want to switch to anything else!
4041	1	a	When ever those â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gigantic titan Dinos are like right on you and suddently in your face it juts makes me freak the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out and i start shaking and â¥â¥â¥â¥ O_O
4341	0	a	WTF IS THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥! DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
3741	1	a	A very cheap -er- good game.
5737	1	a	ThI$ Gaem Is sO GoOd 11/10
5791	1	a	Its really fun and has a very friendly community because most or some of you are just new to the game and its just really fun... i recommend this to anyone
3656	0	a	A-W-F-U-L GAME don't waste $1 on this crap.
3958	1	a	Logged in didnt know what to expect so i just played a solo survival start mowing through dinos then all sudden trex appears and eats me 10/10 would become trex crap again
468	1	a	Karate kicked a helicopter. Elbow dropped a tank. Killed a policeman by throwing his car at him. Killed another helicopter by throwing an old woman at it. Ate 354,729 zombies. I regret nothing.
2328	1	a	Great game but could use some updates and detication, Great for helping teamwork and some good laughs!
3496	1	a	Would vote for biggest improvent of a game I've seen.
1219	1	a	Its a fun game, good to get your mind off things :)
5234	1	a	OK i dont care what anyone says this is one of the best games for $0.99 cents after i started playing it i even forgot that i only paid $0.99 cents
1315	0	a	How many times can one game crash?  If the game is Beep, let's just say my playtime may read 8 minutes, but I've been at it for 20.  At $0.19 I feel I got a bad deal.  MY THRILLING INDIE EXPERIENCE: - Launch game - Reach main menu - Set it to windowed - It crashes immediately - Relaunch game - Set it to windowed at splash screen - It works. Amazing! What a time to be alive. - Game proceeds to crash at any provocation from dying to hitting the escape key to just because it feels like it - Have to re-window the game every launch because it never remembers - Decide it's just not worth the hassle to try to wring $0.19 cents worth of fun out of this basic â¥â¥â¥ flash game  Just go on the marketplace and buy a baller emote instead like a mouse with a hat or a sleeping goat.
4830	0	a	Not worth a dollar. These people have ripped off other companies assets and are going to get a Dino Beat Down soon enough.
2748	1	a	Punched a raptor in the face and got 125 points. 10/10
5125	1	a	it's good and cheap it's really fun online but i havn't been able to hav too much fun as both my school laptop and my 5 year old laptop are crap so i can't really judge the bugy parts cause it's probz my cpu
714	1	a	Fun game. It's not as deep as Puzzle Quest, but it's pretty fun approach to poker.
4350	0	a	I bought this game for a dollar. I wasted that dollar. When it says in the trailer that the metascore is misleading, it is correct: this game should get a much lower rating than 34.
6004	1	a	best i ever played in the history of dota
2253	1	a	I love this game. Minor glitch where you can get stuck on top of rocks, but only happened a few times. This game will keep you up all night if you are playing with friends.
837	1	a	Only played the 1st level so far, it was FREE for the weekend, and I flipping LOVED it.
2791	1	a	People got excited for titanfall, just cause it was cod with a mech. This has that mech, and then theres dinos.  Check and mate.
4345	1	a	I generally don't leave reviews but I feel inclined to show this game some support due to all the negative feedback. I don't understand all the hate on it. While it may not be the most sophisticated game by any stretch, Dino horde is good casual mindless fun. You shoot progressing waves of dinosaurs in a futuristic setting and upgrade your gear inbetween rounds.. What's not to love?  It gives a sort of old school type of fun before games were more complex. Given I can already tell this is a game I can fall back to at any time to just kill some time, it's current price is a complete bargain. In all reality I'd probably be comfortable paying 10$ or so for the game as it gives fun multiplayer but lacks any depth.  Any how... It's a fun game. If you can get it on sale do it, at the very least you'll put an hour or so into it and for a buck i'd say its worth it.
498	1	a	22 hours to beat.  if u have a 360 controller and a good gaming rig then :   Holy wow... just WOW!
458	1	a	A long time ago....  It was the great action game.  May the force be with you.
5941	1	a	great and fun Coop game - a bargain for ~1â¬
311	0	a	Really good for the first two thirds, except for a couple of difficulty spikes, but the last third of the game is awful. These developers had no idea how to do difficulty right.
3061	1	a	Stabbed a Velosoraptor in the face then promptlly got eaten whole by a T-rex 10/10 would stab again
6222	1	a	Frickin' sweet. Six Words: Best Halo instant kill melee simulator.
1460	1	a	Lovely little game. After playing only 40 minutes of it and beating just one half of a planet I can already tell that it's great fun not only for kids. I'm very excited for difficulties and puzzles to come! Also the fact that BEEP says 'Beam me up Scotty!' from time to time at the end of a level helps a lot and with a final grade and I didn't even watch Star Trek.
1388	1	a	This game is literally the definition of weird. You play as a robot, fight other robots, can partially fly, and as a little side-note it is a platformer. This game has only one shortcoming, one that every platformer has... every time you fall off the damn edge.
4289	0	a	Started off â¥â¥â¥â¥, became good after some love and craft, now it's gone to â¥â¥â¥â¥ once again. The weather effects alone ruined everything.
1499	1	a	Some advice:  1) Kill the flying jerks first. The larger ones can pick you up and drop you out of the sky. Very disconcerting.  2) If you get picked up by a large flying jerk, melee it. It will drop you.  3) T-Rex's can 360 no-scope you with rocks. Keep your rear end in motion.  4) Save up your dough and buy the greedy perk first. Then buy stopping power. Life gets easier after that.  5) When you buy this game - and you should buy this game - remember that stealing your teammate's speeder bike is a big no-no.  6) Keep the generators up and running. Because reasons. Also because the game will end if it stays offline too long.  7) The vampire perk is gross but cool.  8) T-Rex's that 360 no-scope you with rock throws... Did I mention that? Pretty sure I mentioned that...
914	1	a	Very fun and addicting!
5790	1	a	Played dis with my friends worth buying 10/10
6043	1	a	i played beatdown and dang this is way better gonna get it soon as i can :D
5888	1	a	Suprisingly good.
2869	1	a	I'm going to hesistantly say, yes I recommend Orion: Dino Horde.  It's definitely buggy. Animations seem a little stiff and unvaried. Graphics could use some... umph. I don't mean to say the graphics are bad and I see the style he has chosen, they just lack something.   I agree with some others that the weapons lack the variance and power they should. It often feels like I firing tiny lasers. Maybe the dinos need some sort of hit animation/ows***Ijustgothitbyabullet twitch? As much as I dislike Battlefield as a franchise, they do at least that much well.  The dino AI definitely needs some tweaking. And those f****** pterodactyls. F*** them.  Aside from that, the core elements are there, and can be very fun at times. I'm only afraid that this game will get tossed aside as the developer tries to promote his next game, 'The Orion Project'. To the Dev: It's going to be awful hard to make another game if you don't polish up the one you have now.  Summary: Fun, but unfinished.
3578	0	a	I remember when i bought this game for $16.00 what a rip.
91	1	a	If you get a boner while dismembering innocent people, this game suits your needs.
2349	1	a	Surprisngly fun! Think of it as if Planetside 2, Turok and Halo had a baby
5870	1	a	Best dollar get yet? YES! Fun only with friends though.
3045	1	a	Play in a prehistoric wilderness with futuristic weapons! Pteranodons and Tyrannosaurs and Velociraptors, oh my!
5055	0	a	Its so freaking laggy i don't recommend it. I barely could move
4509	0	a	'60+' updates. Well 60+ updates later its still a very buggy, laggy, broken game. Its good for a laugh in the first 5 minutes but its really really not that good. within my first game i was knocked under the map and couldn't do anything about it. It is only 1 dollar and thats what its worth 1 dollar because its not a good game and frankly not worth playing.
19	1	a	I grew up playing these games.
3482	0	a	I imagine that HIV would offer me a more enjoyable experience.  Weapon handling is utterly boring. Sound design is atrocious. Animations are stiff. Horrible usage of post processing to cover up low-res textures.  It's a game you buy and there's also a cash shop. It was crappy with Guns of Icarus Online did it, too. But, GoI Online was fun. This isn't.  Pass on it.
3636	0	a	... Where do I start? It was horrible short experience. The game doesn't grant you any information whatsoever. There is not even a tutorial to bring at least an introduction of what to do and what the controls etc are...
2758	0	a	Such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, wouldn't even buy it whilst it's 1 dollar
1021	0	a	The activation key doesnt even freaking work, this is bullcrap
1269	0	a	This stupid application does not have a tutorial or even a menu with settings to disable the stupid music. This is enough for me to write a negative review without even trying it.
129	1	a	This is an open-world singleplayer game. The storyline isn't too interesting, but this game shines in combat. The combat is fluid and the traveling dynamic is fun. This game does get frustrated with its ridiculous time trials side quests, however.
56	1	a	Classics from my youth.
5746	1	a	Jurassic Park: The Game...  But it's actually good. Seriously, buy this. It is a steal for the price.
1297	1	a	hardcore
901	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loved Shank. Iâm putting that out there up front. I loved every minute of playing it. It was really really hard. Itâs been a while since Iâve played a game like that. Now, when I say âreally really hard,â I donât mean impossible. Super Meat Boy is impossible. I mean really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ challenging. Shank is by no means a perfect game, but itâs so much fun. Even if you arenât a fan of beat-âem-ups, I still recommend giving Shank 2 a shot.  Weâre going to pretend like I know what happened in the original Shank. Right? Right. Whatâs research?  Shank 2 is, as previously stated, a beat-âem-up game in which you play as (appropriately) Shank. Shank is a member of a rebel group who is defying the warlord, General Magnus. Magnus and his militia have taken over the government, essentially throwing the entire system out of whack. The militia is tearing the cities the government controls apart, taking in slave labor, burning entire villages, the whole shebang. For a game whose story is completely unimportant, Shank has a considerable amount of thought put into it. I mean, donât get me wrong, the story is a tired tale thatâs been done a million times over, but it sets up an excellent backstory for Shank.  Shankâs mentor, Elena, has been captured by the militia. Not only does she mean to world to Shank, but she also is the leader of the alliance group. Itâs up to Shank and his partner Corina to save Elena and take down Magnus once and for all.  The first thing you can note about Shank is that he is BADASS. He uses a flipping chainsaw and shotgun to take out hordes of enemies, cranes, superhumans, and airplanes. His weapons actually range from machetes to molotovs. Yeah, how flipping cool is that? Unfortunately, Shank isnât a relatable character in the slightest. I know that the game wasnât going for an emotional tale, but whatâs the point in having a backstory at all when you canât feel any emotions toward the characters? Shank, and even Corina, to an extent, were too Gears of War-like for me to actually care about why I was killing all of these deranged lunatics.  Putting the stupid characterization aside for a moment, Iâd like to discuss the flashback I was continuously having during my playthrough. There was a game made for the SNES called Blackthorne. Maybe you have heard of it. In, a badass character runs around shooting a shotgun to save prisoners, etc. I havenât personally played the game, so I canât attest to how good it is, but Iâve seen in played and learned about it. There are so many callbacks to Blackthorne that it isnât even funny.  Let me give you some examples. Blackthorneâs signature move was shooting with a shotgunâ¦ one handed and backwards. Guess what Shank can do? Of course, there is the obvious saving prisoners from the bad guysâ¦ I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Before you go calling Shank and Blackthorne the same game, though, recognize that Blackthorne was actually a cinematic platformer. This is a genre that isnât really touched on as much nowadays, with the exception of the recent re-release of Flashback. My point is, whether they meant to or not, the developers of Shank made Blackthorne cool again.  Before we dive into the gameplay, letâs talk about the art of the game. The animations are all very comic-book-like, which Iâve always been a fan of. The animations are simple and cartoony for such a violent game, but this is hardly detrimental. What isnât the best part of the game is the music which isâ¦ bland. Sure, it sounds epicâ¦ at firstâ¦ and then it gets repetitive and fades into the background. There isnât anything wrong with it, per say, but it isnât as good as I would like it to be.  Shank is hard. I know Iâve said that a lot, but Iâm trying to ingrain this into your mind. There are two modes of the story: Normal and Hard modes. Normal mode is doable, but Hard isâ¦ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hard. In Normal mode, you get plenty of health powerups, checkpoints, infinite lives, etc. In hard mode, you get very few powerups, next to no checkpoints, and infinite lives. To give you a quick perspective, I beat Normal in about four hours, give or take. I have yet to get past the third level in Hard.  Some of the better things about Shank are his weapons. You see, there are a variety of weapons, like I said earlier. Each weapon has a different amount of damage, speed, and some variation of stun. You will be able to find which weapons work best for you as you play the game. You donât unlock all of the weapons until the last few levels, and by this point youâve probably already figured out what you wanted. For instance, my lineup was the Chainsaw, the Shotgun, and the Grenades.  I like that the game balances out the weapons. You have a real chance to figure out which weapons are best for your playstyle. If youâre like me, you like to deal with one problem at a time. This is where the Chainsaw and the Shotgun came in handy. If you like to take on lots of enemies at once, you may find that the Pistols and Machetes work better for you. Even when it seems like a weapon is unbalanced, youâll find that it has a certain ability, like leaving enemies burning in your wake. The weapons are arguably the best part about the game.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward. Itâs almost, but not quite, button mashing. The enemies range quite a bit in size and power, so some weapons will work better on them than others. For example, when I was in close quarters with several enemies, Iâd end up flailing about and murdering all of them with my Shotgun. If I needed to clear the field and make space, Iâd use the Chainsaw. Youâll find that just using one will not work. Youâll need to chain combos together to help you take down the multitudes of enemies.  Speaking of multitudes of enemies, there are quite a bit of them. These basic enemies range from swordsmen, to female ninjas, to guys with pistols, to guys with machine guns, to guys with axes, to midget bomber, to gigantic â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cretinsâ¦ There are so many. Each level may or may not present you with different enemies. Occasionally, this could just mean the same enemy reskinned, but some levels do include zone-specific enemies.  The best enemies are the bosses. And there are not as many as I would like. The levels in Shank only end up being about 20-30 minutes long apiece, and there are only eight levels. This does mean there is variety in bosses, but there arenât enough. For such a BA guy, youâd think heâd constantly be taking on guys three or four times his size.  That being said, the bosses are awesome and also not. Each one of the focuses on a different aspect. For example, there is a psychic boss, and thereâs fire boss, and thereâs a strength boss. Each of these bosses seem perfectly fit for their levels. Alternatively, there are minibosses in some stages. For example, the crane I mentioned earlier. It has been a long time since Iâve had this much rage towards a boss in a gameâ¦ You canât hit the crane unless youâre using your gun. The crane repeatedly tries to smash you with a boat that takes up a third of the screen while guys with pistols try to take you out from a mile away. Itâs tough. But I beat it. I canât get past in on the Hard mode, but I got in Normal.  The bosses are not awesome in some partsâ¦ Mostly because they all use the same tactics. To a degree. They have a predetermined moveset that consists of maybe five moves at the most. Once you take out about a third of their health, they all call backup. Itâs the same thing every battle. On top of that, once you figure out the movesets of each boss, they arenât that hard to beat. Hell, even the final battle against Magnum I beat on my second try. For a game that can be as challenging as Shank, the bosses arenât hard enough.  ......read more of this review at  http://theoblivianstudios.com/post/62088773680/review-shank-2 
3747	1	a	Halo meets Dinos. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 I was playing with a friend and suddenly he began to get arrows stuck on me, finished with a selfie. Now i can go out and say: I hunted dinos like you but then i took an arrow to the knee.
4038	1	a	Nice game with low price :)  8/10, I like mp mode cause it funny if play with friends. Using bazooka and K-Boom xD
1417	1	a	Just started the game and i already like it. The levels are fun and well made. The use of physics with the enemies and objects is awsome. The caves are great too it's dark and makes it a bit harder and that's fun. I recommand this game for anyone that likes platform games it worth every penny.
1173	1	a	Ruined my life    10/10
6151	0	a	I should be able to run this, but I'm very,very laggy, lowest settings
983	1	a	Loved this. The little alien is so easy to control. Good story line too. Still need to finish the game as it does get tougher the more you play. 9/10
2437	1	a	Good game. Like Nazi Zombies but with dinosaurs and jetpacks.
4052	0	a	I'm sorry.   I know it's only a buck.   But it is not very enjoyable.   Especially when there are free games that are more fun. Seriously.   I gave it a shot.   Cost me a buck.   But I don't think this was worth the download.   Sorry.
1575	1	a	7 hours for a quarter... beats an arcade any day
5294	0	a	to play this game you need 2 things beer and lots of it and frineds that are willing to buy this game
6452	1	a	mechs, tanks and guns vs dinosaurs.  What could you possibly need more?  It is not a perfect game, but its fun most of the time. There are a few areas where it gets confusing, for instance when you have to go through the options in order to check the controls and you are met with an controller type menu with LS/LT button descriptions instead of the actual keys.
4788	0	a	Just.. don't support them
6577	0	a	Buggy gameplay, sticky dinosaurs, horrible dino control. 10/10. will never play again.
4087	1	a	not bad game but i dont know why its little lagy for me maybe my pc suck,dunno. 3 words- BUY THE GAME (if you are nolifer)
5851	1	a	Tiny Dinos that are strapped with dynamite and bark as they go up in a fiery explosion 10/10
4633	0	a	Being a dinosuar in this game is cancer... I couldnt even damage the enemy. Mega thumbs down from smeagol.
1147	1	a	well BEEP says the robot.  10/10
5375	1	a	This game is amazing. I got it in a four pack in the steam summer sale. Me and my friends have so much fun with it, and it cost so little. Tottaly worth getting. Really it is. The metta score is wrong. Don't belive it. Play this game with people. Co-op op.
2415	1	a	Look it was 99c for a co-op dino slaying FPS. How can you beat that? I experienced no bugs, and the UI is pretty easy to figure out, maybe with a few checks into the options for key commands in game.  So far every server I joined has had great players on it, so spend a buck and have a few hours of fun ;)  trog_79 in game, level 3 when I posted.
2162	1	a	The game looks beautiful. There is a good selection of weapons and a huge open world to explore online, plus the game is incredibly cheap! The dinosaur animations could use some work but this is still a very good wave based game. Also, the game can be played offline in singleplayer, which is good because I don't really like online-only games. All of this for 0.49p on sale?

2278	1	a	Surprisingly FUN!!! Great for Co-Op LAN
2574	1	a	A game that tries way to little to actually be its own game.  Instead it tries to take things from other popular games Slow motion time (Zed Time from Killing Floor) Large ingame store with cosmetics and other things to dress up your character (Team Fortress 2, Planetside 2, CS:GO and many more..) The game's animations are clunky, the voice dialogues make dialogues from Ride to Hell: retribution sound like a dream.   The dinosaurs sound horrible, the maps look horrible and the game in its entirety just feels incomplete.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥ It was 99 cents!  So if you buy it don't expect anything amazing, you get what you pay for.
3840	1	a	This game is awesome AND very cheap,in fact too cheap for being this awesome~! :D (not that i am complaining~ xP) In the beginning i was 'Meh,this games is hard and not that good,but after a while,when i got the hang of it and started to have fun,i thought,hey it's not bad,actually it's very fun~!' xD
4813	0	a	8 out of 8 would say not great mate
2286	1	a	Very cheap and fun
3395	1	a	according to amazon dot com, this game is six times cheaper than buying a baseball bat to beat your own head in
2743	1	a	I thought this would be kinda crap but I actually just kick back and shoot stuff. People on co-op are really patient and fun! A hidden gem, but not a masterpiece. I just put some podcasts on sometimes as white noise and go nuts. Also, I killed two triceratops and a t-rex by myself, so I feel pretty good.
2618	1	a	The most ridiculous game you can get for under a buck!
2853	1	a	Clearly the developers were high while playing Halo and watching Jurassic Park at the same time.  11/10.
1132	1	a	Side scrolling &amp; Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today. It has several planets, each planet containing different levels.   In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more!   There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels!  Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal.   The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing. As if 2001: A space oddesy &amp; Wall:E had a child, this would be it!  This is a great game for children aged 7-11, I give it a 6.5/10
6310	1	a	This game is literally a big mess, and I got rid of 6 CS:GO skins for it.    God damn, have I never liked a mess the way I like this.
3074	1	a	The meta score lies. This game is definately better than the meta score.
1124	1	a	BEEP is probably one of the best 2d puzzle games I've ever played
2981	1	a	Based on the Unreal 3 Engine, we've got Orion: Dino Horde, or a game i like to call Dino Killer Future Simulator.  The game is simply beautiful, the visuals are simply ridiculously pretty (if you crank the settings up, like with any and all other games).  The gameplay is fun, even on your own, though it is challenging, also depends on difficulty.  There's lots of game-modes, a maximum of 5 players at once, due to it being a wave-style game... atleast in survival.  There's small dinos, medium dinos, large dinos, and i think giant ones too. (not too sure on the giant ones though).  You can use automated turrets, pistols, magnums, sniper rifles, large and small machine guns, a cool-looking tank that seems very similar in look to the ion tank in UT2004.  Very fun altogether, I give this game an 8/10, because it's jsut that good other then the reasons above.
5105	1	a	Very fun to play with friends
103	1	a	Plays a little like you're a bossfight from MGS. Don't bother watching the cutscenes, the story is nothing to write home about, but otherwise Prototype is a load of fun. Pick up a pedestrian, any pedestrian. Run to the top of a building. Throw your pedestrian as far as you can, see if you can land exactly where they do, before they do. Fans of the Hulk games on PS2 and XBOX will note that in terms of mechanics at least, this is a colossal rip-off. People who have an aversion to being giant and green will probably prefer Alex Mercer's agreeably-generic appearance. And if they don't, they can pick up an old lady and turn into her, then punch helicopters out of the sky.  Slight caveat - last time I played this game from Steam, all the sounds were playing in comical fast-motion. So if you can get it to work, it's fun. Otherwise it's unintentional hilarity.
2506	1	a	Very nice game for 0.99ct man 420 blaze it every day and every night
219	1	a	One of Activision's (if you want to get technical, Radical's, but since their out of buisness, we'll be calling this Activision's game) best game in ages, it's from 2009, and it still hold's up today.  The story is solid, it will leave you wanting more and more answers as you progress, and it throws a real curve ball at you when you learn the truth. There's also a ton of extra bits and pieces you can find by seeking out and consuming (more on that later) certain people, called 'Web of Intrigue' targets, and my hat goes off to the people who made those cutscenes, because they looked pretty painful to make. But there are a few sections in the story where you'll be left confused, and with no answers, none. So for the story, 8/10.  The graphics are a bit dated, but can look pretty good in some parts, especially on the PC. And you'll encounter little to no frame rate issues, or crashes. And the animation is quite nice as well. But there are a few audio glitches, especially in the cutscenes. 7/10  The gameplay is amazing, it's hack and slash for some parts, and beat them to a bloody pulp for others, and there are so many combos in the game, an astounding ammount. You're also going to want to use a controller if one is handy, I felt the game didn't work well for a keyboard, and was glad I had my controller with me. But consuming is really quite interesting, you can grab a target and more or less 'eat' them, but you gain their form, memories, etc. etc. etc. But the boss battles felt painfully OP, and I was playing on normal for my first time through. I had the most trouble with the last boss, as he was a damage sponge, there were other people attacking me, and if that's not enough, there's a timer. His attacks also did an insane ammount of damage. Gameplay earns a solid 9/10  So, the story is great, one of the best one's I've experienced in a while, close to the level that the original inFAMOUS gave you in terms of depth. Still, it has verry odd bits and pieces missing from it that could of easily been included. Graphics could of been better (i.e. inFAMOUS was released around the same time, and look at how it looked) and the gameplay is awesome. So my final score for [PROTOTYPE] is an 8/10, pick this game up, it is a must have.
5413	1	a	This game is so much fun to play. I like the fact that you can play as dinosaurs. It's a lot of fun chasing my friends around trying to eat them with zombie gator. lol 
2147	1	a	Its fun; a little dated nowdays but still fun.
4226	1	a	shot dinos on the lowest settings fun was had it was pretty cheap to so I aint even mad.
2569	1	a	It's pretty good. Lots of action, non-stop. The concept is very well done. It's a little unstable at some points - fairly glitchy. The sounds need to be updated as well. I recommend it though. 4.5/5.
5661	0	a	The game is basically Halo and Jurrasic Park. It's a good game but it's really laggy.
1086	1	a	This game is adorably fun! Like some weird cross between Yoshi's Island, LocoRoco, the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2, and imaginings of Dead Cyborg (look it up, it's awesome!), BEEP is worth $5 USD!
288	1	a	Used to play spiderman 3 by activision on PS2. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is the same but better!
4880	0	a	Whenever I talk about this beautifully crafted game I get emotional. It's just so wonderful and everything I've ever wanted in a video game. Huge alligators. Unrealistic dinosaurs. The amazing almost pixel like graphics. Wowza! This game is fantastic.
266	1	a	They should literally just rename this game to 'Badass Simulator' Because that's what I feel like when playing this game.
5621	1	a	Hmm, let's see.  Guns checked Violence checked Dinosaurs checked  They have utilised elements from Halo, Star Wars, Turok, Quake and Crysis. Now if they can utilise the Alien franchise, this will be my number one FPS!
2188	1	a	Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.  Overall thoughts: This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.  Review: [ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]  Pros:  1: It's free to play. 2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee. 3: It takes you to a place you've never been before. 4: It has some really good customizable â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the main menu.  Cons:  1: The game is full of glitches. 2: No one really plays it anymore.  Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?  My personal rating: 8.2/10.
2899	1	a	A good game to screw around in, if you fancy a coop game of driving around it a turrented jeep, while your friend uses the turrent to kill the bigguns, you simply run over the smaller one. Or if you fancy a minor challenge go to conquest and save up cash for a helicopter and then rain death and destruction on the ground. Not complicated, fun to play, and easier to adapt too i reccomend this game
4147	0	a	I paid 1$ for this game. Actual money.  Its being updated pretty frequently but in its current state, I should have bought some ice cream instead.
3802	1	a	very funny and doesnt need a strong pc
2613	1	a	a game for fun with a good price
5010	1	a	Add dinosaur mating and copulation and it will be perfect. 9/10 would ride some lady dinos again!
1007	0	a	I wish there was a way to NOT RECOMMEND games. REQUIRES ORIGIN! :(   Edit 11/26/2013 - Steam finally gave a way to not recommend games. Thank you!
2790	1	a	Protect the generator and kill dinos in co-op or kill each other in multiplayer mode. Many game modes to play and a good number of weapons and vehicles to kill dinos with. Level up your class and unlock perks and weapons as you go great game at a great price.
5248	1	a	Great game if you enjoy to play FPS games. Has a few minor bugs.
2519	1	a	Give it a second try, I hated it at first but it turns out to be not all bad.
5138	1	a	Best lag simulator stil available for a low purchase.
3029	0	a	this game is not great. but its not bad. i do not suggest this to people who have already played primal carnage. the only problem in my opinion is the concept. and the way the dinos play out. what i do love is the vast amount of species to play as and the NPC/BOTS they work well as balancing the teams
2046	1	a	Stabbed a friend in the â¥â¥â¥ when he was playing as a tricerotops.   10/10 IGN GOTY
4105	1	a	A fun game to play. Doesn't need crazy skills but teamwork is indeed needed sometimes. Has interesting game modes with most of the games on the edge. Plus is not expensive and can run on every pc.
4624	1	a	I had some nice survival rounds with a bunch of people over the course of multiple maps. Sort of Killing Floor with dinos. Roaming some canyons with a four- or five-man party - on foot, inside tanks, mechs or other vehicles - killing a big T-Rex and seeing his ragdoll-body fall down in slow-motion was a pretty epic and satisfying feeling. The general gameplay looks and feels a bit awkward at times, animations and gunplay aren't as 'tight' and polished as one may know from AAA shooters, but it's decent enough, the Unreal engine keeps it together and gives it an alright look.   People say there are day-1-bugs still left, only obvious bug I've seen so far was a teammate getting stuck in a tree by flying dino tossing him in there. You can surely get some fun hours out if it - for 1,00 EUR a steal, basically. I still need to try the other co-op and PvP modes. Open world with day/night cycle and loot sounds interesting, just as beating up humans with playable dinos. And it seems the game is still being actively developed/enhanced.   The very bad metacritic rating scared me a bit, but it is apparently related to a much earlier, now-gone phase of the game, in it's current state it probably deserves better. No idea how many players will be left after the current free period. I hope it won't die too soon, it looks interesting. And I hope the netcode is stable enough. My first attempts of joining other people's games were greeted either with timeouts or lags. Then I found a good lobby and sticked to it until the host closed it down. It seems to be working with peer-to-peer mechanics; unfortunately - dedicated servers would make it easier to avoid such issues. Peer-to-peer games often trouble me.
1691	1	a	Pretty good solid game, however having to traverse for minutes at a time from spawn point to where you're needed can be a hassle.
2353	1	a	For $.99 it's actually really fun. I played for almost an hour last night after purchasing and I kept thinking 'If I were at an arcade, i'd spend $1 for 1 round' So I like to think I spent $1 for an infinite ammount of rounds and in that respect it's definitely worth the price.  Aside from the great price, there were a few hiccups. I noticed a bit of lag, even though my connection was good. Hit detection seems slightly off, maybe this was because of the lag, but at times I had to aim a the ground in order to hit the little dinos that bite at the feet.  But still, nothing feels better than mowing down a stegosaurus and a t-rex from raining down rockets with an aircraft up above.  Get it, it's worth it, you'll probably like it.

But the difficulty level is all over the place, some missions are extremely simple while others are extremely hard. And the combat... Everytime you take a hit you get stunned for a while, so you often find yourself taking a chain of hits which you can't do anything about. It makes some missions extremely frustrating.  Try Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.

3682	0	a	+dinos -a bit clueless for beginner dinosaurs are great theme but need more help &amp; tooltips to help player
1179	1	a	truly ganteng
4027	1	a	much improved dont read into older scores, the game was redone.
3306	1	a	Very cool fun game. Bad that it doesn't hav an complex developer console like the valve games to make it work on pc from 1998.
1498	1	a	OPEN THE DOOR GET ON THE FLOOR EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR
2182	1	a	I bought this for the story
2093	1	a	This is a epic multiplayer first person shooter and i love to play this with my friends 
1428	1	a	So cute and amazing.
3599	0	a	Honestly...this is my opinion, and mine alone...but this game isn't as fun as I was led to believe it was. Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.
3021	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
1489	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.  So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered 'one of the worst games on Steam.' And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.
5353	1	a	This is a really good game. Sometimes it can be quite laggy, but what game isn't these days. If you like COD zombies, this is basicaly the same thing, but dinosaurs, and a whole lot more fun than zombies. Great game!
67	1	a	I grew up on these games, along with all of the other Sierra point and click adventrues. These still make me laugh and are fun to play.
3619	0	a	y u put money on the game im mad &lt;:( 
2420	1	a	This is a very fun game to play with friends. You can play a variety of different game mode on different maps. These game modes range from PvP to Co-Op. One fun game mode is Conquest where you have to defend a generator against dinosaurs in a CoD Zombie style.( more dinosaurs and more difficult dinosaurs appear as time goes on) overall very fun
5501	1	a	I never played Orion: Dino Beatdown so I missed all the hate towards that first iteration. I first played over a free weekend in August of 2013 with Orion: Dino Horde. And now they have released Prelude.  Prelude seems to have added a lot of polish to the game which is nice and appreciated.  Is ORION: Prelude a great game? No. Is it a Bad game? No it is not bad either. What this game is, is pure unadulterated fun. If you like shooting dinosaurs with guns I highly recommend this game to you.  The only downside of this game is that if it isn't a free weekend, the servers can be sparsely populated. With the introduction of bots (that will fill one of the slots for squad members until a human drops in and takes their place (which is brilliant btw)) and lowering the price of the game, hopefully this will no longer be an issue.  So grab this game! It really is a lot of fun :D
2315	1	a	Turn's out heavily armed soldiers riding vehicles caused the mass extiction of dinosaurs. Super entertaining for competetive or casual gamers alike.
6257	1	a	Like halo, but with dinosaurs  10/10
887	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
6583	1	a	Really Good! One man or many versus DINOSAURS! How cool is that!? 
2726	1	a	I have to say this is maybe one of the best games I've played. Its got bugs, lighting errors, but that stuff is for people that play the game to be super serious and such. This game is soooooo fun I've played it alot. Its the type of game where you go to say: 'I'm done.. (Goes to hit ESC and then hears a T-Rex roar) ... nevermind, just one more wave.' You then see that when you went to leave at 9:00 PM its now 2:00 am in the morning, then you catch yourself at around 4 am then finally quit. Thats how it runs for me. I have two more words. Buy. It. (You will not regret it!)
4767	1	a	I believe that we all had a dream of fighting or being a dinosaur. ORION: Dino Horde brings this dream to reality... well, at least they did it visually. True, Dino Horde may not be the most beautiful game out there. The characters you and your comrades control, run and perform their tasks in impractical and awkward manners, and giant dinosaurs break the laws of physics once their health points reach zero. Simply speaking, this game has a lot of flaws.  Though, I can't really say these flaws killed the joyous atmosphere when I played the game. The humans have amazing technology, which somewhat resembles that of the Halo Universe. On the other hand, despite their primitive traditions of chewing and tossing rocks, the dinosaurs proved themselves to be a challenge.  ORION: Dino Horde is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a game where everyone plays with a smile on their face. With a huge variety of weapons and abilities, followed by a decent number of game modes, Dino Horde is a game that offers a lot of alternative styles of playing the game.  Right now, as of the date this review is given, ORION: Dino Horde has the price of only $0.99. It's fun, hilarious, and suitable for both casual and hardcore players. If you want to give this game a try, now's the chance.
3932	0	a	Waste of a dollar. Cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
2305	1	a	Good Game. Didn't play for long, but thats because I was tired and couldn't be bothered learning thigns :P But definately cans ee how this would provide hours of fun.
517	1	a	the only things i have to say about this game is SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK SICK
4716	1	a	Best game ever. I leveled my Pikachu up to level 101 and drove into a dinsoaur 101/101
3157	1	a	Awesome game for A buck.
1853	1	a	its a fun game. Just get it and you wont regret it ^.^
3425	1	a	Never in my life before I had the chance to kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber. Thanks Obama
1469	1	a	Much better than I thought, worth buying, even if not on sale.
2782	1	a	Kill Dinosaurs with a tank.  10/10
3415	1	a	Orion feels to be one of those games that has a few differences to how you play, but all together the game is quite fun playing with other people.
1192	1	a	Surprisingly Fun.
215	1	a	Best zombie-apocalyptic game ever  10/10
4343	0	a	Why did I actually pay money for this piece of crap?
5855	1	a	Worth every penny,
1848	1	a	This is quite possibly the best cheap thrill you can pick up on Steam.  It's everything and more than I could have ever wanted in a game this inexpensive: dinosaurs, guns, more dinosaurs, flying around shooting dinosaurs, destroying Robot Santa with a rocket launcher, music that you could swear carries a bit of the Mr. Clean jingle in it, and much, much more.   The best things in life are apparently just about nearly free; snag this if you're looking to blow things up with friends and marvel at the masterpiece that is ORION: Prelude.
3399	1	a	This game is really awsome and if you have friends to play with,it'll be even more awsome. I just wish this game was more popular.  Also,you can    Noscope a T Rex and kill him in one shot     11/9    Because only America puts months before days    -IGN
475	1	a	Great graphics, engine, gameplay, sound. It really brings in the darkside, you know? Can't wait til I get the 2nd game :)
1899	1	a	dont wana make a review for this now ima go play it
264	0	a	Prototype looks like a really fun game, but the PC port is god awful.  You need to disable HID devices for the game to even run and even then it might not even work  The game crashes, freezes and pretty much anyone who owns the PC port seems to have problems.    Seriously, If your interested in this game, go for the console version
754	1	a	Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is pure brilliance...knocked down a few pegs by some glaring flaws. At its heart Dead Mountaineer's club is a beautiful, brooding, sophisticated, crime noir mystery. The incredible artwork is supplemented by great music that eventually gets repetitive over time because there are only a few measures. The story builds up quite a bit of suspense and intrique that strings the player along and leaves them wanting more. The locations, while pretty much all within the confines of a dilapitated ski lodge are surprisingly numerous, though could possibly still stand to be supplemented. Quirky characters, each of which has his/her own personality and self-interests coupled with a creepy environment that always hints at some form of potential danger on the horizon makes for a rather paranoid journey through the wash of clues and suspicious events the player has to sort through in figuring out how the crime took place, if there even was a crime.   Sounds like a masterpiece, doesn't it? Well, not quite. Unfortunately, there are a number of flaws that prevent the game from being the forerunner of the puzzle/adventure genre that it really aspires to be. First, the pacing is odd. There are moments of intensity while other moments leave the player wandering around with no real direction. While freedom given to the player to solve some story elements in different orders in a way that actually allows for multiple story endings is a great addition to this game, there are some minor problems with the way the developers implemented this feature. The player can actually break the game by doing something before doing another required task, which leads to some sort of missed cue in the game that stops the progression of the major game events. This is probably the biggest problem with the game. Another, lesser problem is that the game is slightly anticlimatic, partially because the major events in the game overshadow the ending, and partially because the game builds up so much suspense as the game goes on that we're expecting a bigger resolve toward the end of the game.  Being the adventure game fanatic I am, I still enjoyed the game enough to put more than 51 hours into it, but I don't think everyone would share my exuberance. Given the flaws, I would recommend it for unbending fans of adventure/puzzle games. At the same time, I would probably advise those who are new to adventure games and more casual adventure gamers to steer well clear of Dead Mountainer's Hotel. For those types, there are plenty of other challenging adventure games that do not have the same pitfalls this one has.  In the end, I would rate this one at a solid 6.5 out of 10, because in the areas where it excels it does so gloriously.
6529	1	a	Its fun I dont understand the hate for this game, its a defend a base style game with dinos. Its a wonderful game to play with friends and i hope they expand on perks and weapons soon.
6342	1	a	iTS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I HAS AND ITS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!
375	0	a	having never gotten around to playing this game i was really looking forward to playing it, always looked interesting and im sure it would have been fun to play!  had i been able to get in the damn game, whenever i tried to get into it it crashed.  oh sure i could get into the title screen and settings, but what good does that do me?  save yourself the money and buy a game you CAN play.  and yes my pc should be able to run it, i checked the specs, if it can run things like fallout and games like it at maz graphics and such, this should run fine, it just doesnt
2495	1	a	...Holy HELL! If anyone decides to play this game, make sure you have very quick reaction times or know how to run around screaming with good reaction times. This game is VERY HARD and glitchy to the core. If it ever gets fixed up in the future, I am pretty sure it would be a bit decent for a shooter up game. Otherwise, if anyone plays this, stick inside the buildings always............That's my only advice.
2751	1	a	7/10. Game has a low score and I wondered why? After playing this game I had a lot of fun playing I just couldnt figure it out. The score was taken a long time ago when this game first came out and was awful. This is not that game. I've played wave games, one of them being Killing Floor, and as much fun as Killing Floor is, in the end the only objective is to survive. Simple and beautiful. This game has that, but with dinosaurs. You also have actual objectives to complete which gives more of a challenge rather than just killing things, and upon completeing said objectives you gain more credits to buy more guns and other perks to help you survive. Not a perfect game but a decent fun one.
4682	0	a	This game had a fun idea but failed completely in realizing it, its poorly optimised (runs de same amount of horible on whatever setting), the enemies are juist plain boring and the 'special abilities' of your class are just plain pointless.
4527	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
1444	1	a	This game is quite simple and I don't have to write a complicated review for this. In BEEP, robots discover new planets and you have to get all asteroids in the map to get a good score on the level, while shooting and manipulating objects in the map to get through your way to the end. For $0.19 cents, it was worth a buy.  8/10
560	1	a	Open World,Adventure,Sci-fi,Action these are words to define this game it is amazing.You can run around,fight,upgrade power-ups,kill army men,and hijack tanks.THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!
2180	1	a	I had a splendid time playing this with my pals and with random people. It's definitely worth the 99 cents.
5013	1	a	I commited mass genocide of raptors by running them over with a tank. 10/10
2877	1	a	this game is so awsome 
4539	0	a	I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game. Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.   Would like to see some sort of 'finality' (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else). The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.   
1769	1	a	Just keeps getting better with all these updates i love it :)! And for $.99 permanately thats just a bonus :)!
4982	0	a	I am sorry but whoever is writing this game is excellent now after some changes, well I dont know how bad it was before, but the controls are AWFUL, that is putting it nicely, I tried htis game this weekend since it was 99 cents, but after playing it for a few hours, its the worst game trying to play at a FPS that ive ever seen, this game might have had people buy it 20 years ago, the controls are awful , the characters move like bricks, there is no fluid feeling its all fighting contols constantly, the game is so unbalanced its annoying between dinos and humans . PLus there is a cash shop! I dont recall the last time I saw a game I had to buy then have a cash shop to contend with.  Even for the 99 cents I cant recommend this, but for the normal price I would TOTALLY WARD you OFF thinking about buying this, the meta crtic score is generious at 36! The game devs of this game need some serious practice and help BAD BAD BAD feeling game play!
493	1	a	This is only a first impression, but from what I have played, this game is what you get if you take the concept of Kirby and suck every last ounce of innocence out of it. Not to mention adding a whole lot of bloody mess rather then clean 'inhaling' as it were.   Its -kinda- typical third persion actiony title, but the fact that you're a Parkour People Eater (My offical term for Alex Mercer) gives it that different edge that keeps it interesting. The fact you can be jumping from rooftop to rooftop one moment, to sneaking past security by eating someone with the right clearence the next, and then hacking your way through horrible monstrosities with your giant claw arms after that keeps the game interesting and enjoyable.
1400	1	a	For a game that costs 21 cents CDN, it was definitely worth the price! I haven't played much, but from what I've explored it is incredibly fun. It runs smoothly and I enjoyed the level design. The graphics aren't the best feature to be honest, but it looks good for its price. Not only that, but you could just sell the cards to get your money back so you're technically getting a free game!
1620	1	a	Got in tank to shoot T-rex, T-rex flipped and blew up my tank 10/10
1215	1	a	Take the f****** checkpoint, because 'The 'Lie' its a 'cake''.    After this game -&gt;&gt; Einsten genius -&gt;&gt; P. Nobel of Peace -&gt;&gt; Die  11/10
1103	1	a	fun and challenging platformer, great art style, and right now very cheap (1,95 CAD) if you like platformers, then this is definitely worth your money.
634	1	a	Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture.   You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you. The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.  Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.    Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.
6541	1	a	I would very much recommend this game! The metacritic score does not belong here! I have had a blast playing this game, and not to mention its 99 cents right now! Buy this game and partake in some of the best cooperative survival games I've ever played.
6537	1	a	lots of mindless fun
3526	1	a	The only game servers I can find are ones where I have a ping of 150+  Otherwise its a good game
69	1	a	'If the robot droid could laugh, which it is not programmed to do, it would do so. Your pulseray is only effective against living opponents!'
4722	1	a	very cheap lots of bugs
5343	1	a	This game is a great co-op game. good vehicals, multiple ways to play all while helping to complete the same objective with friends or strangers. If manage to get this during one of the great deals it is well worth 1-2 dollars. if not then if you enjoy first person shooters and good set of vehicals. would get it. A lot of people are friendly when playing currently so helps learning curve. Not much of one but every game has one.
3542	0	a	I tried to like this game, I really did. While my friends were calling it garbage, I defended it. The truth is, however, that they were right. I never played Dino Beatdown, and I didn't bother with the Metacritic score; going off of some brief gameplay videos I figured that while the animations looked clunky it could at least be one of those games that is fun to play with friends. Those videos don't quite prepare you for Dino Horde, and I can safely say that even at the price of $1.00, I would not recommend buying this game.  The animations are bad, and in fact very laughable. Running looks like you've got a stick up your â¥â¥â¥ and when you're in first person in a car you can often watch in horror as your weapons wiggle around. However, these animations are typically situational - no, most of what you'll see of the animaiton quality is in the dinosaurs themselves who often come off as cartoonish, rigid or downright broken in their movements.  The gunplay is very unsatisfying. Everything kind of just haphazardly squirts blood when you shoot them. You'd expect such a loud game to at least have some great, satisfying sounds to accompany each shot, but they don't. Every enemy is a bullet sponge and each weapon is unpleasant to use.   However, the most frustrating failings of Dino Horde is in the fact that when buying upgrades in Survival, dying will cause you to lose them. Additionally, despite boasting a large number of game modes, many are just not fun. The worst was where you're forced to play Support and just stand around as raptors spawn out of the air on top of you, trying to last as long as possible.   The only positive points I can truthfully give this game was that the vehicles were at first very fun and interesting. If you're forced or tempted to play this game, jump into a vehicle as soon as possible. The only difficulty you'll really find with vehicles is how their tires are somehow incapable of running over small dinosaurs. However, even they were not enough to save Dino Horde for me. I will not be reinstalling this. If you want a dinosaur game get Natural Selection 2 or Primal Carnage, a lot of ORION's assets were ripped off from those games, anyways.
5649	1	a	its a dollar well spent
4191	1	a	Be a Espinosaur and eat your friends     10/10
3122	1	a	Open Game for first time. Round 1, fight some dinosaurs, seems like a normal game. Round 2 fight thousands of tiny dinosaurs all wearing pirate hats. Round 3 fight against invisble raptors.  Realism: 10/10 Immersion: 10/10 best game 2k12
3731	0	a	This game cost less than $2 yet somehow i still feel like i got ripped off&gt;
4604	1	a	booooooring game , but cool
4762	1	a	If you have some friends willing to play, it can be some mediocre fun. If you don't, you'd have more fun playing Warframe.
5859	0	a	The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is boring, and the mechanics are clunky. I bought this last year when they at least pretended it was worth something (base price of $9.99). The game now only costs $.99. This is not a quality game. Don't waste a penny on this
3951	1	a	the framereate is jumpy and you cant tell whats going on half the time. its a good idea but it needs work i only recomend because i want others to see this games potential.
6051	1	a	6/10  +its a $1 +Gamemodes +Workshop +Coop +Maps are very interactive +driveable vehicles -Specs need to be high in order to play
5150	1	a	This is an absolutely hilarious and entertaining game, it is way better than I thought it could be. Lightsabers, tanks, and dinosaurs!
177	1	a	THIS GAME IS SO COOL!! Such a neat concept. Great storyline. You can jump off buildings from suicide height and go-splat-on-the-ground height and do a super hero landing without taking damage. And you can slice mutant monster things with awesome wolverine-type claws and make spikes come out of the ground. How can anyone NOT love that?!
1864	1	a	The MetaScore for this game does not do it justice. - If you only read the first line of reviews, then this one speaks volumes.  Essentially a wave-based first person shooter (in the same mold as Tripwire's Killing Floor and Valve's Left 4 Dead), this game has a man vs dinosaurs theme set in mulitple locations.  Graphics are smooth and surprisingly good. The developers have thrown a lot of work into making this game not only playable, but challenging and enjoyable as well - and it shows. Not the most immersive game out there, but that fades into insignificance when the bullets start flying.  A worthy addition to any game library - especially when on sale.
2301	1	a	Its a fun game, with or without friends. Now on sale for only for a dollar. Whats not to like?
2004	1	a	For $1 this first-person shooter is certainly fun to play with friends. It truly shines in its Survival game mode which involves you and your team protecting your base's generator from dinosaurs as well as protecting each other from them. You can play as dinosaurs in other game modes as well. You have different abilities, weapons and vehicles. The vehicle combat is okay, but I would recommend sticking with the Assault class and its jetpack instead. Sure the servers' latency may drop at times, but it is still fun to play. My favorite feature is how in arctic levels your visor actually slowly freezes from the cold. THAT is neat. I just love shooting dinosaurs and for $1 that is an experience I'd pay for.
5508	0	a	i boht it and 1 week later it vanished from my library.but its a great game.
4419	1	a	It's a fun game, The graphics are alright, it's super fun to play with friends.
5491	0	a	Wouldn't play it if it was free. Nothing exciting, there's no challenge or skill. Either your class can beat your challenger(s) or not. It's actually pretty frusterating because so many mechanics, ballences, or hitboxes make no sense. Just run around and shoot. There are much more multiplayers for free. If you like the concept of dinos vs humans -&gt; Primal Carnage. Occasional server bugs, but worth paying for over this.
1965	1	a	I haven't even played it, and I like it
5429	1	a	Very Cheap and Very Good &lt;3
1129	1	a	So far of what I have played in this game has been amazing. This platformer is a must buy and is unique.
2778	0	a	I can not recommend this game to anyone. The graphic engine or the way they utilize it is horrible. I get framdrops down to 5fps with a GTX780 at times. The game is kinda fun the first hour or two, but after that it just blows.
238	1	a	So this was fun...
6316	1	a	Any game where you can slice the balls off a t-rex with a bowie knife is worth at least a look. 6/10
4549	0	a	game is bad sad game with a music copied by a famous game..
3129	1	a	'only in the future do we fight our past'
1006	0	a	This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.  Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.  Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.  TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.
4873	1	a	awesome game, awesome devs that stuck with the game for three years straight although everyone hated it
3762	0	a	Like masturbating with razor blades.
5786	1	a	Clearly not the best game ever made, but for 74 cent it's still sold quite much under what it's acutally worth...
1535	1	a	I shot a T-Rex in the face with a revolver, killed it, and then got eaten by it's mate. 8/10, would recommend.
2780	1	a	For $1, this game is very fun. A little buggy, but very amazing. I bought this thinking 'Oh it's only $1. Might as well try it.' This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is more fun than spending that $35 on 'Rambo The Game' and getting bored of it in the first 5 minutes. I still don't understand why it has a metascore of 36/100. It should be above 65/100 at least.  10/10 would play again.
2601	1	a	The metascore of this game is very misleading in my opinion, I don't know how bad this game was when is was released but now I think it's really good now. I don't think this game is supposed to be taken too seriously as it is far from realistic but it should be considered as a fun game to play with your friends (or alone like me). Shooting hundreds of dinosaurs has never been this much fun.
5818	1	a	this game is good but it lags for me so i havr to return it im sry but if it didnt lag for me it would be 10/10
1122	1	a	For 0.19, it's deffinetly worth it.
4204	1	a	1 Opened game  2 Joined a single player survival game  3 turned the generator on  4 Bought a Trek-9  5 the first wave started  6 Murdered some raptor babys  7 wave ended  8 bought a bow and arrow  9 T-rex comes thew a wall and kills me instantly   1000000000000/10 would be eaten by a drunken T-rex
1979	1	a	this game is alot of fun if you like team fortress 2 but also wanna shoot some dinosaurs instead of other people!!!!!!! who doesn't want to play an FPS that kills dinosaurs!!! the only down side is that there seems to be lots of bug problems. so get this game and kill some dinosaurs cuz well its dinosaurs!
5857	0	a	This game sucks my other left nut
2727	1	a	This is one of the best games ever made. I would pay $100 per round if I had to.
4976	0	a	I spent 5 minutes trying to find out how to play with my friend, then we played for 5 minutes. Got bored and played Dota 2 cuz even Dota 2 is better than Orion. Don't buy, a waste of your $0.99.
658	0	a	Hard to tell the difference between clubs and spades especially. Sometimes I make the wrong diamonds and hearts also. Fix this, please.
1723	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading
181	1	a	Cool and really fun game. But it doesn't have 1080p and it won't really run on my good gaming computer but runs well on my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier laptop. Game has highest resolution of 720
2537	1	a	Punch a T-Rex to death after it wrecked your tank!  Ride a giant Crocodile!   Awesome game!
2603	1	a	Excellent game.  Beautiful graphics if you have the PC for them, fast-paced gameplay, intense dinos versus humans combat, a wide variety of vehicles to choose from, and it can be very challenging at times. The environment weather-effects are well done and look very realistic, they also add an element of difficulty. It's hard to shoot dinosaurs when it's almost pitch black and raining. The visor effects caused by weather are also very interesting. Your visor can get frosty or covered with rain, making visibility limited.  I bought this game on sale for $0.75 and it was worth every penny. Some people give it a bad rap, but I have no clue why. Who doesn't like shooting dinosaurs with machine guns, driving tanks around and using a jetpack? Even if you only play it once or twice, it's well worth the regular price of $0.99. It's fun to play with friends while voice-chatting, I've even played with some Twitch streamers. I would reccomend this game to pretty much anybody. It's a heck of a lot of fun. Besides, even if you don't care for it, it's less than a dollar.
147	1	a	Great game! Interesting story and awesome gameplay if you like to smash everything :)
5523	0	a	Great if you like Halo with dinosaurs and toilet skid-marks for graphics. -10/10
5714	0	a	This terrible game popped up in my library one day. I think a friend gifted it to me.  1. Play for trading cards 2. Sell trading cards 3. Uninstall 
894	1	a	Same as first one, only little longer but still funny action game...and you will still think that script wrote Tarantino/Rodriguez but didn't have enough of red color and limbs of all kind. :D
3068	0	a	this game sucks !!!!
2053	1	a	I think that it is interesting, and brought something a little different to the table, and I TOTALLY love dinosaurs, but its graphics aren't very good. Hell, that could be my computer. I would still recommend playing it though. Maybe it'll be a better experience for you!
3350	1	a	ItÂ´s like Left4Dead but with dinosaurs, and i love it
3455	0	a	So my freinds, i have played 20 hours of this, more than i have played bioshock infinite, and here is my reveiw. Its not even open workd you're consrtantly defending a power genarator against din osaurs, but if you have a freind and two space helicopters it's extremely easy, or just get two rocket launchers, you get the choice of a knife or a gun that can provide you with infinite ammo and repair cars. Dinosaurs A.I is just suicidal, the multi-player is just 20 t-rex's standing outside the humans spawn, The audio is garbage, oh and the thing that makes every game worse, MICRO TRANSACTIONS! is there potential? If they re-did the audio worked on the dinosaurs and made it actully open world, meh. I dont know how this isnt listed aas early acess, it looks and feels like one. Unless it goes on sale for a dollar again, NEVER BUY IT! i've been told killing floor is better, which at some point ill get and look at, this reveiw of hitting a terrible game with a stick starts my writing reveiws
2126	1	a	This game is cheaper than EA's marketing tactics 10/10 would buy again !
1952	1	a	Really fun game. Especially if you find a couple of friends to play it with. For a low price, this game will give you a couple of hours of fun :D
4310	1	a	i cant really rate this bad or good but for the price of Â£0.79 its a decent game
2600	1	a	The optimisation could be better, but otherwise it's alright.
5841	1	a	It's much better than many $30 plus AAA and Early Access games and only 99 UScents.  Think Halos firefight/Spartan Assault modes but with dinosaurs instead of Covenent.  Seriously hope the dev makes a follow up. 
272	1	a	I think I killed the entire population of Manhatten, but then it respawned.
605	1	a	Definitely one of the funnest games I've ever played. Its fun, exciting and really makes you feel powerful and great. I think Prototype is GREATLY underrated as it is very original and good. I highly recommend this game, it has so much content and fun sandbox features and if you're a fan of games like Saints Row, InFAMOUS or Just Cause were there is lots to do in the open world and just create havoc, destruction and just have fun in a large world of freedom, definitely buy this.
5466	1	a	yes this is a asome game 
3675	0	a	My PC 'Meets' the recommended game requirements and it's even better than the recommended requirements.  But you know what? The game has that information in its â¥â¥â¥, game is lagging, AI is buggy and i'm getting max 25 FPS on minimal settings... Did i say that my PC meets the reccomended requirements?
1477	0	a	I wanted to like Beep. The music and art style is charming and some of the level design is good, but the difficulty is very uneven. Worse, the difficulty arises not from a solution being hard to think of, but because the controls are too loose to precisely perform what you've thought of.  Tighter controls would have turned this game from a no to a yes.
4928	0	a	very laggy even i use the recommended system
304	1	a	Overall good game but... sometimes you can try to fight hunters and think that there too much overpowered even in EASY mode and I mean it
5460	1	a	I recommend, the game is very fun, if you noob play cod you must try this one lol :P
2487	1	a	It's pretty good for an 80 cent game, I reckon it's worth more. It can be quite fun if you get it for your friends, and for just 2 euros, it's a bargain. dinosaurs / 10
5500	0	a	to maney error's no mather what you do it always crash for no reason....
1825	1	a	0.99$ um who wouldnt wanna have the thrill of a fps and kill dinos and dont have to worry bout lil kids saying you hack.
6187	1	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ i like this game worth his prize over nine thousand man, is just a meme itself
6369	1	a	its meh alone  beyond great with friends
184	1	a	A very good game in my opinion. Fun open world sandbox game. It's maybe a bit easy, but so much fun when you get the hang of it.
3820	1	a	it is the best 49 sents ive spent
2810	1	a	What a real man should do before death: achieve triangle with two hot chicks, eat kebab and kill dino using futuristic weapon!!! Now I have 66% of life achievements! : D
1357	0	a	very mediocre. I wouldn't buy this for $5. The sale where it was 19 cents fits the price perfectly. I mean look at it!
4284	1	a	Best not even a whole dollar you can spend on a game. #BringMeSomePizza
3271	1	a	This is LITERALLY The best game I have ever played. Buy it immediately.
5670	1	a	Very fun dino multiplayer shoot them up game.
4394	1	a	So bad its funny.  Best .99$ game i ever bought.
1845	0	a	Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.  Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me 'please don't listen to the metacritic reviews'.
1409	1	a	its an ok game and i got it on special and made 2 cents
515	1	a	A game to play when you feel like being a nearly unstoppable killing machine that consumes people for health, breaks tanks like they were made out of plywood, and terrorise a city. Or, if you're fed up with games with moral choice systems and don't want to have to put up with that random NPC that just insulted you, and would rather punch them from one side of the street to the other. Or if you want the freedom that comes from traversing a city in minutes on foot.  Oh man, I'm hungry...
2997	0	a	Onion Dorito Hard is possibly the best FPS since Super Mario 64, no joke. I mean it has snow, hats, custom colours, DINOSAURS, guns and an 'Upgrade System' so it seems it was worth the 79p on sale. Seems to have more content than CoD and is cheaper than it.
4009	1	a	this is rellay cool
4256	0	a	I purchased a four pack for around $3. After installing it and playing for a little short of an hour, I can report that it has poor graphics, subpar gameplay, and is more than a little repititious. Spend your time elsewhere. To those I start to send copies out to, I owe you apologies.
2117	1	a	you can kill a dinosaur with a lightsaber 10000000000000000000000/10 Prehistoric Reviews
2957	1	a	I got into my first game. I ran into my first dino to kill.  As soon as I started getting attacked, my xbox controller (which I wasn't using to play) started using the vibrators in it.  My whole desk started shaking, scaring my friend and 2 cats. The cats ran from the room like Satan was after their poop holes.  I will report back once I have played more.
2927	1	a	It's an OK game. Fun to be in the Jurassic Park guys' shoes. The dinos scare the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me.
1897	1	a	Some insane, crazy fun! Just a little bit unpolished but still fantastic!
3405	0	a	this game is garbage tried playing several matches and the game performs so poorly, yet it keeps going up on sales, it's not even worth a dollar  
2019	1	a	This game is really entertaining when playing conquest mode with a couple of friends. I like the way classes are able to cooperate and bring down everything that swarms around. Especially T-Rex, lol!
2606	1	a	I love this new farming simulator 8/17 Birthday cards would 360 a t -rex again
4482	1	a	this is the best game if ever played 
350	0	a	After more than two hours of attempting, this would not run on my PC (Win 7, 64 bit, can run basically every game on Steam).  Activision no longer supports the game.   Buyer beware.
2880	1	a	This game brings back a lot of nostalgia from other games made in the past using the Unreal engine. It plays good, things work fine and there are some handy features to adjust some options.  There are plenty of modes; pvp and pve are a lot of fun, from killing dinosaurs, or suddenly finding Santa trying to kill you with presents.  This game is hilarious and fun. If you love FPS/TPS games or just for the fun you can have with this game, I would recommend this game to play alone, with random people or just with some friends. 
1946	1	a	Used a Lightsaber to kill a dinosaur 10/10
4476	0	a	LAME, uninstalled this turd soon after playing it for a bit.
6190	1	a	Gameplay is fine not hard to master, controls are good,  the game is great tho i havent been playing the game that much to say, the game is relaxing and it doesnt give you the hard diehard tryout  i would say  -Teamgame on higher difficulties - Squad controls  -Fine to give each other money or credits to combine weapon damage -Having vehicles to shoot with( Tank, Titan, Hovercraft etc.) -Difficult game modes, team deathmatch king off the hill waves etc   the game is worth ur 1 euro and the game woould evenly be worth to buy it for 10 euros if u buy it trust me you wont be disappointed
7	1	a	As a young kid I played these games religiously. I used to write letters to Sierra asking for help and they'd respond via snail mail. That was before AOL 4.0. These games have aged as well as can be expected. Simply put, if someone created these types of games today and marketed them as 'retro', 'pixel graphics', 'point and click', 'text adventures' etc.- I doubt they would be as well made as the KQC games. The nostalgia is overwhelming, the quality of the content is priceless, and the feeling of solving a puzzle is unparalleled. If you are around 30, you probably paid $150 or more for the box set back at Media Play. The games are almost as fun today at a fraction of the price. kQV... 'Look out Graham, that's a poiiiiiiisonnnnnus snake!' And KQIV? Come on, completing the game 100 points over the maximum score? KQ3, finding the right ingredients in the spell book to advance their game. KQVI, making your way into the castle for the first time just waiting for your opportunity to return. VIi, those graphics - the epic ending where the win / lose was completely random based on your computers mood. So many memories. Where is Laura Bow and the dagger of amen ra? Or mixed up mother goose. All of the ascii text games, NORTH NORTH WEST NORTH, ahh a shack in the desert. Oh the memories.
5161	1	a	Get some friends, kill some dinos; at a very very cheap price. Too easy? Try playing on Insane. Now go kick some â¥â¥â¥!
222	1	a	An excellent suggestion for anybody.
6253	1	a	Awesomest community ever. Awesomest Devs ever. Awesomest Memetastic game. 50% off on the new Orion game for owning the prelude.  Buy this.

2908	0	a	This Game Suffers From Bad Frame Rates Graphics And Thrilling Fights I Mean Cmon They Could Of NAILED The Huge Dinosaur Boss Battles  But It Was Just Another Small Dinosaur With Bigger Mass So No I Dont Like The Game Final Verdict 5/10....Just Because I liked The Lazer Katana
5764	1	a	Played this game for an hour.......1$ well spent! its like HALO,Star wars, borderlands, battlefield and unreal tournament and Jurassic park all mashed up with insane graphics nd some awesome gameplay....unless u lack a dollar there is no reason u should not buy this epic game.....where else can u kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber!!!!!!!?????????
2043	1	a	A lot of fun, recomend for co-op fans and all FPS / Dino Lovers!
3322	0	a	don't work on windows 8.1 64bit, nvidia gtx 780 x 2 sli with 32gb ddr3
6306	0	a	 2/10
4228	1	a	Only played a little bit, at first I played alone and it got boring pretty fast, but when you play with friends this game mixes together a great feeling of excitement, hilarity, and suspense (after all that T rex could be right around the corner). So much you can do and the maps are a fairly good size as well leaving literally hundreds of different ways to get to where you need to go. not to mention the various vehicles and even a mech suit. Plus who hasnt dreamed of bow hunting for Dinos! 9/10
4455	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs in the face for $.99.    What? Buy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!
1049	1	a	EA sucks! They make you sign in to Origin, twice! Then they make you 'activate' the game with a CD key, twice! The menu sustem is also crap. It's inconsistent and clumsy. Please EA, just die already.  That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.
2323	1	a	A fun game to play with a group of friends.
5676	1	a	This Game is Great I would sponsor this game on Youtube if i could.
6393	0	a	Admittedly my time was rather short with orion Dino Horde. In that time during the free weekend I found the game to have had plenty of potential that is sadly lost in a generally bland game. It's sad to say really because the premise is pretty fun really. Running around as a team of soldiers blasting any and all Dinosaurs that you see with a variety of weapons and vehicles sounds like immense fun until you start playing it.  The animations are subpar for both the soldiers and dino's. Men look like they are gliding along the floor as they 'run' while dino's charge around the map with their jaws hanging open but not making any sounds. The large opponents such as T-Rex make roars every now and then but Jurassic Park level sound design this is not.  Weapons are varied but they all look pretty bland. Most weapons have flat textures with blue lights on them and many feel particularly weak when fired, or simply miss half the time. The weather effects for the snowfall is atrocious and overall it just feels bad.  I know this is by a small team who have accomplished something here that I personally couldn't and if you don't mind the general chepness of the title it's probably not going to grate on you too much. Certainly a game best enjoyed with a few friends. If however you are looking to buy this for yourself to game with random people online, DON'T. It isn't worth it as a single purchase.
938	1	a	The follow up on Shank... also a good (side scrolling) brawler!
5387	1	a	For all the money a person throws away on crap... The $1 I paid for this paid for itself! Yes, it's repetitive. Yes it's grapically boring. Yes, it's actually pretty pointless. So is Pac-Man, and people still pop in quarters to play it. If you're at least in your 30s, think back to all the times you popped in money to play Dragon's Lair. Even at the 1014 summer sale price of $3.74, it's worth getting imo if you're looking for cheap random wtfits amusement! If you have a friend to play with, it will quickly pay for itself. It's like going to Jurassic Park with jetpacks and guns! Don't go into this with a serious face! Go at it knowing what you're getting yourself into.  the bad... - very limited ability to customize yourself without the IAP bs. You do unlock a few things by playing a lot. - 1 music track for everything. Turn off the music, pop on some MP3s! - T-Rex 1 bite kills you! - Raptors are NOT clever! - It's not worth $15.00 when you can hit Walmart and get old AAA games for $20.
1162	1	a	This game has changed my life for the better : ^)             Kappa
663	1	a	Although not as good as PuzzleQuest (12500) it's still a fun little game. It's a mix between RPG and Poker, however weird that sounds it works. You earn special cards along the way, spells and followers and follow a storyline as you fight monsters through poker combinations. It could definently be better, more RPG elements and some new functions would liven it up. It it's cheap, it's worth it, or if your a poker and rpg fan!
3176	1	a	I feel like this game really taught me what it's like to be a paleontologist.
870	1	a	Liked the first game?? Then you gotta buy Shank 2, too!!
2617	0	a	I started this game being very excited: ''Powered on Unreal Engine''- Wow, this game looks cool! Nope, this game just suck. The gamplay is very rusty, graphics are ugly and there are just a few of servers.  5/10 dinosaurs
5299	1	a	So glad I tried this....easy learning curve and fun.
1042	1	a	Nice Puzzle game. It has charm, good pacing and the right lenght (about 5 hours). It's not as memorable as Portal or Braid, however, and the puzzles are on the easy side. I would say $5 is the perfect price for this game.   The store page says it requires Origin, but actually you just need to accept Origin's terms of service the first time you run the game, you don't need to run the client or log into Origin when playing.
3711	0	a	The Orion Prelude was one of the worst games of all time-Once Now it is a bad graphic, first person, dinosaur hunting, survival game. Servers only Costs money too buy items and there is no Steam trading inventory for it. Pros- 99 Cents Cons- Bad Graphics Lagging... Slow Costs money too buy in game items No trading As IGN said 'Please don't waste your hard-earned dogh' I rate this game- 3.1/10
2641	1	a	well honestly this game rules  there are a few bugs here and there but all in all BEST DINO FPS ON THE MARKET buyin a 4 pack($2.99) is still cheaper than a whopper at burgerking however...dino meat over an open flame...sounds yummy
5038	0	a	Glitchy. Makes for a frustrating game. All I wanted to do was shoot dinosaurs. Couldnt find the damn dinosaurs... game crashed, uninstall followed.
5776	1	a	For less than 1â¬ you have a super silly funny dinosaur shooter. Reminds me of an malformed halo son with a killing floor vibe to it. Anyhoo, it's just fun and there's DINOS.  And also, the devs made a great trailer for their game after 3 years of support with a lot of self criticism.
