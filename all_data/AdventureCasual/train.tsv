1506	1	a	My dune buggy takes a flying leap directly into the face of a T-Rex.   The T-Rex is not amused and proceeds to stomp me to death.  All for $1.  10/10
5942	1	a	Honestly, I can only describe this game as a knockoff Halo with dinosaurs.  I shot a pterodactyl in the face with a bow and arrow though.  I didn't pay enough for this game.
878	1	a	One of the best 2d brawlers I have ever played
3906	1	a	only problem is it doesnt have good fps on my computer
3667	1	a	best game in the entire world must buy please buy join based gaming
3914	1	a	THE GRAPHICS ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR MY AYES.  10/0,1
1832	1	a	This is one of the best games i played
4553	0	a	this game is a n u s
429	1	a	I enjoyed the freeroam platforming nature of the game. Like GTA with superpowers but I had some issues with the cutscenes not downloading properly.
4635	1	a	Halo... With Dinosaurs.
5567	1	a	Buy this game for all your friends when its on sale and force them to play with you. Then you gotta find some more friends.
4876	0	a	Why is the T-Rex so loud
3243	1	a	Don't look at the rating. Just buy it at discount when possible. Nice Replayability, cool game type options, generelly friendly community and hey...Dinos to kill.
3986	1	a	This is one of the greatest multiplayer games to play on steam. I've been playing with my friends through skype for a few days now and it just keeps getting more addictive. It's made with the Unreal Engine so it's perfect :D. I will always love this game ;-;
2739	1	a	Hit a raptor with a truck and it went up really fast. 10/10
3441	1	a	Did a future-helicopter barrel roll backflip into rocket propelled T-rex murder. 
13	1	a	Know your roots. If you are a fan of adventure games, you owe the King's Quest series for perfecting and popularizing captivating storylines to compliment inventive gameplay. Its like Devo or David Bowie, you owe this series a play simply because of the impact its had on modern gaming.
852	1	a	Better than Shank 1.
5524	1	a	One of the most fun games I've played for 0.99 cents ! Be a T-REX! and eat people! Or shoot em up as a person. Either way you're bound to have fun, best 0.99 cents I've ever spent.
985	1	a	A really fun little game that's well worth buying, despite the EA account nonsense. There are some great game mechanics in use and the puzzles are pleasantly challenging. It manages to be both cute and gory at the same time, too. Should note: I was playing with a controller (which works great), so I can't vouch for keyboard controls.
1882	1	a	Good exiting game where you have to work together with your team mates a lot to survive. Almost like CS but you fight dinos instead of terrorists.
2462	1	a	Jetpack +100 136/100
1253	1	a	Such an interesting game.
5254	0	a	This game is buggy, there are bugs such as doors remaining closed the whole game. The melee weapons are also useless as they are outmatched by the heavy weapons, such as the minigun. This game also has terrible graphics and the game has random lag spikes (the lag might just be my computer).
593	1	a	For me, this game is really awesome!! Here are the pros and cons. PROS: - Amazing storyline - Awesome powers - Awesome graphics - Challenging game CONS: - Nothing (except if you dislike blood and gore)   Basically this is a super awesome game. This is not all the PROS and CONS but this is what I can come up for now.
2059	1	a	Pretty sweet simplistic game. Excellent for low powered computers n min game resources. Also its history is hilarious for using the steam system like an iTunes top trending chart. 5/7 perfect game. Would play again
1585	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a big improvement on Orion: Dino Beatdown and is great to play. Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.
1314	0	a	Unpolished platformer
5827	1	a	11/10 Ragdolls are hilarious Game gets intense fast Buy it on sale!!!!
2605	1	a	Solid shooter, Dino AI sometimes a little strange, but tons of fun to play. Would recommend.
1891	1	a	Damn Good to Play this game
4538	0	a	i payed for this useless thing and now its free its not even a real game
2203	1	a	Okay, this game has been getting tons of negative feedback, but I don't see what's wrong with it. The previous games were pretty bad because they were filled to the brim with bugs. this game, not so much. It was a bit unprofessionally done, but you have to expect that from this level of a dev team. Obviously, the game didn't and also wasn't meant to have much depth, or a storyline, it was just meant to be fun. I mean, come on, its about killing dinosaurs. The game has a HUGE amount of content for a dollar right now, as well. I never ran into any bugs, there were alot of cool weapons and vehicles, and tons of content. The game ran and looked pretty good, and the controls are exactly as one would expect. Again, its biggest feature is that its simply alot of fun and there is alot to see, but not for you if you want a game with alot of depth. Its incredibly under-rated and the metascore is broken, would reccommend.
4776	1	a	jurassic world 2.0
3727	1	a	great game.
145	1	a	Fastpaced hack and slash. Graphics are good and the story is too. Not sure if i would pay full price = 19.99euro But deffinatly worth the buy at a sale. Play it with a steam or other controller for best game experience.   And also.... You can hug people to death in this game!!!!
1321	0	a	Boring spinoff of super mario, glad I only payed 19 cents
3464	0	a	Literally the worst thing I've ever played.
2101	1	a	M8 this game, whew it really blew my expectations. I was ROARING to play another round. Though the textures are a little... PRIMATIVE
2826	1	a	a really really bad game. i regret every cent i spent in paying for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. please do not buy it. let it die. let my shame die along with it.
6586	1	a	I happened to get it recently since it was on sale for $0.99 (I'm not gonna pass a deal like that up) and I feel that it was money more than well spent. I'd even go so far as to say that I'd be willing to shell out the usual $15 if I had to. There is nothing I dislike about this game. It's a fun slant on the usual wave survival/tower defense style game and it features a variety of game modes besides that. There is even one where you can play as the dinos.  All in all, I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes FPS.
3039	1	a	The T rex is the best dinosaur in the game because it powerful
3158	1	a	You kill Dinosaurs.......What more can one person ask for?
805	1	a	The same as Shank 1: cubic tons of blood, cartoon characters, more violence than in the Venezuelan newspaper, short but with enough replay value, etc. Virtually nothing was improved, and feels more like an expansion, but if you liked the first one, I did, go for it
4363	1	a	Your gun hovers in mid air right in front of you before your hand grabs it when you switch to your pistol. 10/10
97	1	a	pretty good for a prototype, i hope it comes out of Early Access someday
6069	0	a	you frekin crashed my computer with your frekien bugs
5529	1	a	best buck you will ever spend
5386	1	a	Great game other than being a bit laggy
4417	1	a	PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS, THEN DON'T READ THIS. THIS IS PURELY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THEN GO WRITE A HATE SONG ABOUT ME AND UPLOAD IT ON YOUTUBE.  This game was not worth your time, and you shouldn't buy it Although this game advertizes for having immersive co-op, co-op is barely present. The only 'co-op' this game has to offer is swarming the larger groups with dinosaurs stiff as wooden boards, while your team shoots all the dinosaurs down, except the pterodactyls, which are so small that they're impossible to hit, while some random guy is screaming at people over voicechat to come repair his vehicle. The AI in this game is not that great either. Enemies often circle around in the tall grass a couple of times and then charge straight at whoever is closest, regardless of wether a wall, a tree or even another dinosaur is in the way, not to say it matters, since most dinosaurs clip through each other. If you play as a dinosaur, the game then gets even worse. you spawn somewhere close to the players, half of the time, without a map, arrow or anything else to guide you to the so called 'survivors' forcing you to search for them. It doesn't help that the maps are HUGE, and everyone is mashed into a claustrophobic mass of crudely animated violence. If you don't have a somewhat beefy computer, this game will run with less than 15 fps, even on the lowest graphics, so take note of that, especially with the motion blur, where you won't be able to see 5 feet in front of yourself.  pros: -has some weapon variety. -better optimized for pc than Toukiden Kiwami.  cons: -awful co-op. -does not run that well on slower computers. -although it does offer multiple gamemodes, they all feel the same. -Developers went as far as to change the name once, just to get it to the steam frontpage.    final words: if you really REALLY don't have any other games to play, and have a lot of free time at your hands, then go outside and get a life.  I certainly hope this review helped you save your money, if not, then come back and write a review like I did, to help others see what lies beyond the wall  This is what i would have said back at Orion: dino horde. these people completely turned the game around, and is now enjoyable, and fun to play. they fixed many of the bugs, most of the stiffness, and did a ton of tweaks to the performance.  true final words: Buy, but don't wait for a sale. these guys who made the game spent a LOT of time improving the game little by little, until it finally became good, plus they made co-op a lot better too. If you bought this game previously, I say give it a second chance.  That's all, praise the sun.
666	1	a	Puzzle Quest fans need look no further for their next addiction.
1190	1	a	Great game 10/10
4253	1	a	its a really good game
610	1	a	i love this game :D
4589	0	a	Good concept... but the game needs a major optimization overhaul. I don't mind sub-par graphics.... but this game has been around for a few years and boasts about the constant updates and improvements made during this time. That being the case, there is no reason why I should get ok-ish to somewhat bad FPS on this game with minimal video settings, when other games like Skyrim and Call of Duty run smoothly on MAX settings.... If you're into not-so-great visuals coupled with not-so-great FPS, then this game is for you if you're willing to throw away a dollar... As for me, I'm going back to my 'real' games that at least function well enough that problems are hardly observed....
1256	1	a	it is really fun get it
5324	0	a	Alright for shooting some dinosaurs in the face, though the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly for my tastes. The assets are decent enough, but they suffer quite a bit in motion due to an odd application of motion blur.

5251	1	a	This is what happens when a stupid idea is amazingly fun.
727	0	a	It's a poker game, mixed with an rpg element. Pretty shallow. Difficulty scaling is pretty messed up?
2718	1	a	  I have to thank one of my great friends for getting me this game on my BDAY, but anyways I have to review this game.  I am not really a fan of dinosaurs BUT this game is indeed good I have to admit, this game does have a decent player base and the gameplay is really good, You can buy things in game to make your character look better like in TF2 (that godawful bucket of........ sorry venting) but yeah this game has a lot of great gameplay assets but I hope you enjoy this game. My score for this is a 9/10.    EDIT: WOAH, I just remembered how many microtransactions there are in this game, not only that but the A.I of the dinosaurs is actually a lot better than the A.I of your teammates if they are bots. I also joined servers where a ping of 300 was NORMAL. Maybe I was being a little to soft on this game but honestly IDK what else to say about this game besides, THE BOTS SUCK AND DON'T HELP YOU THAT WELL! 7/10 (-2 points)
3970	0	a	It runs like s@it it's boaring  and grapfics arend even that good
1903	1	a	When I first played this game it was nothing special. The gameplay was average, but fairly fun with friends. Today the game was updated which added a various number of things. The added rain and day and night cycle allows for more depth and realism to the point where i feel like i am actually in the arctic fighting dinosaurs in real life. This game now makes games such as Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 look like arcade shooters. 9/11 would bang and buy again.
1980	1	a	Best game ever 11/10 played it for days
1396	1	a	Really 10/10 game pretty difficult throughout and free profit from sale
2919	1	a	super fun with friends
5302	1	a	IT'S SO STOOPID IT'S GOOD
2397	1	a	For one Euro, this game is a steal. Pick it up ASAP! Can recommend to play with friends.
4388	1	a	what up with single player 
967	1	a	Shank 2 is a beat em up sequel of Shank from the developer Klei who makes Mark of The Ninja. like Mark of The Ninja, Shank 2 has a really good animations and presentation. the humor, cutscenes and the gameplay really makes this game so enjoyable to play. the combinations of melee attacks, heavy attacks and range weapons are really good that it makes the players free to experiment with a combo that works best in certain situation. Shank 2 is a fast-paced game but it also has some slow motions that works well, it makes the players rest a little from its fast-paced world and come back again. Shank 2 successfully blends beat em up with strategy because if you play just to keep attacking, you'll end up dead. Shank 2 is a really hard game which forces the players to plan a quick strategy for successfull attacks. Shank 2's story is a combination of violence and humor. some times it's really violent and some times it's funny but Shank successfully combine both aspects to be a good game. unfortunately, Shank 2 has a very short length of Story Campaign and it doesn't really do well in telling the characters and what's happening in its world. nevertheless Shank 2 is an enjoyable game with very good gameplay, good animations and presentations. it just doesn't really have longer length and story. 7.5/10
3511	0	a	this game is a peace of $h!)  sorry but it is and i want my money back
6144	1	a	My boy DJ Roomba bought me this game for Halloween. He is super cool for that. We play it on the daily and I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends.
3294	1	a	Better than any of the COD, BF, or Halo games. Worth the money if you like good FPS.
4000	0	a	I bought this game on a whim. That and it was 1 dollar. I managed to play enough to fulfill that 1 dollar but at face value it would not be worth it.  Why? For a game that is supposed to gone from a 3 to an 8 it feels like there are still numerous issues that have yet to be dealt with. For one, the issue with trying to join in a server and it doesn't work. There are times when joining a server crashes the game altogether.  Gameplay-wise I find that being eaten by a large dinosaur is a bit redundant due to the fact that you have a gun. Seriously, get eaten, blow the dinosaur's insides out with bullets or go kamikazi with a grenade and BAM! dead dinosaur. But the game says that's impossible.  Music is okay, can't complain about that.  Announcer voice seems to be a bit funky here and there when trying to announce things but otherwise not worth adding or removing points.  Overall, it's an okay game if you buy it bargain-bin(Around $0.99) but as a full game there are better games out there. 7/10.
2824	1	a	This game is soooo much fun and very addicting! Best .99 I've ever spent. I bought this for a friend as well. As the waves get bigger, it just gets more and more fun. The hit points are similar to Borderlands, and its cool that you still get credit and XP based on the percent of damage you've done to a dino before it dies. So even if someone finishes off a dino you pumped a lot of rounds into, you still get a portion of the xp and credit.
5517	1	a	Dinosaurs and futuristic weapons.  The first time I played this game, my childhood  exploded  was rendered all over the screen. Many other reviews cover the finer details of the game, so instead of rehashing them, I say just go play it!! Plus it's really really cheap, so you don't have much to lose, yet everything to gain.
3393	0	a	there is a horde of dions that eat your face. play on the halloween map if you (dont) want to preserve your sanity. why do the t rex throw rocks from its face? no backstory whatsoever and this game sucks.
6255	1	a	HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS GAME!?! ItÂ´s 1$ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the haters, this is a great game to play with your friends and itÂ´s even better then most games out there, â¥â¥â¥â¥, i had more fun in this than Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, and this is only 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing $. Just buy it, play it for 4 hours, and then passout cuz of all the fun you had!
419	1	a	Great fun game to play. You get to be ausome and do heaps of cool fighting moves. Best to play with an xbox controller. A good port to teh PC and easy to get teh hang off.  Good storyline and graphics arent bad considering this game is a few years old. If you can get it on special its woth the money. Also quite long so you will get heaps out of it.
4494	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
47	1	a	First time playing the game and it seems quite interesting, challenging and very funny.  Some of the posts complain about not being able to crack the codes =&gt; Read the manual.  Initially it wouldn't run on my Win8.1 PC after installation - it would seem a bad dosbox configuration or possibly an issue with the emulator? Anyways - if anyone else has the same issue, these steps might work for you as well.   1. Right click the game when in your Steam Games Library &gt; 'Properties' &gt; Click the tab, 'LOCAL FILES' &gt; Click 'BROWSE LOCAL FILES...'  2. Open '.\dosbox-0.63\dosbox.conf' for editing in notepad..  3. Find (CTRL+F) 'core=' and change the value from 'dynamic' to 'simple' and save your changes (CTRL+S)..  4. Launch the game.
4279	1	a	stupid fun, and the people who made it seem to have put a lot of work into it. I kinda feel bad paying $1 for it, since it's so much fun with friends
750	0	a	ugh... where to start with this game... lets see if i can put this nicely, this game makes me want to punt babies and kittens... broken from the get go and crashes constantly, however the opening scenes are ok. the good thing is that the best part... before it crashes...
5193	1	a	A lot of love was put into one dolla
2699	1	a	For one dolla' you can flip off a T-rex as it headbutts you to the other side of the map
556	1	a	Super hero simulator 1.
5457	1	a	its on no bad 
1935	1	a	THIS GAME IS SUPER FUN. I NEED MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH IT. BEST $2.99 SPENT.
3536	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
3183	1	a	this is a fun game, i really enjoyed it. its a great game for such a low price
905	1	a	not too easy not too hard  has simple controls and very good gameplay
6138	1	a	This is an amazing game, it is so unbalanced and glorious. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone! Dinosaurs, jetpacks, infinite ammo bows.... what is not to love!
1270	0	a	Any game that you cannot adjust the volumeof is a fail in my book. Glad I got this in a bundle and didn't buy it outright.
631	1	a	If I could give a neutral recommendation I would, because this is just an okay port of a decent game.  Every good point about Prototype seems to have a countervailing drawback. Maneuvering Alex around Manhattan has a thrilling feeling of hurtling along the streets in a blur of barely-controlled speed, but this makes it very easy to fling yourself in the wrong direction (off a building, into a military base, etc...) and the controls become infuriating any time you have to move with speed and precision. Naturally, I didn't bother with most of the 'movement' optional events (even playing with an Xbox controller). Furthermore, Manhattan is just large enough that criss-crossing the island as you go from one event to the next takes just barely long enough to become tiresome.  The side event system itself includes some real winners - I personally got a kick out of the War, Kill, and Glide events - but also some stinkers, such as Movement and Consume. The subset of 'Military Consume' events where you have to grab X targets in Y minutes are utter garbage that highlight the worst aspects of the game. On the other hand, the 'Military Consume' base infiltration and base destruction missions are a lot of fun, so it's a mixed bag.  Finding and eating targets to fill out the Web of Intrigue starts off as... intriguing (ba-dum psh)... but eventually becomes an onerous chore, and you don't get anything for completing it. I finished the Web on YouTube and walked away feeling relieved I didn't bother finishing it in game.  Generally, the combat is engaging and fluid, much the way the Batman Arkham series aspires to be. With Alex, as compared to Batman, there's a much greater sense of personal power as you lay waste to your enemies. You almost have to feel pity for them; most of these puny mortals are your playthings - grabbing a guy with the whipfist and flinging him at his friends is a real rush and is as easy as a few well-timed button presses.   However, the boss encounters are feats of poor design; I ended up having to beat each boss by spamming the whipfist in circle-strafe. The boss that pops out of the street (about 2/3 of the way through the game) was so infuriating that I nearly ragequit.  Technically speaking, the audio in the cinematics is borked. I carried out the recommended fix (unpacking the audio archives into the game directory; Google it for details) and it didn't do diddly for me. It really kind of sucks, but it doesn't affect gameplay or in-engine audio, so it's a pain in the behind rather than a game-breaker.  Overall, I had enough fun with Prototype, in spite of its flaws, that I'm willing to give it a half-hearted thumbs up. Pay no more than $5 for it and you'll get your money's worth.
1494	1	a	 Dinosaurs, jetpacks, lightsabers, teleporters, invisibility, high-tech vehicles, extreme weather effects... omg this game is everything! And epic victory music is playing in the background all the time. Seriously I have really good time playing this game.
1441	1	a	Beep Beep Beep!  + : simple, cute robots  - : classic platformer, nothing new really  6/10 would beep again
1995	1	a	Good game, Worth it for $1.49. (On sale). Very fun multiplayer
1963	1	a	First of all, if you are looking for a AAA blockbuster title, better start clicking the 'back' arrow. Go into this game, just like the TV show 'Pretty Little Liars,' with a lack of expectations. This game is FUN! If you have a few friends, you might want to take out a loan and purchase the 4 pack for only a few bucks. I got it for around a dollar and have played both online and solo. Other than a can of petroleum jelly, what else could you buy that is this much fun for the price? Not a whole lot. Now beware, there are some bugs here and there but that is only part of the experience! If you would like to see some gameplay, here's a video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reVhVGjRubI 
4121	1	a	WOW. Value for money is an understatement for this game. This game is worth about Â£12/$15 or maybe more but you can get it for Â£0.79/$1 or less (during sales) Also 15 DIFFERENT gamemodes !!!!!! What!!!!!!! For $1 !!!!! Oh my!!!!!!! Bottom line is definitely worth it. Trust me.  UPDATE: Now free to play, where's my money
2843	1	a	Worth the money
2542	1	a	Surprisingly addictive. Play it with friends.
1878	0	a	It's poorly optimized and doesn't look like the screenshots.
5692	0	a	1/10  this game may be cheap and it may have come a long way from where it started but still it has a long way to go. the game is unstable, buggy and the graphics quality on the highest settings is nowhere near what you see in the screenshots on the storepage. the character models and animations are just auful and the interface is strangly aranged.   now let's talk about the gameplay...   the consept of this game is good but they should have thought it out more. the game play get's very repetative very quickly.  the whole game is just:  spawn -&gt; activate generator -&gt; shoot dino's -&gt; shoot more dino's -&gt; buy new gun -&gt; shoot big dino -&gt; shoot more and more dino's until you die. then repeat on a (hardly)different map.  untill you get so borred that after a while you find the greatest feature in this entire game: The uninstall button.  so in concusion:  should this game be free?  yes  should this game be version 3.0?  definitly not, it is barely the level of a alpha prereleace.  if the developers update the game would you play it?  no, they have been at this for 3 years and it is still not better that a school project. it is unlikely that they will start to take this project seriously now.  is this review to harsh?  maybee, this is just how i experienced this game. maybee you will love it. but i don't, i took my time writing this so people think twice before buying this game. i know it is only 1$ but that single dollar could help little children in akrika get a proper education.. just think about that for a second before buying this so called 'game'.
999	1	a	One of my favorite games :)
5425	0	a	C'mon, you know you want it. A dollar. There are dinosaurs, guns, vehicles, melee, all you need. BUT, only buy it if you have a friend to play with you, because this game is coop based. Have fun.  EDIT .: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE
4484	0	a	ok i know i dont have a mega super Â£10000 pc but i can generally run most games with about 20fps on mid graphics, but this this game. i dont know where to start. i dont know what the gameplay is like because it runs too badly for me to play. i put it on lowest graphics and i get about 4fps if im lucky. when i tried to play it on mid graphics it froze and what i could tell by the screen where horrid graphics. luckly my friend paid for it not me.
2723	1	a	Got the 4-pack at 3â¬, played with my kids a few hours, already got my money's worth.  Don't get this expecting a piece of art, unless you consider goldfish in a blender art.  Go in expecting to shoot a lot of dinosaurs (nothing much deeper, though you can buy perks and guns in the game), and your expectations will be well met.
5202	1	a	Can't argue with the price, and I killed a T-Rex with a revolver.   10/10
5809	1	a	Dinosaurs!!!!!!!!  Roar!!!  Yum?   Really though,  get this game.
4582	1	a	Fighting dinosaurs in mechs. Period.
4474	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME AND THIS CO-OP OMG! CATCH A GAMERA OMG LOVE THIS GAME ^~^ ^3^ ;-; ===================================================================
1627	1	a	After many game updates from the old title ORION: DinoHunt, they gave the game a new title called ORION: Prelude.  The game is a lot of fun since they fixed it and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is casual on the FPS genre. Although a bit taxing on old computer hardware, it's really cheap and feels like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Jurassic Park.  With many game modes to choose from, how the dinosaur action is played is up to you and able to play with other people as well. Go nuts!
4023	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE SHIIIIIIT  GO BUY IT NOW ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GO PLAY THE FREE TRIAL
4229	0	a	a junk game, a dumbed down version of halo with much less
5412	1	a	when it was free
4766	1	a	this game is great
5748	1	a	It's a ridulously fun and mildly nice game. To say that it has 'huge, endless environments' is somewhat pointless, because it isn't fun to explore them, for there is only scenery outside of the area where dinosaurs spawn. Though they will follow you.  I would definitely recommend this game. The optimisation is fairly decent, considering that it looks fairly pretty on high settings, but there are always a few bugs here and there. The gameplay is balanced to an extent, but in a more interesting way than a generic fps, instead going for a more classical unrefined approach which makes it much more fun and progressive (in my opinion).  And best of all, the developers are still working on it, so it can only get better from here.  Did I mention that it's only $1?
2915	0	a	I honestly dont like it that much it just feels improper, the #1 thing that annoys me is the vocals, they sound like scottish people who dident put any effort into voice acting. This new update just makes the game look like for kids now, and the taunts are just .. Wow.    Still worth the price though.
3922	1	a	it's ok, but an awkward mix of Counter-Strike,(the voice commands)Dirty Bomb,(the accent)and Halo(the graphics) I can see why it's only 99 cents now, but it's pretty good, I guess
2525	1	a	this game is hella fun!!  lots of customization, MANY gamemodes, its weird hows not everytone playing it atm! for .99c its a surebuy
4648	0	a	So I started playing and looked at the wall because I was checking my surround. a dinosower slid up the wall doing the walking animation then began to slide sideways on the skybox while sliding it did not have a animation so it flew like a angel on sunday 
496	1	a	this is insanely a great game. It will challenge you quiet a lot come later in the game, especially when you have to fight some of the harder bosses in the late game - even with almost every upgrade possible unlocked I still died multiple damn times on the last few bosses cause of their power and being targeted by over hundreds of things at once (&gt;.&lt;). I would 100% recommend people to get this game, especially since it's on sale!! Makes it even 200x's better that it's on sale :D
461	1	a	BEFORE I REVIEW! If you are having FPS problems. Try this. 1.) Open Device manager. 2.) Start DISABLING, and not DELETING your HIDs. (Aka the ones that look like 'HID-compliant ~etc) 3) Re-enable them after you stop playing.  This fixed my issue. Hopefully it fixes yours, should you have it. &lt;3  Review: Pros: + Combat is absolutely brillaint.  + Gameplay feels smooth. + Things despawn at a very slow rate. For example: You can set a helicopter down at one end of the map. Run to another end and back and find it right where you left it. + You have character appropriate abilities. + Violent, and gory. Very, very graphic. (If you enjoy gory games.) + There's an option to replay the campaign with previous campaigns unlocks. &lt;3  Cons: - Graphics are a little dated. Max resolution is 1280/800. - Story is short, and a little lacking. - Entire game is essentially a copy of Radical's: 'The Incredible Hulk. Ultimate Destruction.' - Very gory, and violent. (If you dislike, or are disturbed by gore.) - Voice acting was bad. (Though better than the second game, I will mention.) - End game feels repetitive. You run around killing the same hunters, soldiers. Destroying the same bases, and hives. After you're fully upgraded. End game Prototype feels a lot like endgame GTA. You just run around and kill things.  If you played the Hulk Game I mentioned in the Cons. Then realizing the fact that it was essentially copy pasted from that game will ruin most the experience for you. Though if it is on sale. I would pick it up.
77	1	a	Nostagia kicked in, played this way back in the dark ages when Sierra On-Line was allmost the only graphical text adventures you could get. I must say, my sense of humor has changed since then. Games are .... ok. Sound is .... beeping and graphics are .... ok.  If you are as me .... nostalgic .... for old PC games, i urge you to buy them, play them and remember how the good old days was.
3855	1	a	so much fun for 1$! It is very awesome get it worth its worth the money
4797	0	a	This game is not worth whatever it is put on sale for ever. Just not a fun shooter. If you want dinosaurs get primal carnage or dino d-day, anythingnother than this. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.
6184	1	a	Dinos and Shooter Very good game for this price. I only can recommend this game!
5585	1	a	Did you ever wake up one day and felt the need to drive a jeep into a T-Rex' face? Now you can  Ever wondered what it felt like to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥slap a raptor with the butt of your rifle? Now you can  Ever seen a stegosaurus do the moonwalk on the side of a cliff? Now you can  Do you have the uncontrolable urge to jump on the back of a triceratops and stab it with a knife repeatidly? Now you can.  Ever wanted to play Halo, Borderlands, Turok, Time Splitters, Planetside, Jurrasic Park all at once? Now you can.  This game is absolute mayhem. It doen't win any prizes for its quality but it does what it's supposed to do: deliver hours of hilarity and action. I binned Mass Effect. I binned The Witcher 2. I tossed aside Deux Ex 3.  But this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shooting gallery? it will make me come back for more. If anything, this game is a guilty pleasure.  Ever wanted to pwn dinos while laughing your â¥â¥â¥ off for a whopping $0,99 and give money grabbing corporations like EA the finger in the process?  Now you can.  DO IT.
2128	1	a	I was in a jeep with a buddy and we tried to run into a stegasaurus. The stegasourus sent me and my buddy 300 meters into the air and i flew past my buddy in a VTOL Helicopter. 10/10 would try to run over stegasaurus again. (Seriously though this game is amazing like holy crap)
4162	1	a	this is a fun addictive shooter with a call of duty zombies and a halo feel. It is definately a must buy because it is only 75p
1716	1	a	AMAZING! I would recommend it to EVERYBODY i know, keep up the good work, there is a bit of lag with a spawning dinosaur boss however, so there are of course still a few bugs, but can't wait to get my friends together and play this for real.
6500	1	a	it is pretty fun.
5155	1	a	cant go wrong for the price ^.^
6567	0	a	Don't play it, it's bad, trust me..Despite being warned by a friend I thought I should give the game a try..Within the first 10 second my impression was: AWFUL. Textures are far from even an average 'standard' quality for PC...Guns feels weird, hard to aim, horrible sound and also feel weight less..FOV is low, makes you motion sick and nope, you can't adjust it.
2590	1	a	When I was the metascore I was somewhat worried, but I tried the game when it was free for 7 days; although I've only played for 2 or so hours the game is worth the cash, especially if you have friends who are willing to play too, but you can always find games online if you donât.  The game has a nice feel to it. Like Killing Floors except in this game you kill a crapload of dinos. The game does sometimes feel cheap with the whole hip fire not being accurate at all, but down sight you will have no problem. It was pretty amazing to be chased by a T rex, makes your heart pump and leaves you with the feeling of what else is coming... well there are many more dinos and T rex is not the biggest one either.  Ignore the score, the game has been polished enough to enjoy with friends.  
3807	1	a	gg steam votes for sale when game was already 99 cents on sale instead of a real game. wp steam community
729	1	a	Good game and fun to play some poker-like-game. Had fun playing it, but wouldn't pay full price, wait till it's on sale :)
2979	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is pretty damn good. Survival Gameplay has 10 Waves of increasingly stronger Dinosaurs to fight, and your experience is more rewarding the longer you survive; dieing has the consequences of losing all upgrades, augments, and weapons you purchased during that life. This usually turns away or dissuades people who aren't good at surviving from continuing to play.  Multiplayer is difficult when playing with random people, but I blame that on practically nobody having a mic or speaking english. Communication itself is also practically nil, and most players (That I've encountered) will be more focused on rushing through the game, wasting resources and vehicles, and often dieing a lot in the process. To better enjoy a Survival match, I suggest getting some friends to play one with you.  The other gamemodes have very few players playing them, but that's due to the currently attempting-to-rise popularity of the game, and Survival is also the most commonly played mode.  If you're gonna get ORION, and/or play it, I suggest having a Microphone ready, a comprehensive grasp and understanding of the concept of 'Survival', good aim, better situational awareness, and some friends to play it with you (Who hopefully also have all the qualities described).  Try not to die!
4721	0	a	You say the game is fixed? let me tell you, I have not been able to play the game without any lag! and I have a Intel Core i7 NEW! this game also seems largely boring, all my friends regreted the buy so did I, 4/10 (Broken Laggy Mess with some funny moments) this is a personal opinion if you liked it, then im very happy for you but for me its very broken.
293	1	a	I liked how to the story progress as alex got stronger definatly will play agin
3048	1	a	Actually this was surprisingly good. Pretty much Killing Floor meets Jurrasic Park. High intensity FPS.
2797	1	a	I shot a dinosaur in the face and it threw a rock at me. 11/10 Would rock again.
1491	1	a	 UPDATE : ORION PRELUDE   There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game  (no single player after all) , there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism  (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity) , the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP  (in a good way!) , but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that  feeling  when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels  (without a lot of perks)  you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable  (there are a few surprises though) , but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay  (some bonus ..ahem.. querks)  offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!     Too much to read?    Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..   I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269015668   (original artwork uploaded by  Grayscars !)

865	1	a	This game should have been called Shank 2:The Real Chuck Norris simulator. After the events of first game Shank returns to his home village which he finds outruned by bad guys. And so another epic adventure begins for Shank. Shank 2 is a 2d side-scroller beat'em up game where you can kick some butt and break sculls of your enemies. Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes. So everything is great here and it's full of badass-ery even though game is short but it's worth it low price. One of the best downloadeable games of 2012.
5775	0	a	im not really into this game it lags like hell so i cant move/turn around witthout doin somat stupid and there is nothing there to kill when i join a multiplayer game so yeah... its crap for me (i wanna get a refund but i dont know how)
1224	0	a	Kinda janky, and feels pretty cheap.
689	1	a	Let me ask you one thing! *points at you*   Do you like playing poker?   Do you like playing magic the gathering?   Have you ever wondered what would occur if poker ever got drunk at a party and had sticky awkward unprotected sex with magic (the gathering)?  Then you are in luck you sick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this is the game for you! *points at you again*
1318	0	a	Crashed, and wouldn't let me close steam because it thought it was still running. 0/10 Awful.
1950	1	a	This game is so freaking fun! There's an eight year old deep inside me that's jumping for joy after playing this game! 
5878	0	a	'I got the game and it still had really bad Graphics and lag OMG.'
6346	1	a	Can't afford to buy it for $5. Can't afford to not buy it for $0.99
6404	0	a	So it seems to me that the map is just way to big and you end up running for minutes on end to get places and that dinosaurs at times can be way to overpowering if you dont have 4 or more people playing with you. Also the bosses can wreck if you are 4 or less. The matchmaking is absolutely garbage, with refreshing sometimes not working and trying to get into a game saying that you can connect but having a giant CONNECTING plastered on your screen. Friends can sometimes join games that you cant. Overall its a 4.5/10 in terms of gameplay quality and could be a meager laugh or too in coop play but there are far better options in terms of this catergory. BUT for a dollar you might as well buy it but for nothing more.
3828	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
1310	1	a	This game is awesome and fun! I reccomend it!
4332	0	a	This game honestly isn't that good, I am glad I got it on sale when it was a dollar. All the game is, is to reactivate reactors over and over while killing dinosours. There are vehicles to get to the reactors faster, but honestly I left the game minutes after I realized it lags when I shoot. I would rate this game 2/10
5589	1	a	It's a great dinosaur FPS game! The sensitivity of your head movement needs some work, but other than that, great game!
3369	1	a	A very addictive game and fun as hell!! ^_^
6294	1	a	GREATEST 3 DOLLERS IVE EVER SPENT leviling system makes it easy to lv up not much grind needed to get ok stuff but even in easymode the 'large dinos' get really overwelhming recomend to play with freinds makes the experience more life full great soundtrack and cool weapon exited to see this games updates
2210	1	a	Really buggy and lacks a lot of things. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUN TO PLAY!
5554	1	a	the most fun i have had for 99cent. Game is great fun to play with friends :)
5205	1	a	Jurassic Park in space.
1283	0	a	Boring, repetitive, waste of money
3538	1	a	Good weapons, good graphics, good textures.
1106	1	a	You play as a robot that has a gun that can be used to break physics. It's addicting and you die quite frequently. Play this before going to bed.  10/10 would rage
3817	0	a	Trash. graphics are mediocre, performance is horrible, and dont even want to hear the audio, which sounds like a game from 1995, actually, worse. cons: poor quality, no singleplayer, bad multiplayer, overpriced dlcs, and not optimized.  pros: workshop.
3920	0	a	horrible
12	1	a	Fantastic! Oldschool :D
5618	1	a	You can use the FORCE! :D
2333	1	a	Quite fun. It has an intresting gameplay design and is addictive.
4839	1	a	bought this today after ORION was taken down, â¥â¥â¥â¥ activision
3189	1	a	From the first 5 minutes i enjoyed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game ! worth playing with Friends Super Fun
6511	0	a	pros: lovey graphics   cons: the game my 24 inch monitor wont fit bad sound effects i have a 5.20ghz but i still had to run it on low graphics  and the modles look terrbal thank god i got it for 99p i would love to reccmend this game but its not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wervay sorry ;(
3661	1	a	This game is has a few rough edges, but it's really fun.   If you enjoy Killing Floor, Sanctum or Team Fortress 2 in Mann Up mode you should give ORION:Prelude a try. It's like playing Sanctum with bots instead of a maze, but on the island from Ark and with special abilities and hats.   I suppose every game has hats now, but still.  Give the zombies a break and mow down dinosaurs for a change.
3032	1	a	This game is insanely fun and I mean who doesn't love killing dino's in a mech suit haha I definately recommend this game. Solo is crazy fun and it's even more fun with a group. Two thumps up and I hope ORION has more games to come like this.
1529	1	a	This game? This game is awesome. It costs only 0.79$. Thats pretty cheap for a game like that.  Lots of features, funny gameplays, multiplayer matchmaking super fast and lots more. Verry nice co-op with friends. Totally worth the money. Buy it!
75	1	a	One of Sierra Online's best game series collections. The Space Quest Collection takes you on a hilarious adventures in outer space. Your name is Roger Wilco, a bumbling space janitor from the planet Xeon, and a bit of a slacker. Your goal is to guide Roger through his various misadventures.
275	1	a	Great game, you can complete it within a couple of days, but there is a free roam which gives you a bunch of other missions
3577	0	a	I can tell you before it got its makeover it was pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, I played the makeover for a few minutes and that was pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ as well but it looks like they updated so i might reinstall it
351	0	a	Non starter with my 4930K, SLI GTX970s and Win10 x64. not sure if I should refund my $2.... Oh well.....
6267	1	a	Basically, theres a class who can heal vehicales, teammates, then yank out a minigun and literally kill a giant bloody aligator dinosaur in under 10 seconds, and then get dive-bombed to death by flying dinosaurs. Best game ever. 
2237	1	a	Its not that bad.
1026	0	a	the game is mediocre at best, the concept is kinda cool but not worth $10 i only payed $5 cause of summer sale thank god but even then i wish i didnt buy it. The story is painfuly boring and lack of creativity and the upgrades in the game do very little. As for all the people ahving trouble with the origin account? i logged in once and played the game smoothly ever since the only thing is it said i wasnt logged in everytime i started the game but to be honest i just wanted to finish the game to see how it ended (it was a dissappointing ended obviously lol) and the save game was never an issue. I dont recommend this game because its blan and boring go spend your money on something better. Hope this helps :)
2296	1	a	Still a better love story than twilight!
2351	1	a	This is a pretty interesting game.  I got it while it was about a dollar or so, I got a 4-pack, actually, as I'm still hoping to sometime play with people on a kind of lan party. This would be the perfect game for it, and make sure to order pizza.  This game is fun... it can get repetitive quickly, but if you learn a few tricks you can keep things quite interesting. This is the kind of comical game that, well, the way I played at first that I survived by doing? - I was running around knifing raptors - Yes, knifing them.  There's your sign.  Everything about Dino Horde feels like an arcade game. The item/upgrade stores, and so on.. which is neat.   For the sake of repeated play getting boring, and a lot of low appeals other than the comical... bugs -  7/10
3760	1	a	Fun shooter Dino slayer who wouldnt enjoy????!!!!!!!
1968	1	a	If you are playing with your friends it's good but Ä±f you are playing with your friends.
5935	1	a	This game is the most HORRIBLY AMAZING GAME IVE EVER PLAYED FOR JUST 1 BUCK I WAS SO HAPPY I JUMPE OFF A CLIFF then lost all my weapons and we lost........BUT STILL 10/10!!!!!!!
607	1	a	Great game. The graphics aged about as well as 2009 graphics can age, and the story is alright. The gameplay is amazing though, and I had plenty of fun as Alex Mercer, our stone-cold proto-tagonist (I'll stop now.) and using his awesome power to destroy things. You feel like an all-powerful god, but the game still has challenge to it that keeps it from being totally boring. A throughly enjoyable experience all around, and something you want in your library if you liked Rock Star's Infamous and Infamous 2.
4288	1	a	Awesome dino fps Hard to go wrong
3801	0	a	Terrible. 5 dollar budget. wasnt play tested. If there are more words to describe it, I dont think they exist.
4169	1	a	BEST GAME EVER!Graphics are very good,you can even play the game with an older computer,it works just fine! It's worth the 2 euro i paid for it! And ooh,be carefull it is highly addictive! :DDD
2729	1	a	This game is very fun! I liken it to L4D2, but I personally enjoy this more. There's a variety of weapons, perks, enemies, objectives, maps, and vehicles. Whether playing alone or with friends, I think it's a good FPS with nice graphics. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes first-person shooters. There isn't a 'campaign,' it's just multiplayer/singleplayer arena comat.
2528	0	a	First of all....this is a bad game! Don't get fooled like I did. I thought: well it can't be THAT bad,but it is. To be fair, I bought it for 99 cents so I guess it's a good deal,but it's not worth like 5 $ or something.
4010	0	a	So i recently come upon this game think 'Holy crap im going to be able to like rpe some fckin dinosaurs. So I had to make a choice to rather get food for my family, or play as motherfckin dinosaurs and let my family play a couple times. So I decided to buy Orion Dino Horde. At first I was like, holy fricken jesus look at the small dinosaurs that just horde the generator, screw orion dino horde, it should be dinosaurs like to orion the generator with a horde. While I play, I let my friend Anne Frank play for a while, she said 'lulz i gve it 0/7, bt il be bck, im goin to gt baked' so i assumed she ment going to the sauna because that game was amazingly optimized but instead she climbed in the oven and left me a note saying 'lulz, il nver be an mlg orion dino horde player lik u'. I said aw, you really think im that good? Of course she didn't respond because the game was sooo good it made her kill herself. So then I thought, if im really that good, ill need other people to tell me that. So I got a buddy of mine named Lorenzo who was healthy and young. After he was done he said 'lulz hld on polp, i ned to seee mi parnts bcuse lulz' I was so confused so I waited and a week later I go to his house and hes all 'U DID DIS TOO ME' and I ran and talked to Lorenzos dad and he said, 'lulz dat fagot got ALD from somedinhg clled Dino Beatdown'. I got really scared and left. 2 years later i go back to his house and he is now hooked to a respirator and a suculant incubator. Thats when I realized something, that game gave him ALD. So I let him play it one more time for good old times and he said '.-.. ..- .-.. --.. / ..-. .- --. --- - / ---.. -..-. ---..' thats in morse code, so that means 'lulz fagot 8/8'. I really couldn't believe how Mlg I was at this game. But then that made me think, one person who played this game killed herself, and the other onee got ALD from it and only enjoyed it when he was paralyzed, blind, deaf, and could only move his hands. So finally, my review on this game is that you rather have to be MLG like me John Motherphockin Sorcerer Polp, or you die and get ALD from it. It was worth buying this game then giving my family food. Lulz i give this game 1/8, would not get noscoped by dinosaurs again.
1694	1	a	this game like jurrasic park and mister chef is there and killing dinos because the covenant did some â¥â¥â¥â¥ so he needs kill them all in all 8/10
1596	0	a	This game is simply bad. Based on a weak engine (Unreal 3 - outdated, doesnt support ms antialiasing just the terrible fxaa etc.) Awful animations, boring gamemodes and maps... Dont believe to those who tell you dont believe to metascore.  If you want to try out an interesting multiplayer fps with asymmetric teams I can recommend Natural Selection 2. That is a well made game. This is not.  Oh and I mostly forgot to mention the ingame shop where you have to buy extra skins, equipment and animations for real money - but fortunately that wont be a big temptation.
1504	1	a	Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?  Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.  But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.  Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.  The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.  What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.  Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.  Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.  When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.  When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.  The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.  The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.
4427	1	a	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LOL!
3528	1	a	I got this game on sale for 50cents. Definitly not the best game ever, there are some issuses with it. But the game is fun easy to play and great for you and your friends. its cheap too. I boughtit for some of my friends.
2235	1	a	This game is really worth getting it on sale, its only 1 euro/dollar ! The multiplayer has many game modes to select from. You can play versus dinosaurs or deathmatch with real people (wich i play most. It has nice graphics , and enjoyable gameplay . This game is pretty fun , one of the Best 1$ game on sale ! Really worth getting it !!
3534	0	a	this game is so bad, it's so laggy and you can shoot dinosaurs through the wall like the good old early 2000s counter strike. Such a bad game. Not even worth my 1 dollar. Dont buy it.
3775	1	a	Pretty fun game to play, especially since it is extremely cheap.   Pros:  Simple gameplay Good to play with friends Very cheap, literally the price of a can of Pepsi Dinosaurs   Cons:  Players don't seem to communicate much, which can make it pretty boring if you're not playing with friends AI can be a bit buggy at times Pterodactyls are annoying asf  Definitly recommend if you're looking for game to play with atleast one other friend, not as fun on your own
2717	1	a	...
3212	0	a	It's buggy and rough around the edges, but it isn't completely terrible.  99 cents is a fair price for it. Anything more is a rip-off.
3500	0	a	the only thing I liked about this game was the price.
1622	1	a	Truth be told, I am not a big fan of the 'standard' multiplayer. But the open world missions are entierly different. You must protect your base, explore and fight off hordes of dinos. The most fun I've had since Minecraft alpha.
5956	1	a	This game was awful before but now its more polished and is a lot better. Its worth 1 dollar and even 5 dollars but 10 dollars and above it wont be worth the money it isnt that polished, The community is awful and it was a bit confusing. The graphics are fine and there are less bugs then before.
4853	0	a	Like skyrim but without a development team.
3625	0	a	Gabe newell should pay us to play this piece of garbage
3579	1	a	very good and cheap game, but i dont understood some parts :D
2712	1	a	I am fully encouraged to recommend this game!...... to anyone looking for a horrific gaming experience &amp; the sexual assault of your wallet (If the game is not on sale for a price that can be considered 'expendable').  Gifted to me by a friend during the 99p sale, we were treated to a game with horrible animations, unusual keybindings, not one single form of tutorial, and horrific sound issues where footsteps reign louder than gunshots &amp; death of a player treats all player to a painfully loud slo-mo sequence. And after all of the updates this game has received since it's crtically panned release, it's INEXCUSEABLE that the developer has left these issues completely neglected. I'd speak about how starved of strategy the gameplay is, but I've not been capable to play this trainwreck enough to provide proper judgement. Unbelievably, me &amp; my friends had a lot of fun suffering at the hand of this game's poor design, but it was short lived.  In general, this is a game that is poorly designed across the board, and whose issues most core to the game have been completely ignored in favour of expanding the game experience.  You will laugh, you will anger, you will cry. Whatever the case, fully recommended to those seeking to see a video game at it's worst (when ON SALE). Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY &amp; STAY AWAY!!
362	0	a	Clearly prototyping was not involved in the development of this game or else it never would have been made.
2933	1	a	Ready for a little Joy-fun, Beautiful Family? Â®â¢ ;)
1898	1	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ are you kidding me this is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game i ever i did play
5345	1	a	Not the most polished game, but I have had a lot of fun with it for the $2 I spent. Good dino shooting gallery game, and coop is fun.  7.5/10
2792	1	a	'It's like skyrim with guns with dinosaurs; It's okay I guess' - IGN 12/10
4435	1	a	It was like an arcade game. I put in 50 cents and got a little entertainment.
364	0	a	No matter how much I struggled, fought, and screamed, this game would NOT run on my pc, which can play almost every game on Steam on max, or high settings at LEAST. The game would boot up at the wrong resolution, being a tiny box in the corner of my screen, with no way to make it fit despite my fiddling with the resolutions. So many things wrong with this game, I can't possibly type it all unless you want a page-long review. it runs SLOWWWWWW and just basically unplayable. Terrible purchase choice. Do NOT buy!!!!

3380	1	a	Cheap, but very entertaining game. Hopefully they could make an upgrade about campaign though, like what are your objectives, why are you killing dinosaurs, and such, I think that we're alien visitors and just mining some power for our own planets or technology, should add details about such things. anyway, great game 8/10
3847	0	a	Still not worth it.
1225	1	a	It's like mario meets wall e
5697	1	a	This game so cool and funny LOL!!
5850	1	a	It is alright i guess not the best game i must admit but i guess it worth around 79p it has developed since its early stages a lot as i saw there vid on it. But u no i guess it kinda addictive just work on the graphics and the style of thae game.
187	1	a	It's like saints row 4/ Hulk ultimate destruction but edgy.
1872	0	a	Do not get this game. It has horrible graphics and very bad fps, even though tipicaly running 120fps on any other game. The consept is ok, but nothing great: you have to survive waves of dinos who come and try to kill you and your generator. get sanctum if you want a game like this but better.
2906	1	a	If you're looking for a simple and fun shooter that you can easily jump into with some mates, this one is it. There are a few frustrating quirks (like not being able to join back into an active round once you die or if you leave) and you need a high tolerance for frustration -- those dinos can be ruthless. If you can stand that and want a game with a bit of a challenge, ORION: Dino Horde is a great choice.   Just don't try and play it on your own - the difficulty curve on the higher levels isn't something you want to tackle on your own.   The devs are very responsive in the forums and it's telling that you'll always find people dropping into your game between rounds if you're playing a 'Public' game.  
5286	1	a	honestly at first i tought this game's graphics where a bit on the bad side but i was having so mutch fun i didn't even think about ghraphics 
6154	1	a	Exploded a car into the wall and got an achivement for that. 10/10
5323	1	a	This is a really great game to play with your friends. It is frantic and fun. Imagine a expanded nazi zombies mode from Call of Duty: World at War with dinosaurs. Really fun
6441	1	a	this game is amazing it got light sabers and mech suits and cars and arcrafts and laser guns and sentry turrets and GIANTS DINOS !!!!!!!!!!!!!
6057	1	a	why am i able to write a review for this? i dont even own it.
3964	1	a	*F+3* 'Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?!'  10/10
896	1	a	It may doesn't look like good game, but it's great.
4577	0	a	boring boring boring, just it
4295	1	a	This game is lovely, killing with your team mates surviving endless hordes of dinosaur's perfect :) a bit laggy tho sometimes.
247	1	a	Good Game! 'Nuff said. I guess...
6160	0	a	This game used to be my favorite but now with all it's updates and stuff it just went down. Yet now it appears to have more lag and Framerate issues. The gameplay is fun but hard to enjoy. So I would not recommend it at the moment
179	1	a	really awesome game! heaps of side quests and activites to do, you can upgrade your abilites and â¥â¥â¥â¥ so thats pretty rad.
4163	1	a	This is a great game for dino lovers or people who just want a new kind of FPS.
2655	1	a	This isnt a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game anymore, albite its not the greatest game ever. but if your looking for a gmae ot â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with friends this can do it. its score is like a 5-7/10. Not the best, Not the worse. just ok
4140	0	a	very boring dont buy it
2713	1	a	Had inappropriate relations with a T-Rex, spawning little raptor babies, strange men in space suits come invade my land, my baby's daddy charges them and eats 1, my little raptor babies all swarm in and attack their ankles, hiding in the grass. They all die. I spawn more babies.  10/10 best 74cents ever spent.
1981	1	a	OMFG! This game is better than I thought. Got it for $4 in the summer sale and just love it :D
5651	1	a	Was free for weekend, saw it was 0.74$, bought it just for lols, and wow, this is so fun to play if you want some satisfaction out of killing dinos and getting 'ARMAGEDDON' voice queues. â¥â¥â¥â¥in sweet.
5409	1	a	The graphics were not too bad, the gameplay does have a few bugs and the boss dinos are pretty hard hitting but what were you expecting from a 99p game. In my opinion this game is pure gold, it has fun gameplay and it's almost innovative to the indie genre. The weapon range is large and it has a competetive element inside it. Therefore I would consider buying this not if you just have spare change but if you want hours of fun then it's a must buy.
4084	0	a	Did not really dig this game as much as I thought I would. Did not play well, bad clips all over and not very visually pleasing either.
1789	0	a	Graphics are great, but the gameplay is just tedious and boring. It is like Gears of War Horde mode but more crap thrown in. Weapon cost is extremely high, and the 'defend points' are never near any actual defensible position. If you have 4 or more people playing it can be good, but it still seems very lackluster. In my opinion not worth $1.
3316	1	a	While its an extremley fun game on the outside of its dino like body, its a buggy mess on the inside. Some thinks its horrible, others think its awesome, Im in the middle somewhere, it looks amazing on full settings and you need a beefy computer to do that, gameplay wise, its really fun , but some bugs downright BREAK the game, like when my friend accidently drove off a cliff and he couldnt get out of the car even when it was upright, story, it has none, now to the dinosaurs you can fight, the Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Trike, Stegosaurus, Deinasuchus, Raptor, Compy, Pteradactyl, and a few more. The modes you will play most are the Rampage, Survival, and Dinosurvival, I will go over these. Rampage, you become the dinosaurs against other players as the humans. Survival is where you go through 10 waves and fight off hordes of dinosaurs, over time the objective will change simotaneasly. Dinosurvival is where its basically survival, but you can kill your teamates, which is weird, my overall rating has to be......... 7/10, like I said, its the glitches
4096	0	a	Really bad attempt to make a decent 'horde' mode game which is all this game has to offer with graphics from the 90's.
3790	0	a	The only game i wish i could delete from my library.
1850	1	a	I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.  Positives:    -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.  -Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.  -It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.  -The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.  -The vehicles are varied and quite fun.   -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.  -Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.  -None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.   Negatives:  -The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates 'Homies' and 'Dawg' just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.  -The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.  -There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.  -The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.  Overview:  For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at 'Dino Horde', and that's okay.   Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.
514	1	a	The game is pretty average. Graphics are not the highest quality and it has poor characterization and i never felt connected to characters throughout the game. However the weapon variety was fun and kept me playing. The open-world is also fun, running around destroying everything in sight is always fun. The storyline is pretty boring, but is a good length. Gameplay however is extremely fun and one of the reasons it was a good game.   7/10- great gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥ storyline
1637	1	a	Steam just downloaded an update for this game, which reminded me of it. Funny, I thought I reviewed this game before. Nevermind.   The first big problem with this game was that people expected too much from it, even when it was selling for $0.99 (or â¬0.99, or Â£0.99, whatever...). It looks tired, outdated and it's got glitches left, right and center, but for that kind of money, who cares? It's a nice, casual little dino shooter to play either solo or coop with friends and/or foes, that's all. And honestly, Orion is way better than most of the indie crap which is sold on Steam for way more than that, also not to mention that the devs are still updating it, surprisingly...  Up until when I last played (a year ago or so), the second biggest problem was the lack of players (and servers, as a consequence). Because most people who bought it wouldn't take it seriously -- and I'm not sure if even the devs took their own product seriously, first selling it for that price, now giving it away for free --, it was always the same little community playing and a few newcomers in between. Hopefully now that it's gone F2P, things will change, and if so, I may be back playing it.  Well, it's free now, so no excuse for anyone not to try it at least...

2467	1	a	You don't need friends to have fun in this game, best 99 cents i ever spent
6442	1	a	I installed this game with very low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. The controls were nothing special or difficult, just standard FPS controls (+1). The single player was pretty lag free, though it was very lonely and kinda of hard (then again it was medium). Basically this game is along the lines of orcs must die and whatnot. good for mindless slaughtering fun and explosions. 
3571	0	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ i want my money back   this game sucks more than a desparate asian
2225	1	a	this game is funking terrible but fun
451	1	a	So damn fun!!!!!!!!! And runs SO smooth. Great definately recommend it to all.
6523	1	a	Better than you would expect. Killing Floor: Dino Edition.
4376	1	a	cut a t-rex in the ankles with a knife until he die
3876	1	a	I know I haven't played it for very long, I had put off buying it because of negative reviews, but those reviews are garbage. This game is fun.
2214	1	a	i have it and its fun but a few problems are the ocasinal glichyness andhow annoying compys are also needs a back story but overall its fun with lots of guns explosions and killing
1800	1	a	Great if you like your dinosaurs to be able to phase through walls. 11/10
5482	1	a	Besides completing some objectives in-game with random people, operating some vehicles, and killing s***loads of dinosaurs, this game doesn't really have much to offer. The graphics are pretty good and this game truly impresses me, but it's just not my cup of tea. That being said, who doesn't like dinosaurs in video games?? If you like running around Halo Reach style and killing many tiny-to-massive dinosaurs with your teammates, then by all means this is your game.
4188	0	a	This is how you steal assets from another game and claim that assets as yours.  Good way to reduce production money and time.
491	1	a	pure visceral fun for the sheer sake of fun. Amazingly addictive sandbox mayhem.
1119	1	a	I really liked this game. It may be a bit short, but the puzzles are challenging and the graphics are cute and delightful. That being said, I did get this game when I saw it on sale, but it seems to go on sale all the time, so consider keeping an eye on it.
2856	1	a	This is a great game, cheaper then CSGO skins and its fun. the most fun you will have with $1!
5796	1	a	It's like Jurassic Park in space
3799	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. It runs horribly and its a killing floor with dinosaurs. Its a one euro pound or whatewer its not waste of money but it doesnt last long. Buy killing floor instead or buy dino-d when its on steam sale.
2705	1	a	It's a very underrated game I think. Altough I have no problem finding a game online I think it deserves a bit more attention.  Gameplay feels very solid, shooting acts very smooth as each gun feels different. Killing hordes of dinos is very fun by yourself or with a friend (witch is recommended) and the ragdoll physics can be quite hilarious at times. However the game can be a little buggy at times. A few times I've found myself stuck in a wall after a dino had rammed me, and I had to quit or your gun will freez and you can't shoot it, but that only happened to me once and I think it was a connection problem. I've had a very fun time playing and while it's on sale for a dollar that's a steal! 7/10  [Edit] Over time I got bord witht this game. Everyone online just wants to play survival, witch gets old after awhile. All the other game modes are left in the dust forgotten about. Don't even get me started on how 80% of the games avlailable the host is idle or somthing because they NEVER start the game! Trust me that gets really annoying. One of the main things I don't like about this game, in fact I hate, is the community. Most people I played with trolled with me or thought I was hacking because of how good I was doing, not to mention little to no teamwork. As for gameplay it's pretty solid. I'd say the game is more enjoyable with a friend. Theres just somthing about the game that doesn't feel right though, I don't know what it is but somthing feels off about it. It is a fun game but if you're looking for a game to spend hours on hours of playing I wouldn't get this game. The only reasons for me to go back and play it again would be if me and a friend wanted to be stupid and play or to try and get all the achievements. Maybe if I were really bord and had nothing better to do, maybe I'd play it again. If I had to rate it again it would be a 5.4/10
6181	1	a	Hey For a dollar this game isnt that bad its not great but not bad
4076	0	a	Got a weapon, dinosaur ate my brains out. I thought my life over for a few hours after that.
1962	1	a	Not bad worth the 53 cents
5844	1	a	Started it up Joined a server Moved around then died a lot without seeing anything Holds Tab Sees my ping is 900 Disconnects Finds a new server Ping is 4 Destroys dinos  10/10
5283	1	a	Just one problem with this game.    It feels cheap and unfinished
5980	1	a	this game is alright
4430	1	a	For only $1 you can't go wrong if you don't enjoy it you havn't realy lost anything but I love it best to buy it for all your friends to play along aswell makes the game even better. So much potential still to come!
825	1	a	first game was really nice piece of fresh air for me in gaming, i was blown away with spaghetti western revenge theme and atmosphere, anti-hero and bunch of similar things.... i also highly recommend this second instalement in the series but in my opinion it is too identical to the first game. i assume i would be equaly amused with it as i was when i played shank for the first time, but to me it seems like some extra levels for the first game, it really does not add anything to feel like new game. i found nothing new in sp part but challenges are fun to play with friends i guess.
4372	1	a	It's actually a ok game so i think you shoud get it!
2777	0	a	This is possibly the worst game on steam, not worth 99 cents on sale and not worth your time
3676	1	a	Thank God I refund this gim in time
3042	1	a	A very fun game, although quick paced and a (tiny) bit laggy. People will find it fun, provided you play it in a multiplayer server.
2494	1	a	sever of this game really hard to connect and have some lag when play. But it is a good game to try and play with price 0.99$
3132	1	a	Dinosaurs couldn't figure out how to go around mountain 10/10
1077	1	a	Amazing game! would recommend this! 10/10
5391	0	a	Cheap yes but lag ugh so much of it....If you want to play for 30mins than get bored than this is the game for you someone made this in a day just to steal your money dont buy unless you love games that you get stuck or people camp where you cant get them its like really if your going to make a game than do it right thank you:)
2146	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ Nuggets with a â¥â¥â¥â¥-Cola an a Mcâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! :)
4108	0	a	i cant open lobby why help pleas 
4576	0	a	It's terrible.
1883	0	a	I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game. When I finally got to play... god... The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast... If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.
4707	0	a	I highly recommend that you do not buy this game, because it's just a complete re-release of the previous game. The dinosaur AI is so bad, I'm sure that I could do better and the bugs oh don't get me started on them. This game is riddled with small and irritating glitches. I understand that sometimes it's very fun to play crappy games especially with a friend, but this is just too boring, broken and downright â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play. The game has one of the most clunky and buggy menus I have ever seen in a video game and I've played kinect games which usually have shocking menus. ORION: Prelude does it's best to make sure that you do not know what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you are doing, and if you somehow work out what to do it kills all of the fun with bugs and â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI. I had to think hard to find a good thing about this game, and all I can say is the graphics aren't terrible. But to even play on these settings you need a really good pc, because I swear the developers did not do anything to try to optimise this mess of a game. From playing the game, I have concluded that this game is just a load of small bits of other games glued together with â¥â¥â¥â¥ (the warthog and ghost from Halo, the wave defense mode from Killing Floor and the gun shop and base defense from Empires). I swear the game feels like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mod or a terrible indie game cobbled together really quickly. All in all this game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, do not buy it even though it's cheap you could spend that 80 pence on another game or something.
3917	0	a	I save my video options and the game crash dont buy this
571	1	a	Pretty good game!
213	1	a	Fantastic game. Deffinately one of my favourites.
1640	0	a	It's just a bad game tbh.
5836	1	a	good but laggy sometimes ate/10 hehehehe see what i did there?
2834	1	a	Not enough anime tities. 9/11 i would jihad for this game.
6022	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex and a Stegosaurus with just a knife  10/10  Worth the money
255	1	a	you can eat people karate kick helis and pick up giant mutant creatures and slam there head into the ground and also amazing story
912	1	a	fun to play and great gameplay
5220	1	a	This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
6344	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents!
87	1	a	You eat people and gain powers from them by tearing them to pieces.  So it's basically hard-core Kirby
2451	1	a	7 hours play time and i have already slaughtered 11492 Dinos. I am a one man dino apocalypse!  Definitely worth the price, Â£0.59p at the time i bought it. Even playing it solo is fun.  Good bits: AI is fairly competent Dinos AI is too Real money shop actually IS cosmetic only for a change Plenty of weapons to choose from Map are big Custom difficulty (Prehistoric mode)  Mutators Community maps etc  Bad bits: Dinos tend to glitch into terrain, especially the big ones Could do with more armor variations Minor lag when achievements/lvl up notifications appear Cheating type user made maps  Over all it is a good game and at the price it is, there isnt much reason not to if you like FPS/Team based shooters or just like the idea of shooting dinos because Turok.
6049	1	a	What you will hear while doing combos: Double kill Triple kill Mega kill Kill us all Armageddon BRING ME SOME PIZZA
4611	1	a	This game is so terrible, and steam should be ashamed for allowing this to be even released in the state it is in. I hope steam will honor a refund for the first time ever. Game is so buggy and crashes. Worst $9 spent.
919	1	a	Festival of blood and gore...
455	1	a	The graphics are dated, but if you are looking for a parkour smashemup game this is gobs of fun! Think of this as Assassins Creed meets Venom.
6231	1	a	Recon best class 2016
1927	1	a	Killing Floor meets Halo meets Primal Carnage. Waved based defense vs dinos with veichles! If it sounds awesome it's because it is. It's a pretty solid game and fun with friends and an abosulte steal at $.99 which is a price it tends to sell at from time to time.
4733	1	a	This game was so crazy awesome! with just the right amount of glitch and insane dino killing that i rate this game a 11 out of 10 for 1 dollar games!
3660	1	a	Finally, a christian game developer that knows dinosaurs lived alongside humans.
4961	1	a	Epic GAme for those money !!!! You can play with friends it's FUUUN!!!!
3513	1	a	If you hate this game, your mother didn't love you.  T-rex killed me over 50 times, and a stagosaurus splooged on me. 11/10
3429	1	a	It's so sad to see people from reddit just buy this game to give it a negative review when it is a pretty good game, had some pretty decent times in here with friends, and more to come!
6532	1	a	The metacritc score is misleading that was for the first part of the game THIS GAME IS WORTH THE BUY NOW I PROMISE LOL ITS PRETTY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SICK AND FUN TRUST ME
1478	0	a	The game has nice graphics, but overall is pretty boring.  BEEP makes annoying sounds; Sharacter design is not to be found; Soundtrack is chilled, but ignorable; BEEP makes a scared face whenever it jumps (WTF, this is a platformer, you're SUPPOSED to jump); The telekinesis system is kinda broken;
4070	1	a	meh. It isnt the most fun game I have ever played but it defently wasnt the worst. The gameplay is pretty straight forward (shoot anything that moves) but that isnt a bad thing. Its simple easy gameplay that can be picked up in a second. Thats what I like about this game....Now for the bad....not much I can find so far except the combat (even though I do like the simplicity) gets dull and boreing to me atleats after a while. Aim, click and shoot and thats the game. Id give it a solid 7.9 out of 10
2347	1	a	Dinosaurs = good As long as u have friends that wanna play then great game, Even better when u get 2 be T-rex. 
144	1	a	much killing, such game, so good, wow
5141	1	a	This game was worth the $1 that I paid for it! I have only played it a couple of times and they were really fun. This is a very good game to play when you feel bored of the other games that you have.
3909	1	a	This game for the low, low, low price of the lint in your pocket is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Especially if you play with friends. It's survuval mode is really fun but the PvP is where things get interesting. The game is also surprisingly alive so you will run into players occasionally and they are all pretty cool guys.
2143	1	a	This game. Oh this game. It might be silly or bad looking but to tell you the truth if you and a few frinds want a game to play i would recomend this because its fun.
1373	1	a	Good game, but so hard to reload
3135	1	a	Don't buy the vehicles. Only the dragonfly
6524	1	a	In a given match, my experiences have varied wildy between laughably bad and surprisingly good. Some parts look gorgeous while others look like poop. I'd buy it while it's on sale.
6056	1	a	wow BEST GAME FOR $1 I HAVE EVER PLAYED. so worth it. i have played this more than CS;GO
161	1	a	Like a more brutal version of assassin's creed.
4227	1	a	BEST GAME WHAT I EVER PLAYED BEFORE! REALLY, THANKS!
2215	1	a	I don't agree with metascore.. You can play as DINO! And you can beat T-Rex in MECH! Oh god
5478	1	a	Good game i like it.The game is costing only 79 cents but it would be like 10 euro
1213	1	a	i realy liked beep. it has fun chalenges and is a game all librarys should have
6066	0	a	Mutliplayer is garbage, riddled with bugs, no lan support, and dedicated servers are near impossible to set up for private lobbies
4292	1	a	ORION: Prelude, killing dinasours with lightsabers and futuristic weapons seems legit right?
1674	1	a	this game is very fun if play you with your friend
6278	1	a	rarely plays the games.... at least it's cheap and fun
5152	1	a	10/10
1725	1	a	Pretty fun game i really like the open world part! It is a hassle to buy a 4 pack if you own the game already or just a normal copy to gift when you are playing it on the free days.... But all in all it is fun to play with a couple friends has some good content. :)
1806	0	a	ONION: Dino Horde is da most thugged-out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ vizzle game I've eva played. Y'all KNOW dat â¥â¥â¥â¥, muthaâ¥â¥â¥â¥a! I KNOW dat it is unfinished n' buggy yo, but still, why release a game when up in fact it is literally, metaphorically, geographically, ironically, n' biologically da most thugged-out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thang eva n' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Right back up in yo muthaâ¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥. Seriously, why even release it, dawg?
4075	0	a	This game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. The sounds, AI, and overall the total game is really bad. The AI just runs in circles, along the main route, or just straight at you until it kills you.  I've asked so many times for a refund, and been ignored every time. When I bought this, I noticed that none of my friends have played longer than ~1 hour. Now I see why.  Please, just don't buy it. It's really awful.
1502	1	a	I really love this game and i would like to ask anyone reading to just give it a try even if its just a free weekend.  Spiral has done an amazing job of post release support with tons of new maps, modes and improved graphics all free.  If your looking for something co-op thats a blast to play with friends and quite playable solo (your characters go up in levels offering perks and better starting gear) this game is a diamond in the rough.   Dont let the metacritic score turn you away and come play a game where the developers care about thier product.    
2227	1	a	not even worth the time to instal.... no wait not even worth the time to click on to see what the game is on steam.... wait wait hold on... not even worth the time to read the name. thats how bad this was. dont get jiped into this game. majority of reviews are bad and all the things said in the promo video up top is complete BS made up by them.
764	1	a	Overhead Mech Twin Stick Shooter with gorgeous graphics, bullet hell inspiration, coop and plenty of content. Leaderboards, 3 difficulty levels, cloud saves via Origin through Steam o_0 and an ace presentation. Picked this up in the EA 'indie' bundle and this one shooter is just about worth the cost of the whole bundle.
4073	0	a	{This is for mac players} Its fun i tried it but it aint mac supported....
3705	0	a	lets get this game to overhemling negetive
6040	1	a	Glad to see they finally fixed it. Good game.
6467	1	a	Fun and awesome game for a buck!!! Get it while you can! 
3007	0	a	Dont let the price (or lack there of) fool you. This is a fairly bad game... like most games you can get a bit of enjoyment with friends, but literally find anything else; it's garabage.
2015	1	a	i bought this game when it was $20 dollars im not gonna lie i was upset but now it has improved greatly
6289	1	a	I felt like going back and try this game out again like 2 years after i bought it, but its not in my library anymore. I own it, or else i couldnt write this review. Help?
121	1	a	Pros:  Transformation and being able to play the game stealth or full on badass.  Combat makes you feel like a god and shape the city around you in destruction.  City slowly decays as you get deeper in the story as you watch infected areas start growing out into a giant mess. Beautifully chaotic.   Lots of upgrades for your character and ability to choose any build path you want.  Unique specific weapon transformations for different situations and enemies.  FPS was good for me and had no problem running it on an above average gaming laptop.  Cons:  Game isn't very challenging and throughout the game you feel like you can't die. (At least on Normal mode. This isn't a bad thing, just different experience if you want a game that's fun and just want to kill stuff).  PC port mouse movement controls feel wacky. I honestly like the movement of using a keyboard to move and the simplicity of using your left and right mouse buttons to do combos; however, the camera movement with mouse for this port is just noticeably bad. After a while you get a little used to the jerkiness of the camera movement, but it feels like it should have been done a lot better.  Another thing to go along with this is the mouse movement for switching powers with the cycle select. I really don't like how this was done in the port. You basically have you push your mouse as if moving it across the entire screen just to switch powers using the cycle select and it still feels hard to aim fast accurately, affecting the gameplay for fast reaction gamers.  Game can get a bit repetitive quite fast for some people.   General Game Rating: 9/10  PC Port: 7/10  I would recommend getting this on console if you have one. I'm normally a PC gamer, but once I played this PC Port after playing it on console you really notice how bad the mouse movement with the camera controls and even general menu selection was done. Still an amazing game if you can get past those notes though and just want a fun super badass button masher to play.
1802	1	a	I bought it at $0.62. Why haven't you?  Didn't expect much from a $0.62 game initially but after playing i loved the horde based gameplay.Wave after wave will try to attack your generator which you have to defend or repair with occasional objectives you have to accomplish. The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.   'Peak' is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos. 'Raupi' is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead. During each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.  However, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.   I'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^
417	1	a	This game is EPIC. I love how you can porh your limbs into weapons and hijack vehicles(except for civilian ones). The story is great. I highly reccomend this game for anyone. The only thing I don't like about this game is the graphics, but that's just becaue this is an older game. But it's fun all the same. There is an enormous twist at the end...heh, heh heh, play it and you'll find out.  Useful tips: When it gets too difficult, hijack tanks and light up your target. Never use choppers against bosses, they'll just throw one thing at you, and the heli will come crashing down.
3412	0	a	A truly horrible game, don't even consider buying this.
3665	1	a	Very Plain and simple: Just paid â¬0,99 for this game, We've found it due to the free weekend on steam, but it is just to epic to forget for only â¬0,99 cents.  We decided to support the developer and bought the game with the entire team and we're still pushing other members/employees to buy this game.  We've made a full video review on this game, make sure to check it out if you want to see more of this game before buying it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GfZhJzWdU   (Make sure to watch the video on youtube itself for full HD (1080P) video)  For 99Cents you just CAN'T complain about this game and her 251!!!! achievements :D 
6264	1	a	Considering this game is $1, and the developers still took the time to revamp it when it had issues out the wazoo, I think this is one game that should be in every Steam user's library. You can't have more fun with a single dollar, than what you can have with this game.
3467	1	a	lol, this was fun. much better than what they are doing with the orion project.
3926	0	a	only baught cause 49 cents and i got bored after 3 minutes of playing it. to sum things up this game eats â¥â¥â¥
6544	1	a	It looks cheap and it is not the best game But for 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dollar i should hella take it meta is wrong you really really should buy this game if you are going to play this with your friends. So think about it.
207	1	a	Prototype is very addicting, as it uses a upgrading menu to keep you playing. This game is identical to Saints Row IV, only this was realised before hand. If you want a game where you can't stop playing, I recommend checking out Prototype. The story is ok, but the gameplay is very fun as it involves the use of abilities such as disguises and a wide variety of weapons for your character.
5269	1	a	You shoot dinosars and it's co-op, what more could you want?
5699	1	a	this game is awsome if u like dinosaures and cool guns with friends to play with get this game
2992	1	a	Think of a zombie game where you have to survive waves. Now replace the zombies with dinosaurs!
63	1	a	This is a classic bundle of Sierra point-and-click games- a serious piece of gaming history. (Sierra is also known for the King's Quest and Police Quest series, among others.) If you like point and click games and aren't deterred by the pixelly graphics (you shouldn't be!), this is a great collection to add to your library.  One warning- much like King's Quest, you can make a mistake, forget to pick up an item, or do something in the wrong order, and mess up your whole save. Save the game often, so that you can pick up where you made the mistake instead of having to start from the beginning!  Playing with a walkthrough is only recommended if you care more about beating the game than about the journey of completing it.
1130	1	a	In this game youâll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game youâll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, youâll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.  The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordonâs gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. Youâll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and youâll use your enemiesâ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.  Another twist came from Beepâs partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.  If you canât tell by now Iâm totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldnât give this a chance.
742	1	a	The game isn't all that bad, the story is quite interesting, if your into solving crime and finding clues, this might just interest you.  But if your one to just want all the action and great voice acting, then this ain't recommended for you.  I personally think this game is a good game and I fairly enjoyed it, even though the english is kinda bad in way.  Recommended for people who like puzzle and crime solving games.
3648	0	a	I am disapointed with where my money went.
4937	0	a	played five mins, on the menu that is, worst than cod with its host migration. Got a single player game to go, but it crashed before it got to the loading screen.
1734	1	a	37/100
2730	1	a	While the game and concept are really enjoyable, eventually, some of the enimies become too fast and tiny to hit... Fun game, just one flaw... still, for the price, i can recommend it, but not as a game I would see myself spending a lot of time on. Seems like a game ill play a few times then never play again.
1553	1	a	kinda like if halo and turok had a baby and that baby was thrown continusly off a building 10/10
1341	0	a	i can't start the game when i got to run it i can't click to start a new game
6097	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥boys have everything for less
5382	1	a	This game is fun xD
1272	0	a	Game is okay puzzle platformer, but BEEP crashing my machine on start up half of the time means I can' recommend it. This has been a problem for a good while, judging by the forums, and nothing appears to have been done :(
2845	1	a	It's cheap, it's fun, why the hell not? Plus theres guns and dinos, GUNS AND DINOS.
821	1	a	Single-player is a blast. Beat it on Normal, and then beat it on Hard. THEN, beat the survival mode by yourself. Oh how I love this game. I AM a glutton for punishment, however.
6089	1	a	The game itself is a little buggy and weird, and there are some flaws in some of the maps (getting stuck in various places), but it's overall pretty enjoyable. Animations leave a bit to be desired. But overall, you certainly can't go wrong for the price. 7/10
2882	0	a	Poor quality, redundent gameplay.
280	1	a	Please note that some some people are having issues with this game, but I am not. It is worth it to dig into their problems to ensure that you will not have them as well.  That having been said, graphically, this game is nothing special (though to its credit, it is half a decade old at this point), and the controls can be a bit difficult at times. But overall, I do recommend this game. it is a fun game to just unleash h*ll on random civies (as there are no penalties for it). The powers are very fun, and when you get used to the controls, zipping around the city is pretty fantastic. The story is nothing too special, but still fun to go through. And some of the missions can be a bit annoying on higher difficulties.  Basically, this game is a fantastic ammoral d*ck simulator, and well worth the low cost imho. You can just run around streets with a car over your head, smashing everyone like bowling pins. You can go nuts with machine guns or helicopters. Quite frankly, this is a great sandbox game to play, even if it does seem to lack depth in most departments (although they do have a cool feature where you can affect the map through your actions, even if it is temporary)  8.5/10
994	0	a	i dislike this game, bad graphic quality
3549	1	a	 So what is ORION: Prelude?
2285	1	a	I've played 0.6 hours of this game. That is 0.6 hours too long. why do i get this gaem? i dunno. it no gud and i cant tell if it are a game.
3520	0	a	They made it free to play, but I don't think they can save it in the long run, it's just not worth it...  A lot was promised, little given, but that's my own fault for buying early access, so I shouldn't complain too much. I only post this review so that others are aware of the way the devs/publishers of this game operate, for when they release their next game.
6141	1	a	Do you have friends?  .....No, I mean real friends?  No? Okay, then don't play this game.  Orion is a pathetic excuse for a game. Good enough to be worth .99 cents, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ enough to be worth anything more. Unless you're 9 years old and your room is still covered in dinosaur wallpaper, I would avoid this game all together.  (That is, unless you're a filthy achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that gets off on the idea of wasting hours of your time compiling meaningless accomplishments on a computer, if so, please get help as soon as you can. You seriously have a problem and you need to get a job or something)  Orion: Prelude is a game. That's pretty much all I can say. It doesn't offer anything outside the established norm of a FPS besides 'OH BOY HERE I GO KILLING DINOSAURS AGAIN!'. Turok did it. Dino D-day did it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hunting genre did it. The only difference between Orion and the rest of the crowd is the 'horde mode' it emphasizes. Orion is, in itself, a 'friend game'. If you don't have friends who enjoy stupid, silly, ridiculous and down-right â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (Yeah, I said it, so what want to fight about it?) games, then don't buy this.   This game is best enjoyed after knocking back a couple brews, smoking a few bowls and releasing all of your pent up daddy issues. It's a nut-less shooter with the brain the size of a walnut. Given the state of the FPS genre now, I'm sure this game must appeal to the majority. 'BUT NOT ME DAMMIT, I'M SOPHISTICATED'; you say. Ha, how cute, you must think playing CS:GO makes you bourgeoise. Bah! I say! Bah! Orion is nothing special and neither are you. What makes it special is the company you enjoy playing this game. That being said, lesbian honest, isn't that all of life? Get friends, get drunk and or high and play this game. If you are sober, avoid this game entirely.    Pros:  +Perfect game to nut around in +Graphics aren't bad +MOM! MOM! LOOK! A T-REX! + Life will.....uh...find a way. +There's a warthog +Great game to play with friends    Cons:  -Hats -Seriously, why hats? -Other game modes (specifically conquest) look like the result of combining two VTD student's art portfolios. ( what I mean by that is the textures don't match, you uncultured philistine, jesus how are your parents not ashamed of you?) -Wonky controls.  -No single player value. -Wtf who would pay 5 dollars for a hat in a .99 cent game? You're not TF2, Orion. -There's not much to offer in the game besides the peanut-butter horde mode. -Too many cards. -Absolutely does not diverge from any different from the traditional FPS standard. -Flavor of the month game. Give it two weeks and you'll get bored and move on. Maybe you'll come back to it in another 3 months.   My Dinosaur Book Report: 6 stegosauruses/10 apatosauruses
5644	1	a	Like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and vehicles. You literally can't go wrong, especially for the price point.
1866	0	a	-5/10 would not get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by tricerotops. Worst $1.50 I've ever spent.
2817	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs, what more do you realy want?
2674	1	a	Frickin jet packs and dinosaurs!!!!! Dont care what anyone else says, this is fun on a bun!!!
3206	0	a	Not worth $15 more like $.25 - $.99
3014	0	a	Almost a carbon-copy of orion dino horde...
1603	1	a	It is halo and dinosaurs. I repeat: halo and dinosaurs. Why would you want to be killing stupid zombies when you could be killing all of your favorite prehistoric beasts? Don't think about it. It's true, it's good, and it gets better everyday. Have you ever killed a t-rex with a bow? No? Then get the game. I recommend.
1761	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations. Several game modes, from TDM, FFA, 1v1, Survival and Conquest. Survival are matches consisting of several waves of dinosaurs attacking you and your base for you to fend off with you and your mates. Inexpensive, fun and easy to get into for video game novices and experts alike.
5964	1	a	got a mini gun killed 100 raptors in 10 seconds.
1271	0	a	Not a lot of fun.
808	1	a	Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way.   The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition.   Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.  Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.  Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.
2527	1	a	It's pretty damn awesome. I haven't learned the strengths to win much yet, but I am still enjoying losing to these ridiculous monsters!
1819	1	a	Really fun dinosaur shooting fps, the characters say funny **** when they shoot dinos XD, definitely worth buying and playing with friends.
2206	1	a	certainly a lot better than the reviews give it credit for, still rough around the edges though.  in terms of fun, the more the merrier. multiplayer is pretty sweet
692	1	a	See the hours I've played? Yup, finished, done, a few achievements if I really cared, but I don't. So was it worth the price of entry? Yeah I guess. At it's heart it's a pretty simple game with an interesting and simple battle mechanic. The developers do a good job of dressing it up and making it feel like there's more to it, but there's only so much that can be done to make what's really more of a browser or mobile game seem more substantial. The games saving grace and why I give it a tentative recommendation is the battle system. Over all it's not bad, not bad at all. But once you figure out the optimal strategies it becomes a matter of making sure you've grinded enough to charge your 'spell' cards and your pretty much golden. With a multi-player option this would be a total recommendation, as it is buy if the battle mechanic interests you, if not give it a pass.
3769	0	a	This game is worst game i ever played ! Lag , Hard to new players and it is not fun game !! Hate that game !!!
4174	1	a	This game's amazing. The graphics are good and the style as well. Love it.
2375	1	a	had much fun in this tower-defense-FPS while Hunting down Dinosaurs with a wide variety of weapons    9,5 of 10 would slash T-Rex with an overpowered katana-sword 
319	0	a	A giant heap of terrible console port. With a i7 6700k and a gtx 1070 I manage 20 fps. Sound has awful clipping and desync. Got the franchise pack on sale and I would write a review for the second but it doesn't even launch. 0/10 wish I could get my 7 dollars back.
5435	1	a	For $0.99 you will get a TON of Jurrasic fun! Buy it, its a bargain.
4255	0	a	This is the biggest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've played since sonic 06! It lags constantly even though i have a computer with system requirements AND i even uninstalled all my games to make sure that it would run and it even managed to crash my computer multiple times!
3233	0	a	This game blows goat â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was originally Orion Dino Beatdown, and I thought it had promise with jetpacks and dinosaurs...however only one class got the jetpack and it just had the biggest amount of bugs, crap ai, crap graphics, sounds and just about everything. Anyone who has ever played this warns anyone they can to not play and generally that its a waste of money....yes even at $0.99.
2599	1	a	Incredibly fun game. The metascore is the rating for the previous game before it was over hauled so don't let that scare you. Overall a wonderful dino-killing experience and a great multiplayer experience.   8/10
457	1	a	Want to be wonder woman, batman, superman, x man, the flash and hellboy at the same time? Than prototype is just for u
431	1	a	I would recommend this to anyone who loves free-roam games, blood, strong violence and just all out mayhem!  An amazing tutorial which pretty much puts you in god mode at the beginning of the game so you can learn the controls which are extremely easy to use! Rich and telling storyline which keeps you gripped all the way to the very end.  Alex Mercer is probably the best Antogonist/Protagonist ever!! 9/10 (Grenade launcher spam at the later stages is quite annoying)
5968	1	a	A dumb little romp. Good to play with friends, worth the $1. Devs are a bit shady apparently, but I don't really care. In game purchases, but they are not necessary to enjoy the game.
5962	1	a	Orion Prelude is probably the game with the best price/quality ratio you will ever buy! 
2643	1	a	This game is absolutely amazing. I give the devs props for keeping up with this game and completely redesigning it. This game went from crap to amazing. They gave it a huge graphical update and then added more dinos. This game just got better and better. They did an amazing job. I highly recommend you go check this game out.
2544	1	a	it's like the low budget evolve thats actually fun
564	1	a	In the first 5 mins you can jump off of a car and body slam on a tank.... and it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing explodes! 10/10 best game thats ever existed
2638	1	a	Do i overall recomend this game... Yes for .99 cents. But once the sale is over, the 15 dollars is not worth it.  The goods: It is an addicting game that makes my neck hurt when I am done with the game session. The gameplay is awesome, and the money system is slightly flawed, some rounds i only get 500 income, even if I get alot of points.  The Bads: It gets bad frame rates. It probably could have been better on a modified source engine to fix the frames, as I have to run on medium to get 30-40 fps at beginning, and 25-30 at the lvls 10+.  The uglys. The lobby system. It is absolutely terrible. If you click on a game, you usually connect at lvl 5-10, And get desamated because you start out with only 5000 credits, or even less sometimes, with a starting pistol. If you are lucky, you join a game at the beginning levels, and you are fine. If you join a game before it has started, you usually are stuck there for a while because the host is afk while there are 5/5 people on the server. Sometimes it wont let you join games, or it is stuck on 'Connecting to Server'. The worst of all, is that the refresh button doesnt work. So I could be clicking on a full game, even though it says 2/5 people on it. usually after a while, it wont even let me connect, which brings me to my other point. So i have to end up restarting the game 2-5 times just to get in a game, because the refresh button doesnt work.  Once the free week/sale is over., I wouldnt reccomend this game, it gets maddening after a couple hours. The Ugly's and bads outweigh the goods way too much
6239	1	a	An amazing game but this is a new account on my old account ive been playing for 1378 hours :P  This is not sparta THIS IS PRELUDE its freakin' amazing the weapons the halo the JURASSIC PARK the well EVERYTHING! 9999999/10 love it love it love it co-op PvP freaky mode (prehistoric mode) just wonderful in every way possible and dont even get me started on those graphics and its got gamemodes its just plain amazing i would buy this if it costed 1000 USD i dont care its just perfect
3641	1	a	Great game with loads of fun and par graphics,good to have it! Cheers!
478	1	a	surrealistic dealy dangerous and vilent, stealth and a good storyline, you are the infection. evolve and conquer
3764	0	a	I lost R$ 2,19 buying this game
445	1	a	For 2000s game, It is perfect.
1987	1	a	Hold on to ya butts!
3331	1	a	It's actually pretty damn fun you can play as the spy with the amby knife and invis watch never buy any primary or secondaries the amby has infinite ammo and 1 hits everything anyway just get 100000 monies for backstabbing dinosaurs on halo maps.
4146	1	a	Length of Time Played: 26 minutes Distance Played: Not even 1 game Achievements: None Personal Grade: B+  Opinion of each aspect  Grading System - Based on a five-point rating system (5 = Outstanding, 4 = Good, 3 = Average, 2 = Poor, 1 = Awful)  Gameplay: 4/5 Stability: 5/5 Story: 3/5 Controls: 5/5 Graphics: 5/5 Music: 5/5 Sounds: 5/5 Difficulty: 4/5  Probably would have been an epic first-person shooter, IF my computer wasn't so laggy. I could hardly run it on LOW settings. I recommend this game if you have a beefy computer.
1238	1	a	Got this, bcouse my roommate is funny  Even do this creeped me out.... (see the screenshot)  69/10 - Would play this game again and again to see weird,... things.. like on the screenshot again . 
5606	1	a	The best worst game ever Play with friends
1993	1	a	Who can make a game with dinosaurs and jet packs lame? Spiral games studios thats who. You can get more value from you money by lighting it on fire 
4749	1	a	it's freakin BIG and run so fast but FUN!
3600	0	a	theres like only 15 servers with no one in them. Honstly don't know how this game can still be this bad looking after 3 years of support. The trailer over hypes the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game. Not even worth $1.
1896	1	a	This game is so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun, I would recommend any one to buy it, especially now it's only .99â¬ Driving in a buggy being chased by a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing T-Rex is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing epic.  9/10
5094	1	a	Beheaded and carried by a pterodactyl, dropped on the back of a tricerotops, where i rode it across the map too its death, hwile my teammate was thrown into a mountain side and pummelled by a boulder thrown by T-rex. 10/10
3999	1	a	If you think that there are dinosaurs in battlefield then this game is for you
3447	0	a	yuck, tis game is a ruined game the trailers look nothing compared to the game and it's looks quite blocky just yuck. when i saw this game i thought hmm this game could be cool i looked at the reviews and there was alot of critisim but i though nah ill give it a try, once it was downlaoded i started playying then i said NO NO not again a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The game looks nothing to the gameplay trailers i said well a waste of space. I dont recommend it
4655	0	a	There is a reason this game is usually on sale for super cheap.
120	1	a	There's really only one thing this game has going for it so im gonna make a short review here:  + This game is FUN AS F**k, its just so addicting running around in the city . . .??M per second and kicking the living crap out of everything. - The Story in this game . . .oh boy, dont bother trying to understand it, its not nessesarly a bad story but the way the game tells you the story is just very confusing.  8.5/10, The Story may be confusing but the game itself is very fun, definently worth the money whereither you buy it when its on sale or not.
5785	1	a	So much potential.... this thing could be epic with some of the minor problems tweaked... I do hope they don't give up on this game
4331	1	a	Played it for a couple minutes its alright.
1654	1	a	This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily. By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.
4999	0	a	In light of   this article,   I'm afraid I can no longer reccomend this game. It's a real gem, a real fun timewaster, but this is really rather shady. I cannot, in good faith, reccomend a game that has a shady buisiness policy and is run by a company with questionable practices.  All this over three sprites.
2588	1	a	Really fun, just don't take it seriously
5627	1	a	very good game 5of5 stars:)
6489	1	a	Its like Halo but with dinosaurs and stuff
4033	1	a	Fun with friends
4395	1	a	I paid a frickin dollar for this and its more fun than any 60 dollar game I have played. 
4407	1	a	Such a stupidly glorious game. Played with a group of guys at magfest and we just tried to kill triceratops with buggies  10/10 would allahu akbar into dinosaurs again.
1383	0	a	Well I am not sure about this game. First off can't even play the game starts up black screen then never opens. I read the forums of it saying it might be a sound card thing. But wtf. No prob with any other games. Don't recommend unless you wanna take a chance of wasting your money
5068	0	a	It had dinosaurs. It was ok, just not great. Could use some more varying of weapons.
2970	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥  â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME  Even though the game is $1 right now, dont buy it.
1054	1	a	It's a great game where you're an alien running around a government facility killing scientists and trying to escape. Very brutal and very fun.
1650	1	a	Pros  Great graphics and high framerate addicting multiplayer, singleplayer and lets not forget co-op You get to kill Dinosaurs WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT? Nice players Awesome vehicles Awesome Guns Smart bot AI  Cons Not many servers vehicles lag if the server is to far away and you have high ping  Raptors will kill you to fast if you dont melee them like instantly because they swarm you you have to pay for skins there are no loot boxes for the skins (I totally didn't buy one because im addicted)  Overall Ratings Score in Graphics 7.9/10 Score in Framerate 8.0/10 Score in AI 8.9/10 Overall Score is 8.7! (avarage for me being 7-8) Do I love this game and will I keep playing it? yes and yes! At the time of posting this review this is my favourite game and I bought this for my friend to play with me I love it so much!
2565	1	a	Amazing gameplay, and concept. Sure, its dinosaurs...Could be like aliens, or something....But its awesome!
1116	1	a	Cheep Game only $0.49. Real fun game and easy controls. Nice look and feel. It feels like a android game but is right at home on the pc. If I found this for $10.00 knowing what it was I would still buy it.
2419	1	a	It's ok i guess.
2554	1	a	Glitchy, unoptimized, garbage. If you enjoy generic tower-defence games and have a computer strong enough to run the terrable graphics, go ahead. The only reason it's worth it is because it's 99 cents. If it were 5 dollars I'd say it's not worth.
6382	1	a	haha no paying for me cuz i played the game when it was free i can play the game for free  anyway everytime i play with my friends its fun so i really reccomend the game its cool
6213	1	a	Would r8 gr8, wad fun with friends but could do with some work.
860	1	a	Entertaining
464	1	a	This game is so great. So fun. So much action, chaos, powers, jumping, destruction. I love it. Period.
6554	1	a	Better than expected. I feel the 'open world' mode is a bit of a disclaimer, but maybe I just didn't play it enough. It deserves a higher raiting than it got from its initial release, but still isn't my cup o' tea.
6517	1	a	Orion: Dino Horde is a wave survival type of game, there are pvp modes, but pvp is not needed to enjoy this game. If you're fond of wave survival games, this is for you. But i will say this game is kinda hit or miss. It seems hard to get a public game going, you have to wait awhile or hope to find one. Like any game, this one has it's pros and cons. But if you like wave survival and dinosaurs, this one is for you!
3826	0	a	Its an ok game but SEVERELY BROKEN did you have to dip down in quality after you almost got sued Step up guys seriously
951	1	a	Still damn fun!. But sadly the story is so bad compare to the first one.
4917	0	a	This game was Very Laggy okn my computer and it is a quallity one. Even with it at its lowest quality i still had some problems with it.
4177	0	a	Its free now...thats how â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is
3547	1	a	I buy it once.... ask for refund and steam refund my money.  but now i buy it again and enjoy the game.....  thanks for not abandoning this game and made it works.... love it.
6090	1	a	This game is literally only fun with friends and not really strangers. It's really dumb but really fun when you get into a certain groove. Hopefully it picks up more traction in the coming months and gets expanded upon because as it is, this game is mostly a horde-mode class-based dino shooter. Don't come into this game expecting Call of Duty or Battlefield levels of refined gunplay. Come into this game expecting to be entertained with friends. Best if played in conjunction with a skype group chat, from my experience. There are like 9 guns and 3 types of dinosaurs, and to totally throw that off balance, there's mechs and vehicles and gigantic levels that require you jumping from base to base.  So I'd recommend getting this game during a mad crazy sale and only if your friends have it. The potential for fun, while bottle-necked, is pretty vast, I suppose.
5918	0	a	It's a broken game worst game ever it sucks
3417	1	a	The halo man fights dinosaurs in space, then uses dino-bones to buy upgrades and level up.  It's pretty much dark souls meets megaman.  Megaman and halo are the same person, right?   10/10  I mean, one is blue, the other is green, alter ego. I'm a cat and I know things.
760	1	a	Very nice game in general, with an original historical background. You play a SS Standartenfuhrer, who chooses to get involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler, using his authority in the Gestapo. What called my attention is that the character you play -intentionally or not- is not the typical 'good guy'. He's far from noble, actually. His main reason for being disenchanted with Hitler was that he saw  Germans  in the concentration camps (apparently he was cool with it when it was only the Jews). Mild mild spoiler (not really, but just in case:   He doesn't care about exposing the conspirators to his superior, saving only who can be useful to him in the future, or about accusing an 'innocent' man as communist because he was in his way, even after he stated that his motivation came from seeing Germans in the camps solely for being communists or personal enemies to people in power  . This is unusual, and was very interesting for me during the gameplay.  THE GOOD: + Nice visuals, with beautiful artwork in the cut scenes. + Excellent attention to detail, especially with historical elements. + The music isn't overwhelming or annoying; sound effects are cool. + Different dialog options. It doesn't change the main outcome, but you may learn more or less, according to what you choose. + The plot was believable, historically accurate within the context of this fictional little story, and made sense.  THE NOT SO GOOD: * Two of the 'mini-games' inserted in the game are exclusively about luck, rather than skills, and losing them may block your game, forcing you to use a previously saved game. * The first mini-game was quite poorly explained. * The game has you picking up stuff you don't need at the moment. This is a common trait of most point-and-click games, but it kind of spoils the immersion. * Voice acting was... not that good. Some characters were ok, others less so. * Even though the main plot was somewhat solved, many point were left open in the hopes of part 2. But let's hope!  THE HORRIBLE: - The pronunciation of German words was preposterous, especially by certain characters. Every time someone said 'Wehrmacht', I felt like someone was scratching a blackboard. Note that I'm not German, and I'm cool with actors pronouncing 'Gestapo' instead of 'Geshtapo', but some of it was too bad even for me. - The woman who did the voice of 'Victoria'. That was the worst part of this game, and the worst I ever heard. I heard kids in elementary school reading from history books better than this lady did her lines. PLUS: she pronounced the word 'Fuhrer' as 'fur-r', and that wasn't the worst part of her 'acting'. (Another reviewer deemed her probably the worst voice actress in the history of gaming, and I agree)  Not mind-blowingly good, but I recommend it. I had a very good time playing it, and I'm looking forward to playing the next one!
5745	1	a	Post Edit: The below review was for when the game was fairly new, the developers have taken responsibility for their games shortcomings, for one dollar a pop you could easily set you and your friends up with copies of the game and have a killingfloor-esque bundle of funs. Everything in the pre-edit still applies however --------------------------- Pre Edit This game has a fair way to go. It doesn't perform well on my computer (fairly high end), and it is very difficult to find a match. I got it for 1 dollar and it for me that was worth it, but i'm not sure it's worth the $15 price tag. The game does have positive and negative points to it.  Pro: The support service is excellent, they were polite, helpful, and got my problem resolved quickly  Pro: When you get into a game with lots of dudes, you have some dino killing mayhem to look forward to.  Con: They have a coin system for cosmetics  Con: I couldn't get it to work when I first started and had to contact Spiral's customer support  I may edit it if I play it more, but this was my initial experience. I have high hopes for this game, but at the state it currently is in, I'd hold onto your $15 and wait for a sale to get it.
6075	1	a	so much fun for only 0,99 cents
4013	1	a	For $ .99 This is Worth the Buy!
6135	1	a	One of the coolest most cheapest game i have ever owned!
5163	1	a	Really fun game where you with your team need to kill tons of dinosaurs, big and small and you need to do objectives like check the point or somethin ! You have about 10 weapons for each class and some special weapons for each class only, but you can buy in-match perk that gives you acces to all weapons in-match. You can cuztomize your character look and camoflague of your dinos, but only for these you are playing, not for those that are attacking you. You have many perks o buy in-match and there is a lot to do ! Its one of best Co-op game and its still updating and giving you even more of these things. It have steam workshop too where you can download even more maps and game modes ! The graphics are not the best, but they are on really high level, my pc that handled Skyrim on ultra, nearly handled this game on low-medium. This game is really interesting and fun to play with other people AND ITS ONLY FOR 0.99â¬. I recommend it 7,9/10
2764	0	a	Little Changed since I paid that 14.99 $ back in the day for Orion, graphically is Okay, but how the Dino's walk and attack, it's just NOT OKAY, why couldn't they take ideas from Turok with the Dinosaurs, the last Turok game that came out, was awesome as far as Dinosaurs are concerned. In this game here, since it came out, there are new maps and skins here and there for characters and Dinos, but nothing was improved either graphicaly or even gameplay wise, I would recommand this on steam sale for under 5 $, but not at a full price.
4614	0	a	dino are too hard to kill buggy menu server button wont refresh repeats itself 2/10 would not bang
1628	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
2850	1	a	Dino Mayhem. It has it's flaws, it is very arcadey, but it is great fun with a team. Close to unplayable with randoms or by yourself.
3630	1	a	The Best Game I Have Played In A Long Time! Keep Doing The Great Work! :)
5157	1	a	About 3000 cloaked dinosours attacked our squad ... We fought for hours trying to defend our base. But the inviz. heads won . ( did i mention that these cloaked dinosours had cloaked only their body ? wierd right ? ) Because there was a second wave .  Second wave which had 6000 more dinosours than the last. 10/10 Would get attacked by second wave and revive our generator every 10 seconds .
5920	1	a	this game is incredible, when going through ghosts... and considering the connection is so bad you cant walk 10 feet. this game allways promises the ability to choose your game and play how you want not limited to how a server says you shouldent. this game is fun and reliable
3735	0	a	Worst game I've played
2413	1	a	I admit that I didn't even know why Orion: Prelude was in my steam library and couldn't even remember how I aquired the game. Assuming it was a compulsion perchase, I angerly installed it so as to get at least a little time out of one of the many regretful purchases in my library.   Twenty minutes later the only thing that was real was the jungle, pitch black in the midst of a typhoon. The only light to see by were the bolts of lightning in the sky and the fire that spread accross the countryside. I'm standing on a hill fending off a living tide of velociraptors. My LMG running dry as a T-Rex charges, up my right flank. As I'm about to be eaten, my team mate broadsides the T-Rex with the APC, killing it. two of my teammates jump out of the back and start engaging the next wave, led by a prehistoric giant crocodile. I equip my shotgun and lept back into the fray.  Orion: Prelude is super fun and has some solid mechanics. It is fortunate that the action packed dinostorm never stops because there are some issues. One of the most glaring issues is that the high paced action can immediatly screech to a halt if you die. Depending on the scenario you may be able to only spawn at the begining of the round. There is no telling how long a round can be as there could be as few as 30 dinosaurs to as many as 300, and the earlier you die the longer you will wait. This applies to joining games as well and you can only drop in at the begining of rounds. The objective kept switching every round also, which was confusing. There is only one level with varying weather conditions, the graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥, the sound is â¥â¥â¥â¥, nothing is clearly labled or explained, the default button mapping for the controller is unintuitive but the game is always on multiplayer so pausing to fix it is suboptimal but exiting the game to deal with it is even worse because you'll have to wait five minutes to get back into the game. on and on I could go with issues.  But in spite of a lot of glaring issues the game rocks. For doing a lot of things wrong it does a lot right. Again the shooter mechanics are solid but need to be polished. the game prevents being overwhelming by having shooting dinosaurs be the central focus and you'll be doing that from the word 'go.' upgrading yourself is easy once you try it the first time and it doesn't take long to get a loadout that works for you. Once you actually do change the controller mapping the gameplay will feel like putting on a glove. As it tuned out I had been given the game as a gift by one of my friends that bought a 4-pack and never picked it up. At the end of the day, the game needs work but is still wildly entertaining especially for its price.
5815	1	a	Buy it now. Don't bother reading the rest of this review or any other review. Are you still reading? Ok then, fine. At this price you will not find a better value in gaming. This is gonzo bonkers fun. Get your friends together, run around and kill some dinosaurs. Even if you play it for half an hour, or one day, you only spent a dollar! Buy this game, buy it for your skeptical friends, and find out THE REAL REASON the dinosaurs went extinct.
1874	0	a	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gave i ever played in my life.  The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.  INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.  Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...  Again, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.  The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2. Sounds is terribad... Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons. Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you â¥â¥â¥â¥ like 'I bet you play CoD', well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.  The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.  Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game..  
3456	0	a	This game is so freaking bad. I'd be hardpressed recommending this game for $1, don't be fooled by the interesting looking screen shots. This game is extremely 1 dimentional and quite unrewarding.
3213	1	a	really really kid loving game...... no details and anything
6248	0	a	10/10 my â¥â¥â¥â¥ got chopped of by an toster
4	1	a	I looove the King's Quest Collection. The only downside, of which I hope it will get fixed soon, is that I can't play the King's Quest 7. The rest works except that one which I like the most of all. Also very strange, because KQ7 is the newest of this entire collection, so you would think that part 7 would work and that the older versions wouldn't work instead. But anyway... King's Quest 7 is the reason that I've bought the entire Collection so I am a bit dissapointed. I am looking forward to a fix! (I have Windows 8.1)
553	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME.. ITS A GIANT TURD THAT WONT FLUSH.  It doesnt work and there is 0 support for it. You wont even get an answer from the company that makes it.
3687	1	a	i bought this game for 99 cents an now its free can i get my money back 
4814	0	a	omg Though I used to live this game I stir no free to reclaim bagwini now. Some resolution, my producer
1753	1	a	I had the raptor in my sights, but before I could press the trigger I was suddenly picked up by some dino bird and lifted very high. I punched it! I then began to fall to my death, but my trusty jet pack saved me from a nasty fall. I landed safely, reloaded, turned around, and saw the T-rex jaws coming down, and then I think I was in its belly dying. Punching didn't help, and neither did the jet pack. I am now poo.  Game play is tight, not a single crash. Me and the bros were playing survival for 10 hours, then we realized there was even more game play type! We were having so much fun we didn't even check if there was a way to change or alter the game!  No real story that I can see, but if killing hordes of dinos with halo-type weapons appeals to you, who needs it? I grabbed it on a steam sale and it is unbelievable value for my money.
2514	1	a	This game is great with a friend or two. Controls are a little hard to get used to but once you do the gameplay is awesome! Satisfying as all hell. If you're considering buying it, BUY IT!
5222	0	a	I really wanted to love this game but the mouse delay was way to intense. Lag city â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lag lag city â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.... 4/10
262	1	a	The control is something strange but I could get used to it. The story is good. And I liked the mini challenges.  Good things:   -The story is enough long.   -Playable challenges.   Bad things:   -The control must get used to it.   -If you not play any of challenges the game become too short.
5175	1	a	AMAZING GAME!  Defenately worth the cash and very cheap may i add, Great fun and good to play with friends, The feel of shooting dinos in a FPS futuristic game is amazing, get this game if your looking for a laugh and  something to do in your spare time!
130	1	a	A solid proof that even viral outbreaks can be incredibly fun, if done right.  Eat . Sleep . Consume . Repeat .  Oh, and you are kind of OP !  10/10, will consume again.
3287	1	a	The game is fantastic. It's come a long way from Dino Beatdown and as a lot of other reviews will say: do not trust the metacritic score. I've gotten more hours of fun than I have from games I've paid four times as much for. You can kill T-Rex's with flame throwers, rocket launchers, miniguns, bows, snipers, machine guns, a knife, a jedi sword, and grenades.
5499	1	a	...
3148	1	a	i approve of this game! 
756	0	a	Nice, old-scool graphics, reminded me a bit of Syberia. However, story-wise it was a complete blah with no ground for anything and tons of mistakes: You have tons of locaions (rooms) and such, most of which you never need in the game. It makes reacing places so difficult! You have tons of actions which bring nothing to the story.  A number of items which you can view, say what they are and that's it. Usually, this cancels the 'view' action in such games. Once you see it and know what it is, if it's uselss otherwise.. it just mustn't stay active. Here, it's the opposite. You have a generator and a room which you may never 'see'.  Collecting stuff with no need for it.  Tons of useless mini-quests (like seeking for the same item twice).  Idiotic ending.
1860	1	a	Great Game actually. I see a lot of reviews sayin how the publisher is a piece of crap and all that stuff, I have to say that the game itself is pretty nice.  The idea of the game is simple but hey, if you are a casual gamer like me who just need to wind down a bit after work, this game is perfect. It is an easy goin' dino shootin' fps with nice graphics and a very friendly game community. There is no fancy campaign or complicated mechanics in the game, no scheming no grand strategy, just some good old fashioned brainless action packed shooting. And that is good enough for me.  Of course, if you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challege, this game is not for you. But if all you want is sometime away from it all, this game is the perfect choice. 9/10
5036	0	a	not recommended bad gameplay and graphic
2670	1	a	Wasn't particularly fun but I bet it'd be amazing with friends who are willing to buy it. All in all I would say it's worth the price tag it has on it but only if you have people to play with.
6025	1	a	BEST GAME EVUR! YOU JUST HAVE TO PLAY IT! IT'S LIKE 1$?? REALLY????? IT FEELS LIKE.. WOAH DUDE, I WOULD HAVE PAYED MUCH MORE FOR THIS INSANE EXPERIENCE! JUST BUY IT, I MEAN WHO CARES ABOUT 1$ FOR SUCH AN INSANE GAME?
206	1	a	Fantastic game. Deffinately one of my favourites.
4672	0	a	I didn't think they would make a game off my favorite novel Gay T-Rex Law Firm Executive Boner but they did and man that just gets me so flaccid like on a scale from 1 to wet noodle id be angel hair spaghetti.  But for real this game is an anal shipment of crap and I hope no one suffers the same fate as i did.  3 out of a George Forerunner.
1780	1	a	Game's nice, but not worth the regular $15 price. It has gameplay affecting bugs up the wazoo, and devs who seem to care more about sales than informing their playerbase (unless I can find more up-to-date info.) The levelling system is nice, if a bit tedious due to how fast the exp requirements go, and the specific upgrades are off a level every once in a while. But despite the game's professional appearance, on the inside, it's a far more amateurish game than it looks, which may or may not actually be a bad thing, depending on what you like. However, if it's on sale for $1 (which is more often than it should be) just buy the damn game and enjoy the time you can spend with it for only a dollar.
3615	0	a	even for a 1$ is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing waste of money.
5225	1	a	Very unexpected joy coming from a game that costs less than a pack of gum.  10/10
6209	0	a	Servers are crap, it's always laggy, no tutorial ( so I was pretty much lost), and worst of all i bought so I could play it later, it passes by the return date, i play, and it's bad. These are just my thoughts, if you had a blast with the game, good for you, but these are my thoughts, so I could care less
5073	1	a	It's a real fun game when you have dinos and explosions going boom all around you 
3671	1	a	If you have a dinosaur fetish this is the the game for you.
1917	0	a	The developer was banned from the Steam forums if that tells you anything.
5669	1	a	Its ok I guess 
6023	1	a	BEST GAME EVER LOVE IT WHEN YOU KILL A TREX IT'S SLOWMOTION
3323	0	a	Great idea for gameplay, horrible execution. The game environments look alright, but the character, weapon, vehicle, and building textures look like they were made by members of the Unreal Tournament community over a decade ago. I don't understand how a game engine can have the kind of performance issues that this game suffers from, even when all the settings are turned low, despite the fact that it doesn't look as good as other titles I've played (that perform better). The gameplay leaves me asking questions like: Why is the generator so far away from the other buildings? Why don't I have enough time to get back and buy weapons and upgrades between rounds? I also find myself asking questions about the originality of the game, such as: why does the tank look like a ripoff of the scorpion from Halo? Why are we fighting dinosaurs of different time periods, millions of years apart? Why aren't these like, primordial alien monsters that resemble dinosaurs (we are futuristic soldiers)? Why does the menu music sound like a cross between Battlefield games and the action score of Pirates of the Carribean (which already sound similar)?  I read a review last time I tried a free preview that stated the game still feels like it's in alpha. I agreed with it. I read a recent (community) review that said they've improved the game since then. My recent experience proves that to be mostly false and I still agree, it needs a ton of work because it still feels like it's in alpha.  Biggest problem: how is this not a free-to-play game if it has its own store?
3994	0	a	I would not recommend you waste $1 on this game lol
3459	1	a	Its a really fun and awesome game, great fun with hordes and hordes of dinosaurs, do get it its great. check out thegamingbeaver on it
6082	1	a	Ok first this game if one of the best ive ever seen, like for 1$ are you kidding me ? Seriously i would pay more than 5$ for this, this is a great game but i am about to say all of its bad things, and it might make you want to not buy it, so here i go:  Bad Things:  Ghaphics : It is ok not that broken, but it dosent reach my standards, with is very low.  Difficulty: You are rather over powered as hell and it is at the state witch is not fun any more, or you get beaten by a T-rex every freaking time you spawn.  Vehicles: It is acually ok, but the shooting on the cars and tanks are broken. And never drive a heli it is 100% broken, and one time it even killed me.  Dinos: Most of them are fine exept the birds, thy are always broken to shoot or kill.  And thats pretty much it, but there are lots more that i havent said, so yea...
3266	1	a	Good fun game MUST play with friends and DO NOT pay full price.
2343	1	a	If you like Shooters i would definatly recommend this game
819	1	a	Great fun, good game if you just wanna slice â¥â¥â¥â¥ up.
4730	1	a	The game is decent for the cost. The only problem I have with it is that is was gifted to me, now Steam is telling me I have to buy it in order to play it.
1813	1	a	I love to play this game with friends, got it for all my mods on twitch so we can play with the whole mod team on stream!
671	1	a	This game is fairly terrible, but I can't stop playing.
5410	1	a	This game is one of the best fps shooters i have played in a while. You just can't beat the feel of Halo with bad â¥â¥â¥ dinos.
2904	1	a	This is seriously one of the most â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up games I've ever played.......
5268	1	a	Turok meets Halo in this jump in jump out game. Initial thoughts were that this game was going to be boring but it is one of those games that remains a hidden gem. Get it, play it, and see for yourself.
4793	1	a	-10/10 Would get slapped across the map by a dinosaur again
3524	0	a	poorly optimized and also high ping
1826	1	a	you can taunt on people that you lick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ !
5921	1	a	FPS is not my first choice of games but the trailer and 'plot' drew me in. WOW! Just started playing, I don't even have all of the controls memorized and i love it. 
166	1	a	it's a super villian sand box game (shut up, he's totaly a bad guy)  your options are, generally, kill every body, or kill every body then eat them, and the plot is &gt;.&gt; well it's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ed, so much so theres a whole sub quest devoted to eating the people that know what the hell is going on.  but shoving the mess of a plot aside, its pure genocidal fun. there are LOADS of fun ways to kill people from just grabbing them to verious shap objects to tanks and helicoptors, even the stealth missions, which are mostly side quests, are fun (and involve killing a AT LEAST one person) case you haven't noticed, killing people is pretty much the whole point, and if you need a game for that this would be it, if you want a plot you can understand and a touch more in objectives then 'kill everybody' well not for you then.   also, the last boss can â¥â¥â¥â¥ him self for being boring as hell
3745	0	a	This game sucks so f**king bad, like holy sh*t. Don't buy this if you have any right of mind.
4554	0	a	The worst thing for my life Abto heck heck of a game Maine buys?
744	0	a	Worst. Game. Ever...  I continued to wait for the game to begin all the way until the credits rolled.   There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever.   â¢ The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus.   â¢ There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.  â¢ It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry 'Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof.' there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky.   â¢ You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters.   There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank.   Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for Â£1... and only if you get that Â£1 from someone else.
1381	1	a	I had a lot of fun with this game. The controls can be a little challenging at times, but that makes the victories all the sweeter. You could probably beat this game in a day if you wanted, but it's still worth it.
2168	1	a	This game has potential. WIth some major graphical updates, bug fixes, improvements to gamemodes, and a larger player base, this game could be really good. But because it has none of those things, I give the game a solid 7.5/10. It is kind of hard to criticize the game too badly, though, because of how cheap it is.
2561	1	a	Usually I try to avoid horde survival games like Serious Sam, but oh boy for a dollar, it is really fun to play. Its fun to play with friends and blame them for not healing you. Forever alone? you can play with close-to-useless AI bots to play with!  Also you can ride a dino while raining bullets on their face. 11/10
5525	1	a	its great and for only .99 it is too good, if they added a story line it could be even better but still great. if you like halo and call of duty zombie's mashed to gether than download it now
3561	0	a	Dev is scamming on KickStarter and IndieGogo, distributing false allegations, stealing content from other games and threathening people who critisise him and his company. What a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2767	1	a	BEST GAME NA, SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WHEN TOTALLY BORED. TIMMY DOWN/10
4929	0	a	I would not reccomend this game becasue the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I say this from only needing to play 1 hour of the game. It is basically just a race to get the cheapest vehical and run over the enemy team with it before they do it to you. This game had a great idea however and was fun for the one time it that people didn't just run over the enemy team. If the games community was better I would reccomend this game however.
5967	1	a	For 1$ its an absolute steal
505	1	a	If you enjoy destruction, this is the game for you. Prototype is a very versatile game that also gives you the ability to build your characters atributes the way you want. The end game is hilarious due to the fact that you are untouchable.
3001	1	a	It's like Killing Floor...But with dinosaurs :D 10/10
3096	1	a	This game just not have any T-Rex, but it got a T-Rocks 
5306	1	a	It's a pretty good little game. I got it for 1 euro, and that's about the best value for it. The survival mode can be really fun if you get some decent teammates but really, that's a problem that all online games have, getting matched with stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kids. Other than that, the Versus mode is a bloody nightmare, I was getting 200 ping on the servers, couldn't get a lower ping for the life of me... Because of that ping, in Versus mode, I had one of the lowest K:D ratio I have ever had in ANY game, EVER! Lol... Graphics are pretty decent. It has the occasional glitch but nothing too bad. Like I said, not too bad. Take it with a grain of salt.
3146	1	a	The meta cretic score is a lie. Its a great game!
2865	1	a	Why did I buy it. â¥â¥â¥â¥
3215	0	a	Its fun at the very beginning of the game but gets boring at the end the fun will never last!!!!
5736	1	a	this game is good just needs to lag a little less
839	1	a	Awesome game go for it
3463	0	a	This is absolutely terrible, the PVP is awful the Horde mode is okay but the animations and sounds are beyond awful, But I guess thats what you can expect from an indie developer pfft.
5547	1	a	I like killing dinos not to mention shooting things
1711	1	a	Best game youll ever have for $0.99 Its nazi zombies+halo+dinos This game is very addicting and has the best intense co-op experience i have ever had in a long time
2629	1	a	The box art looks pretty cool so it's got that goin' for it.
5840	1	a	this game has very little content...for well different gear but ways to play let's just say i've put 720hours in and i'm still fiding new ways to play. It all depends on the people you play with!
2761	1	a	I respect these developers. I respect them. These guys teach you to never give up on something.
83	1	a	These games are an integral part of my youth. They may not be the first choice of newer generations, but they still have a lot to offer anyone who plays them.
4927	0	a	well this game should be free it cost 72 cents? really? make it free plz
2148	1	a	Absolutely love this game! Even though I haven't played it as much as other people but the gameplay is awesome, graphics aren't complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ but the ambience of the game is just amazing. The music, don't even get me started on the music. The music on this game is brilliant and is just so catchy. As some people would say, 'Damn yo. This mixtape is fire' 10/10 -IGN  
1324	1	a	Not as good as Bernards but still pretty nice game.
2568	1	a	The Best game over with good graphics and anomations!!!!
3602	0	a	Cancer inside a cancerbox, inside yet an other cancerbox, before putten into a cancerbox.
3738	0	a	This game sucks... it's really boring game.
39	1	a	Space Quest is an excellent adventure game series that is a recognized classic. While it's not consistent throughout the series (mostly SQ VI, which isn't bad, but isn't great, either), the highpoints are tremendous. My favorite is easily SQ IV, but SQ I-III are also fantastic with the same sort of humor (I haven't played SQ V enough to rule on it).  It's important to mention that this collection is missing the original version of Space Quest I, which is an EGA version with a parser instead of point &amp; click. I personally missed it since I have nostalgic memories of playing it. It's also important to note that this collection has compatibility issues. EDIT: I believe this has since been fixed. The non-Legacy edition worked on Windows 10 for me. I still prefer downloading ScummVM (a client program which allows you to run old Sierra &amp; Lucas Arts games) and manually adding the games that way. ScummVM has plenty of options if you're a stickler for various graphics &amp; sound options (it can emulate the Roland MT-32, a legendary sound device back in the day, however, you will need the ROM for it). You can also get the GOG version which has the original version of SQ I instead of the point &amp; click remake.
1994	1	a	This game has its bugs and the KI is ultra stupid. Anyway, it makes a lot of fun to fly around and kill badass dinos!
1407	1	a	Lovely 2D platformer with beautiful artstyle.One thing that annoyed me was that the game looked so good in 2D but the checkpoints,nuggets,anti-matter etc. were kind of 3D and I felt that wasn't really fitting in.8/10
4900	1	a	i so love this game i hope they would give me a code for this :(
1354	0	a	  -
602	1	a	Highly recommended by me. Reminds me of Just Cause 2 when it comes to game play BUT so much more darKer and brutal &gt;:D  ~ Love It!
4321	1	a	Yes THA â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ BEST GAME EEEEVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR NOT but its fun
1964	1	a	I like it.  8/10  Cheap fun, buy it!
5241	1	a	  To start with.
435	1	a	Very hard game. But really enjoyed it.
2502	1	a	ORION: Prelude has a lot of issues, but it's a lot of fun and it's really cheap, especially right now that it's on sale for 74 cents. Even the full price of 99 cents is probably less than the developers deserve for this game, even considering all of its flaws. The game plays like a budget mixture of Halo: CE, Borderlands, and Killing Floor: After selecting your class (One of three) you and your teammates get a short period of time to buy weapons, upgrades, and vehicles, after which a wave of various kinds of dinosaurs attack you and your power generator, which you must protect. If your whole team is killed or your generator is knocked offline for too long, you lose. Players respawn between waves, when you have the opportunity to buy more stuff with the money you earn from killing dinosaurs. Every so often, your team needs to travel to another area of the map and kill one or more large dinosaurs, which are often stupidly hard to beat, and cause smaller dinosaurs to spawn as long as they are alive. Once that wave is completed, various vehicles spawn, depending on the wave - many of which are quite reminiscent of those from Halo, including one very obvious Warthog shout-out.  ORION: Prelude isn't a pretty game by any means, but it's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the price. Pick it up.

1058	1	a	This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic. I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a 'level select' area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks. I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels.   I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just 'being there' rather than actually adding anything to the game.  So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.  Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.
3637	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥
1343	0	a	naahh I buy this game only for badge
2471	1	a	Have you ever thought, what would happen if you add dinosaurs to halo? Neither have I but it works!
4053	0	a	I could have spent the one euro on a coke or something. I knew this was bad, but this game puts the word bad in a new dimension of bad. Like shaving your beard with a kitchenknife kinda bad. This game hurts right in my feels. But I was stupid enough to even buy it to begin with.
4760	1	a	Amazing game bit laggy but isn't every online game other than that i love this game
2788	1	a	Surprisingly Entertaining.
1055	1	a	Pretty cool game until the last level. I couldn't beat it it was so hard.
4660	1	a	Best Game Ever Played
2985	1	a	Give this game a chance, do not take it seriously at all, and you will have some good fun. Highly recommend getting the four-pack and playing with friends, nab while it's on sale for silly value. :D
6133	1	a	Worth the 0.39 euros !
6296	1	a	My computer isn't very good and can't run this very well, however, it is a pretty fun game if you don't lag a ton like me.
2179	1	a	FIVE DINOSAURS KILLOSAUR BRING ME A PIZZA  Fun times for good price.

6318	1	a	Pretty good game for 1$.
3833	0	a	Sure am glad the specs keep changing
2888	1	a	All time best purchase in the whole of today!
3293	1	a	I really enjoyed and i strongly recommend it :D
2252	1	a	I backed Dino Beatdown on Kickstarter...I guess this is a remake of that game. I was really disappointed with Dino Beatdown...but recently played Dino Horde with some friends and can honestly say I havent had that much fun playing a game with some friends in a long time. Sure it doesn't really have a story but who cares...survival mode for me it the most fun. But Hey its .99 so you can't beat the price...play it with a 2-3 friends and I promise you'll be hooked. I plan alot of Dayz which is a slow and patient type of game...so its nice to take a break from Dayz and play something crazy like this and just have fun.
1095	1	a	Relaxing gameplay, makes you think, cute grapchic, awesome music and sound effect, fair price for this kind of game.
6367	1	a	This game is a dollar. I got to drive a helicopter while terroizing my friend without a car from above
2103	1	a	Good game for when you want to kill an hour... or 100... I'm HOOKED... Ah well, at least this addiction only costed me 49 cents....lol
4036	1	a	Great game with friends, 10/10 would recommend, it never gets old shooting velociraptors and triceratops' into oblivion.
2133	1	a	Killed Raptors Punched a t-rex in the face Attempted riding a triceratops Nearly breaking my 'v' key clearing waves of raptors Crashing helicopters into dinosaurs Having a lightsaber battle with a gaint crocodile AND MUCH MORE! All for 99 cents...
3683	1	a	i had it before it was epic but it was only the demo it only lasted 3 da :(
1909	1	a	Remember playing with those plastic dinosaur figures as a kid? Apparently the Devs of this game did. If you want to relive your childhood this game is for you. Grab a shotgun and blast some dinosaurs till youâve had your fill of prehistoric carnage. Solid mechanics make this game easy to pick up for anyone who is familiar with FPS games. Various game modes and a variety of dinosaurs and guns make for some fun game play that keeps you engaged. Add some friends and itâs even better. Some of the upgrades and HUD elements can be confusing at first and currently there isnât a large player base. Overall I'd recommend it, especially if you can get some friends to play as well.

6230	1	a	This is a steal. Probobly you will have more fun with this game than SOME 20$ games. This used to be a terrible game but now its awsome, less glitches, bugs.... Please get this its really fun
6083	1	a	This is a good game 
4541	0	a	trash. theif. don't play
6468	1	a	great game, super fun to play with friends
1740	1	a	You may expect a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game (as I did), but you are wrong - this is one of the best co-op shooters for a unreasonably low price.   Futuristic soilders fighting dinosaurs is a weird combo, but it turns out great. Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.  The only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.  Overall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much. Will be buying more copies for friends!
1593	0	a	This game is a scam. The publisher didn't pay the developers and they are using assets they stole from Black Ops 3. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
6053	1	a	Work in Progress, only 3 classes and lots of game modes. I would hope that it continues to update things like more classes, perhaps a mmo server for the entire game, maybe even unlockable vehicles. But 1 thing is for sure... Melee (except the Ion Blade) is SUPER OVER POWERED, example: I joined some guy's server at round 6, by the time we won on round 12 or so in survival i had gotten 204 cryo melee kills and their best person with guns got 83..... liek... dafuq??? plz nerf, needs to be more realistic.
4405	1	a	Not bad for a 2$ game
1093	1	a	Tab and Click for Beep  BEEP is cute style platformer with puzzle solving and action shooting, but pity that it's Keyboard and Mouse control only.  Good: - Cute character and world design - Nice Happy mood music - Stage select by spaceship is funny - It's cheap and with cards  Bad: - No controller support - Step on damaged evil robot as platform sometimes tideous - Stage and enemies type is few  Verdict: Only recommend to get it on big sales  Score: 5/10
5471	1	a	Is it a great game? Nah. Do I feel like I spend most of the time backpedaling as fast as possible to keep shooting dinos in the head? Yeah. Is the weapon and perk buying between waves mechanic decent? Sure.  Am I debating just buying a handful of four packs and giving them out to my friends saying 'We need to get a group together to play this?' Ooh hell yeah.  There seems to be a lot of polish missing, but for 99Â¢ there isn't the 'I paid $30 for this garbage?' response. Sometimes I know I don't want to play a real complicated game, and I just want to dome some dinos. And given use of the Unreal Engine, and decent selection of weapons, I have to say I prefer this as my mindless dino shooter of choice; beating out Primal Carnage despite it being objectively better in most ways.  Give it a try. If you don't have a buck to spare, what are you doing looking at reviews on Steam anyway?
5372	1	a	This game is fun if you have people to play it with, otherwise it is rediculously hard to play.
2584	1	a	the devs took a crap on their keyboards. 3 years later they turned that â¥â¥â¥â¥ into gold!!
4637	1	a	OMFG, ok so to start off the metacritic review is flat out wrong and either needs to be updated or removed. This game is downright amazing to play with friends, its like every childhood dream, its requires skills and is super fun to play with friends as you can do large survival missions, the vehicles are epic and the gameplay lothough repetative never gets old i highly reccomend it and tell you to ignore the ratings!
2141	0	a	It;s and alright game, however I wouldn't recomend wasting your moeny on it, it's not a game that is worth moeny, also it crashes whenever you move on to a new map after finishing a mission.
3506	0	a	Complete waste of money. You can never connect to any servers. So you wont be able to play the stupid game. Boring gunplay
5312	1	a	Only when it is on the 99cent sale
1663	1	a	this game has fun, intuitive controls and the people are great! I love Orion:DinoHorde to my hearts content. I wish i could play all day :)
467	1	a	so much blood :D
2593	1	a	Awesome game really interesting i recommend it
3179	1	a	Laserwords, Dinosaurs and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing co-op. 10/10
4903	0	a	Horrible, horrible game.
594	1	a	First off, I would like to say that I love this game, for me, It seems that games like this make me think overwhelmingly positive, because of all the destruction and all the crisis, but this game could not suite you, so you should just try to find a game that works well for you.  I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for complete chaos.
81	1	a	It looks like crap, has a hard time playing on most modern computers, but is a blast none the less esp if you grew up on these games.
667	1	a	The most bad â¥â¥â¥ poker game around. With great music/graphics and gameplay...this game will make you pumped to play poker. Simply awesome.
5793	1	a	Halo + Nazi Zombies + Dinosaurs = Orion: Prelude  Highly recommended if you have people to play it with.
2167	1	a	You can run small dinosaurs over with a car.
6171	0	a	It's bad. This game is honestly one of the worst games i've ever played, i only payed $1.50 for it and i'm regretting my decision. Just please don't buy this game.
5015	1	a	It sucks
3345	0	a	probably the worst game on steam
2069	1	a	It boots up :)
136	1	a	7/10
980	1	a	Nice game
6224	1	a	Monster Hunter meets Halo for $0.99? Yes please.
5720	1	a	Great game 10/10 you can fight Dino's drive vehicles get weapons perks and play with your friends what's not to like.
758	1	a	A nice classic styled adventure game. A few unintuitive things were needed to progress though, had to resort to walkthroughs.
2783	1	a	I played it with friends and had a great time, but welp everything is better with friends... But this game isn't horrible and certainly you can have fun by yourself (especially since they added bot support),so for 1$? Hell YEAH, this game is worth it.
823	1	a	OK, to be honest, they added simple nothing with this game and I can say first one was better than Shank 2 in almost every way. Story was terrible for me. It's all about going after someone called 'Helena' which we know almost nothing about her. Well, he raised Shank and some other guys from Rebellion that's all we know but we don't know why he goes after her. Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added 'Survival Mode' and you can play online co-op, too. We couldn't because of annoying connection problems. Long story short, buy it if you really want to play Shank 2.
2002	1	a	Fun game to play with good friends when you just want to screw around and have a bit of fun. Other than that its not that great of a game if you're playing by yourself.
5400	1	a	It looks like it's gunna be rubbish but it really isn't.

568	1	a	I'd highly recommend using an Xbox One controller for this epic action game. Easily my favorite hack and slash game. Very intense and fast paced. Interesting plot. Also the game gets very very hard in the end, your first playthrough of the game should be on Easy. Movement mechanics are very interesting and allow for fast-paced traversing across NYC. Movement includes dive bombing, parkouring, gliding, dashing through the air, sprinting, sprint climbing up on buildings, massive charged jumps, and much more.
3277	0	a	I have one word to describe it:lag
3642	0	a	Absolute garbage optimization, so much that the game is unplayable. I would describe more, but i can't cause i cant play the game. You'll probably have more enjoyment out of bad rats then this piece of trash.
1689	1	a	Decent game if you can overlook its flaws.
2972	1	a	I actually bought this game and now it's free to play ? Lmao get it while it's free it's a cool game and nice graphics.
3119	1	a	needs optimization 
27	1	a	I absolutely LOVED this game growing up. It's pretty nostalgic for me, and even though *I* can't quite get the oldest games in the series to work (it wants me to reconfigure some settings for graphics and then it looks weird), I'm sure somebody more tech-savvy than myself could.
4548	0	a	I bought this for a quarter and still regret my purchase. This game is absolute garbage.
4287	1	a	Assault rifles, shotguns, laser guns, flamethrowers, tanks, mechs, airships, and dinosaurs. This game really is pretty awesome. Great for LAN's or teaming up with friends for some mindless fun.
5741	1	a	skeptical of such a cheap game, I went in expecting to find a dissappointment....  I was wrong.  With reminders of Early Unreal tournament and an enjoyable pacing Orion: Prelude is well worth the money. Spend the dollar, it's worth it.
1758	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
2861	1	a	its a good game but i have a problem.My friend bought me a copy of this game but its not in my libary and when i try to play it ,it says that i have to buy it .can any ony help me D: 
1273	0	a	Had a huge horrible glitch where it was 32 bit, could not play at all, and lucky me, it was before the refund system came out.
1277	0	a	Not bad for the price but poor control.
5503	1	a	I wish iI could use all the weapons that u buy
343	0	a	The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:  1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).  2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)  Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.  I've tried every 'fix' I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.  So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.  As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.
5611	1	a	Orion Prelude... What can I say... Fun multiplayer/ Co-Op dinosaur killing mayhem, all for the low price of .99 USD or 3.99 USD for a four pack. Can't go wrong. :)
5641	1	a	Hilarious times. I had a tank and shot a Triceratops about 300 feet up into the air.   Gameplay: You choose 1 of 3 classes, each of which as its own unique ability. You then fight waves of dinosaurs by capturing objectives or by defending your base. In between waves you can upgrade your weapons/abilities. There are also hilariously hard to control vehicles. You will crash into a wall a lot.  Also no friendly fire, thank goodness.  No bugs that I can think of. Smooth gameplay on the unity 5 engine.
1532	1	a	This game is like Dino D-Day, only better.
5403	1	a	A fast paced romp through a horde of dinosaurs. enjoyable alone, but the game really shines in its multiplayer. working together to take down the dinos is sufficiently difficult to make you chear when you hear the satisfying death screams. I haven't played much yet, but i thoroughly enjoyed it so far.
6247	1	a	This game is glitchy. It is really unoptimized with many framerate drops regardless of how good your PC is. It has a mixed history that includes quite some controversy over changing their name to avoid a terrible metacritic score. It was described as one of the absolute worst games of all time. All but the last are true.  The game itself is buggy and absolutely unoptimized. It is also extremely fun, with a very large variety of weapons and quite a few different enemy dinos to take down. The special weapons were particularly fun. It makes for a great game to jump in and shoot some dinos with friends, or even just alone. Throw up max money, buy all the cool weapons and just wreck the dino horde.  Is it the greatest game of all time? No, but it is far better than everyone made it out to be. When it was $15 this would've been a negative review due to the poor performance and that things just don't work right a good chunk of the time. But now that it's a dollar, and a 4-pack can be had for $3 (prices as of writing) it is a hearty recommendation instead. Think of it this way: A cup of coffee, an energy drink, or 4 copies of this game for yourself and friends to play. It'll provide a minimum of a few hours of entertainment, either through actual fun with the game or purposefully trying to break it and make silly things happen.
2572	1	a	Pretty fun: The only thing missing is an unlimited survival mode. I don't get why there are things for 20k credits if I can only make that much by buying nothing rounds 1-9. e.e But overall it's a decent game, esepcially for 99 cents.
5086	0	a	Gameplay is nice. But they could make some imporvements.
6159	1	a	actually really good
1359	0	a	This is second worst game I have ever played. (#1 is disney infinity for the 3DS)
614	1	a	I have real fond memories of this game. The story is kinda dumb but just interesting enough to keep you engaged, and the powers you get are fun as hell. It's a bit dated by today's standards but give it a shot.   Plus, you get to karate kick helicopters out of the air. Who doesn't wanna do that?
5550	1	a	At less than a dollar, you cant afford to not own ORION: Prelude. Not in this economy.
2255	1	a	Great graphics, lightsabers and dinos...
2144	0	a	This was so bad, it made my balls hurt..
5710	1	a	I wish i could play the game, But my laptop is crap so it runs at 10 fps rip :( Anyway one nof the greatest games ive demoed
2735	1	a	There simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs &amp; even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...  The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde &amp; Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big &amp; small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication &amp; gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles &amp; more to enjoy.   PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks &amp; weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving &amp; helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful &amp; friendly in-game too.  One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates &amp; types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!  Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths &amp; each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups &amp; perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos &amp; gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)  If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).  The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use &amp; offer a good range of practical &amp; destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over &amp; over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes &amp; tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.  The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' &amp; 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)  O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs &amp; remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun &amp; intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience!
3967	0	a	I spent 10$ gifting this to all my friends and it turns out to be free. 0/10 wouldnt gift again
404	1	a	Finshed the game and wanting more.   9/10 for great gameplay, I really liked the powers Alex Mercer has especially that whip power. The whip power gets me to helicopters, and gets me to attack far away enemies. The parkour also looked great, but I've seen better.   6/10 for the story, I wasn't that clinged to the story. I didn't even watch the scenes. I just waited for the objective and do it, no questions asked.  It's really an old game but it's really entertaining because of the open world and killing lots of civilians for no good reason. I recommend you t buy this game when it's on sale. I think I bought mine with the Prototype 2 which I'm gonna play some time after this. To sum up, 7/10 for the game, buy it on sale along with Prototype 2, so you can continue the story or like me just play another open world game and kill lots of people. Again, 7/10, and buy it on sale. :D
3475	0	a	I couldn't even get into a game with my friend.
4808	1	a	if you like killing things then this is game for you  :)  
4893	0	a	.....
5927	1	a	Who told you that you have to spend a lot of money to have a great game? This is so cheap and dope â¥â¥â¥â¥
2155	1	a	'The only thing worse than a zombie running at you, is a zombie on fire running at you'. This is not the case with dinosaurs, especially when you wield a flamethrower with infinite ammo, and you have a T-Rex running straight at you. Slow roasted goodness.
4680	0	a	Buy this game for someone you do not like!
3016	1	a	I love this game i love the bow i love the teamwork i give this a 100 out of 10 i also like the pvp aspects
5194	1	a	you can shoot dinosaurs to hell with such varied weaponry that it doesn't matter how much you mess around 10/10
2292	1	a	i so recommend dis game when dinos heads get shot off the blood looks like gum its weird and funny at the same time 
2721	1	a	The Metascore is a Lie !!!
1446	1	a	Good platformer. 7/10
5631	1	a	DO IT!
6456	0	a	Guys run like they have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ in their â¥â¥â¥.
3862	1	a	I loved the look of the game. in game storyline or the concept is very good. I wish i had a better computer to actually play the game....
3142	1	a	Worth every single cent of the dollar
5527	1	a	Great game. For a $1 ... its worth more
344	0	a	Bad controls, bad animations, bad dialog, bad ballence. This is a bad game. It's not â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's not like i'm mad they got my money, it's just bad enough I wish I didn't own it because I'm not going to play it.
2836	1	a	this feels like doing meth and then questioning all your life choices  but its only a dollar so lose yourself
5064	1	a	I got knocked off a cliff and disconnected from the server 10/10 game of the year.  The game play was fun and fast paced yet some dinosaurs glitched through rocks alot.  Yet, I shot a stegosaurus repeatedly in it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it died! What more do you want from a fps?
1403	1	a	got it for 19 cents , made it back and a profit from trading cards , it is also a really enjoyable game , with some puzzle features to it , I do recommend this as it is just a generally fun game and is a great time passer
1242	0	a	what a stupid game, when you load up the game its just blank grey  the develpers are stupid for not finishing the game and i have a huge pc
5977	1	a	Great, dumb fun if you have any friends to play with.  Gets old fast though.  Excellent Value for the money
974	1	a	worth the price and its a lot of fun both in co-op and singleplayer, gameplay is better but i miss the co-op story from the first game and the way that you had to find difrent aproche for each boss, now its kick them till they dead and it makes them boring and basicly they all feel the same, in the first game you died a lot till you find the way to kill the boss but when you did you can kill the boss fast, and feel smart, the same was in coop story
2871	0	a	10/10 would recommend
5498	1	a	It's .99 cents, if you still have an issue with buying it, you might be jewish.
5244	0	a	Still doesn't work. Waste of money. Steam should remove.
3087	1	a	Personally, I think this game is pretty stupid. Its not super interesting or well made. The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is meh, and everything about it is not particularly creative or good. It is, however, $1. So far, I've played about 2 hours of it, and I'll probably get another hour or so out of it, and I think thats worth $1. It can be pretty fun to beat the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of a dinosaur for a little bit.
6521	1	a	For off the wall fun this game is it.
3786	1	a	This is probably the best game I've ever played. Stunning graphics, next gen engine, haven't encountered any bugs yet. If you really love your friend, gift this to him/her.  Actual quote from IGN: 'The next Bioshock: Infinite' 11/10 -IGN
4273	1	a	Best name-changing simulator I've ever played! 9.4/10
3070	0	a	This is seriously the worst game I ever played in my life. It is not a game that I didn't like, it is hard to like because of its many bugs and lack of content and balance. However, if you don't care too much about that kind of stuff, you can have tons of fun with friends. I don't recommend it though.
3019	1	a	One of the best dino games ever
1943	1	a	From my personal experience this game is awesome and provides lot of fun, especially if u play it with friends, To be honest game needs improvements and fixes but that dosen't mean that u cant have great experience of fun. I recommend this game to everyone. Just lover a bar of perfection for games. I've played this game for 23h and I love it.
2411	1	a	I mean it's only 99 cents so, why not get it.
5082	1	a	If you're looking for a game to have fun for a few hours - i recomend this. You probably wont play it for weeks on end, but an hour every now and then with friends, sure.
704	1	a	Puzzle Quest gets into debt and tries to win a few games of poker.  But seriously though, good game and creating poker hands is a wonderful idea.
6506	1	a	Best indie game EVER!! its halo meets killing floor with a little bit of jurrassic park.metacritic review is not for this game but actually for its predessesor.persistent ranking and the best coop mechanics to date (simply click on a friend to instantly add to party).9.1 out of 10 as more content is on its way 
5097	1	a	Don't let the price scare you away! This is actually a really fun game. It might not be a huge game, but it is very well made and a very satisfying FPS romp. The larger dinosaurs take a while to kill so you get to throw a satisfyingly large amount of ammo at them.   You can easily create our own server to play with your friends. With the low price and ease of entry it makes a great game to play with your friends at a party. Each player will need their own computer.
6405	0	a	Even for a dollar, Im not going to waste time or hard drive space on this prehistoric turd. All I want is a New Turok!
2667	1	a	  One of my friends gifted me this game. Actually i wasn't planning to play this game but he said that he bought this not only for me but for our some common friends too. So, we downloaded and started to play. I can honestly say, i don't know much about this game's '' games modes'' except survival and conquest(i couldn't remember clearly which one is which.). Dinosaurs comes on to you wave to wave and you have to defend some energy things. There are some huge dinosours such like T-Rex and much more littles. Little ones can be slayed easily opposite of bigs. And flying ones are so annoying. I am trying to say that there are many kinds of dinosaurs are in this game.  For figthing with them, the games serves you a great range of weapons. You can find many things from rocket launches to ion swords. And each weapon make you feel the difference. There are maps that i don't know but the maps which i played are good. They are big and you can fly to the top of the mountains. Don't assume that you're invulnerable just because you are high, the flying ones still can reach you. On tundra, your glasses has frost effect and blizzards occures well, on another map when the rain comes the weather is nearly blackened etc. and these are such good things on a such cheap game. In conclusion this game offers you a great playability and the price is what it deserves even though it's no fun without friends.
422	1	a	who wouldn't want to drop kick a tank?
2421	0	a	it may look aowsome .. but it's not it's REALLY NOT ... :) if it's 0.99$ get it .. if it's not don't waste ur money :)
5137	1	a	Straight to the point: This is a fairly fun silly little game for the price.   It has some novelty. There are vehicles, and throwing a boulder as a TRex is kind of satisfying. You can fight off waves of AI or you can play competitively arena style. It has a variety of modes so you can mix things up a bit.  You probably won't be playing this game every day. I recommend buying it with a few friends, and you're probably going to get more than your money's worth of a good time out of it.
377	0	a	PC version is complete trash if you have a higher memory video card.
3746	0	a	I cannot explain how terrible this game is. I have played this game for a total of 7 minutes and 45 seconds and honestly I hated every second that my eyes burned on these playstation 1 visuals. I have seen better looking videos and games on my iPod Nano. However I am told that the developers were ging through a tough time being blind. At least thats what I am hoping because this game is worse than that one time a small unloved child from a third world country choked on his own sadness. I wish I could refund my time and life wasted on this pittiful 17th century game that was funded by small children haters foundation. I am truely sorry if you bought this game, for you have been sucked in by the steam sales and the crappy games they put up for less than 5 dollars. FarmVile in my opinion would get my seconds of my life then this sorry excuse for a videogame.
1493	1	a	Let's be brutally honest here.  How many other games can you drive a tank off a cliff, smash into a T-Rex, jump out, noscope T-rex with a bow and then club it to death with a lightsaber?  Exactly.
4230	1	a	This game is really nice .. Thanks for making it free for 5 days . I really appreciated it ..
2212	1	a	DINOS AND MECHS AND GUNS! Whats there not to love about this game.
2456	1	a	It's a great game to play with friends but usually this is how it goes  friend- Hey where are you  Me- Oh ya about that  friend- Come on help me out I'm surrounded by raptors  Me- Ya well I kinda got digested by a T-Rex friend- That's it I'm done I can't kill dinosaurs when ur busy being a piece of crap  Me- but..... friend- that's it I'm just going to get a rocket laucher and a helicopter and BLOW SOME DINOS UP!  WELCOME TO PRELUDE
3403	1	a	This game cured my autism. But gave me astigmatism instead.
4157	1	a	I paid 1 $ for it and i still wish i hadnt. It looks fun but when you play it it just sucks. One good thing is its not as bad as COD Ghosts. Get a game like Dark Souls, CS:GO, Borderlands 2 , or even the Stanley Parable is better. 4.5/10
1703	1	a	IT GIVE'S ME SO MUCH PLEASURE! 
4580	0	a	ORION: Prelude  Oh dear this game ... I do not reccoment this game ! This game is so bad optimized that it will run 40 fps if you have an nvidea geforce gtx 980. But there is even more ! The animations are wierd. Your opjective in the game is hard to know because you do not really now what you have to defend...  1 cool thing: There are HALO cars in this game !  Overall Rating: 2/10
392	0	a	I don't really like the controls or narative style of games like this, what i call openworld sandbox games(red faction, infamous, GTA, etc) I only played the intro and turned it off. Feels and looks super dated now.
5470	1	a	Was $15, but they renamed it and changed the proce to $1. â¥â¥â¥â¥ed over whoever bought Dino Horde, but animations game still on point.
3076	1	a	I shot a dinosaur and it flew 100 feet in the air. 11/10 would fly again
102	1	a	Pros: - Story and gameplay is intresting. - Graphics are decent. - Works very good with Xbox one controller.  Cons: - Performance issues. Very bad port from consoles to PC.  - I would have had wanted to clean the city after story is over but its not possible.
3302	1	a	FORGET THE METASCORE RATING. FORGET IT RIGHT NOW! Have you always wanted to fight dinosaurs with your fists? That's a weird thing to hope for! This game's for you then! It's weird just like you! But I bet you also have friends, right? No? Well then... IT'S STILL A FUN GAME TO PLAY ALONE. Although not as fun as with friends. PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. If you don't have friends MAKE SOME ONLINE ONES. And if you don't have those THEN MAY NEPTUNE HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN IF I WAS IN A DARK ROOM WITH NOTHING ELSE TO PLAY.
2357	1	a	An odd little gem of a game thats amazing for the price. Theres no reason to not buy it.
58	1	a	I'm a huge Sierra fangirl, and I loved the Space Quest games growing up, but this review is for the collection as a whole. There is one major thing missing from the manual PDF: a book that was included with the original Space Quest 6 that is the only way you can solve the datacorder puzzle. So if you don't have that book anymore (or in my case, I never originally purchased Space Quest 5 or 6 so I never had the book to begin with), that puzzle will need to be solved by searching for walkthroughs on the Internet. It's unfortunately just not a good implementation all the way around.  That being said, I still recommend it for Sierra fans who loved the games like I did growing up. Even despite frustrating pixel hunting and many, many deaths and failstates, these games are great granddaddies of adventure games as we know them today. And for that, I love them.
3291	1	a	Hey your qoute 'We released the worst game ever' Day one garrys incident is IMO
2894	0	a	Free week? More like free waste of time! Not even worth 0.99.  It feels like a mashup of Primal Carnage &amp; Tribes: Ascend...  With loads of bugs, horrible animations &amp; lack of originality (it features Lightsabers, Dinosaurs, Jetpacks, and.... basically nothing new...).  Don't waste your time or money on this.
840	1	a	Fast, responsive, quick, deadly  SHANK 2 M O T H E R â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ E R
6026	1	a	by far the greatest master peice of gaming ever created 11/10 stars
3290	1	a	Fantastic.
2368	1	a	for half the price of a pack of gum this game is very good. cmon guys i bought thid game for less then a PACK OF GUM
1746	1	a	Definitely the most fun I have had in ages. Sure, it's buggy, but the gameplay is solid and there's shenanigans aplenty to be had. Not to mention that playing as a dinosaur is a rolicking good time. That feeling when I let loose a spine-chilling roar that sends people scampering in the opposite direction never gets old for me. If you like to be huge and stompy, I higly recommend giving Rampage mode a try.  All in all, I think that anybody who is a dinosaur fan should play this game. And really, who isn't a dinosaur fan at heart?
3426	1	a	Overall, I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of FPS; it is a dollar you will not regret spending.  +DINOSAURS +Great for co-ops with friends +Variety of customization options for players +Plenty of gun types +Vehicles are fun to use +Several game modes, including one where you can play as dinosaurs  -No singleplayer campaign/story -Limited number of types of dinosaurs (see a lot of the same)
1263	0	a	Game crashes upon running. No fix found.
5798	1	a	I recommend only because its cheap, anyways 1/10 but 10/10 if you like games with quality of the 70s pornos
146	1	a	This game was not made recently, but still one of my favorite games. The story line excels in every way. the optimization it self is great since i can still play it on my Lenovo laptop which its CPU is an Intel Pentium and 4GB DDR3 Ram and Intel HD 4400 internal graphich card.
1110	1	a	This is pretty nice game for it's price. It has all kind of different levels, i recommend this game to all who like Puzzle games!
6317	1	a	It is a pretty fun survival game especialy if you play it with friends
5724	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a fun dionsaur survival FPS game. I bought this on sale for $0.74, but I would buy it for the full $0.99 if I had to. This game is perfect for those who enjoy shooting dinosaurs. My favorite feature of ORION: Prelude is... THE MOTHER FREAKIN LIGHTSABER! Yeah you can buy a lightsaber in survival mode. Did I mention there is multiple modes like conquest and duel? I did now...
1998	1	a	Great for Dino lovers
2250	1	a	This is probably the greatest, and most terrible game on Steam. But really its not a very good game. I would only recommend it for its 99 cent price tag and if you have friends to enjoy the terribleness together. Its bad, in the right way.
6462	0	a	The dinosaursurvival is Great. But the multiplayer is crap. You can't shoot anything. Your bullets go over and to the side of your enemies. I rate the multiplayer a 1-10 and the dinosaursurvival a 7-10. But it has great framerate the graphics are outstanding but the gameplay, iffy.
482	1	a	Best Action EVER ...
6214	1	a	High Quality Graphics and cooll gampeplay and also Hardy Cheese Lemon Hard  10/10
1871	0	a	I hope you know what weapons to get; because those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that want you to defend that base LOCK YOU OUT IN ONLY ONE MINUTE. The sound seems to work intermittently but one thing is for sure; that stereotypical black guy voice is coool under fire! These dinosaurs are ninjas.  Sometimes the miniguns on the vehicles work. Sometimes they don't. Your friends will swear that they are overheating and take over but you know the spin-up animation isn't happening but now you want to kick your dog. Thank Glob you don't have a dog.  I played my first game and my friend was so happy to be done with our mission that I couldn't even get to see my stats. Frankly, I don't really care anymore.  This game is sooo close to being decent. There are too many niggling issues (it's not racist - look it up) for me to recommend it, however. I can only imagine what it was like to play at launch.  When I bought Audiosurf for 99 cents, I was ecstatic. There should be a 'Meh' button, but...
6183	1	a	Awesome use of 1â¬. May require a bit better pc than my schoolcomputer but still looks and sounds awesome!
3088	1	a	One of the best game of this decade 10/10 This include a revolutionnary combat system with dinosaurs and amazing graphics Would recommand to anyone interested in Video Games
4132	1	a	It's like being a kid in the 90's that's playing with thier toys. Cheap plastic figures that are a blast to play with. And online is still alive.  dinosaurs remain......dinosaurs remain........  good times.  I understand that a game can't be for everyone, and if you feel like you wasted a dollar so be it (waah-waah). But those that got this for free and complain about it, stfu....make a better game....and send it to me for free. Then you can show the obvious imperfections of this game and how to make them better while still being a fun game. K? thnx ;)
5238	1	a	played for 2 hours, got a lightsaber, did less damage than my knife. 10/10
4902	0	a	Im not sure what to say.   I got it for 1 dollar yet I still feel a little ripped off  you can still try it I guess  Maybe I played too little because I couldn't find anyone who would play
1483	1	a	So, I bought this for â¬0,24 when it was in a sale. And there are trading cards, so it is even cheaper than that. This game is a cartoonish-like puzzle platformer. It felt pretty easy, but there was quite a lot of music and many levels. Even some storyline! And all that for a few cent. Buy it already! (at least when its at sale)
4366	1	a	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268420288  ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA COMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1266	0	a	Boring, repetitive, waste of money
1634	1	a	OK i played in short time but I really recommend this game for all people who like killing each other or killing dinosaur.Overall,graphic are really damn nice and perfomance of this game is work well for me (I got steady 40-50 fps) which is good sign.Also its just 1 dollar guy,so come buy and support the developer~!!  Will look foward of what Spiral can do next...Goodluck
5483	1	a	It's fun and easy to get the hang of. And even if you don't like it, it's a dollar.
1445	1	a	Pretty good game
2224	1	a	The metascore is very misleading. Words cannot describe the fun I have had with this, I was very surprised with how good the game is.
153	1	a	We have to eliminate the infecteds. Military also have to eliminate the infecteds.  Can we join forces? No? â¥â¥â¥â¥ you then *pounds away*
3980	0	a	Bad overall
2277	1	a	Constantly fought the urge to yell 'SHOOOOOOOOT 'ER'. Enjoyed blasting tiny Compys with a magnum. Screamed in pain as my best friend was eaten by a Spinosaurus in slow motion. Got on Steam Sale for ~$1.49. 9/10
2545	1	a	Good Zombie game with friends. DLC's are cool but not nessicary. (If you are going to buy DLC's wait untill the go on sale, they go on sale offten.)
1090	1	a	' a gravity gun right out of Half-Life' not quite 'Despite its friendly art style, this is a hardcore platformer in the truest sense.' not quite. it's a casual time waster but it's okay not worth $5
2300	1	a	So much fun with a group of mates... especially when so cheap
6173	0	a	Wtf how can I write this review while I don't even own this game. Silly steam.
5926	0	a	This game I thought had a lot of promise when i got it as a gift but when i played it it was horrible. it always lags lots of errors and i can never get into a server.Should you buy it?NO Only if the developers fix this will it be a good game in my eyes.
4862	0	a	THIS GAME OMFG!!! THIS GAME FORCED ME TO MOVE MY HAND ON MY MOUSE AND CLICK BUY! IT COST ME Â£0.79 WHICH IS NOW GONE FROM MY ACCOUNT AND THAT IS Â£0.79 I WILL NEVER RECOVER! THERE IS A CHEESEY VOICE TELLING ME '2 DINOSAOWERS RIMEIN SNIKGDHM' HONESTLY... COULD THEY NOT AFFORD MORGAN FREEMAN TO VOICE OVER THIS. AND FINALLY, WHERE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS HARAMBE??!!!

745	0	a	Someone made this game completely at home. Voice-overs: Nails on chalkboard. Total $hit.
5614	1	a	this game is awsome the gameplay is great the game everything about it its awsome keep on what your doing guys keep it up
2623	1	a	Have you ever wanted to just go nuts on dinosaurs? What about going nuts with tons of weaponry including a sword, gatling gun, and auto pistols? What if the dinos your killing came in massive, unrelenting hoards made of many varying dino types? This game is for you if you answered yes to any of these questions. I myself bought the game not expeccting much besides a fiew hours (maybe) of shooting things. Instead i was met with DAYS of fun packed, dino killing action. This game touched down on my inner child of wanting to blow stuff up and shoot huge guns with crazy power, and also having aspects of cooperative play. I have only played the survival mode of this game because it was exactly what i was looking for, and look at how many hours i have gotten out of this game. Seriously, amazing fun.
2048	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a FPS that, at first sight, reminds one of Halo. It is class-based, with each class leveling up separately. Classes only dictate the special ability your character has, and you can switch them at any time between games. Assault has a jetpack, Recon can jump higher and has cloaking abilities, Support can heal and revive easier. You can further customize your experience by buying weapons in the match (there are some two-three dozen weapons) with credits earned from killing dinosaurs, and leveling up a certain class allows you to set some of those as starting weapons, removing the need to buy them. The weapons are pretty diverse; pistols, SMGs, different kinds of assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, there's even a lightsaber and a plasma bow. You can also use up your credits to buy Perks, improving your ability to fly (increase duration, speed, cut fuel recovery time in half etc.), walk faster, even give you lifesteal. There is also an abundance of game modes, around 7 if I recall correctly, and a variety of maps. Pros: +statisfying graphics with a range of weather effects +a lot of drastically different, big maps +vehicles and mechs +sound +a vast number of weapons +nicely done perks +a good number of achievements +a lightsaber-only free-for-all +the dev team actually listens to its fans +really worth it for 0.99â¬ Cons: -the classes kinda lack balance (in Survival, Assault is the only class worth using) -in need of a good tutorial -prone to exploits (set the Prehistoric difficulty to the max, so you get the most XP, pick Assault and fly on a rock, it's enough that you kill 4-5 dinosaurs and die to get insta level 15)  All in all, the game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun. If you intend on buying it, get a 4-pack and gift it to your friends and then play together. For 0.99â¬, I'd recommend this game to anyone.
5173	1	a	If Ed Wood were a game developer for our generation, this is what he would be remembered for and not Plan 9 From Outer Space
5322	0	a	It is a meh game. At first it is fun, but then it just becomes wave after wave of the same thing and it becomes boring. There is really only one good-ish game mode. I am glad that someone else got it for me at a 93% off promotion because it is not worth $15. I just can't reccommend this game. 4/10
4686	0	a	Meh, the game is O.K. i guess. If it kinda appeals to you, buy it. It's only 0.99$. But I wouldn't recommend it. I would rather spend 0.99 on a TF2 ticket. Right now it's just holding up space in my library. Kinda fun with friends.
2795	1	a	great game so much to do. GET IT!!! worth the dollar
2579	0	a	Played for 10 minutes...  NOPE
2497	1	a	Best $0.49 Lost simulator ever. 7/10  Seriously... its less than half a dollar. If it entertains you for 15 minutes, then you got your money's worth...
2480	1	a	Hillariously bad mechanics make this game a MUST for groups. You can vehicle surf on tires, or the car istelf, making turrents usless compared to rediculously overpowered guns. I and my 2 friends laugh and have a great time. The game mechanics suck horrendus â¥â¥â¥, but it's still fun.
811	1	a	Surprisingly an extremely fun game once you get past some of the control problems. Makes me want to buy the first one...
1148	1	a	There's a chapter where you have to stack two robot bodies in order to reach the exit. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing brutal. 10/10.
4035	1	a	Totally worth $1.50 Developers really polished up this game well.
4383	1	a	it is realy fun!! :) 
1752	1	a	I shot a guy in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a bolt action in rust to get this game.......so i guess its good............
6288	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing, just buy it, it is fantastic Its a dollar, don't be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ Shoot some dinosaurs, high five your bros and/or babes, there's a lightsaber  buy it
2939	0	a	Hands down one of the most boring games I have ever played. I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan 
2062	1	a	(Me): Goes with the recon class becasue of it's stealth ability on survival to repair the generator. (Friends): Goes every class apart from recon. Generator goes down, i stealth past all the dinos and repair it, stealth runs out.........get mauled by dinosaurs.....dies.......generator goes down again.......loses survival.........11/10 would go recon again.
6418	0	a	Dont be fooled by the cheapness of the game. Believe me its not worth the 1 dollar and GB on your computer. People are reviewing this game poorly for a reason and no amount of percentage off the $15 price is going to make it anymore value for money. The game feels like a mod, not an actually game made by a company. Play Killing Floor, as its much more ahead of the genre then this game is.
5894	1	a	I got it for .99$ and it was SOOOOOO worth the money. I'd spend anything south of 10$ on this game. Great laugh inspiring gameplay but, no real goal. Just mayhem. Great for friend games and honestly it can be fun with the right crowd. The online community is really good I just wish there was a single player mode.   5.5/10
4324	1	a	Everybody on the entire planet should get this game. Especially all my Steam friends.   STOP READING AND BUY IT!!!
788	1	a	Shank 2 its very good game, like shadows dancer, metal slug, final fight or other retro games but with more best graphics design,best game play.... very good time..so cool...so fun..
3315	1	a	Awsome value for money.this game is better than some $20 games. Dont doubt my playtime, this game is meant to be played in short bursts.
2936	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
5998	1	a	T-Rex ate my friend  I laughed from a safe distance Then the Rex threw a rock and killed me too  There is no safe distance
4071	0	a	I've got it 2012 for 10â¬... Yeah, I'd like a hug right now. :'(  Oh? My hours played? Yea. my steam bugged all the day, and back in 2012 the game didn't wanted to be closed. I mean, steam thought the game was open and counted the hours.  If you ever wanted to buy this game, do not. Spend that 1,00 for whatever you like. Some candys whatever. Get something food or water for it, idc, BUT, do something usefull with it.  You can thank me later. Cya
4272	1	a	Amazing game just cant wait till prelude 'Offically launches'
4467	1	a	Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs    taken up enough of this court's valuable time?    How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?    They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges    against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!    Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going    to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.    But you can't! We have a terrific case.    Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?    Show me the smoking gun!    Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?    Here is your smoking gun.    What is that?    It's a bee smoker!    What, this? This harmless little contraption?    This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.    Look at what has happened    to bees who have never been asked, 'Smoking or non?'    Is this what nature intended for us?    To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines    and man-made wooden slat work camps?    Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?    - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.    Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    Free the bees!    Free the bees! Free the bees!    The court finds in favor of the bees!    Vanessa, we won!    I knew you could do it! High-five!    Sorry.    I'm OK! You know what this means?    All the honey will finally belong to the bees.    Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.    This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.    You'll regret this.    Barry, how much honey is out there?    All right. One at a time.    Barry, who are you wearing?    My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.    - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?    We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.    Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?    First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.    Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,    every last drop.    We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more    than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.    We're all aware of what they do in the woods.    Wait for my signal.    Take him out.    He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.    And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...    But it's just a prance-about stage name!    ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products    and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.    Oan't breathe.    Bring it in, boys!    Hold it right there! Good.    Tap it.    Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!    - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.    Shut down honey production!    Stop making honey!    Turn your key, sir!    What do we do now?    Oannonball!    We're shutting honey production!    Mission abort.    Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.    Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.    Oh, yeah?    What's going on? Where is everybody?    - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.    They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.    I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.    At least we got our honey back.    Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?    It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.    This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.    And now...    Now I can't.    I don't understand why they're not happy.    I thought their lives would be better!    They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.    You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?    - What did you want to show me? - This.    What happened here?    That is not the half of it.    Oh, no. Oh, my.    They're all wilting.    Doesn't look very good, does it?    No.    And whose fault do you think that is?    You know, I'm gonna guess bees.    Bees?    Specifically, me.    I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.    It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.    That's our whole SAT test right there.    Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.    And then, of course...    The human species?    So if there's no more pollination,    it could all just go south here, couldn't it?    I know this is also partly my fault.    How about a suicide pact?    How do we do it?    - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.    Right, right.    Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.    I had to open my mouth and talk.    Vanessa?    Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?    To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.    They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.    It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.    Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.    I know. Me neither.    Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.    Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?    Roses!    Vanessa!    Roses?!    Barry?    - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.    Flowers, bees, pollen!    I know. That's why this is the last parade.    Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?    Oould you slow down?    Barry!    OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.    Yes, it kind of is.    I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you    with the flower shop. I've made it worse.    Actually, it's completely closed down.    I thought maybe you were remodeling.    But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.    I don't want to hear it!    All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.    I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.    All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.    - Bees. - Park.    - Pollen! - Flowers.    - Repollination! - Across the nation!    Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.    They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.    Security will be tight.    I have an idea.    Vanessa Bloome, FTD.    Official floral business. It's real.    Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.    Thank you. It was a gift.    Once inside, we just pick the right float.    How about The Princess and the Pea?    I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!    Yes, I got it.    - Where should I sit? - What are you?    - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?    It goes under the mattresses.    - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.    You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!    Let's see what this baby'll do.    Hey, what are you doing?!    Then all we do is blend in with traffic...    ...without arousing suspicion.    Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.    Stop! Security.    - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.    Has it been in your possession the entire time?    Would you remove your shoes?    - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.    I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.    Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.    Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!    I think this is gonna work.    It's got to work.    Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.    We have a bit of bad weather in New York.    It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.    Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.    I gotta get up there and talk to them.    Be careful.    Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?    I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.    Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.    - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.    Bee!    Don't freak
3773	1	a	If Bungee saw this, they would sue. 10/10
3774	0	a	I noticed a lot of other people said they were prompted with controller buttons on screen instead of keyboard when playing. I got the exact opposite. I had my controller plugged in and was prompted with keyboard options. So it sounds to me like this game is â¥â¥â¥ backwards and i'm not surprised because it sucks. A lot. Don't waste your time.
3943	1	a	Cheap/10
109	1	a	A GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY American with Ebola: 'I am growing stronger'
6440	1	a	Good to play but playing alone is difficult
5224	1	a	Perhaps the 3rd steam game i got.  Pros:  + The game costs $1 + Very unique gameplay + Dinosaurs  Inbetween pros and cons:  = Slightly confusing controls(there IS a lot of keys that it uses aswell) = No storyline  Cons:  - Gets boring after a while - Only good computers can run this game - I assume it has about 1 months worth of gameplay  Graphics: 8.5/10 Singleplayer experience: 8.5/10 Multiplayer experience(PvE): 9/10 Multiplayer experience(PvP): 7/10 Overall Rating: 9/10
1760	1	a	Great game with great graphics, especially for its price :)
2274	1	a	This game is poorly put together, somewhat unoptimized and pretty much looks like a game out of 2003... BUT I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love it, it is truely a turd of a game but it is a shiny turd. I really wouldn't be able to convince you to play this game if it was full price but when ever it goes on sale ever its so worth the pick up because I'm sure a few hours of mindless fun with friends isn't worth like $3 then what is?!  0/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN
5347	1	a	It has dinosaurs, more people should play this game. 10/10.
585	1	a	Quite a interesting and different game compared to alot that I own on steam. If anyone has ever played any of the Infamous games and enjoyed them, you will like this, has a similar feel to while not being the same.    The Story is quite interesting where it starts out towards the end, and alot of the game is basically you playing flash backs (although most if not all game is during those 'flashbacks') leading up to the 'beginning', and the end of the story.    Even when not playing missions, there are side activities to do that will help you obtain upgrade and have fun. Outside of those, there is still sandbox style fun to have throughout the city. In some ways, progressing through the story makes the game more fun (upgrades, new/more enemies), but at the same time some makes it a little less fun (Hunters all over, military uses more heavy hardware, less neutral zones.). The only thing that I did not like about the game, was the difficulty of the final boss. Overall a good game though.
6510	1	a	Best game to play with friends.
5819	0	a	It is a very laggy game (needs Improment (Fast) ) 
2142	1	a	Defenitely worth 1$. Imagine Halo and Jurassic Park mashed together and you get ORION: Prelude.  Pros: -Awesome gameplay -Only 1$!!?? -It has dinos and guns Cons: Needs a GOOD computer to run properly
2859	1	a	Pretty chill game. You slaughter hordes of dinos. It's a pretty typical survival, with wave after wave coming after you, though the number of waves is limited. It's worth it for the price (it's been having good sales) if you like the sort of thing. Also, brownie points for glorious dino-slaying!
1726	1	a	IF I COULD FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND HOW BUGGY THIS GAME IS, ID GLADLY DO SO... â¥â¥â¥ U SPIRAL U DIRTY â¥â¥â¥â¥ FUKS. I HONESTLY HOPE A METEORITE SMASHES WHATEVER â¥â¥â¥â¥ BOX U CREATE GAMES IN AND YOU DIE IN A ROCKY FIRE BLAZE. â¥â¥â¥â¥
1619	1	a	The game is a s#!t show. But a glorious, messy gooey dino s#!t show, a s#!t show that for a price of one dollar will give you a jetpack and rocket launcher, mechas, warplanes, massive maps and ptaradctyls. That is quite a lot for a s#!t show. Would you like to come to the s#!t show? I think you should. Now excuse me, as I go kill a triceratops.
2594	1	a	Oh this game is lagggy. but fun
6444	0	a	This game really looked exciting. Kind of like a cross between Left 4 Dead and dinosaurs. However, this game was very disapointing for me. It had bad graphics, slow online play, bad mechanics, and bad AI. With all the hype this game had it was a disapointing result.
3167	1	a	Everybody do the Dinosaur!   (you should also Walk the Dinosaur too, if you can... wouldnt want to get fatigued or anything,)  Really though, aside from the few imperfections, occasonal trolls, this game has VASTLY improved, and I highly reccomend it. Nothing is perfect.

180	1	a	10/10.
6388	1	a	A great and challenging game if you like dinosaurs, still way better than Ark
2245	1	a	I have lots of fun with this game. BUT it crashes when I do voice chat with some of my mates. But still great. 9.5 dead dinos! :D
908	1	a	Fun and crap.
6104	0	a	This game literally sucks. Objectives are stupid the graphics are awful and again and again the same dinosaurs
3592	1	a	Sorry fellow reviewers, but you're supposed to rate this game, and not whatever scandals can be happening with the studio behind it.  Simply put, for its price, Orion Prelude can be hours of fun with your friends, and can thus be considered a great game if your point in gaming is having fun.  There you go. Trek 9 might have done some shady/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ things, in the past and even currently, but this game is still the same game it was a year ago, and I recommend it.  1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale 3) Recommended  4) Highly recommended  5) This is a must play
2532	1	a	Vastly improved since release, originally titled ORION: Dino Beatdown. Don't let the Metacritic score fool you, this game is now a shadow of it's former terrible self. The constant updates and bugfixes have transformed this game from being a very bland and broken basic shooter, to a very fun co-op survival game. The amount of equipment, customization, and vehicles; combined with many months of simplifing the games UI, game mechanics, and constant bug fixes make the entire package a very fun way to play.  The sheer scale of battles, and the fast-paced combat make it fun. If you get a bunch of friends in on it, you'll be coordinating air strikes, tank movement, and infantry battles all in one wave. It's really something just to see two VTOL's fly above you and reign down missle fire, as two tanks flank from both sides... with troops pouring from either side, engaging a T-Rex which is more then enough to take out everything around it.  The AI has been vastly improved, as well. When the game first came out, you would have raptors blindly rush you in a straight line... and pterodactyls swooping in predictiable patterns. Now, the enemies juke and run around, the pterodactyls are hard to shoot and become the bane of any VTOL pilot. Granted, don't expect any amazing AI here, it's still a horde game and horde AI still crowns... but the game is challanging, even if you have the credits and augments to last. Underestimate a triceritops, and it'll destroy your tank in two hits with its charge attack.  In fact, the best way to describe the feeling while playing this game is like living the movie 'Avatar', but instead of Navi... you have face-ripping dinosaurs.  The game has vastly improved on bug fixes, graphics, and optimization since it came out, as well. No longer do you have memory leaks crashing your game, or textures failing to load. No longer does the game lag on high-end systems, and the graphics looking akin to a grainy mess on your screen, hidden by lens flare. The style, while still basic, has been vastly improved; comparable to the style of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Lots of high bloom space colors, lasers, and heavy weaponary... with vechicles that look as much retro as they do futuristic; this game feels right at home... combining a 'Rad' vibe, high-tech space, and a cheesy 'B' movie feeling. The environments are lush, and the maps are large and immersive. A day-time/night-time cycle affects your visibilty and shifts your gameplay. For example, while playing on a tundra map the cold air at night will cause your visor to freeze if you stay outside in the dark for too long, requiring you to find someplace warm. Rainstorms and snowstorms can also hamper your vision, giving the dinos a leg up to ambushes.  The games three classes (assault, support, and infiltrator) have gotten a major upgrade since launch. No longer is the medic gun useless on the support toon... and no longer does the assault dominate maps. The classes seem very balanced, having their own weapons and play styles. An augment system is also in place, which allows you to purchase in-game upgrades with in-game credits you earn per round... allowing you to gain class specific upgrades like double jetpack energy for the assault, or that the support's medic gun can heal structures and vechicles. Later augments will even allow you to purchase and use other class specific weapons, like being a 'boost-sniper' assault... or being a cloaked minigun assassin; as well as having the ability to canabalize raptors for health, earn more credits, or even cause the enemy who kills you to die as well. However, augments arn't permanent... and during rounds you have a finite amount of lives. Not only does dying during a wave cost you a life, but you loose all your augments that you've purchased; giving a larger penalty to death then most games do.  This game has the standard assortament of game modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill; along with having duel modes for both 1v1 and team. The standard horde mode exists as well, called 'survival'... but the meat and potatoes of this game is in it's conquest system, which will allow you to experience those large battles that you see on the screenshots. Players have to fight through waves of enemies, generating credits and protecting their power generator, then use those credits for upgrade, equipment, and vehicles. There's also a 'Rampage' mode that allows humans versus human dinosaurs... so you can live your dream of being a T-Rex and eating people.  The game also features an in-game store with microtransactions, using Spiral Coins:  1,000 Coins - $1.00 6,000 Coins - $5.00 13,000 Coins - $10.00 75,000 Coins - $50.00  Thankfully, this store is PURELY cosmetic with most items costing $1 dollar. No xp boosts, or in-game upgrades... the most you can purchase are hats and skins for your marine or dino. At most, I can see just spending a max of 6,000 coins to get a character the way you want him to look, unless you want to go deeper with customization.  The game also has persistant stat tracking and a levelling system, however the system is very static... only unlocking set upgrades per each level.  The few things I can say bad about this game is that the maps and waves in conquest mode still seem too large. Gathering your entire army to move from base A to base B after you've spent 10 waves defending base A really doesn't make you feel like that base is 'yours'. Also, some weapons are more overpowered than others; and some items aren't that useful to invest your time into (IMHO, the flame turret). On top of that, dinos tend to 'pop in' if they're too far away... making a hunt for a large dino that you can idenifty close by a bit harder to locate. Also, the populations for game modes seem to be a bit low in my taste, with conquest allowing up to 5 people per server. Other modes have different population caps, but overall it feels small. The menu UI structure also is a bit hard to get used to... with the whole menu UI coming off a bit cheap. Granted, the old menu system from two years ago was DREADFUL, and this is an improvement... it's still not up to par with most games.  However, these are nitpicks for a game that really has been risen from the ashes of it's former self. The developers are very active in the games future, and this game does have the love and dedication of a passion project come to life. There's constant free updates to this game, and new features being added all the time; as well as having the team be very approchable with ideas and suggestions. With the changes I've seen with the past two years... and (at the time of writing) a new version of the game in development which will expand on this game, allowing for new features... including a persistant open-world game mode, ala Planetside 2... I can safely say that this game has a bright future.  If you had met me two years ago and asked about this game, I would have told you to never play it... to stear clear, and forget about it... If you had bought it, to try and ask for a refund.  Nowadays, I'd be asking if you wanna buddy up and kill some dino's in a APC. It's improved that much, and I'd be MORE than willing to give it a recommendation. It's cheap, it's fun, it's OOZING with Sci-Fi goodness, and there arn't many games out there like it.
3688	0	a	Not sure what I expected for so little money.....but I do know I never expected cancer concentrate
5989	1	a	It's a little glitchy, but nothing a good update can't fix. Really fun FPS and great for the yonger crowd.
254	1	a	If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it, get a job. If you don't have a job, rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.

5506	1	a	can't go wrong for 99 cents. lots of fun to be had here 
3481	0	a	rubbish even for a free game!!
114	1	a	A great free-roam game, Able to jump buildings and completely obliterate the military. Having evolution points to spend on power upgrades and trying to combine them to a combo is what makes this game interesting. There are also checkpoints where you can go and do some mini-games. The game does get repetitive or rather boring when you keep doing the same thing which is getting chased by the military on the same town (If you provoke them). The story on the other hand is really something, we get to see Mercer being known as the victim through all this when in the end that is not entirely true. Won't go to details but i really got somewhat hooked to the story.  Heard alot about the port on this game, and i have to say they are not unfixable. So i recommend to not take curator 'PC Port Info's' review lightly. Although there are things wrong, it works great with my AMD Radeon 7970, The Audio can be fixed also by changing the Sample rate of your speakers to 48000 or 44100. Only thing is that you can't put it in windows mode.  
5558	1	a	I don't play this game. Why do i have this? I looks okay... i think           Nah not really
932	1	a	The original Shank and Shank 2 are fundamentally the same game. You will be doing the same combos with the same weapons on the same enemies.   They did add some fun tidbits such as weapons enemies drop that you can then pick up and beat other enemies with. Some of those weapons are insanely powerfull which only adds to the fun. However, I did not find myself using most of weaker pickups because the gameâs balance was more focused on Shankâs default weapons so you cannot combo as well or as quick.  Bosses are considerably more enjoyable than the original Shank. While they are fundamentally repetitive, they feel challenging. Add that to the bosses are no longer tanking you with their health pool and you have a very enjoyable experience that will leave you screaming at your screen with excitement.  Another definite positive is enemy animations. Though it might be unimportant to game play, it defiantly adds to atmosphere. After a brutally insane and satisfying combo, it is fun to watch your beaten enemies roll around on fire or with limbs missing.  However the biggest negative is the story. If the story was bad in the first Shank, it is even worse in Shank 2. The story seems to have no point what so ever and you will find yourself wishing it was not there. The ability to skip cut scenes is the greatest thing I could hope for while playing Shank 2.
6466	0	a	this game could be a great ps1 game in 1998, other than that, its not worth a dollar
110	1	a	I probably would say this is one of my fav games. So glad I bought this. If you're able to wait till it's on sale (Like it is now). Then I would do so. But I probably would spend the $20 on the game even if it's not on sale. The story is amazing and fun. I got nothen else to say but just to play xd 10/10
471	1	a	I love Prototype. So much fun. 9/10
5363	0	a	Thank god I only lost $1.30 on this game. It's cheesy in all the wrong ways, so much so that only a 5 year old boy with devolpmental issues wouldn't find the cliches grating. 0/10  Even on the lowest settings the game is prone to crashing and hiccuping frequently. Too much time to jacking to leaf textures and not enough time actually putting some thought into the game. I wouldn't recommend this to even stalin.
3194	1	a	killed dinosaurs with guns found out melee did 2000 dmg what is guns
5877	1	a	I wish all game developers were this devoted to their games.
76	1	a	My first and favourite was Space Quest 3, still loving it today.
2988	1	a	LOL nice and cool game ever seen in my whole life :D
4095	1	a	Truly stunning. Great game I deffentaly suggest it. Worth the money
1243	1	a	Platform. Walk, jump, shoot stuff with weird balls. Fly sometimes. Nice game to play while you wait for dinner to be ready, if you get it for less than 1â¬.
4100	0	a	I played it for 30 minutes it was okay glitchy but okay, later I turned the game off and now as soon as I start the game it won't boot it just stays running and now I can't get my refund :)
890	1	a	Play this if you just want to have some senseless violence
1154	1	a	Great Game
4104	1	a	really good game. it helps alot of people. it helped amanda todd find bleach. (the anime)
3109	1	a	Sniping from atop a vtol, that my friend is piloting, with a gatlin gun is how i spend most of my time playing......i have a 42% overall accuracy with said weapon.  I bought the game for a dollar.....totally worth full price just saying.
4015	0	a	.
521	1	a	The story is kind of clichÃ©, but the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, very rewarding and fun.  I played this game with a 360 controller and my index fingers were seriously hurting near the end of the game hahaha
5451	1	a	is rly good
6236	1	a	0.99 $ for this. Just get it and see what u can get for only 1 dollar this game is atleast worth 15.
2755	1	a	Not a big shooter fan personally, but O:Pre brings out the best of the few that I happen to like: Halo, Gears of War, and Tribes (ah Tribes I remember when you were king!). Haters gonna hate, but I find this game intuitive, engaging, and addictive! Now if I could just get a better set up so I could enjoy it to it's fullest with better graphics.
3391	1	a	3
2493	0	a	I think this could have been a real hit had they just made a few simple changes to the gameplay, but as it stands it's a miserable game that really just doesn't make any sense. The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous and itâs badly executed too. I have to confess that when I played the game it was riddled with bugs, so it may have improved by the time you read this, but I am afraid I just can't recommend it at all.
3540	0	a	This game is like a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, fun for 20 minutes but it gives you a disease after you play with it. Would not recommend.
4785	1	a	Remember that this was $1? Now don't waste a dollar for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ :D
3662	0	a	'Mostly Postive'  This statement is obviously manipulated. Yeah for a $1 sure, buy it.  ***There are TONS of reviews claiming the game is bad, but give a thumbs up anyway...hmmm***  Quite possibly the worst game ever created, or offered via Steam.  I am sure to be burned at the stake for this from the devs/marketers.  1. Horde Survival - Dinosaurs come at the players on a STRAIGHT PATH in groups riding choppy animations and an absolute lack of AI. 'B-Line to you and chomp.'  2. Art design is crap. Objects look painted like Supreme Commander up close, nothing seems to have a cohesive theme with any other items within game, everything LOOKS like someone plopped down objects in Garry's Mod and went 'Yep thats Half-Life 3.'  3. Terrible movement, maps are MASSIVE to the point of not fun. Games go on forever. Vehicles are cheap and clunky. It honestly looks like bad engine demo.  Can anyone tell me why it's trying to look like Halo?
5771	1	a	halo feel to it. its great
3104	1	a	This game is great to play with friends. It's a combination of Halo and Dinosaurs and some other stuff. What more could you want from an FPS?
3251	1	a	Killing dinosaurs in waves, while purchasing weapon upgrades and augmentations in between. With friends, this is GREAT.  HOW is it GREAT?  Well, I was playing with two other friends. We spotted a vehicle that reminds me of the warthog from the Halo series, with driver, passenger, and gunner seats. I drove. What's great about the vehicles is that you can hold right-click and enter first-person mode. Reminds me of Halo: Combat Evolved.  Anyways, I was running over any dino in front of me, the gunner focused on the big dino near the area, and the passenger keeping the flying dinos away from us.  I had the brilliant idea of running into the giant dino. As I did, we flipped out into the air and nearly died. But we lived.  GREAT GAME.
2476	1	a	I was first skeptical cause of the metascore. But like the other reviewers say, Orion: Dino Horde is actually pretty fun even though it still has its kinks. First time playing it I crapped my pants trying to escape a T-Rex. The game offers tons of customization and weapons, like Killing Floor. But in this case, substitute mutant freaks with flesh eating dinosaurs. I wasn't expecting to be carried off by a Pteranodon either. In all, great game, great updates so far. keep em coming!
798	1	a	A good game, improves on the predecessor on all aspects except maybe the campaign is still short, also is less frustrating than the first one on hard difficulty! Rating: âââââ
2003	1	a	Hours of fun ,Buy a four pack for yourself and your mates
2911	0	a	Glitchy and unfinished. Elements taken out of flash games. No story and terrible voice acting. Horrible graphics. Perfect game 11/10.
5943	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
6101	1	a	Dinosaurs, jetpacks, guns, Redikulous cosmedics...  What's not to love?    Actual Review
6354	1	a	Great game for a great price! Lots of fun when playing multiplayer. 8/10
5479	1	a	For the price, the game offers many hours of enjoyment.
6421	1	a	6.5/10  The game's concept and everything is great, but there is way too much lag. I had 70-85 ping most matches, but I lag like crazy when the waves start. The sniper, thanks, mechs, and such are un-usable due to the amount of lag and the dinosaurs seem to be moon walking. The single player is very fun, but the multi-player is meh... needs to have smoother gameplay (a.k.a fix the lag)  I'd say still buy the game and try it out (since it's pretty cheap), but don't get too disappointed when you start to lag like crazy in multi-player games.   (To be honest, for a game that's mostly based on multiplayer, it's pretty lacking when you consider how laggy it can get.)
2364	0	a	Do not ever ever ever buy this... the fact it is in the flash sale proves the incompetency of steam in gettting rid of decietful, horrible games.... next game is going to claim to cure cancer
156	1	a	great game. good cliche story. definitly reccomend it.
1790	0	a	this game is awfull at the end of every round you fix your generator and buy new guns you cant get new guns unless you fix the generator up abd you end up fight hordes of dinos with a teir 1 pistol! its garbage dont install or buy
4827	0	a	Making this free2play is a problem
158	1	a	Prototype WAS a game like no other, and is still the original game it was in 2009.
1647	0	a	Just don't buy this game.  Why? Not because of the CoD weapon copy situation that is happening. But because this game is just boring. The enemies run straight up to you and do the attack move thing, and this game doesn't add anything new that makes me enjoy this game.  I've played it once, and the next day the game just doesn't want to start up. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥...   I wish I didn't buy this game.
5340	1	a	this game is A+
4922	0	a	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Boring from the head start. Didn't even finish one single game.
48	1	a	If you love classic games, then this is perfect. I grew up with this game series and I must say its one of the best series I have ever had the honor to play.
3968	1	a	this game is good
791	1	a	Pros  * Great gameplay, tight controls. * Tons of enemy and weapon variety. * Really satisfying combat, very meaty, natural and robust. * Really hard, start in normal difficulty.  Cons  * Checkpoints are few and far between, it's very frustrating to have to replay the last 20 minutes because you died near the end of the level. Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss. * The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total). It sucks because it often means you have to kill the boss without the often much needed help from grenades/mines/molotov, especially in hard mode.
2463	1	a	Great game! For 99 cents this game is a must buy! It has a great storyline, wonderful graphics, and is always a great time with friends or by yourself. this game is possibly one of the best on steam! 11/10 Would participate in the greatest dino beatdown of the century.
3150	1	a	Chased across the map by a Trex. 10/10
4252	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
2524	1	a	Cool game, nice weapon and vehicles, as you can see playing it the programmer worked so hard! Recomned!
4021	1	a	Got headbutted by a T-Rex so hard that my Tank exploded. As I flew through the air dead I picked off another Dino, came back to life, and jetpacked up shotgunning Pterodactyls as I flew up. I then got mauled to death by a pack of Tiny Dinos that I couldn't hit. My only hope is that Jurrassic Park 4 is as good as this game.  TLDR;  10/10 would cause Extinction again
525	1	a	This game is an epic kill-everything-you-see sandbox game, with one problem - if you have a GTX 680 then the game won't properly detect it and you'll be limited to 1200x800. I've emailed nVidia about this as it's a driver thing probably but we'll see.
5615	1	a	This is so addicting especially if you have friends and the Graphics are bearable. Again the gameplay of shooting dinosaurs and the guns are awesome!  Positives: EXTREMELY CHEAP!!!! $1.19NZD and $0.75USD Nice graphics(Unreal Engine 3, I think) Fun gameplay Great gun selection Easy and quick movement 3 balanced classes(Assault-JetPack, Medic-Medigun, Recon-Cloak Device) Good and easy server selection AI is good and bearable(ACTUALLY)  Negatives: Huge terrains/maps; so big and takes a while to get across but creative Some glitchy AI spawns Some server lag but once in your good  Overall: 9/10 due to some bugs
1050	0	a	This game is fun, but until they actually do something about the aweful coding, dont buy it OR get it on consoll, it's hardly doable on pc as it is now, I have sent them an e-mail about this but they dont seem to care...do we really wanna support such bad service?
5607	1	a	A nice combination of dinosaurs and fps
5807	1	a	This game is what Evolve should have been. The controls are tight, the gunplay is satisfying (even though some guns sound like Nerf guns,) and the graphics are great. Pretty much, if you liked Killing Floor or Dino D Day, this game is for you.
5799	1	a	10/10 never used R$2,19 so well
6256	1	a	Buy this game now.
463	1	a	Game play is very well. And overpower.â¥â¥
4681	0	a	terrible isay terrible game terrible i say who lieks dino's people that like dino's are IDIOTIC dino's suc k my â¥â¥â¥â¥
954	1	a	The art style and gameplay is just amazing. I love it so far, very action-packed, good platformer. Good job Klei!
2073	1	a	Great game but I think the devs could have just kept on improving this game (like optimization) instead of making a new sequel. However, I got to hand it to them for making such an impressive comeback of this game. Especially fun with friends.
2025	1	a	It's 99 cents for what would be the equivalent of a 15$+ game. (though I probably wouldn't have bought it or tried it out then.) I didn't expect much at first, but fact of the matter is the game is pretty damn good.  There are many servers in the lobby, and if needed you can start your own. The game itself has enough enemies to keep it interesting, and graphics-wise is just good enough. The gameplay is such that teamwork is more or less encouraged, though there's still competition at times over the various vehicles and machines that can be found across the map.  The game is just fun overall. I have a minor complaint (which is probably noobish) about the player GUI and being unsure where the healthbar is, but apart from that I think it's a pretty solid package for 0.99$, and more than worth the price. Additionally, the community seems nice. That's always an added bonus.
1728	1	a	At first, this is a game you'll hate a lot, but as I found out, it quickly gets to be more fun as you invest time into it. Animations are, pretty sub par, and there are some questionable bugs in the game that break it, and, it's soundtrack is forgettable. But ignoring those features to the basic bits, you've got a game built around co-op that has a competitive feature. The co-op includes the 3 classes where each one contributes to the game in a major way. Recons eliminate dinos and do stealthy revives/repairs on the generator. Supports are the only class that can heal anyone on the team, as well as tanking with their beefy life. Assault, well, it's pretty basic, he goes places fast and kills things fast. Competitive allows the player to play as the dinosaurs too, which is actually kind of fun, though I must say I haven't had much experince in that department.  Overall, all I can say is, you get a pretty good laugh and great feeling after you punch a T-rex in the face and either A. Kill it, or B. It eats you and regains life.  7.5-8/10 It does need work, but hell, it makes you laugh and it has a good core.
5632	1	a	Seriously? $1.00? Can't go wrong with this one!
1467	1	a	Although it's cheap tag, it's surprisingly well made from the fluidness, game mechanic, level design, control, and even the dinamic music. It's worth the full price, very recomended (y)
285	1	a	Decent game on its own but feels like a mediocre Infamous knock-off. Some really wierd UI decisions -'Are you sure you want to load this save file' !!!  Combat gets repetetive despite lots of possible combos. No story buildup or attachment to the charectars.  Probably not worth the $20 but a good pick up on sale.
3257	0	a	Don't buy it even for a dollar. This game is bad and it doesn't improve at all. Occasionally game title changes; what will the fourth one, i wonder?  I'd like to make summarized cons and pros section for this review like most of my reviews but unfortunately i can't. Don't waste your time and money. Buy a cosmetic DLC, TF2/CSGO weapons, $1 valued bundle or just buy a snack for yourself. Just avoid this abomination.
5899	1	a	Entertaining and fun with friends :D
3438	1	a	I really like this game...its retro and fun and i can play with or without friends...good game just to have a change of scenery
5275	1	a	So much co op fun ignore the meta score!
140	1	a	I used to love playing the inFAMOUS games on PS3 and would play them over and over, mixing and matching decisions and powers, and just running all over the world. The Prototype series is a lot like inFAMOUS, except there aren't any decisions you make that make your gameplay experience any different. Still has awesome powers, vehicle jacking, and open-world hack n' slash feel. If you like open world superpower games, Prototype is perfect for you.
1736	1	a	I don't know what's so satisfying about an FPS with temporary and permanent upgrades that's all about killing dinosaurs but I love it. The music is repetative as hell but catchy, it'll be the only thing you might not like and will probably turn off or at least lower it, it's pretty much most the sound. If you haven't seen this game, it has a Kickstater called the Orion project and they plan on making this game an entire precedural universe with story and such. I can't wait for that, I bought this on a Steam sale way before I heard about that and I'm glad I did. I can only run this beasty in 720p or my 440GT takes a duece but that just shows that it wants to have more graphical power. The game runs gorgeously with dynamic lighting and has amazing textures. I wish I had a better videocard.
989	0	a	It's a fun game but the EA login killed it for me. It doesn't remember my account and have to recover password every time because it doesn't accept my credentials.
4550	0	a	This game makes practically no sense You're dropped into a world and told to shoot dinosuars A bunch of weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ has happened to me in my playtime. I have;  -Been buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed by pterodactyls -Been eaten by a T-Rex, in which I sat in its stomach while in the first person view as it boomed around, stomping on my teamates while it was having a temper tantrum -Recieved enough credits to start buying stuff I actually needed and gotten kicked from the game due to a supposed 'Error with my internet' -Met a lot of friendly people who shared their knowledge of the game openly and honestly (I'm not joking, the community is really friendly) -Played games that never ended -Played games that ended quickly -Gotten negative credits (my record was -12) -Been pushed off of a cliff to my doom by a stegosaurus -Revived a team mate while I was incapacitated -Been blinded by the stupid HUD freezing mechanic -Lagged to the point where everyone was still playing the game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ but I couldn't damage the dinos or even use any ammo in my gun  Overall, it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. But the potential it has is amazing... It just needs polish. Then it won't be â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Oh yeah, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ pterodactyls. Most overpowered â¥â¥â¥â¥ since ACR/noobtube/scavenger combo.
723	1	a	Runespell Overture is essentially and turn-based RPG with a poker-hand-based combat system. You create combinations with cards that you draw to deal damage or heal. The graphics are good for an independant title, but the game has a lackluster plot and is extremely short (only 3 or 4 hours of gameplay). If you enjoy playing poker, have a love for turn-based combat or have small children who like card games, then you may find this title entertaining for a few hours. Wait for a deep price discount, otherwise you may feel you overpaid for this title.
2170	1	a	Is quite fun. Sort of like TF2 (upgrade stations, classes, etc) but with Dinosaurs and vehicles.  The Metacritic score is incorrect, it is for the first (and terrible) version of the game. The updated game that you would purchace now is much better, is probably a 70 or 80.  Graphics are good, it isn't the best use of Unreal Engine I have seen, but it isn't the worst. Be prepared for this game to have performance issues on lower (embedded) graphics.  I tend to stay away from the Player v Player game modes, as the co-op 'kill all the dinosaurs' is much more fun.   Its good to see the developers paying attention to the game, and to get the 'Prelude' upgrade and other DLC for free. Worth buying in the Summer Sale.
389	0	a	Bored... :( ... Timepass Game
4761	0	a	this is more disapointing than my son
6199	1	a	I got it for free
4659	1	a	Most broken game I've ever played but this game is so broken that it's good. It's like eating sushi from a 711 but something in the sushi makes you forget show â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it tastes so you keep eating it. Glitches and broken mechanics usually ruin a game but not this one. This game is so bad that it's good.
2571	1	a	Love it
4194	1	a	This game Good but I want more Vehicles  
1365	0	a	this game is butt
2399	1	a	Team left me to fight a T-Rex all alone? 10/10 - will be abandoned again.
833	1	a	This game is awesome. Test yourself to see if you like it. One point for every question you answer with yes: Do you like 2d scrollers? Do you like monstrous combo moves? Do you like a good story?  1. You may or may like this 2. You will probably like this 3. You need this game 4+ Stop cheating. This is why we can't have nice things!
2318	1	a	Super fun. You can be a T-Rex. Or get eaten by one. 9001/10 would get my face eaten again.
2907	1	a	You get to learn about some pre-historic dinosaurs! Your knowledge has improved 10 folds. 10/10
6509	1	a	This game is one of the games, with a replay factor. Good for LAN's and with friends. Really love it and think it is worth supporting the Spiral team. If the Orion: Prelude Kickstarter is going in this direction, i will definetly buy it as well.
6021	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHspCZRla-0  - Even though I haven't played that much of this game, It's so good and probably one of the best games to play and at such a cheap price. I want my money back plus more because this game is so fun. It's a part of the government or sent by aliens.
5215	1	a	i dont understand anything/10
4181	1	a	I would recommend this game for anyone on a budget whom needs a fun game to last them a while. It's really just a fun, relaxing kill'em all type of game.  Can't go wrong for a Dollar!
2427	0	a	This game is funny for about 10 minutes and then you realize that it's awful and don't ever play it again. It's like trying to watch a movie that you think is funny-bad and just realize that it's bad-bad.
4335	1	a	i have the game and my game is lagy and the mous and the keybord is really werde and thats it 
3512	0	a	Not good, shady practices, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was only 49 cents!
3312	1	a	This game actually kind of rules. The metacritic score is outdated and wrong. This game has quite a few bugs and general lack of polish, but there are no game-breaking or even game-delaying bugs. If you can see past the shoddy UI and overall presentation, you'll find that co-op dino killin' is really fun. The core gameplay is actually done quite well. It could use some more dino types and better balance, but aside from that everything is spot-on and highly entertaining.
1046	1	a	This is a fun little game, and the bonus of getting it on sale makes it worth having. Really adorable concept, if the idea of blowing up bad guys from the inside can be referred to as 'adorable'. I'd pick it up, you can't beat 7-10hrs of entertainment for $2.50 (especially when a movie costs like $8).
5835	1	a	This game is fantastic. Once you get past the first few hours of just reveling in the ridiculousness that is this game (like slaying a TRex with what is essentially a lightsaber), you realize that this game can actually be really difficult and requires top-notch co-op skills. 20/10 would buy.
6123	1	a	If you don't buy this game, you're probably a dino. And we do bad things to dinos so you better change your mind about buying the game.
349	0	a	This game was a mess. The controls were really touchy and the lockon system was completely counter-intuitive and made it almost impossible to lockon the the target you really wantedmaking it feel like you pushed the buttons first then crossed your fingers and hoped your character moved the right way. The main character's powers were mediocre when used in battle, it was better to just steal enemy weapons and vehicles to fight with giving the feeling that his powers were more why he was hunted than what made him cool. The characters were unrelatable and the story , while it had a good premise, felt poorly executed. Add on that a half-dozen of the side quests were broken in an amazingly frustrating fashion and I have to say I'm suprised I finished the game at all.
5374	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you are looking for a co-op game for you and some friends I advise you give this a try. Don't listen to the reviews from 2012 they don't apply to this game anymore, it has came a long way. For the price it's at you can't be disappointed. 
2442	1	a	its fun, still has some glossing that needs to be done, but definately worth the play
6178	1	a	I don't know what to do. I'm addicted to this game. I play 8 hours a day, and I've been fired from my job because of it. My girlfriend left me even after being engaged from my addiction, because the game would get me so frustrated I would take it out on her. I have 1600 hours in Orion combined from my alts, from less than 6 months.Everytime I finish an Orion game, win or not, I tear up a little at myself and cry or grieve my life as it is right now. I have no more friends, the only friends that I had hate me now because of how I act during Orion and how seriously I take it, wasting my life on it. I celebrated Christmas alone this year, as my mother and father reject me in favor of my more successful siblings who have also rejected me. I have a Master's Degree in Engineering from MIT, and I'm sitting at home, playing Orion and weeping of the things I lost.
1449	1	a	A fun and difficult platformer, I'd definately recomment this! Of course, sometimes using the enemies as platforms is sometimes frustrating. My only real gripe is that there is no sequel. Not because of how fun it is, but because of how the game ended. The ending suggested a sequel to the game, where we go to the Creeps home planet. The game was released in 2011, and there is no sequel. Big Fat Alien, you get to work with that. For what it is though, it's a pretty fun game, and it's only $2.
4012	1	a	Great game for only $0.99
1877	0	a	Graphics 4 out of 10 In-game sounds 3 out of 10 Gameplay 6 out of 10 Story N/A Multiplayer 6 out of 10 Price-quality 8 out of 10  Summary-The game is really worth 1$ but don't expect anything fancy.It's poorly optimised and has bugs.It only has multiplayer function.
584	1	a	One of the most underrated 'superhero' games out there. Its the first of the series so don't expect anything too groundbreaking in terms of gameplay mechanics (The second game is even better). Good chaotic combat, gory carnage, lengthy exploration, albeit with a weak overall narrative despite an interesting lore supplemented by the comics. Prototype is a 7.5/10.
6573	0	a	This is very good game,I played and i like it
2844	1	a	At first I was sceptical, then i decided ''Why not?'' And bought the game for 99cents... Best 99 cent spend ever!!! Really amazing graphics and dinosaur precision... Definiatly check it out! Awesome weapons and team work.. Also Sweet Vehicals for you to have fun with.. Running over Raptors is the best!!!!
4045	1	a	It's like Skyrim without dragons plus dino's and guns! 8/8 m8
2982	1	a	Sure, it has a few rough edges, and some of the models' animations are lulzy/'incomplete' but that doesn't make the gameplay any less fun after you get through the initial setup's verifying of the game cache. Cause lets face it... Halo Reach + Dinosaurs = Fun.
2041	1	a	bought this game a year ago got aids  played this game today didn't get aids  7.8/10- needs more water
2550	1	a	Spent the entirety of a game running over small dinosaurs in a car with 'Get it on the floor' by DMX playing in the background.  10/10
796	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! Mark of the Ninja without stealth, this Commando-esque game is worth every penny. Very fun and challenging at times, just like Mark of the Ninja is. The creators have really shown their talent with this game. Get this game!!
4103	1	a	Lot of fun with friends 8.5/10
3947	0	a	It was said to be a bad game, and it improved over the time. Better graphics and such. But i still think the graphics suck( I have it at max everthing for graphics) FPS sucks ( Turned everything to the minimum for this, and I have a very good pc) So, I belive in my perspective that this game still sucks.
5839	1	a	if i had to sum this game up in 1 sentance it would be: Halo meets dinosaurs!   I paid just over 1 dollar for this game and you get:  +cool abilities to use  +a nice selection of weapons  +vehicles that highly resemble the ones from Halo  +some of the maps are quite large, while others may be cartoon-based +getting tired of killing dinos? try your luck against Robot Santa (thats right!), or hell you can BE any dino in this game! +There is a great selection of game modes to choose from...  +Lightsabres! (lets not kid ourselves) +teleporters!  whats not to like about it? if i had to say.... -there is NO tutorial or story -no detail of game mode, unless you are starting your own game -slightly buggy dinos sometimes (stuck way off in the middle of nowhere)  BUT! im just being picky there none of those things caused any issues for my enjoyment of this game! if you have a spare buck in your account and are tyring to avoid lemons, just buy this game, it was my first spare buck i spent on steam and i dont regret it at all! Dino surfing and punching T-rexes in the face is awsome!
596	1	a	Even though the story is generic and the graphics are not that great this game is freaking amazing, great gameplay, one of the best open world that you can have fun just by running and gliding and the powers are amazing. The only problem that I have with the gameplay is that there are 2 o 3 moments where the difficulty spike is brutal but you can easily recover because Alex is practically immortal.
4481	1	a	At first sight, this game appears to be lackluster and unpolished. Do not be fooled by the games subpar visual treatment. It is jam-packed with multiple gamemodes,player customization, and a plethora of weapons to annihilate the dino fiends! The content in this game is what games today are lacking and should focus on rather than the eye candy made to appease the mass of 'seeing is believing' gamers that exist more today than ever in the gaming world! This game is a combination of Halo,Dead space,Borderlands 2, as well as league of legends, and I have never seen a better mash-up than ever before!
4106	0	a	is a bs game was tricked into buying the game. it was on sale for a dollar when the main price was 15.99 so i was like cool what a deal bought the four pack and the next day it was 1.99 all the time, would never have bought this game if it would have been a dollar all the time was looking forward it being 15.99 so i could trade it on cs lounge or use it to my advantagfe at a later date but the game bombed and was a scam as soon as it was put to 1.99.
3629	0	a	99 cents for a game! Yes please!  Oh wait, no. This game sucks.
3831	0	a	Ugly. Awful. Bad gameplay. Waste of time. Sorry I gave this game a shot and it's just bad. Looks cool and fun at first however it's not.
1587	1	a	Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.  A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.  Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.  While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.  Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least. 
3466	1	a	I liked this game better when it first came out and I still think they shouldve stuck with what it was but its still fun to this day and now you can switch back to the old way of playing the game!
3811	1	a	i bought the game when it was 5 or 10 EURO :(
5612	1	a	great game
1348	1	a	I just bought this game on sale to get some profit. (Y)
1143	1	a	It's regularly on sale for $0.49 and while it's short it's worth way more than the asking price.
3147	1	a	I wouldn't exactly call this game 'good,' but it's 99 cents, and it's pretty fun to just â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with the iron blade or fly around in a plane with a group of good friends and just have a good time.
3628	1	a	You can turn invisible and knife raptors, 10/10
1869	0	a	The graphics are low texture, the AI is buggy as crap and there are a bunch of features that don't work properly. It's fun with friends but you'd be better off playing killing floor for an evening.
3239	0	a	This...game....is...â¥â¥â¥â¥! Do not buy it! It used to be called ORION: Dino Beatdown. Terra-bad game. Bought it when it was said title..
4842	0	a	American Servers only. So pretty much sucks for the whole world unless you can deal with 300+ ping
4056	1	a	for a 1$ its worth it , i have fun with this as much as i do with killing floor. 'which is a time waster game when your bored' this isnt a game you play for 4 hour straight , but a hour of fun once and a while is fine, just like killing floor
3317	1	a	My friend could buy 260 copies of ORION Prelude by selling his csgo knife. 10/10 IGN
5865	1	a	Jurassic Park meets Borderlands.  You and your friends grab some sci-fi guns and jetpacks and shoot a bunch of dinosaurs. Or you and your friends are dinosaurs and you eat people with sci-fi guns and jetpacks. If that doesn't sound fun, consult your doctor because there's something seriously wrong with you.  And it's only a dollar! There do appear to be optional transactions in the game's 'store' menu, but it's only for cosmetic items and stuff like that. As far as I can see this game is NOT 'pay to win.' One dollar; tons of fun.
6305	1	a	Realy fun game, expecialy for that price!
1597	1	a	 Great value for money
6560	0	a	Lags, frame drops, black screen, crashes, sound skipping. And dinosaurs. 30 euro? Are you crazy? This is hardly a beta, I'd say it's an alpha edition, not a final product. Yup, my PC meets the minimal technical requirements.  I do NOT recommend that you buy this game.
4159	0	a	Ai is awful, the dinosaurs get stuck on walls. the graphics are on par with an xbox game (no, not a 360, before that) circa red faction 2 era. for all its supposed to tout, the videos make the game look 10 times better. save your dollar. this simply is NOT worth it. even if they give it away for free, still not worth it. so many other interesting games you could play, even free ones. this game is flat, boring and brings NOTHING new to an FPS genre. this game will make you think of what a freshman high school student would show as a computer science project. if you think i feel hurt, i am. i didnt even buy this crap. my friend gave it to me and asked me to play with him. so we did. controls are clunky, and every gun and aspect of this game is nothing but regurgitated crap you have already played many times. this should have just been an extra piece of content in a real game. sort of like how they added 'Zombies' to Call of Duty. dont get me wrong though, CoD sucks too.
3800	0	a	@InternetBeaver Why did you make me buy this?
3736	1	a	49 cents on sale the best 2 quarters i've spent on a game that offers so much and yet get it for so little
5011	1	a	One of the Funniest COOP Games EVER!!!!! Recommended 10/10 (Play with Friends only)
4344	1	a	This game brought the dino's back to life!
1889	1	a	For the money, you simply can't beat this game. It does come with different game modes, which in my opinion are all awful except for survival, which is a round based game mode where you buy (not with real money) weapons, perks, and go on missions to acquire vehicles that not only increase travel speed, but also come equipped with guns, rockets, and turrets.  Like I said earlier, this is not BF4, or COD Ghosts, but for the money especially when this is on sale, you can't beat it.  *Update* System Specs have increased due to the new arctic update, you can no longer play this with dedicated graphics, you need some sort of GPU. This degrades my opinion of the game slightly, just because the range of viable players has decreased (i.e. I can no longer play this on my laptop, I have to play it on my desktop with my fx 6300 and r9 270x). This does not affect my overall impresssion of the game, this comment is simply in the 'Other Thoughts' section of the review if you are familiar with newegg.
2	1	a	King's Quest 1 was the first game that deeply impressed and made me realize how videogames are a medium and format with limitless potential. I understood how they could go infinitely beyond the simpler arcade titles of its time, in which you just played an eternal repetition trying to reach a good score. Not that I am against this kind of game, hell I still play a lot of those to this day, but we couldn't just stop there and KQ's contribution was paramount for this.  The feeling of adventure and fantasy that the series provides - especially 1, 3, 5 and 6, and yeah I played them all - is unparalleled, and Roberta Williams' huge sensibility to transpose the magic feel of fables and folk tales to the games is a delight to enjoy. Somehow makes you see things with children's eyes again, with that mixture of curiosity, excitement and awe.  I'm very happy that this collection is back on the Steam store for old and new fans alike. It has been recently updated with a fix that we previously had to manually apply all the time, so there's also that. Have fun with 7 amazing classics!
1879	1	a	This is what happens if you cross HALO with Jurassic Park. The game is very enjoyable, but farily repetitive. When it went on sale it was 1 dollar, and thats the best dollar I have ever spent on a game. So get out there and strat powning T-Rexes with mechs and tanks!
4746	1	a	Best game I ever played for $0.99.
3767	0	a	STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS!   Orion Dino Horde is nothing but a rebrand of the god awful Orion Dino Beatdown,however with more content and SOME bug fixes,the most notably one being the better optimization. BUT all of the issues are back full force:  -God Awful Dinosaur attack animations -Horrid Gunplay -TERRIBLE Sound Design -TERRIBLE firearm sound design -TERRIBLE Voice Acting -Sub-Par Graphics for a 2013 release,this looks like an early UE 3 game  there are other games that execute this ``Wave Survival`` mechanic much better than this travesty of a game,instead of buying this save up some cash and buy Killing Floor,this game was supposed to be a mod but SOMEHOW it got funded and now its asking for your hard earned cash,by the time im typing this review this game is on sale for 1 $,in my opinion its not even worth a dime throwing your money away is much more fun than buying this piece of crap.
225	1	a	Prototype reminds me bit of The Hulk : Video game, same concept except, can not destroy buildings. Gameplay is decent (what do you want more besides smacking or consuming people and blowing up armored vehicles) even tho game itself counts as open world it does not have any side missions just challenges and searching for collectables. Story wise, not bad could excite new players. Find what happened.... What actually happened to Alex Mercer.  Game does work on W7 64bit.
6309	1	a	EPIC FUN [&lt;3 that we kill dinos!]
1313	0	a	Fun little game that would have defenitely got a positive review from me had it been free. It's simply not worth to pay for, certain free browser flash games provide you with more entertainment. I guess it is worth to spend like 20 cents on this game.
3113	1	a	I dont really know what to say other than: ,   360 no scoping dinasaurs with rocket launchers and hovercrafts. 11/10 would no scope again.
1683	1	a	This game is pretty good for the price you have to pay, it is basically COD:ZOMBIES but with dinosaurs on a huge map. You can have Lightsabers, Bow and Arrows, Hoverbikes and much more. I R8 this game 8/10  'Game of the Year'-Orion: Prelude Developer 'Why Dinosaurs'-My Mom 'I have a dream'-Martin Luther King jr 'potato'-me
6540	1	a	It is--at least--worth $0.99.  Unless you're odd.
2306	1	a	My friend crashes into a t rex on purpose and we died.10/10 would play again later when he's offline
3340	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is one of those fun games that me and my friends have a great time in. There are many gamemodes and maps and most which involve the fun dino killing the game is based around. What adds on to the fun is their system of vehicles and the Rampage mode, which puts you onto the side of the humans AND the dinos. This is all around a very fun game to play and I recommend it.
2326	1	a	What more can be said, it's a horde style game involving dinosaurs, and don't let the metacritic score fool you, this game deserves much better, great to play with some friends and grab some achievements. 7/10
46	1	a	I dunno if they have updated this or what but I have checked all of the games out and they run fine. Many were saying that DosBox was configured incorrectly when they tried playing. Anyway, if it works for you, it is a great collection of classic games. I don't have much time tracked here on Steam, but I have put many hours into the Space Quest games over the years. I don't care how you play them. Get it on GOG or wherever you can. This is awesome gaming goodness.
5847	1	a	THE GAME IS JUST TO GOOD
2123	1	a	Awesome game with a 90's feel.
6333	1	a	The game of the century, not even a meteor could kill this one.
408	1	a	Better than any GTA title.
6419	1	a	Bad Graphics and buggy, but the game is quite good gameplay wise. I reccomend it to anyone especially for 1 dollar
2498	1	a	Everyone should get this game, it is absolutely amazing, i showed my friends and we all love it :D
535	1	a	The Best Slasher on PC for me!!! Looking forward to play Prototype2!!!
1000	0	a	Badly optimised, significant loading times even on my high-end CPU despite such a simple game.  As far as gameplay goes it's a good concept but poorly executed, with minimal stealthing or thinking required.  On top of that - it requires ORIGIN.
2018	1	a	such a funny dinosaur game  and its only a dollar...  NICE!  10/10
339	1	a	'Like Skyrim with fapping hand' -IGN  69/420
5534	1	a	its k for the price of snickers.
5965	1	a	I got stuck in a rock and both of my friends got rekt by a T-Rex. 10/10 would get stuck in a rock again.
5820	1	a	How do you add a Xbox One Controller in?
5909	1	a	This game was really fun. I got many hours of entertainment for only $5. Worth every penny.
3051	1	a	The Sharknado of games
902	1	a	good way to kill some time
3873	0	a	This game is TaRASH i wouldn't recommend this game to my child if his life depended on my ex paying child support. This game is a -1/10 wouldn''t play it if my friend's life depended on it.
5929	1	a	had 99 cents bought this, fun as hell. Haven't played csgo in a week! (that's alot for me)
1274	0	a	THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME CRASH EVERY TIME I START IT CMOON WTFFF FIX IT PLZ
5048	0	a	This game gives the feeling that it was assembled out of models bought off of stock bmodel website. Gameplay is meh. UI is meh.   1/5
1549	1	a	I killed 5 Dinosaurs with a pistol  11/10
947	1	a	This is a good side scroller, 2D combat game. I think it is unique and if its on sale, I would reccommend it for a fun Indie game
1005	0	a	This game was not enjoyable at all and I felt like I was smacking my head againist a wall because of my machosistic desire to finish games. The puzzles weren't awful and the atmosphere was okay but stuff seemed off and when enemies spotted you it seemed at times unfair and then they randomly swear at you for no apparent reason.   Not something I'd recommend to anyone.... =(
3501	1	a	you know what ??  This is actually a good game, it's just lack of development. and, maybe can you add the low resolution ? like the 800 x 600 and so seriously.
113	1	a	A game like no other. Parkour, not just parkour, but like, how about running up a building and elbow dropping a tank? How about a really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing challenging game? How about a well-done graphic setting table? How about a sad and cliff hanger story? How about a huge open world that almost seems like a roguelike? No loading times at all thru areas, it's all there. How about 500 different melee weapons you can assemble. How about gazillion different ways to kill enemies? How about replay value?
5701	1	a	Shoot dinosaurs with guns. Stab dinosaurs with knives. Blow up dinosaurs with gernades.
6276	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
261	0	a	I wold like to start off by saying I love this studio, I love this game ploline, I love games like this in general. but I dont honestly know how you let these controls get past testing. like was it your goal to release a game that pisses people off because you tell your character to go one direction and he takes a running leap 2 dashes and glides in the opposite direction. this sincerely does not deserve to be available for purchase. please correct your issues with your equations for locking onto a wall and directional aiming when jumping. a fix for something like this wouldnt take more than a week for one lone programmer please take the time ou of your oh so very busy schedule and fix the first game in your series.
2197	1	a	Wouldn't pay Â£12 but have had days of fun on Orion after purchasing it on the Â£1 deal. If it comes on sale again jump on it because â¥â¥â¥â¥ where else can you shoot dinosaurs in the face with a shotgun and jetpack off into the sunset?
6145	1	a	Definately a fun game, it looks and feels like Halo mixed with CoD and dinosaurs. I really enjoy it just for the first person shooter vs dino's. Sadly though due to my pc's specs I can not run the game very well. So there is nothing negative I have to say about this game.
4081	1	a	FIrst spawn, run to a chopper looking thingy and proceed to shoot a T-Rex with missles while everyone on the ground gets eaten... my $1 was well spent in the first 2 minutes alone!
1339	0	a	cant play the game!!
2102	1	a	I'd buy that for a dollar.
5883	1	a	Got hooked on this via the free Steam trial, and had to buy it. An excellent shooter, it has a distinct Halo feeling to it but with an intense PVE and cooperative focus to the gameplay, although PVP options are available. Needless to say it is a ton of fun. If you ever wanted to pilot a futuristic helicopter and get rocks thrown at you by a t-rex then this is the game you want to get.  The game as a whole looks great, and for the most part runs great, although it can be hard to find a game that fits your ping when the game is still in the lobby. Other then that no complaints, it is a true hidden gem and would go great in an library, even for only the casual FPS player.
1145	1	a	this is a really fun game  
4451	1	a	Probably one of my favorite games, love every aspect
1152	1	a	HL2 + Yoshi's Island = This Game Anyways here is my formal review about this game Gameplay - Pretty awesome platforming game, totally worth buying it :)  + 4 Graphics - Cool graphics though, I forgot what game engine did the developer use though + 3 Controls - Its ok :3 +1 GUIs and stuff - Can't change resolution and audio volumes D: -2  Overall - 6 / 10 Would stack dead robot's bodies again xD
988	1	a	Very easy game (except a few locations), almost without any storyline, but I've great time with it, it's nice, cute and funny. I don't often play games more than once but in this case I will.
4579	0	a	i have this game now its charging me to play it
5259	1	a	'Lets have anal'-A MAN
1376	1	a	A pleasant suprise...what else is there to say? 
6501	1	a	This game is nearly like primal carnage. It could do with a bit of work but either than that it's ok. You get more veritys of dinosaurs. I recommend it. :)
4684	1	a	Turok meets Halo. Good fun.
4697	0	a	I paid for this game and it got for free. How dare you people do this kind of thing?
409	1	a	I played on console, and I liked just buy it for that. Pretty interesting game.
3285	1	a	I bought this game for a dollar I think. As far as games go it's ok I guess, but when I read how long it's been in development and how hard the team has been working on it, I get the urge to stand up and flip my desk over, and walk out of the room muttering about syrup and potatos.  This game is fun for a dollar, but don't try and tell me it's been in development for 3 years when I could have made this in my sleep with the help of a couple pet seals dry humping my keyboard.  I have no problem with indy developers, but these guys sound like they are so full of crap. This game could run on a school science caculator. It's just garbage, it would be really fun if they would fix the mechanics and animates. The textures and graphics aren't so bad but yea it's crap.  But it only costs a dollar or something so you might as well buy it.
897	1	a	One of the best games I've played the past couple of years. A bit short, but nice replay value on other difficulties.
5957	0	a	Multiplayer game where one team fights as humans and the other team as dinosaurs. The human party has various weapons options and the different dinosaurs has abilities, whether is is flying, jumping, strong attacks or great defensive armor.  The game itself is actually well thought through and the game offers a lot of possibility, but the game is poorly optimized, the server lobby has flaws in connecting to games and several things ingame leaves you frustrated.  It's a game in progress, but they have to do much more work to compete with other games. Still, the game is very cheap and if you don't need insane graphics and flawless optimization, then it's a game for you.  Pros  * Originality * Team based fun * Diversity in characters (Dinosaurs - big, small, flying, crawling) (Human - Recon, Assault, Medic)  Cons  * Game needs optimizing * Glitches * Bad dinosaur models (bad handling leaves you with some of them not able to attack) * Bad landscaping (Getting stuck ingame) 
5401	1	a	Halo with dinosaurs  343/343
413	1	a	Turned into a woman and through a guy off a building. 10/10 would be a feminazi again.
396	0	a	I had hear about this game and I saw the offer 75%, so I brough it to try out...It very boring.  Waste of time.
5647	0	a	PROS:  It's fun It's only a dollar  CONS:  It's laggy on my nvidia geforce gtx 980 It's repetitive It's unbalanced It's buggy  With the double damage upgrade and the longshot sniper you do so much damage it's ridiculous. Not only that but you can only suceed as an assault class for the jetpack. The clipping for anything but a flat surface is dreadul and you'll find yourself getting stuck often. When you fall into the void you don't die, you only continue to fall into the void which will force you to disconnect from the server.  It'll give you maybe 4 or 5 hours of gameplay before you get bored, more if you play with friends.
1801	1	a	Best 99 cents I've ever spent. End of story.
6587	1	a	Ahaha, oh man. Worth every penny of the $0.99 it's currently going for. Hilariously bad, so bad it's kind of good. Absolutely mindless entertainment. It's kind of like Serious Sam, but less serious. Great if you've got a group of friends who liked Halo:CE multiplayer and Killing Floor and hate dinosaurs (and want to kill them).  Haven't touched anything but basic survival mode, and haven't even opened the cash shop as it seems pointless.  Don't expect anything going into it, and you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.
5383	1	a	It's mindless fun. Well worth the Summer Sale price. Would love to see some L4D-esque run n gun maps in the future. The almost have it with the outposts, just need a little more thought and it will be awsome! Level editors for the community maybe?
3281	1	a	Grab a knife. Slice for your Life!
5104	1	a	I have to question how much a person really likes videogames if they've never wanted to fight dinosaurs. Here you can do it cooperatively and with outrageous weaponry. Disregarding how ludicrously low priced this game is, you should get it 'cause it's fun.
1286	0	a	It's like one of those browser games everyone played when they were younger.
1390	1	a	Beep is a great game, and definitely lives up to the claims it makes of being like yoshi island with gravity guns.  Following a ship of robots [beeps], you aim to travel a solar system and collect anti-matter. The levels are your classic platformer side-scrolling style, but there is a lot of variety in landscapes, from levels that require a jetpack, to those in underground flooded caves. There are also enemies that you can either shoot or avoid.   The majority of the gameplay is pretty casual, for example there is no limit on your ammo, you can reload an infinite amount of times. Some of the enemies require a bit of experimenting to find the best way to deal with them, which provides a challenge. That said, most of the enemies have a very simple AI.  The gravity gun provides for some very interesting gameplay. You can pick up many objects, including enemies, which can lead to finding some interesting solutions [not always the intended ones] to progressing through levels. This coupled with the gravity reversal in the final zone definitely makes this a great gameplay object, rather than just a gimmick.  The art in this game is very nice, and aside from a few [what i suspect are] spritesheet glitches when a certain enemy explodes, it is consistent throughout the game. On top of that, the music in this game is great.  This game is also short. The main level selection screen shows you have essentially 6 'zones', each with 4 levels. If you are a veteran player of platformers like this, you will probably breeze through it in no time. Regardless, if you like platformers, you will also enjoy it very much.
686	1	a	Short game, but interesting gameplay.
2857	1	a	this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ mate play this game is sick as HELLL
3681	0	a	7 minutes of my life has gone :(

5716	1	a	Daaad there's a dinosawr in the backyaaawd.  *SLAM*  I'm tired of your sh*t Benji, you little b*stard.
5784	0	a	This is the most terrible game ever. Within 3 minutes of opening, I quit.
4164	0	a	I wanted it to be good, but it's clunky, awful looking, cheaply made and not very fun.
5797	1	a	Pretty good game to kill some time... and dinos.
1772	1	a	Best dollar I spent in my life!
578	1	a	I hate to say it, but I really liked this game. It's like a more fast-paced and violent inFamous. The story is absolute trash and the final boss is complete garbage. Everything in between is like a gore-porn fantasy. Make of that what you will.
5549	1	a	this game is awesome
1239	1	a	3 hours of platforming for not even a dollar - worth it completely.  If you're able to pick this up on a sale, go for it.  The difficulty ramps up nicely (to the point of mild frustration towards the very end)
5448	1	a	great game
5595	0	a	Look, just because a game is inexpensive doesn't mean it is worth your time. I thought with positive reviews and the inexpensive price, running and gunning for dinos sounded like an okay time. And it was, for the first hour... maybe two. It isn't even that it is a bad game, it really just isn't a good one, at least not without other players. Maybe they're all on privte servers or something, but pulic ones seem to be pretty sparse and while Bots can fill in, they are incredible stupid and apparently can do nothing other than prance about shooting dinos. Sounds like the point of it, right? Well, they don't provide cover fire if you need to rescue your generator and don't ever seem to work on objectives other than killing dinos. In a word, useless.   I'm not going to complain about graphics because they aren't that bad, though maybe it was my video card or something but I had some wonky glitches from time to time. Game modes are shoot dinos, shoot more dinos, shoot dinos and each other, shoot more dinos, and did I mention shooting dinos? The variations on the theme are not overly interesting. You guard a generator vs waves of dinos. You guard it against waves of dinos and an enemy team while trying to take out theirs. You capture objectives while taking out waves of dinos. I reallky wasn't exaggerating when I said 'shoot more dinos'.  Are there cool things you can do? Certainly. Is it awful? No. Am I recommending it? No way. I just think there are other things that could, would and should be more fun. If you really want something inexpensive and midly amusing to play for a few hours until something else you're aching to play comes along -- Orion may be the game for you. Otherwise, play some backlog, spend that buck on cards and make badges, or find something else and spare yourself a bit of grief.  As with all reviews -- this is merely my opinion and your mileage may vary.
4551	0	a	Only took me 5 minutes to hate it.
6198	1	a	the best game in the world
2166	1	a	This game ruined two of my best friendships. 10/10 best $ .74 I've ever spent.
3881	0	a	when i first played this game it was very laggy and the graphics are bad so i avoided this game for about a year and now im posting a review
4130	1	a	This game is amazing fun. If you enjoy action games and dinosaurs. Then this game is for you! The fighting is just non stop and although the re-spawn times are quite long the game is still really enjoyable!  I recommend this game!
5526	1	a	I knifed a t-rex.  11/10
3996	0	a	Don't get I already had it, but its making me pay because of the update. DONT GET IT ITS BS
1461	1	a	10/10, you will never be as cool as the makers of this game...
1039	1	a	Warp is a game reminiscent of the old Metal Gear series, but with Portal elements. A stealth game with teleporting features is a bit of an odd mix, and so whether you like this game will be entirely up to you. I found it entertaining, but after one playthrough, I think I'm good.
3280	1	a	Game most definitely deserves a better metascore.
34	0	a	Great. Whoever put this together can't even make DOSBox work right through a simple launcher, making the game require manually going in and configuring things correctly to get it running. Goodbye convinience factor.  Also, what the hell with not including the original non-VGA SQ1?
1652	1	a	What you pay is what you get bro. A $0.99 game and expecting to be a great game? nono. But it's lots of fun playing with friends. Rating 5/10
4856	1	a	  rely gude
6007	1	a	Extremely fun co-op game! Vehicles are fun, its difficult without being annoying!
2720	1	a	10/10 Good Game - Grab Four Friends and its hilarious good times
1520	1	a	I enjoyed it since the dino horde update. It's like a mixture of killing floor, halo and dinosaurs, sounds silly but it's a really fun game to play with your friends. Good graphics, no story mode(single player), 5 different difficulties, pvp and co-op mods, three classes and many equipments to choose from, vehicles, simple serverlists, simple level system that rewards you boosts, ''starting weapons'' and more. This game is worth more than the price says, grab it and share with your friends! :)
5373	0	a	It's not often that I am left speechless, but today dear reader, I must cut off my voice and gaze upon the glory that is ORION Dino Horde in humbled silence. Truly a masterpiece, perfect in every way, the Citizen Kane of video games. Words cannot describe the joy and pleasure that result from engaging in this program. I must confess that I climaxed not once, not twice, but three times during my first session. If you only buy one game this year, if you buy only one game this century, if you buy only one game ever, I implore you, purchase this glorious piece of art and feel the warm glow of true satisfaction.
6362	1	a	This game was worth it when you had to pay a dollar for it, now it's free, so there's absolutely no reason not to try it at least. most people will look for fun elsewhere when they see the childish dinosaur trailer. i was one of those people, but after hearing some great things about it, i decided to give it a shot. i've only put a few hours into it, but i had a blast while playing. Here's a list of pros and cons i quickly drew up. it's by no means an in-depth analysis, but the game's free, what have you got to lose?  (pros) &gt;graphics are actually pretty good, lighting effects blow me away &gt;variety of gamemodes &gt;each gamemode is quite different, so you'll have fun no matter what kind of shooter you like &gt;mothaâ¥â¥â¥â¥in t-rex &gt;lazer swords &gt;killer soundtrack  (cons) &gt;slightly repetetive gameplay &gt;small arsenal of weapons to choose from &gt;microtransations (only cosmetics though. it's not pay2win at all)   just get the game already, youw won't regret it 9/10
4112	0	a	1. Pull up options, cuz my computer's a potato. 2. Disable a majority of video settings 3. Set quality to low. 4. Try to play. 5. All I see is white 6. Reset settings. 7. Click Save 8. Crashed.  1.69/10
3081	1	a	I was playing with some friends, we found a trex kill it, and guess what we said, *looks around* ... GET REXED   ooooo ooooo  10/10 would make bad jokes again
3989	1	a	Went in with honestly not high hopes, totally blew my mind it was actually quite enjoyable, definetly gonna buy it
1799	1	a	cool game 
4906	0	a	It seems good in the trailer, and it got a lot of good review but IT MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS PINEAPPLE! Not even worth those 0,49 Euro. You will regret this!!!
5271	1	a	killed a T-rex by stabbing it in the head with a lightsaber-type sword.
836	1	a	Very fun game with an intuitive and simple gameplay. If you like the genre of 2D kill 'em all you'll definately will like Shank 2.
5852	0	a	So much nope. Don't buy it. This game is a buggy, laggy, unpolished... heck, even uncompleted, mess.
4610	1	a	best game na  bet plot best boobies best story best graphics best movement animations game or the year by ign-1965
3201	0	a	I spent money for this game that did not even work for me and now its free. Wow i can't even get a refund for it.                                                                      WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2543	1	a	I..cant stop playing you monsters. For $0.49 its so amazing. This game is soo addicting
6044	1	a	9/10  The graphics and animations bother me. That may be a little harsh, but what harm could an update do? Otherwise the game is absolutely excellent. I love the feeling of being able to fly around on a jetpack while shooting up random extinct animals. I hope Chris Pratt will be proud of me.   Definitely worth the 25 cents.
5560	1	a	for 99 cents (thats some top dollar pricing ya hear me homie).
4089	1	a	Only played for a few seconds, already better than Ark Survivor 10/10 ;)
1920	0	a	Trash.

1126	1	a	I don't know where to start with this review. I started playing smaller indiegames not that long ago and I'm totally addicted to it. BEEP is one of that little games that just is totally worth it's small price. The only reason that I write this review is that this game really deserves to be bought.   Pro's
1250	1	a	I have some problems with my desktop(even if i have the right resolution it stilll syasy that it cant this display in this res,but this happens to me to other games too,so..),but my m8 that does have a steam account(wont share cuz he doesnt wnat to ,and we arents friends on steam XD)let me play it when i visited him and it was fun AF
465	1	a	There is nothing like having the power to manipulate your body to become an ultimate weapon. During gameplay, as you progress, you get to purchase new abilities as well as enhance already purchased abilities. You can use a shield, whips, blade arms, muscle enhancement, full body armor, disguise yourself as your last victim, the possibilities are endless. Run really fast down streets or up buildings, glide for short distances through the air, smash down to the ground and deliver max damage. Yes this is the game for you if you want total destruction. As you progress the game gets more difficult to match your current abilities...come on you can handle it....you are Alex Mercer!!
832	1	a	Very short and mediocre side-scrolling brawler. Well put together with no particularly good or bad elements. Nice graphics though. There isn't really much more to say about this one. Would play if nothing better.
2098	1	a	I loved the game! It is so much fun, I'm a newbie though and there was a person that insulted me. I'm a girl and I'm sensitive but that always happens when you play with anyone randomly. Anyways, had lots of fun !! :D I totally recommend it to others! Can't wait to play as a dinosaur the little ones are cute xD
716	1	a	Although Runespell has a bit of grinding to level up and earn money, the game is really well done. You'll understand the game immediately if you know poker.

4248	1	a	Well if you like shooting dinosaurs, this one is for you. The metacritic label is wrong of course, because it isn't even for this game. I think it's worth a buy, especially if you have friends playing.
4775	1	a	this game is gud
6303	1	a	really fun,
4294	0	a	This game is god awful. right from the start you know its bad, because the game doen't even have a tutorial! so the first 10 minutes you are running not knowing what your doing, and have no idea how to get any weapons so you can actuall do anything. The textures are terrible, they are so low resoulution, that they look like games from the n64! the only good thing about the graphics are your player model, and even that is only decent at best. The voice acting is decent, but not up to par with todays standards, heck even the legend of zelda from the phillips cdi was better. The only good thing about this game is menu, ant that's because it has artwork, that is kinda cool to look at. And the net code for this game is terrible, not worse then brink's but that's not saying much. All in all i would give this game a 3/10. It has got to be one of the worst game i've ever played, I urge you not to buy it, even if it is only a dollar, it is that bad.
3107	1	a	+Rep Gud Gaem and werry good dinoshooter fps gaem, werri god 10/10 would never play again
949	1	a	A funny arcade style beat em up.
636	1	a	Runespell Overture (Card/Poker/RPG/Strategy Hybrid)  For options we have Graphics Quality (Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic), Windowed or Fullscreen, Drag and Drop or Click and Click (when moving cards around), and Sounds (Music and SFX). You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.  The tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.  So what kind of game is this? It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all. The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game... It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin* Whee~!  How does that work? Looking at the screenshots will help a bit. As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style. Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom. We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five. If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are 'legal' to play. Each 'hand' will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen. For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush.   In each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves.   But wait, there's more!   You can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa! If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.) You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you. You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.  Here's an example of how it might work:   You already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.) You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.  This is where the strategy comes in. Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush! EEEK~!!  Here's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings:   Forget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair. Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card! It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent. Now you can do one of two things: Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.  But wait, there's more!   Along the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses. When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.  Be sure to SAVE before each battle! You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.  There a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)  This game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive! A definite thumbs-up from me!
977	1	a	This is the best 2d action game I have been played. Very very good for playing with friend or your brother.
2510	1	a	worth $1, for the weirdly addictive fun that is Halo: Dinosaurs.
1954	1	a	T-rex ran at me and flipped my car off the map, gotta get a new one.  3/10 no more cars left rip car 2014
4512	0	a	The metascore is real. Don't believe what they say about fixing the game.
4907	0	a	I needed a gaming desktop to play this wtf  that's not why I got the gaming desktop don't worry
4410	1	a	It is an average game, its cool to play with other people.
2940	1	a	This game reminds me of the older Halo multiplayer. This game is without a doubt worth $.49. I mean its not perfect. It has bugs and glitches but its only $.49 so you really cant complain. If I had to decribe this game, It would be Halo 2 +Dinosuars += Awesomeness
972	1	a	Glorified violence at its best
1034	1	a	Warp is SO much fun! The top-down style of puzzle is very clever and fun! If you liked Portal and Portal 2 but wanted something a little more casual, this is definitely the game for you! I have only played about 73 minutes so far and only have three abilities but it is a ton of fun to play!
5826	1	a	i played tthe game with my 2 friends before when there was only like 1-2 maps in workshop, we had so much fun killing dinos and eachother. 10.5/10 -ign
4669	0	a	Step 1 make a game thats good and fun. Step 2 make money off of it. Step 3 make the game free to play.  These steps describe this game.

4408	1	a	36 out of 100 Yes thats not acutire this game is no master AAA game but its fun enjoyable and id request it also good with friends My only complain is the AI itsw a bit buggy but i mean its worth a go so get a group and hunt some dimos my friend
3112	0	a	Deffinitely better than beatdown, but not by much. This is one of those games you play for one to two hours and then never again. I reccomend playing for the free weekend, and by the end of that you will probably not care about the game anymore.
6492	0	a	I know it's only .99 cents right now, and I know their video says 'zomg, don't listen to all the negative reviews because we typed this message', but... it's totally a .99 cent game. Don't get me wrong, lots of work went into it, the idea sounds awesome, the first round was great (because I thought it would have actual gameplay once I learned the ropes). But... nope.
6373	1	a	A great time killer or mess around with friends game. Nothing special but passes a few hours.
891	1	a	Klei Entertainment did not disappoint with Shank 2. Inspired by Grindhouse flicks (from what I've read) Shank 2 places you in the shoes of Shank. I don't really know much about Shank since I didn't play the first game but I will give my 2 cents on the story and gameplay.  Story:  The story is kind of weak. Shank goes to his hometown to see his mother figure Helena. In between the 2 games a new military government has taken over and they are bad dudes/dudettes. Shank only starts fighting them because one of them makes him mad. After that he just mellows out on some booze before he goes to see Helena. The military sets the town on fire while he is drinking. When he attempts to get to Helena he sees her along with other villagers being hauled away by the military. So begins Shank's quest to save his mama.  You don't need to know much about Shank except that he is a cool dude. It would've been nice if he smiled or cracked a joke or did not sound like an old man in the restroom when he got hurt but that is just my opinion. You can also play as Corina, Shank's foster sister, in a level along with the multiplayer. She is a determined rebel member who is probably not a drunk. But you don't get to know her much either.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is excellent. You have a light attack, heavy attack, bombs, and guns. You can juggle people around using the light attacks. You can also pick up weapons on the road that are super powerful but only have a few uses like a bat, a pipe, an IV pole, and a sink. There is also a dodge mechanic which works really well. You can dodge at any point in your attacks. The dodge function will cancel out your attack so you wonât get hit because you are in the middle of one. There are also environmental traps you can activate to kill your enemies. There are a variety of enemies that will keep the game fresh. You have quick grenade throwers, regular dudes, fat dudes that laugh like Scooby Doo, and heavy dudes that go 'hoo rah!' when they do a spin attack. Each game has a boss as well.  If you like beat em ups then this is a game you will not want to miss. A coop survival mode (I have not played) will add replay value and there are also leaderboards, a hard mode, and intel to collect. Getting achievements also unlocks skins.  Buy it!
2104	1	a	this games price is 1â¬ and its even going into a sale.... its not worth 1â¬.  Its worth 10 â¬ So theres nothing to complain about a good game for only 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing euro so just grab it and ignore the negative reviews. It has many modes from PvP (Dinos vs Humans; Humans vs Humans) to PvE (Survival). It has even vehicles like tanks, cars, hover-bikes and even Aircrafts. You can choose between diffrent classes with diffrent abilities, buy weapons, buy perks (even perks that allows you to buy other class weapons) There are diffrent types of Dino's, Bosse's.  It's definitly not the best dinosaure game you can get... but its definitly a game you shouldnt miss and its worth more then the price ure paying for this.
4477	1	a	Fun. That's all I can say. Fun.
1827	0	a	Terrible buggy mess of a game, and even worse developer (a whole lot worse than EA or Activision), there's not much else to say about it...
5492	1	a	Ok, so, my previous review was a thumbs down, HOWEVER they have updated it and lowered the price which in my opinion made it a lot more worth it. So, I dont reccomend this game if you are a lonely person with no friends because this game is SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYED WITH FRIENDS! I cant express that enough, this game honestly does not quite fill all the gaps that it had before it got updated a lot *aka glitches, bugs, etc* however its cheap and its a fun survival game to PLAY WITH FRIENDS.  Overall Scores: If you are playing it alone: 4/10 If you are playing it with friends: 7/10
5414	0	a	Glitchy, unplayable, boring, not fun, broken, poor ai, bad sound effects, bad graphics, strange physics... there just isn't a positive thing to say about it. Avoid it.  The game has been 'updated' since I wrote this but you should know the full history of the game:  Release week: game literally unplayable. Literally, you could open the program and not actually play the game due to some networking issues. Dev's blamed it on steam.  Week later an update came out 'fixing' the problem but you could only get the game to work by messing with some things. IE: â¥â¥â¥â¥ing with the program.  So now you could kind of sort of play, right? Well, I was treated to one of the glitchiest games I've ever experienced, far worse than Dead Island. Things that happened included: hitting a pterodactyl corpse with a jeep and shooting STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY. The dodgy AI also got stuck inside buildings somehow, so that was entertaining. At one point I saved up money for 20 or so minutes to buy a flying thing, then immediately (like 50/70 feet above the ground) hit the skybox and either took damage or blew up (it's been a while). Also pretty sure I bought a walker, stepped off the pad (maybe 2/3 feet) and fell, taking damage or blowing up.  There's also this:   http://imgur.com/a/G2sts/noscript   This game was broken on release and the dude is super shady. The game was renamed to get around crappy metacritic scores and then the new game had the metacritic padded with fake accounts. After about two years is the game playable? Yeah, sure. It's just not very fun.  There's so much information on this game out there and if you're actually considering it, please go educate yourself on the history to it. Please.  Update as of Sept 13, 2014:  Alright, it's been a few years and I guess this has gotten a lot of updates (and two name changes? To avoid the poor critical reception me thinks) so I had to ask myself: is this game fun now?  Well, no, it isn't. It's been updated a lot, there are a lot of new features and the visuals are better. Hell, I would even go so far as to say this is an actual game now!  But when I join I still don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do (I kill dinosaurs, sure, but I don't understand the objectives at all -- probably because I haven't played enough). The AI is still dodgy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and can be outwitted simply by jetpacking on top of a building. Vehicles are still op in that going back and forth will just mow down an entire wave. Worst part? All of the new features have just further alienated me from the game. I don't know what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is worth geting and what isn't, which might not matter since everything just runs out of ammo very quickly anyway.  This game is still a pass. I'd recommend killing floor over it because the mechanics are similar but Killing Floor is actually good and fun. I will say Orion had and possibly still has a lot of potential, and maybe it's fun with friends when you know what the hell you're doing. But then, so are a lot of things.
1797	1	a	I believe this game has been unfairly critisized. I can't believe the bargin I purchased it for. This is like Halo only a hell of a lot better, though the controls do take some getting used to and not everything is intuitive, but once you got all that down and play with some friends or strangers it'll be a blast!
28	1	a	Works on Windows XP.  Nice memories. KQ2 crashes when I try saving the game.
1890	0	a	As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam. Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.  The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably. The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and 'look at me' achievements. After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty. Sad textures on bland geometry. The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance. Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll. Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles. The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map. How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers? They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls. Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer. It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake. I would call that a failure. Speaking of 'original' protagonists. Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them. The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways. Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun! The worst example is the tank. It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused. Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed. The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base. I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game. I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde.   Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back. It is that bad.  TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.
5540	1	a	10/10 very good for a dollar, but not as good as Bad Rats
4992	0	a	.
5315	1	a	Much better since the last update
1576	1	a	lot of people say this game is crap or weird, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more positive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda' suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept 'Orion: Dino Horde.' Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, LIghtSaber, explosions?. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 9/10. (Cheap But Way Better Than you Thinks) 
829	1	a	Klei done it again! I love Shank 1 even with all the hate.. Shank 2 follow the mechanics that made his predecesor fun and bring a new level to it! Lots of achivements, hard game and a survival mode will keep you sweating your controller!
3175	1	a	It is worth f2p
2597	1	a	It's like   Skyrim   HALO with   guns   dinosaurs.
6407	1	a	Great CO-OP game with friends and great layout and guns 8/10
1558	1	a	This game is very unique and one of its kind, in more ways than one. If you read the reviews of others who had been following this game since its beta/early access stages, you'll quickly notice that every one of them says that this game was practically a piece of garbage back then, and any games that get labelled as such will seldom get the opportunity to see the light of day years later.  Enter a group of stubborn developers who refuse to back down and watch their work go down the drain, they salvaged whatever's left from the wreck of the cruiser and built a collosal aircraft carrier out of it. The story basically sums up the history of ORION: Prelude.  With so many shooters involving zombies or aliens these days, this game's theme is very refreshing to say the least. It is a FPS where you get to shoot the long extinct reptile inhabitants of the universe that are dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean you're going to do that with makeshift bows crafted out of wood and stone-headed arrows. No no no no no, far from that. You'll be doing that with state-of-the-art futuristic gadgets and weaponries.  Combine that with cooperative team action and you have yourself a top of the notch game that is teamplay-worthy. The audio is also impressive, sporting above average voice-acting comparable to some high-end games out there. For its price, this game is good. There aren't many other games quite like it.  10 out of 10.  I am aware of the recent, what could I call it, âscandalâ that Spiral Game and TREK are involved in with the other game that is the spiritual successor of ORION: Prelude. However, I am only 2 things: a customer and a gamer. I purchased this game as a customer, and I play this game as a gamer. Iâm not a game designer or a politician. Whether or not the game contains assets from games by other developers, stolen or otherwise unintentionally imitated, does not concern me as long as I get my moneyâs worth from the product I paid for. Even if the developers did mess up, it is up to the higher ups to settle the dispute. As gamers, you have the right to demand a refund or just boycott the product, but expressing your opinions on the developerâs actions is irrelevant because it is not going to change anything, and if youâre not an attorney who is going to represent either TREK or Activision in court, Iâd advise you not to at all because it just makes you highly suspicious of being an employee of a competitor organization attempting to sabotage.  Because letâs face it, having all the negative reviews arise  after  the incident is like having âthis game now sucks because of thatâ written all over your review. If that is the case, it is funny how you still support games like   Payday 2 by Overkill, Killing Floor 2 by Tripwire Interactive or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide by Fatshark,   because those developers are easily at the top of the   â¥â¥â¥â¥   tier list. See, your duty as a reviewer is to determine if the game is good, and if the developer did a good job. If the developer didnât implement anything that are detrimental to your gameplay, you need not whine about it. In which case Iâm fairly certain that implementing assets from some other games does not affect your gameplay at all. Iâm not saying I support the idea of stealing assets from other developers, but Iâm just a gamer trying to enjoy a game I paid for.
2849	1	a	I don't understand anything. But I shot a T-Rex in the eye, and it died.   10/10
353	0	a	To the man who designed the final boss battle:  I would like to bang your head against a table untill you become paralized, then force you to watch as i surgically remove your organs, and feed it to your children in lazania.   I beat your â¥â¥â¥â¥, now i hope that this scaring game will never be seen or played again.
3488	1	a	This game is absolutely hilarious at times, yes it's buggy still, but playing it with friends makes it all good to be honest. Especially now that it's only 99 cents, get it, you won't regret it!  The in game sound pack is horrible though, vehicles sound really bad, and so do weapons. On the other hand, the lightning and weather looks amazing for a game like this. So Dev's fix your sound!  10/10 would cape again.
3897	0	a	This game is very unstable  -10/10 wouldnt rate again
2637	1	a	It's a reallly fun silly game. It's not the best but i really like it. You'll have a lot of fun:)
6550	0	a	For $1, I was pretty disappointed.
975	1	a	You really can't beat this game for the price. So much fun with a friend!
5351	1	a	very good game especially with friends and skype
876	1	a	A smooth, slick, and rather gruesome beat-em-up, but nothing more than that. Also hard difficulty is freaking ridiculously hard.
4397	1	a	Pretty good for getting rare achievements so, i think for 1 key (that's what i've paid for) its ok. But wouldn't play again.  5 non existing ragdolls out of 10
6328	0	a	It was a good game... but the people there are asshats and its near impossible to find a game, on top of that there just insnt enough content to last long.
4593	0	a	For 99 cents this isn't a bad game at all. Certainly it is much better than it used to be, and what it used to be was quite literally a broken piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. but now its become a somewhat fun game for about five minutes, then I got bored and confused and gave up. So, there's that.
2492	1	a	This game can be very fun and entertaining if you play with friends and get the teamwork aspect involved. It is very good for a game that costs $1.00//0.50.
4043	1	a	never played it but it let me do this
4665	0	a	I love a FEEL GOOD story, especially one where there is an underdog involved. I always root for the underdog. In this case the story of an underdog has nothing to do with a storyline that you follow in the game, but has ONLY to do with the developer(s) of ORION: Prelude. It is sad. Very Sad. Not because of what they went through as you would expect, but because their story about making a better game over time is ' more fictional' than the game itself. They may have worked hard but it is still TERRIBLE. Just because some people are willing to dig through the trash to find a half eaten donut does not mean it is good does it? How about a little day old meat? mmmmm.... that is what you get with this game at best... day old meat found in the back of a butcher shop on the ground next to the dumpster. If you like that, you will like this too!  MY COMPLAINT: They suckered me in to buying this game thinking that I was helping someone overcome a financial debt of time and love that they put into the shooter gaming society. As it turns out, all they did is waste my time and money. The only achievement they have truly accomplished is in getting a million plus people to buy something a million times for a buck... when it's not worth a penny! To me, that is the same thing as robbing people. They are problably laughing their butts off all the way to the bank while innocent people are paying them for trash. They are essentially bums on a street corner asking for a dollar. That's fine... I can accept that. But don't tell me that they have succeeded at doing anything except stealing innocent teens (and adults) money.  Bottom line: They say they fixed it, but it does not compare to anything else you will have in your library because nothing else LIKE THIS would have ever been released. It's that bad!
3237	0	a	This game has great potential; I've never though of a dinosaur based survival game. On the other hand, there are some things that need tiny tweaks and major improvements. First of all, I'll be talking about things that need to drastically be changed.  1. The AI for the dinosaurs need some changes. All that the ground dinosaurs do is, if you're on the ground, bolt after you with no strategy and try to eat you. If you're somewhere they can't reach you, they'll either start randomly running around not knowing which path to take to get to you, or they'll go and destroy the generator. Also, if you shoot a dinosaur it does not affect its movement; it will keep in charging at you until you finally kill it. 2. Very frequently I've been kicked out of a match for no reason. The game doesn't tell me why I've been kicked which is a major drawback. Those are two things that need major improvements on. Now I will list things that could slightly be improved on. 1. Animations for dinosaurs could be made more natural. Going along with the first thing I listed, If you shoot a dinosaur, they could flinch and/or stagger a little before continuing on with what they were doing. 2. Animations for the player have been a little buggy for me. If I reload my weapon, sometimes the magazine will fly into its place before the hand can move the mag into its place. If I equip a pistol, the pistol will be in its ready position without my hands and then my hands will come to hold the pistol. I think all of these things should be changed, and I hope the developer of this game sees this and takes action. I've heard this game has made improvements, but once these are changed, I will be able to recommend this game.
5397	1	a	The melee dueling combat is actually pretty fun; it feels Jedi-esque, and the horde mode is pretty fun (especially with friends). It was well worth the 90 cents I paid for it. There are a few glitches here and there, and the vehicles seem somewhat underpowered except for the car with the gun (it is only good because of its mobility).
3353	1	a	First Impressions: Not a great game, but the only multiplayer dinosaur attack pc fps I've ever played I thinkk. Loosely similar to **Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter**. Mildly entertaining, it's not awful if you've ever wanted to mindlessly shoot at dinosaurs for a few minutes. Pretty simple setup, and still people playing online so it's not hard to find a game  Cons: - lots of glitchy jumpy laggy physics (being picked up by the pterodactyl).  - weapon store in separate building from perk upgrades?  Pros: - large weapon variety (snipers, pistols, a bow??) - many many hungry dinosaurs - snow map is quite large - giant fat dinosaurs that take a whole team to wrangle  Kinda cool, like a 3 out of 5 ish  Check our other reviews!  www.KittiesAndBacon.com 
6525	1	a	With all the technology that goes into games, it was only a matter of time for something like this to come around--and it's about damn time.   Think counterstrike but with the addition of vehicles, and you're fighting endless waves of dinosaurs...and you're shooting them with rockets and lasers...from a jetpack.   As hilarious and entertaining as the game is, please note it is still in development. However, the reports of bugs/crashes are greatly outdated. As of this review on 2-25-14, I have played COD: Ghosts and Dino Horde for the same amount of time. Ghosts has crashed 5 times while Dino Horde hasn't at all.   Well worth your time!
2733	1	a	ITS AWSOEM 
1251	1	a	Me an' my homies got dis game. It's gucci homies.
3590	0	a	It crashes. A lot.
168	1	a	Pure Godlike Violence. Enjoy being an indestructible zombie killing machine with really fun powers. Run up the sides of buildings, eat people, blow stuff up - good times to be had all around...  9/10 - Purely Gameplay
5581	1	a	i played this game when it was â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loved it with my friend now i cant play it because of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc and want to so bad 100/10 omg yes all the time
3639	0	a	A dull FPS with the elements of others and dinsosaurs instead of whatever generic game you want to compare it to.  The graphics aren't great and the framerate will drop randomly for no reason.  The gameplay itself is fine, there are no bugs and the controls are reactive. It's just you get to do the same thing over and over again, nothing really exciting.
2920	1	a	Got it for Â£0.99. That's so good for the money. Probably will get something like 15-20 hrs out of it. Really fun MULTIPLAYER game. To compare it, I'd say it is exactly like killing floor... but in the style of Halo... but against dinosaurs, with big boss dinosaurs like T-rex's. Pretty fun. 8/10.
2360	1	a	it's a really fun game! 10/10 BUY IT! 
5845	0	a	boring useless and stupid game , i regret that i bought this crap!!!
1247	1	a	Great platformer, recommended to everyone.
3169	1	a	Great game and lots of fun. Jetpacks, Futuristic weapons, Augments, Stealth, objectives, tons of game modes, and giant Dinosaurs! It was worth the money and is fun enough that I'm still playing it off and on a month later. Not every game has staying power but I can see me revisiting this game again and again.
4300	1	a	You like flying motorcycles? You like killing dinos with futuristic weapons? This is Killing Floor, Halo and Borderlands in one game. And you get all that for one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dolar. Totaly worth it. 10/10
3017	1	a	I enjoyed it very very very much.
112	1	a	i really love this game. the graphics didnt age well i have to say but this game was the first in the series so i dont think they gave it the full priority but the gameplay and story deffinetly make up for it. i had to play through it several times to really understand what was going on. and the little side stories really got my attention.   and the gameplay makes it even better. i wasted much more time exploring the city and destroying things that doing exctual missions. the missions are also a lot of fun they give you a nice tutorial on everything. but all the powers dont really have a part in the missions. only the core things get a good view. and the powers.. well there are a lot of powers or attacks or movements. and you kinda stick to one and forget about the rest while it all could be a lot easier if you use the right attacks.  overall it is a great game and i would higly recomend it if you want to feel like superman that has gone over to the dark side.
5196	1	a	Quite good but so lag when in lobby!
768	1	a	I received this game as a gift and after playing it for a while I'll have to buy my friend a drink, tap him on his back and forgive him his foolishnes.
3427	1	a	I hit a pterodactyl with a stick and it died. 10/10
2291	1	a	Yes, you need a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t game like this to â¥â¥â¥â¥ of your friends. Great present for your soon ex girlfriend.
3548	0	a	Paid for this game get nothing extra when it goes free2play. â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
173	1	a	EXPLOSIONS MORE EXPLOSIONS AND EVEN MORE EXPLOSIONS  would play again 10/10 
5932	1	a	It's just awful so awful. Words cannot describe how awful this is   10/10 would play again
6027	1	a	I thought was a good mofo game like shiee. would have bought it if it was 7+ dollars but im a cheap mother â¥â¥â¥â¥er so i only played it during the free weekend. Maybe when i'll buy it one day when i can afford it.(which will be never this game=2 packs of noodles)
6496	1	a	Good game good for online not much for single but still good when you don't have internet.
3437	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
2293	1	a	ORION is one of the best co-operative games to play...
5124	1	a	best Coop for 0,49â¬ ever *_* lots of fun
1862	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
2649	1	a	they were busy doing whatever that i don't understand, i just know how to shoot dinosaur
2468	1	a	I wonder why i got this game. i was probably tripping on my own shoes.
807	1	a	Great game, nice graphics and works very good on controller. The survival mode is really good, even offline playing with your little brother, the fun is guaranteed.
682	1	a	One of the things I like about indie games is that they try out unique concepts that more mainstream developers would either never think of or be too scared to try. Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.
3998	0	a	This game is worth the 99 cents I paid for it. The graphics are alright not great but not crappy either but the gameplay is really laggy, slow and feels overall not good. The game really isn't even that fun you just walk around and shoot at things that run at you and its not even hard. Overall I would not reccomend this game I only bought it because it was 99 cents.
5061	1	a	I really like this game. I mean how can you not like a game that is under 1.00 that has DINOSAURS! Kinda glitchy from time to time, but did I mention under 1.00
4834	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde (DH) is an updated version of Dino Beatdown (DB) despite what many users claim.  Originally copies of DB were retitled as DH after an update, claiming that they are different games is similar to claiming that TF2 became a new game after they added item updates.  Onto the review.  Dinosaurs + Sci-Fi soldiers + Coop + Giant maps should equal unmitigated fun, yet DH doesn't seem to rise above tediousness, for the longest time you could connect to servers despite opening ports, stable connections or close proximity.  I will say that I have not played this game recently, and maybe the game has changed for the better but given my past experience I am not compelled to try it again any time soon.  Check other reviews who have played the game lately. 
2659	1	a	great fun game for hours of fun messing around with friends
5339	0	a	It's fun for... less than the time it took me to download the game. Glitchy and un-fun.
4673	0	a	This is horribly optomized dont trust the requirents this game is literally a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ Tbh tho, 4/20 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2064	1	a	Fantastic! I play this more than most games in my library.
875	1	a	I love this game, just to play casual between things. Or you can really competetive with friends in co-op or by comparing campaign scores.
3372	1	a	Got it for $1.50 with a bunch of friends on the Steam Sale and we all had a blast tonight. Don't let the metacritic score fool you. This was really fun.
5723	1	a	THIS IS AWESUM!
1300	0	a	Poorly optimized side scroller. FPS drops to 20-30 fairly often on a decent computer that runs much more complex 3D titles. However, good trading cards if you get this on a sale.
3492	1	a	First off, to everyone compaining about the game going Free to play and not getting anything, you did get something, the 20K spiral credits for in game cosmitics, about a 16$ value, those just starting without having bught before going F2P won't have that, and apparently you also got something in the seqeal too, if you buy it, but i don't know about that, as i haven't done so.  Now onto the actuall review...I'd be hard pressed to recommend this game if it wasn't free, and there has been questionable history around the game, but, overall, for a game that is as old as it is, it is a deceint co-op to sink a few hours into every now and then with a friend, or level grinding.  Plus, free, so you don't have much to lose.
2367	1	a	Ok to start off this review i going to be honest with you this game isn't the most fun you will ever have or the best game with the best graphics ever its more of a game if your bored and have nothing better to do with your friends. Now i have over with lets get on with the review. p.s. if your do not want me to blaber on go to the summary --- Story: There is none it is just your some peeps who saw a dinosaur and said OH dinosaurs wtf *pew pew* thats it soo yeah so. Score- n/a --- gameplay: The gameplay is very medicore and its not very hard since of the crappy A.I. teammates and dinosaurs. There are three classes medic who can heal peple and heal the power objection, Assault who has a motherf*cking jetpack and recon who can turn invisable. With singleplayer but playing co op is ennoyable with the crazyiness happening with all the dinosaurs but if your stuck with the A.I. because you have no friends then you should not get this game but if you have friends get it and try it. When your bored of just surivial you can mess around with the setting you can make your own fun like starting off with 20000 creidts or pirate dinosaurs. There are a varity of gamemodes such as a gamemode which ripped off quake and some more so more i talk more about them more in the review. gameplay-6.5 --- graphics: Now to the graphics, The graphics are ok-good to the most some maps look pretty good while other to me personally just look ugly which is quite strange but there are things on the screen i hate about it which it the rain and a couple of these snow maps just cover your screen so you can't see has well but i just it make sense because its the rain and stuff but i am stilled annoyed by them but other thet to the most part its good the graphics. graphics-6.5 --- replay vaule: Well there are a varity of gamemodes other then survival which focus on pvp but to be honest no one plays them so its just survial and dinosurvial for the most part so i couldn't try the other gamemodes out. replay vaule-6 --- music + sound effects: There is nothing special about this music its just you stero type action music but the sound effect are pretty good but there is one thing i love and that is that you can change you voice and you can change your voice to a stero type black guy so it get boosted the score music + sound effects -6.5 --- summary: Its not the best game and its not the most fun like i said in the start but its really cheap so gift it to a couple of friends and just have fun becuase for the most part you have to make the fun by yourself but if your ok with that then go it. score overall-6.5

5111	1	a	i likie this dame it smells good and is fast paced
883	1	a	The Shank2 coop mode has been my top couch coop game with my girlfriend to date.
5645	1	a	Simply an amazing and addicting game. I spent 60$ on GTAV a couple weeks ago, but when i saw this was free i gave it a chance and holy crap. I have been playing this more than most of the games i payed 20$+ for! It makes me think of a mix of Tribes: Ascend, Jurrasic Park, Killing Floor, and Halo. I love it.  First game i played as a level 1 i killed a trex with an automatic pistol to the face. 10/10
874	1	a	Really nice game! The Co-op survival mode is really fun! You can get many hours of playtime when trying to unlock all of the characters.
1836	1	a	10/10 the game was a dollar Not just once. BUT TWO TIMES. 93% OFF. AND ITS ONLY A DOLLAR NOW
953	1	a	Although Shank 2 will last you somewhat longer than its predecessor, it is mainly due to, at times, frustrating encounter design where you'll struggle to differentiate enemies from the background and enemies who are perfectly capable of stunlocking you in certain group compositions. Also worth noting is that already simple but effective story structure from the original is further diluted and merely serves as framing device to move you from location to location without any personal involvement. That's not to say all is bad in Shank 2, though. On the contrary; game plays to its old strengths - more cosmetic unlocks were added, scoreboard bragging rights are still around and combat is still as satisfying as ever. It almost evens things out. Almost.
4849	0	a	Empty servers. Boting gameplay. This game must be Free to play, cause i dont want to pay for... this...
1755	1	a	Pretty cool game. My friend bought the 4-pack when it was on sale for super cheap and gifted me a copy.  It's a fun FPS game and it was definitely worth the 75 cents. I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.  It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.  Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.
2313	1	a	Better than COD Ghosts
2132	1	a	Halo mixed with Jurrasic Park. Thats all i have to say.
3593	0	a	this could be fun if i could connect to a server...
3583	1	a	Way better than anything Activision ever put out, THERE I SAID IT!!!
2570	1	a	not that many people play this so not many servers. great graphics though!
1548	0	a	Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die.   The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns.   This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.  Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.  What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.
1033	1	a	good game to pass free time.. just u have loggin everytime to origin account to continue from where you left your game else start a new game again
2260	1	a	lemme start with ..puting my socks back on ..cuz this game knockd um rite the â¥â¥â¥ off....i know a dino game every one does one ..well they do but not like this at all this is like lost planet and halo had sex and out fell tis beautiful bay .....and i love it .ull love it too if u like anything thats close to cool cuz this shiz is top shelf and well worth the .99cents
4142	1	a	Sell some crappy CSGO skins and get this game already. Super fun for the cost!
1439	1	a	Although I haven't played too much of this game (around two and a half hours), I can say it's deftinately worth it's cheap price (96% off)    PROS   -Great Graphics -Loads of levels -Nice mechanics -Brilliant Gameplay    CONS   -Somewhat poorly optimised: I have quite a good machine - an intel i5 4440 and a GTX 660. It runs pretty good however I can tell it sometimes drops for no reason. -Repetitive music  Overall, it's a good game if you can get it on deal but I wouldn't pay the full Â£3.99
477	1	a	This game....is one of the few AAA titles that rolled out in its time that was not only difficult (to a degree), but wasn't awful. Sometimes I still install and play me a little bit of Prototype. Unfortunately, the IP has been cancelled for all further sequels; Prototype 2 was barely able to release, as this decision occurred before Prototype 2 went for sale.   Prototype 2 is a nice conclusion and I suggest picking up both games. This one, however, has you as Alex Mercer, and as you go through the plot, you find you can 'play the villain' recklessly and enjoyably to kick off your after work stress.
2256	1	a	spennt a long time just fighting off giant pink dinosaurs with a lightsaber and a friend in the snow 11/10 would reccomend
60	1	a	For everyone who is saying they can't play these games, just get ScummVM and run them from there. Yeah, you can't launch it from Steam, but at least you can play them.
2808	1	a	Good game. Dinosaurs, Vehicles, FPS, Huge Maps, lots of game modes, Has a level up system similar to Killing Floor, very easy to find your friends and play with them (unlike 80% of the crap out there that advertises multiplayer then never actually being able to play with your buddies). And who doesn't like hunting dinosaurs? Also border line educational as you find yourself remembering lots of dinosaur names you previously thought you had forgotten or never even knew. Highly recommended. :)
6319	1	a	Tons of fun for only $0.99 ... buy a 4-pack for $3 and have fun with friends. Cheap fun: man vs. dinosaur.
4152	0	a	I'd like to say I recommend the game because I used to love it. But it won't launch for me, this is an issue I also have with Smite so I think it's my graphics card, for the 2 it says it launched as 32bit dx9. That's all I know about the issue. I'd love if this could get fixed because it's a really fun game but I can't actually play it! Edit - Game works on new computer, still a bit boring, gameplay is limited.
3406	0	a	This game might be cool. If me and my friends could actually play together without 'cannot connect' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.   Not worth 15 bucks at full price or 3 dollars on sale.  This game is st00pid.
4792	0	a	Just.. don't support them
1601	1	a	I got to say it's a lot better than I expected.  However, play it with friends, alone it isn't quite that fun :/
1267	0	a	Poorly put together puzzle game. Enemies are much more annoying then hard.
5030	1	a	Not even a free year is going to make me play this game, ever again.
2393	1	a	Ill just say this is much better than it was at launch, and i`d give it 7 out of 10
728	1	a	The Game is awesome. A Mix of Magic &amp; Poker with a touch of Fantasy.
537	1	a	This is a spectacular game of the franchise. For those who like open world games. This is the one for you.
816	1	a	Fast, bloody and hard beat-em-up sequel of Shank. Basically, it has the same gameplay as the first game with some tweaks like dodging system.  The most (and I would say the only) significant difference from the original game is the difficulty. Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them. So, even normal mode became a very good challenge.  Anyway, it's great example of modern beat-em-up game.
1986	1	a	if nothing else it is just fun times....
6427	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing weird. Very small lobbies of five.    Its basically a dino versus human. You pick which side you're on... in lobbies of 5. Bigger lobbies would be a very fun game, there would be a lot of room for a f2p model like Tf2.   As is? not worth it
4133	1	a	Not bad of a game. I actually had a ton of fun playing this with my friends. Hopefully some nice updates come out fixing a few bugs, and updating some sounds and effects to make it look even better.
541	1	a	The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.  The actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.  Combat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.  Speaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.  While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.  + Fun as all hell Oodles of powers and upgrades Feels godlike, man Options, options, options  - Poor PC controls Combat can be cheap at times Showing it's age graphically  In the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.
1875	0	a	This is becoming quite laughable. This useless and totally anonymous 'game' just keeps popping up as free trial for days. The reason? Uh... let's guess.  The positive reviews in the trailer are those written in the 'store page', paste/copy. Not even good at cheating
134	0	a	I want to like the game, but with the sound issues, and all the work arounds, and there never been a patch, I just can't honestly recomend the game on Steam.  Is fun, no doubt, and the story is pretty interesting. The mechanics are awesome, the skills are really cool to use, etc etc etc, but the sound, and only being able to play for about an hour at a time without having issues happen, or going in and deleting files to remove sound issues, whatever. Is just ... not really worth it.
3658	0	a	It's just plain bad.,,, Don't buy it, not worth the 40 cents.
2829	1	a	You get to fight Trex' wearing big hats. What more could you want?
1843	0	a	Do not buy this game. I installed it since it's free for a limited time. The only remotely unique thing about this game is that it has dinosaurs so I was like heck yeah I can play as my favorite dinosaurs. But they're slow and clunky and if a human player jumps up on a rock, or even stands next to a rock, there's no way to reach them. The attacks have absolutely no range and seem to do nothing even if the human player should be within range. The only good thing about this game is that you can see some dinosaur models that have animations. Beyond that, it's not even worth a dollar.
3172	1	a	Simple, Fantastic, Classic! ~ ~ ~  CHEAP!!!    Hell Yes!
4051	0	a	I bought the game for my 'team' ( 3 very close people), and we heavy relly on coop, but this was like a time-travel; this is was a a great game, for a game dated about 20 years ago.  I know, it cost like a bus ticket, but it was an awfull hipster trip.
2164	1	a	There are multiple reasons why this game is only a dollar, but damn it  it's only a dollar
1589	0	a	Stolen Content, Bad Company that will sue you to cell if you say something bad about them
765	1	a	A solid isometric action game of the mech kind that's challenging and fun enough to demand a sequel. There's a 25 level campaign with three difficulties, and a three map arena challenge with three difficulties. There's also mech upgrades, aesthetic upgrades and pets. It's over five years old, and with all the isometric garbage out nowadays, I petition for The Butler to return!
751	0	a	played 2 minutes, the voice acting is unbearable, unistalled.
1949	1	a	This game is a hillariously buggy mess yet I wouldn't change a thing about it. Best $.99 I spent in a long time.
4503	1	a	This is a fun game and for 1 dollar you can't beat it.
872	1	a	One of the greatest 2D games to be used with a controller
1233	1	a	Pros:  - Nice Mechanics - Physics are really good. - A useless story that you can put a theory to... - Cool cheap puzzles.. - Paid 10 cents for it...  Cons: - â¥â¥â¥â¥ you - More â¥â¥â¥â¥ you - You â¥â¥â¥â¥ you - Killing of your own kind while you â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. - 10 cents for an innocent high pitch babbling â¥â¥â¥â¥ you!  Overall rate 7/10...
1065	1	a	You be a cute WALLE-esque robot and try not to get blown up
3449	1	a	'Let's see... Two quarters... Four dimes... A nickel... One, two, three... Four pennies! Guess I got somethin' to do for an hour after all.'
848	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
5925	1	a	I owned this game when it was a POS. I hated it and I hated the money I spent on it. Made me sad to see such potential wasted on what could have been an awesome dinosaur multiplayer experience.   now, that was about a few years ago, when I bought the game. NOW, its completely different.  Are there bugs? yes. plenty still. Is it worth playing? â¥â¥â¥â¥. yeah. NOW ITS AMAZIIIIIING.  I give it 2 zugs.  Zug zug.
2805	1	a	ever since they added hats i would say that this is the best game NA. 
4869	0	a	Maby a yes if you didnt steal.
4091	1	a	Easily one of the best games ever made, hands down
893	1	a	Quick Brawler - 4 hours to complete. Couldn't get the hang of all the button presses. B-
3013	1	a	Its a fun game and relatively simple shoot dinos, and capute outpost. Its better when you play with friends!
785	1	a	Nothing will give you the shooting satisfaction of this game. The graphics are beutiful. Lots of explotions and different weapons.
1165	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
123	1	a	The whole story and feel is edgelord and a bit tryhard, especially the protag, but if you don't mind that it's pretty fun. Even if you don't know what the hell is happening, you can hijack a tank and blow â¥â¥â¥â¥ up for kicks. Lots of fun mechanics to mess with. 6/10  Originally played this on PS3. Most of the characters are an undefined mess, which you could chalk up to Mercer's unique existence/mind or them mostly being cannon fodder and written to be distant/vague/unrelatable, but I think it may just be lazy writing. The focus of the story is the virus, how it came about, what it does, and is now doing. This mostly involves collecting memories conspiracy-theorist-style and smashing a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of helicopters. The web of intrigue surrounding it is pretty interesting and sounds plausible (even if the biology is not), which is saying something given this is a game about a guy with crazy superpowers fighting viral creatures. Mercer himself is either eyeroll-worthy or hilarious depending on how you look at him, but you will see hints that the whole 'powers' thing has made him a better person. If you get that far, you can reflect on why this is funny.  The OST suffers from LAIR Syndrome, being kinda bland/samey and nothing stands out, which is a shame since it sounds like they had an orchestra helping them. The visuals are nothing to write home about and the game hasn't aged too well; if you're walking down the street and not focusing on taking something out, you may find the repetitive NPCs and questionable AI to be immersion-breaking. The color palettes start to blend after a while as does everything else. The real joy comes from actually playing the thing and using the powers you unlock. Sneaky sort? Got you covered. Like to be a tank? That's there, too. Ranged? Yeah, kinda. Wanna just slice â¥â¥â¥â¥ up with a giant blade arm? There's a military complex, go nuts. Timed challenges? They're kinda crap, but they're also there. There's so many ways to just screw around and make things go smash and boom that even though it's kinda lacklustre, I still keep coming back. People like to compare [Prototype] to inFamous due to release dates and themes. This one is darker and more bland, but the powers are way more fun.  The game opens with you in a scenario where you can wipe out city blocks of military personnel with ease and elbow-drop tanks, so if that sounds good to you, try it out.
850	1	a	It should be illegal for things to be as fun as Shank 2 is
2548	1	a	Great Game! Way Better than Before, So much fun!! You have to Play it to believ me, Its GREAT I love it 99999999999999999999999999999999FriedNoodles/10
1137	1	a	But seriously what is this game, i bought it for my whole family since its cheap but, I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO BUY IT AND TELL ME WAT TO DO STEAM! Oh wait steam cant buy games XD
3371	1	a	The game is fun with your friends but it can become very annoying to play with all the glitches
3843	1	a	Im gonna ram a rusty nail through my spinal and eat my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1389	1	a	Pretty good for a game i got for 30 cents
2681	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
4179	1	a	IT'S NICE GAME
752	0	a	Doesn't work properly without changing game files, installing third party bloatware like DIVX, and basically jumping through way too many hoops.  I wasted more time on Google trying to find ways to fix thios piece of crap than actually attempting to play it.  Ended up uninstalling without having actually played, as the mouse wouldn't work (among other problems), rendering the game unplayable.  I'd almost classify it as malware, but I'll settle for fraud.  It should be removed from the shop, as I'm pretty sure knowingly selling products that don't work isn't exactly legal, but since Valve doesn't seem to care, stay away from it unless youlike wasting money.
1566	1	a	This is really, really good for a $1 game.   For a $1 game. 
4848	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.    
1700	1	a	Games crashes when I connect to servers. I didn't get to play. Not buying sorry :l
4055	0	a	I didn't want to buy this game...  ...but hey it was 99 cents!
3726	1	a	Honestly it is like Halo with Dinosaurs. If you are doubting buying this game don't. It's so cheap but so good. WHY IS IT SO CHEAP?!
1706	1	a	Add this to MAC!
2891	1	a	wtf were those guys smoking when they made this
2387	1	a	STILL better than the 2nd one      u go gurl
684	1	a	nice little solitare/poker card game. The humor is alright. No bugs. the only complaint i have is there is no autosave but you can save manually so if you computer turns off etc and you for got to save your poop out of luck. (I'm clearly talking from experience.)
324	0	a	good game. i first played this game on my xbox 360. when i first bought it i was disapionted with the game. but i figured i would give it another try. no thumbs up or down... it would cool if there was a way to play it in full hd. but no only 720 for this one guys... save your money
442	1	a	AMD GRAPHICS CARD/ PROCESSOR USERS ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!  Yes this game is awesome. max 40 frames for us.   AMD radeon 290x   AMD FX 8320 8 core 3.5 mhz
2644	1	a	IT SAYS BUY NOW AND GET ONE FREE GAME (SO FAR A GOOD GAME) BUT THEN I DONT GET A FREE GAME I DID NOT BUY IT FOR THE FREE GAME BUT STILL IF IT SAYS FREE GAME I WANT MY FREE GAME
4636	1	a	  Is It Bad That My PC Cant Run This Lol
159	1	a	im very like this game -awesome super power -cool jacket -and fu*****ing hunter  please make prototype 3 activision,dont publish COD Infinite warefare to the steam
4233	0	a	This game is unplayable. I streamed this @  www.twitch.tv/sirspoony  and frapsed it for first impressions youtube.   I was unable to create a solo game.  I was unable to join any online games because they were all locked.  I was unable to play with friends and viewers because none of us could team up for games.  Games would just not launch.  This game is not even worth the $0.99 because it did not work for me or the many people trying it out in my stream as well. So guessing it's either broken or so unstable server-wise that it makes it unplayable.  On a side note. They trolled gamers everwhere and won. They actually fooled the many idiots into thinking this is a recommendable game? Sorry for your obvious loss of some humanity based on trickery.
2228	1	a	Awesome game. Could use some more feedback/news from the developer. What was that patch that just downloaded? What did it fix? What's new? What's coming? The 'news' section as it is kinda feels like BonziBuddy.
570	1	a	Prototype is an action open world game where you try and find out why and who did 'it' for you. The game is pretty hard, it really reminds me assassins creed gameplay and crysis dfficulty. the game has good graphics and a great gameplay. a good gameplay and overall a good game. buy it. play it. 9/10
2941	0	a	Wouldnt recommend, but for $1 it has some laughs
1004	1	a	If you fancy something a little different and enjoy testing yourself then this is definitely for you. Fantastic game to get away from the rages of other games!
3887	0	a	I tried to like this game... I really did, but it is sooooo boring. The first few minutes where like meh this game is ight. but in a few more boy my opinion would change. Just in the first 5 minutes it was so repetitive the dinosaurs aren't even that hard and multiplayer isn't that fun either... the game would be a great idea if they remade the graphics and added a story mode to it i wouldn't regret buying the game but sadly i do... 3/10 would kill raptors that don't even hurt me probably not again
4563	0	a	One of the worst games I've played.
5497	0	a	Lemmie just fix up the store description...  'ORION: Prelude' is an indie Sci-Fi shooter (FPS/TPS) that blunlty blends together half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ visuals and subpar combat. It puts you and your former friends together into boring, bland battles using some of the most generic weaponry and clunky vehicles in which you must work or compete against one another to accomplish mission objectives, explore modest-sized worlds and survive the devastating Dinosaur Horde.'   I know this game is a dollar but it wasn't originally and this game tried to put out major damage control to try to not look terrible.  'Don't believe the reviews' my â¥â¥â¥.
6426	0	a	Andddddd. WTF It may have...some...potential. Considering the menu seems to lag a bit, it definetely has flaws, but i'm sure it would run smoother on an enthusiast's rig. APUs don't support much, even in the fabled 'Dual Graphics Mode'
3743	1	a	i vault the fence, crash down into a pile of dead leaves, and pick up my father from the fallen. inside the constant hum of insects, i breed into eternity. where was god in all of this   the answer is that i awoke naked and alone inside of a cave, the lights were flanging and I felt the crushing hollowness of a century. the voices boomed around me, and I felt fear for the very first time. minutes like bullets intersected by screams, i slip into the skin of a new tyrant, and firmly grasp the rat's neck
6396	1	a	For a dollar this is easily the best game in its class on Steam. Definitely has the potential to have a lot of laughs with friends while playing.
5080	1	a	I can no scope a T-Rex in the face in slow motion, causing it to fly into the air.  1/1 Would dino-scope again.
2560	1	a	Tokyo drift into dinosaurs and the game's announcer says something about pizza  10/10
5828	1	a	this IS the best game ever!!
956	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
5830	1	a	At first I thought, 'Oh, Darryl wants me to play this...*sigh* it's a PVPFPS...' I couldn't have been more incorrect. it IS a fps, but it's geared toward co-op fp combat....AGAINST DINOSAURS! The AI is good, because they know how to swarm your â¥â¥â¥. You'll find yourself backing away while shooting at your feet...and at the little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that are trying to snap off your ankles! I think, graphically, it still has a way to go, but the gameplay is fun and exciting!
3485	1	a	Very addictive.
2870	1	a	Not as bad as people say it is. Preety darnn good lol
1831	1	a	Game of the year.
2835	1	a	Got firefighter hat then proceeded to flip people off in Multiplayer. 420/69 would flip them off again.  [UPDATE! 2/22/2015] So, I decided to play longer and make a better review.  Pros: + Nice looking eviroment and dinos + Nice players that never kick Low levels + Different classes with a few personal set of skills + Massive maps for Conquest (Base taking mode) + A Human vs. Human and Human vs. Dino PvP + Weather changes during game + AMAZING lighting (Not really a pro, but I love the lighting system. ;w;)  Cons: - Player models are... Not the greatest. - Some animations are a bit weird and stiff for players and dinos alike.  So, my over-all score for this would be...  8.5/10  I love this game. It's fun with friends and randoms.
3185	0	a	Horrible
4664	1	a	this game has taught me to never give up in what you doing. this game went from a %35 aproval rating to %75 in 60 updates. the special thing about this game is the devs never gave up on what they thought would be a good game!
5181	1	a	it is cool 
2530	1	a	Short Review: Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.  Full Review: - Gameplay The game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The 'Capturing Base' message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.  For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.  - Changes in Gameplay The last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.  Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing 'how much their game has improved'. Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.  - Graphics/Visual Appeal Despite the 'massive overhaul' from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.  In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to 'focus' on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be 'simple' or complex enough to be 'complex'. It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?  - Bugs (?) There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.  - Verdict By now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.
544	1	a	Now then, where to begin: TL;DR: get the console versions, the PC port is not good at all, but the game is good.  The PC port is not optimised, so the frame-rate will chug when smoke &amp;/or particle effects are going on, there is no option to play it in windowed mode and the timers in the PC version seem to be lowered for no apparent reason. Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldnât see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target. All that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please. I will say now I havenât finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you wonât have enough time to actually finish it. So get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I donât recommend either way. But itâs worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.
2447	0	a	Basic Review: Interesting, but is a short lived game Purchase: I guess so...if you've really got nothing else to do. As this is a neutral review, I can not give this a thumb up.  This game imploys creative new approaches to the basic defense game. Dinosaurs attack your facilities and your team. You goal is to survive each way while upgrading to stay on top of it all.  This game is very fun, if you play it in small volumes. It can get old very fast though, it's very repetitive.
5635	1	a	I would love to see better graphics and to fix some more bugs. Otherwise it is really fun :)
3471	0	a	A good game for being only 0.99 cent , it has some issues like poorly optimized and also high ping , fps is not good sufficient , it freeze sometimes and my opinion for this game is 'I just wasted my 0.99 cent'
4209	1	a	This nice game to play with your friends, also you can play multiplayer to it's fun,and you can have fun from this game i love this game buy it if you like! :) Good Day
4380	1	a	This game is great in my perspectives...  A little bit laggy but very good game play, this game is good for friends you like to play with this 5 player coop game makes you and your friends very enjoyable with different unlocks, weapons, taunts, hats, cosmetics and etc this game makes you look so cool. Orion prelude is a game which you slay dinos and unlock alot of things, Orion prelude is one of the funnest games i had, also the single player is very fun, if you are a single player guy get this game and play single player solo or bots, this game is very fun in my perspectives.. worth the 99 cents! this game might be worth 2 dollars.. this is a must buy game all the fun for .99 cents!!  
5954	0	a	this game is still in need of work. i got the game for a dollar so its not a bad deal. just could be better than what it is now and what the game want's to be.
4266	1	a	its ok for a cheap game but does get boring the graphics could of been better bit like halo with dinosars lol Recommended:  OS:Win 7 / Win 8 (64-Bit)  Processor:AMD 6-Core / Intel 4-Core  Memory:6 GB RAM  Graphics:1 GB Graphics Memory (SM 3)  i bet this could run on a mobile
1064	1	a	I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here. This is a simple platforming action game. You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds. Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds. The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children. Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.
1966	1	a	If you like â¥â¥â¥â¥ things like me, you will love this game.  Totally worth it for 79p  Great with friends  Loads of free content added all the time  Buy it, even if you dont enjoy it all you wasted was the cost of a mars bar. If you would rather have a mars bar than this game you are a fat â¥â¥â¥â¥.
978	1	a	this game reminds me of my childhood , best game ever played !
827	1	a	Buy the game. There's a part in it where you rip out the jaws of a SHARK!!!!?!&gt;?!??!?!?!??!@#&gt;?@!&gt;?#?@!?$@ !#$
5648	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ my pants by the loud intro volume  11/10
338	0	a	Could be an ok game if not for the controls that make your character feel like your driving a bus.  Helicoptors also have a tendency of dissappearing and appearing where ever they please. doesn't matter if you were going to attack them or not or if they are a few feet in front of you. Very unrewarding gameplay makes you just want to uninstall  -0/10 don't bother  also for some reason the recent news for Prototype is   This Prototype Legend of Zelda Cartridge Can Be Yours for a Mere $150,000
2466	1	a	TAKE GUN. SHOOT DINO.
1146	1	a	Cheap and great game !!
526	1	a	controls unintuitive and hard to get used to, despite the controls game play is excellent. Story is disjointed so far due to how the game is set up.   worth a play but not a full price  overall - 4/5
2068	1	a	Orion Prelude is a FPS shooter with both online and singleplayer. There is no story just pure action. So if you are sick and tired of zombies? Want to hunt dionsaurs? This is the game for you.   Slaughter  mode is a survival mode with no base generator to protect. For every 25 kills you get a reward to unlock further weapons to help you killing further dinos. There is no shop in this mode. There is a leaderboard to compare your results. You will as in all gamemode in this game level up your characters to unlock perks, weapons, cosmetic skins and more.  My personal favourite is  Survival  mode wich is a bit different. You have to protect your base generator from being destroyed. Dinosaurs will come in waves and for each kill you will earn money that you can use to buy weapons, perks that will make your life alot easier. Each wave gets harder and harder with bigger dinos attacking. You will also unlock objectives that will give you veichles.  This game includes so many gamemodes and maps that probarly any player will find their personal favourite. The game is quite grindy. It will take alot of hours to unlock character levels.  If you have some friends to play with, this game can be really fun for a game on weekends. So grab a few copies to them as well. Note that you will still level up when playing singleplayer modes. Big plus for that!...    Some thoughts for the devs:     I wish you did what others do and make it more rewarding to play for each turn. I know this is no Call of Duty but rewarding on screen and with unlockables will encourage more gametime.   Please make it more rewarding.    A cosmetic rewards page showing badges what you have unlcoked. I prefer badges/medals instead of just statistics page as it will encourage me to continue playing further to unlock further badges.   Look on competive games why they keep getting players comming back.     End words:    Still I have loads of fun in the new Prelude version. And frankly i have been playing more alone than online. Its a game i can play in short bursts or longer with friends. I keep comming back but as said some thing to reward us would defo benefit this game alot. Adding some human bots to the TDM or FFA maps to kill would defo keep me comming back even more. Sometimes you just wanna kill something else than a dino. ;)    Review Score:     GFx 8,5 SFx 6,5  (Music gets repeative after a while, some more tracks wouldnt hurt)  Gameplay 8-10   I have played both the old and new version and i must say it has grown into me. Prelude is alot better in any aspect. GFx is nice, SFx is spot on, Gameplay is easy and fun. I will gladly recommend it.  BUY IT!.. 
3910	0	a	this is a horrible game, the trailer makes the game look really cool, but looks can be desiving. when i started playing i got an instant headace and this game is not worth the 99 cents.
589	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played
649	0	a	Though i was addicted to it and played maybe 2,5 times to collect all the achievements, can't really recommend it, unless for a big discount. Gameplay is repetitive and becomes stale quickly (collect pocker hands to create attacks). Additional magic spell add a bit flavor. Also the story was interesting. Oh, and the epic music playing all the time becomes annoying after a few minutes :)
2740	1	a	WORST! GAME! I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!
655	1	a	its good cuz therse cards an teyy fight guys
4530	0	a	basically a poor mans evolve
5295	1	a	Got a 4 pack on summer sale for like 5$ (wich is a steal...) this game is worth the 15$ full price IMO but it's probably gonna be on sale again if you want to wait...  It's a nice coop game and relatively easy to understand how everything works (buying system etc.) there are vehicles in wich you can make roadkill (ever tough they could just run over raptors in Jurassic Park? well you can do that) and you have a Jetpack too, so in resume you get to drive vehicule and shoot dinosaurs with rocket launchers and machine gun, what more can I say...  didn't play too much since I just bought it but I like it soo far, buy it :P   
5832	1	a	I can safely say that this game was worth every cent. took couple of minutes to get used to it and the graphics don't even bother at all. Would reccomand it to anyone and the price is just redicilous for how much fun it actually is.
927	1	a	This game is really fun. Shank is he toughest guy around. If a shark attacks him he rips its jaw out.
5754	1	a	Played this game for an hour and it is already one of my favorites in my library.
4034	1	a	This game is so bad its good... but only when the sale is 90% or better.
4496	1	a	GAME IS INACCURATE WITH ITS ACHIEVEMENT NAMES, CAVEMEN DIDN'T EXIST WITH THE DINOSAURS...   -1 point game ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
588	1	a	Zombie Mutants? Aw hell yeah
5616	1	a	dayum dis focking cheap 79p BRAHHH
4501	1	a	contrary to what people believe on metacritic  its not a bad game anymore. ANYMORE. but this game needs alot more players to really become one of the scene. which I believe it has the potential to.
5452	1	a	A lot of fun for 99 cents.
5856	1	a	This game launched as a mess, but because of the loyalty of the development team it has really grown into a great game.
5370	1	a	good with friends bad when you are alone.
531	1	a	The best Sandbox game made to date if you havnt picked this beast up your nuts!!!!
5864	1	a	got spookt by t-rex 10/10
2484	1	a	Shot Velocoraptor while flying on my jetpack. Got chased by giant crocodile 10/10
6193	1	a	Pretty darn good, and only cost pocket change. Thanks to my buddy for gifting it to me.  The cash shop seems to be ALL COSMETICS, so no pay2win. Very happy about this.   You cannot go wrong with this game.
516	1	a	Yeah, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! Como molarl
4031	0	a	i bought the game and now i don't have it anymore WTF
5314	1	a	Very fun game if you have some friends to play with!!
1936	0	a	&gt;DO NOT BUY &lt; even when it hits 0,99 DONT BUY STEAM SHOULD HAVE A DEL BUTTON FOR THIS ONE
3730	0	a	i would rather play other shooters like call of duty     its not bad but its not good 45/100
21	1	a	I can not get game VII to load at all and i cant get steam support. I purchased 50.00 in games and no support.
1679	1	a	It's fun, game has some depth and progression...all for $0.50!
3699	0	a	Enough, already: Games=art
665	1	a	i cant even play i lod it up and it crashed ugh pls fix thx
5303	1	a	This game is really interesting! its a game whereby conventional fps would seem very lacking in. Basically this games can at take at least 10 hour of your time. to actually test everything out! However its recommended if you search up for guide about the control , because this game is not newbie friendly! so its something the developer should keep note of! as well as the repetitive of the maps! as well as objective!.. other than that you should find the game quite interesting! =)
243	1	a	+ Story was absolutely ridiculous, but enjoyable + The game is already 5 years old, but has aged well + Open-world Manhattan is a blast to stomp around in free-roam + Your mutations/powers are well-varied and the game is absolutely bursting with upgrades and unlocks + Being able to imitate other NPCs can be fun, especially when consuming base commanders and taking over military strongholds + You can hijack military vehicles, which can help break up the monotany of your typical mindless killing sprees + Voice-acting was surprisingly well-done, especially that of the main antagonist  - Visuals and character models were lacking, even taking into account that the game came out in 2009 - Stolen weapons (ie. rifles) had horrible mechanics and felt forced; the game may as well not have introduced it - Your character moves like an idiot when holding a weapon (of which there are only two types, ugh)
1766	1	a	I was on the final wave and a T-Rex ate me whole. 10/10
418	1	a	Easy to play, hard to master sandbox action game. You have a lot of superpower and freedom to eat everyone in the city. However, it can be dull at times especially because there are too many movements to master (and they are not that easy!) and the movement can be chaotic. During the battle, it's even worse, you will be attacked by nonstop armies and hunters.   Prototype is a good and enjoyable game, however its execution is flawed. I still like it though because there are not too many games that give you freedom to jump high (and hover) on skyscrapers.
1748	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME SHOOOOOOOOO MUCH. I AM NOT BUY BUT THE PICTURES ARE LOOK MANY GOODS
1175	1	a	Heeey and this is my review about the game  You are a little robot, with asmall hover jet and some machine gun.  It's sort of a mario game, because u have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives if you die, you have the option to be teleported to your last checkpoint. Graphics are a little bit, classic? it's not high tech at all, same goes for backgrounds. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D  If you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.  If you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though. Game has some puzzle elements. The game is calm, music is calm.  Game is okay if u like platforming. Otherwise wait for a discount.  7/10
105	1	a	If u have anger issues buy this game!
4585	0	a	This game is mad budget and really boring. Go play a game with a real horde mode like ME3 MP.
2122	1	a	Me: 'Might as well buy it for the price'  1 HOUR LATER  Me: 'Okay so up to now i've killed loads of dinosaurs in mech suits and NOW im playing a christmas map shooting Santa as he holds a minigun'   11/10
2830	1	a	It was decently amusing but in the end the limited animation and detail was just too unmoistening and I got bored. I'm sure very young children would enjoy it a lot though, as long as they aren't intelligent enough to of been spoiled by the more advanced FPS games out there.
3904	1	a	8/8 this game is great 
1437	1	a	Yoshi's Island + Half-Life + 21 cents on sale = fun.
2275	1	a	It was good
2334	1	a	Grab some friends, and have the experience of your life.
4620	0	a	Very fun trailer. All negative critic comes from famous game observers and positive comments from some random guys, I just glad i didn't see what it was before, because after 3 YEARS OF SUPPORTING it's just terrible.
2066	1	a	I have played this for a few hours and I am willing to say that I want to play more.  For this picetag, it was way more fun then I expected.  Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of work to be done on this game, but you can not beat the 1 euro price tag.  PROS: -Tons of people online. -It's a game about shooting dinosaurs. -Vehicles are very cool. -Controls are intuitive and easy to understand. This is one of those games that doesn't need a tutorial. -1 euro. Cheap enough to try out without feeling ripped off if you don't like it.  CONS: -Menus feel unfinished / buggy. -Vehicles are incredibly overpowered. Especially the flying ones, as dinosaurs have little to no anti-air. -Not enough feedback to see if you hit or not, you notice this especially when you play as the dinosaurs. -Weapons could need more 'umph'.  I would not recommend you buy this at full price, but with a discount you can't go wrong with Dino Horde.

2319	1	a	Very fun game for a good price, not a 50 dollar game.
4841	0	a	It's pretty bad
1230	1	a	Made a 4 cent profit on the game after selling the dropped trading cards. The game is a cute and very fun platformer, that deserves the good reception it has enjoyed on Steam (91% positive reviews). What more do you need to know?  5/5 would get 0.04â¬ of wallet credit and a great game again.
1423	1	a	This is an awesome game! It somewhat compares to Super Mario Bros. 3, but way more awesome! It has a cool soundtrack, awesome mechanics, and cool level design. But recently it keeps crashing, which is a shame... Great game though!
1302	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
4804	0	a	i bought it 0.49$ so worth it for me LOL Uhhhh... this game need to devolope much things sort of AI and game play
2176	1	a	this game stopped me from cutting 10\10 
4170	1	a	The best game, I love it. It has it all, 10/10!! Get it, it is worth it.
4824	1	a	A better dinosaur game than ARK: Survival Evolved
712	1	a	It's like solitaire, except... Oh. Wait. No. Yeah. It's like solitaire. Wait forever for the cards you need to appear to finish one of multiple straight flushes you set up to win the game.
3386	1	a	Its buggy in a funny way. It's definatly worth it, and better than most games with this concept.  PS: I hir a T-Rex in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a knife, so thats a big plus.
365	0	a	I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.  Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:  â¢ Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.  â¢ It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.  â¢ The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.  There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.
341	0	a	Not as good as it seems. Despite its an open world game it's sorta buggy, And sometimes your computer will lag if your surrounded by many enemies. Sometimes you will be attacked from many places and you'll get hurt without knowing where the enemy is shooting from. But, hey if you like the game good for you.
5760	1	a	I bought this game because of the fact that theres no possible way i can buy a game for 99 cents and not atleast get my money back in fun and i was right to me this game is one of the funnest games just for survival alone and i recomended for anyone! plus it has freaking dinosaurs....
1022	0	a	Horrible game. Doesnt even load, and no one can fix it. Not even the producers can fix it. DONT BUY IT IF ON PC!
5756	1	a	If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.  If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.  If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.
873	1	a	Actually rather entertaining, if not a bit short. Gory but fun!
2958	1	a	So good! Got it on sale for cheap and is very replay-able!
5907	1	a	Game is good but it have vere bad optimization
5915	1	a	Never plaid such a fun game i have had it for 2 days and ive played for 26 hours and for only 0.99 its a creazy good deal.
4651	0	a	Ordinary, recycled, and just plain confusing as there is no tutorial. Wasted a $1.09 I could have spent on a chocolate bar that would have been much more satisfying than this game.
1564	1	a	In just a little over 3 years, this decade of gaming will be coming to a close. Eventually, when we're all just a bunch of nostalgiac old folks looking back at this era, what are we going to remember most? In a discouraging period of unfinished games and broken promises, which productions will truly stand above the rest, leaving their mark on videogame history? I've been a gamer as long as I can remember. I've been waiting for that 'perfect game', the one that grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go until you've experienced every little ounce of detail the developers so masterfully placed within its frame. Today, I'm ecstatic to announce that my wait is over. All the years of sifting through garbage have finally paid off. ORION: Prelude is the game that I'm taking with me to my deathbed. Even at surface level, ORION: Prelude is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Never before have we encountered such extensive level design that truly leaves the player breathless. The first time I stomped into the world of ORION: Prelude as the bold, massive Spinosaurus, I was nearly brought to tears. ORION: Prelude does not care that this decade still has a few years left. It's fully prepared to present itself in all its prehistoric glory as the best game in recent history. The intricately crafted but comfortable controls, gorgeous level design, and gripping story leave me yearning for nothing more. It's all I've ever wanted in a game.
638	0	a	As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean â¥â¥â¥â¥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.
3082	1	a	Dinos and guns       that is all you need to know
2661	1	a	honestly really enjoy this game purchased it for less then a dollar and expected such crap. currently busy with gta 5 on PC and bloodeborn on ps4 but definatly keeping this game installed
1221	1	a	Great game for free time and worth trying !!!
4754	1	a	Killing dinos is what i do :D
2165	1	a	9/10  bought it for the slomo
6542	0	a	Just another game that doesn't take itself seriously. Could be fun with friends, just to enjoy shooting at dinosaurs and see them chewing on human-made machines (?) Not great, not bad, if you're into Jurassic Park check it out.
3028	0	a	this game has changed names 3 times since i've owned it.  it hasn't gotten 3 times better yet.
3942	1	a	ITS VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!1  but please its too slow and laggy no servers ... kind of, its really badass to quickscope sum dinos in the head  i really recomend it btw its cheap
6006	1	a	This is my favourite game that i own hands down. I find myself on this for hours every time i blow the dust off my PC. 79p you can not go wrong here :D
5837	0	a	Tried changing the resolution from 1280x960 or whatever crap it was on to my 5:4 1280x1024. NOPE. The setting doesn't exist. They have 16:9, 16:10, and 4:3. But not 5:4. When I applied my graphics settings, the game went black and my screen was constantly blinking. alt+tab didn't do anything and ctrl+alt+del would bring up Task Manager, but still wouldn't let me use it because my screen was blinking. Alt+F4 did nothing to it as well. Had to restart my computer.  TL;DR  -Stupid resolution settings -Game crashed my computer before I even started playing
4210	1	a	awesome game definentally worth the 99 cents (on sale) perfect for a relaxing time! 
497	1	a	Enjoy a great sense of freedom as you run through the plague infested streets with an arm turned into a sword. Violent action, conspiracy and apocalypse awaits you in this awesome game with an equally awesome sequel(Prototype 2) awaiting you after you've completed it .
359	0	a	dont buy if you're on windows 8 as there is no windowed mode and you will lag like hell. and no it is not coz i have a bad laptop as im able to play games like mirrors edge, borderlands saints row and other game witch are newer.
1232	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ yeah  I am beep  the master and ruler of the galaxy  I fly around ina spaceship â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ up  on inferior organism through the universe  with my awesome all terrain robot and dark matter  machine launcher cannon
6242	1	a	I killed a Trex by ramming my helicopter up it's â¥â¥â¥. 11/10 would do it again.
778	1	a	
1561	0	a	Do not buy or touch this game - it is run by filth. See below.  I recently read about all the evil, lying, deceitful shenanigans the company has been up to. A great summary here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   2 of many of their stunts...  1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).  2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.  I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.
2840	1	a	Worth of it's price. this game is cheap at it's full price and on Steam sales it's even cheaper. I expected a game that is fun for couple of minutes and I got what i wanted. Although 4 pack was a waste in my case, since none of my friends that i gave it to wanted to play with me, but if you buy it for yourself, It's great!   The only problem i have with this game is that there are some small bugs and i think it could be optimalised just a bit better. I've met the recommended requirements and have to play on low quality to make sure it runs smoothly. But that's a minor complaint.
5102	1	a	This game has the premise of being a killing floor but with dinosaurs.  This game is fun , but it falls short a bit later when all you see is dinosaur blood, then you're all like:  Why am i playing this? It is very cheap tho, if you don't have it buy it it has an hour or three of fun then it is all grinding. I give this game a 5/10
2072	1	a	The best game you can get for only 1â¬.
4463	1	a	SOOOOOOOOO.... CHEAP :D this game is awsome
1892	0	a	One of the worst games I have played
3755	1	a	Don't trust the rating! This is one of the best fps's I've ever played. I recommend it if you like Halo and Jurrassic Park.
5683	1	a	this game is incredibly fun. for only 1 dollar i get to 360 noscope dinosaurs. I CANNOT STOP PLAYING! BUY THIS GAME NOW!
3392	0	a	The unistall button works.
3090	1	a	Cool game with alot of different FPS genres mixed into it, but feels incomplete. Who cares though its a super fun game for just $1.
1157	1	a	HARDER THAN DARK SOULS. CHEAPER THAN DARK SOULS.   I can't tell if that's good or bad?   11/10.
4854	1	a	dont even. no. just. stop. no. dont. no. it isnt good. yes, i bought it. idk why. just let me go cry and wish i had used the money to buy a large rope and rickety stool instead.
124	1	a	Totally, hands down, recommend this game.   You're a killing mention, unstoppable, that's what the city of New York sees you as, but that isn't all.  The character you play as, 'Alex Mercer' has some secrets, those secrets were within his memory until he's been exposed to a virus, known as the Blacklight virus.  Play through the game to discover what has happened to you; 'Alex Mercer'.  The virus you've been exposed to has taken over your brain and body and is now 'you'.  You can kill and 'consume' any person you see, after killing and consuming you can shapeshift to the person you've last consumed. That includes civilians, military, and important military officers.  When you shapeshift into them, you can ultimatly sneak through areas you 'Alex Mercer' cannot.  When you kill and consume the person of your choice, not only do you shapeshift into them, but you also get their memories, and skills. For example, if you kill and consume a helicopter poliot, you will gain the knowledge to operate a helicopter.   Ultimatly this can be played as a sandbox game, this game never forces you to do objectives, you can always roam free in the city of New York.   Quick thing to add, I have a 1920x1080 16:9 monitor, and this game doesn't seem to have that high of a resolution, so you'll have to search up a quick fix for that. 
1709	1	a	If you hate dinosaurs, then this is your golden opportunity.  Jokes aside, it's no doubt worth the money. It provides exciting and sometimes terrifying (spinosaurus, deinosuchus, t-rex) combat against various kinds of dinosaurs. You get to use many types of weapons and other tools of destruction such as VTOLs and tanks.   Pros: - Surprising amounts of depth and customization via classes, their weapons and augments that let you play the way you want - Unreal engine means it runs smoothly and provides great visuals - Voice commands and taunts to help you communicate and annoy easily - Gigantic (and smaller) dinosaurs with very impressive animations and diverse approaches to combat - A leveling system to give you a feel of progression and achievement - An open-world game mode which I've not yet tried but sounds very interesting - The developers seem committed and appear to release updates frequently - Many large and beautiful maps to fight on  Cons: - It still needs some work, certain things such as player characters (and the mech) have lackluster animations - While it doesn't really hold any merit in deciding if a game is good or not, its 'Metascore' is low (*) - I'm unsure of this, but it doesn't seem like you're able to earn any in-game cosmetics    * = It depends on the person whether or not they think Metacritic provides an accurate review of the product. Dino Beatdown (the game's former name) didn't go too well and this most likely means that certain people will be discouraged from buying ORION: Dino Horde. There are rumors swirling around Metacritic, saying that the reviewers are paid off by larger corporations to make their product seem better. Besides, reviews are essentially opinions.
1573	1	a	Since the original release (which I never played), the game has been completely remade. So the old scores aren't valid.  It's a little rough at the start when you're figuring out how to play it, as there's no tutorial. But it's easy to pick up.  Then you kill a stegosaurus with a bow to the face, mow down a pack of raptors with a supercharged laser beam, and shoot a t-rex in the face with a tank.  Extremely fun, very frantic gameplay.  'Run or shoot. RUN OR SHOOT?' 'BOTH.'
2358	1	a	I fully recommend it, gives you more fun than pricier games. Rawrrrr.. rrr.
6385	1	a	Honestly a lot more fun than I thought, it's a great game if you find yourself in a cycle of playing just a couple games all the time.
6320	1	a	It is decent fun with friends for a short while, worth its price but very basic in gameplay and design.
3138	1	a	Uses credits to buy no fall damage upgrade. You're being bad and missing 360 noscopes on T-Rexs when suddenly you're flying upwards. WTF? That annoying pterodactyl who's been â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up the whole game grabbed you and now it's taking you up in the sky for you know, 'reasons'. You shoot that dino 98438593458934589395043 times until you pistol whip it. Finally! You're free! You look down, you're 5000 feet from the ground. OH â¥â¥â¥â¥! You close your eyes for the unavoidable demise about to come. You open your eyes 20 seconds later. I'm alive? OHHHH I bought that upgrade. Well thank Gaben I did! Well I better get back to 360 noscoping those T-Rexs... Here comes one now. GET READY NOW DI-. Eaten by the T-rex. DAMMIT I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE UNABLE TO BE CHOMPED UPGRADE! Lesson: Buy all the Upgrades. Also, get good at 360 noscoping you scurb.  11/10 Using 99 cents for this game= Logic Wait... Logic=Logitech Logitech is 8 letters long and Logic is 5. 8-5=3 The Illuminati Triangle has 3 sides. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED!  Now stop reading this and just buy the game.
71	1	a	Space Quest Owns The World!!!!
4990	0	a	NEEDS OPTIMIZATION DAMNIT QUIT BUYING IT BECAUSE ITS .99 CENTS!!!
5338	1	a	Fun $0.99 game buy it if you want to shoot dinosaurs and what-not....
82	1	a	Highly reccomend this for Space Quest 1 EGA alone. Seriously its full of so many great pop culture references and is just a great game all around.
1533	1	a	As much as I absolutely despise games that try to be Halo, Doom and Dead Space all shifted into one blobby, stinking mess, I have to admit, this game caught me by surprise. When I saw the game on the Steam Store, and the big, hunky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with some sort of shiny, LED space suit caught my eye as he stood rather awkwardly next to the title, I thought 'Oh, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, not this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ again.' However, then I began playing the game and, over the span of about four hours, I realized what it was all about.  Most games pride themselves on intriguing characters, amazing, scripted scenes and all-out fantastic storylines. But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. 'Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game' Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. 'Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the â¥â¥â¥â¥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you â¥â¥â¥â¥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?' With Orion, that kind of every-day â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.  However, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming 'To infity and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.
5722	1	a	Never reviewed a game before this, all i have to say is this game takes me back to when games were fun for the sake of it instead of being over complicated. I paid Â£1.49 for a 4 pack and gave it to some friends. its truly superb just endless fun shooting dinosaurs. Plus i killed a T-rex in slow mo with a gatiling gun, enough said. 10/10
1479	1	a	I really like this game and it is worth it. Its just another one of those really fun indie games
3344	1	a	Don't bother with the metascore.
2258	1	a	Message me if you want this game I,ve got a gift key that I will give to you guys for a 5â¬ worth steam item or paysafecard or also a steam gift card
5007	1	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥ I never bought this, sooo um review probably a piece of steaming dog feces but probably good so [don't] buy it because is [isn't] good. There review done now to play a [better] game!

4780	0	a	its not very good its on par with or slightly better than browser based games
5112	1	a	Great game, but it needs more video and graphics options.. for $1....Definitly worth it though.. 7/10
3576	1	a	definitly a awesome game  like killing floor with dinosaurs
2216	1	a	It is great fun with Friends!
3154	1	a	but... i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing paid for this game!!! i want a refund this instant, not saying the game was horrible, but wtf steam, can we get refunds or what!? But in all seriousness, this game isnt that bad, and actually fun.  Game does require a pc with decent specs. my laptop is skat on the road so i cant play this game to the fullest. still fun tho
5904	1	a	Damn this game is legit, the price is unreal.
1568	1	a	Turn off in game music. Play Jurassic Park theme in background. WIN
4483	1	a	One does not simply club a T-rex to death.  But yeah, it happens here. IS THAT NOT ENOUGH? ARE YOU NOT YET PERSUADED TO BUY TIS GAME?!  
4493	0	a	I have no idea, a long long time ago this had a free weekend and i played it and it was actually kinda fun. i bought they game now cause its dirt cheap so why not and it is awful. Performance is extremely bad and poor optimization. games that look better even on lowest setting i can run them on higher settings anyways. this game looks awful and even on lowest settings im getting all sorts of frame drops and stutters. Theres not many servers, and rarely any fun servers with fun people. I don't see big dinos as much as i nearly used to back on that free weekend. the guns are nearly unusable, having no recoil and it feels like im shooting a pea shooter, yet dinos die extremely easy, and even on the hardest difficulty, i found it really easy. the vehicles feel stiff and also nearly unusable. not a good game, not even worth 99 cents
4573	0	a	Personally, I hate it. I mean really not worth even 99 cents. The graphics are mediocre at best and the level objectives are compleatly confusing.not to mention that i don't even think you can play as a dinosaur in a game that revolves around them. It's like the developers said, 'Hey, you know what would be cool? If we had 'Call of Duty' and 'Jurassic Park' and put em' together!' Honestly, it looks like the game was made on a toaster. ---&gt;DO NOT BUY&lt;---
1616	1	a	If u liek Primal Carnage, or at least shooting dinos, ur probably gunna liek this
3766	1	a	Just a simple fun game. I'm not going to give this game a bad rating just because the company that made it is having some problems. As for the real question, is the game any good ? I have to say it is. To me that is all that matters.  The Good I went into an easy survival server for my first time playing. It is a simple set up go into the building that has what you want to buy, and get it. The more dinosaurs you kill the better stuff you can buy. The gameplay fells relaxed, no rush just fun. The bosses are large dinosaurs which are fun to kill.  The Bad The Pterodactyls are what killed teammates more then the T-rex. The Jeep turns by moving the mouse, while the tank turns with the 'A' &amp; 'S' keys.  The Ugly The only ugly thing is if you want to play this with a controller. I like to use a conroller when I can, because keyboard, 7 mouse kills my wrist. But this game doesn't feel right.   With that said using keyboard, and mouse was easy this game. You just find a good spot, wait for the next wave, and mow them down. Alot easier on your wrist when you're mostly using just the mouse.
2027	1	a	Many hours after playing this...untill, YOU notice THAT IT IS ONL'Y 1$ WITH SO MANY REVIEWS AND YOUR SO AMAZED. 
1331	1	a	This Game Is Awesomeness:    I payed 20 cents for this, after playing it I feel this game  deserves at least 10-15 bucks.
853	1	a	6
993	1	a	This game is intresting with the mechanics and storyline and also after u get all the abilities u will need to discover some of them secrets which is awesome
4309	1	a	Fun game! Graphics are like Team Fortress 2! It's really worth the 99 cents. I would recommend this game to anybody who's interested in first person shooters. Its a well build game, and I love it. 
5603	1	a	This is a perfect example of a bad game turned good. Shoot dinos in the face and get interesting upgrades. Graphics are meh, dinos glitch out (in funny ways lel) and the sound design is wonky, but it's a buck. What more could you ask for a buck?  Honestly though, if this game were free, no one would play it.
6420	1	a	THIS IS 99 CENTS! we should get it i played before and is so AWSOME! if you like dinosaurs and like tech and guns buy this game now before the offer ends

5557	0	a	Why da F*CK did i buy this game for 0.99,- ? i dont know. 
5735	0	a	I bought it because it was onsale and they said they transformed the game into something amazing, they were wrong.  -half the time the gun animation doesn't even play  -the dinos still spin around and dont have very good ai  -the character holds the pistol like a assault rifle.
1443	1	a	FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET CARD DROPS : I got my drops in 9.1 hours of gameplay - drops are not fast for this game. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY THIS GAME : Steam, please. Beep beep and money goes for a super cool strategy game. I recommend buying this if you have too much time on your hands and have some money to waste. Go ahead, buy it.

1973	1	a	Fun little dinosaur game that can be a ton of fun with friends. Would reccomend it if you love accomplishing insane feats such as killing a T-rex with a rocket launcher. Satisfaction garenteed!
1276	0	a	Nicely polished game, but gets boring quite soon.  Buy it only at a high discount (&gt;90%) and only for collectible cards.  ^_^
51	0	a	So nobody will read this as the game is around 20 years old or something.  However i'd like to write that it is a disturbing trend that 'old school' games are being rejuvinated and made available to the modern gamer and tagged with a rather hefty price too.  Was this game (or series of games) worth the value? Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.  Imagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!  As a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.  Feel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.  So. In summary:  - game collection is too expensive - game doesn't work - â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
6520	1	a	This game is really fun! It's got Dinosaurs, vehicles, mechs, and so many customizable weapons. I highly reccomend it playing it with friends, as it only adds to the experiance. What more is there to say? Get it now!
2051	1	a	dollar game dollar fun  unexpectedly fun (with friends)
1781	0	a	I think the metacriti score of 36/100 is correct kinda lifeless and dumb to be honest. i had 0 health but lived ?!?!?!?!?
797	1	a	Interestingly enough, I ended up picking up Shank 2 before the original. Don't ask why, I honestly don't remember other than it was somewhat of an impulse buy as I loved the demo. If you've played the original Shank, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't, Shank is a grind house style 2D action game where you shoot, slash, and sometimes shank your way through waves of enemies. The artwork is all 2D in a hand drawn style and looks beautiful. Excellent character animations (especially death animations) really bring the game to life. While the original Shank was relatively bare bones in terms of level presentation Shank 2 has a lot going on in these levels. It's not exactly Rayman Origins but it does look pretty great.  In terms of game play this is a huge step up from the original. There is a much better counter system, the grab system is a little more robust, and the game actually encourages you to try different weapons as there are far more enemy types in this game compared to the original. In the original, I made it through the entire game using the starter weapons, which is not how Shank 2 plays. Shank 2's levels are longer, more challenging, and require you to really think about your load out before each mission as you can't change on the fly like in the original Shank. Whereas in the original Shank the game was divided into bite sized levels (which helps a ton when attempting hard mode by the way), Shank 2's levels are fuller, longer, and always feature a boss battle at the end. While most bosses are actually quite more challenging than the original Shank there are a few that are pretty cheap and winning takes more luck than skill. Fortunately, once you get to a boss you have a checkpoint (even on hard mode) so you really get a chance to learn what you are doing wrong and how to overcome the enemy.  As far as controls go, however, I can't recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. I never even attempted it but as with most 2D, side scrolling games a controller is almost necessary for success. Fortunately, if you have a controller, the game controls beautifully. Actions are very responsive which helps when dealing with swarms.  In addition to the main story mode (which has two difficulties that don't stack with achievements) there is an online co-op survival mode. This is a welcome addition as the original Shank only had local co-op (which was fun, if a bit easy). This mode, however, is VERY difficult. There are a number of different stages and you are dealing with almost every type of enemy in the game. It takes practice, but with another player it's doable.   Regarding achievements there are far more than the first Shank (almost twice as many). Most of these are kill grinds with different weapons or level specific actions in addition to difficulty modes as well. The survival mode achievements are tough, but definitely possible if you have someone else. Trying it solo is not recommended.  Although I hadn't played the original Shank until after the sequel I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The visual style is amazing, the game play is fun and challenging, and even the soundtrack is pretty great. I would highly recommend playing the original Shank (even if it is an inferior game overall) as it will get you used to the play style. Even though it's not as good as the sequel it's still definitely worth playing and if you have a friend and two controllers, you can do the co-op campaign which is short and easy but still fun with two people).  I highly recommend Shank 2 to any action fans out there. The action is fast, fun, and extremely violent. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight (most requiring different strategies or weapon load outs) and some great boss battles.  8.5/10
5167	1	a	I don't know why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyone would want to play this game. Dinosaurs are awesome but after you play this game, you'll think that all dinosaurs are homosexuals.
1228	1	a	i got this game for 13 cents  +has nice graphics +has a cool asf menu selector like you fly in a spaceship to pick what map you want to play  10/10 id pay 13 cents again
6155	1	a	Ok so heres what happened i played orion and i was going to buy the sword and also in survival then i ran inside a rock fell through the map and like an hour later....................................................................................................I DIED...
2881	1	a	Classic survival game,can be fun with a friend and there is a lots of achievements for hunters!Graphics are not that bad there is a day and night cycle and rainy weather.8/10
3230	0	a	Bought this game game for 99p and it feels like a waste of money. Incredibly linear, unloved and unoriginal.
276	1	a	10/10 My favorite game of all time. PS: Badass Anti-Hero.
361	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
4592	0	a	Fun idea, looked fun, was fun for one round. After figuring out how to play the fun really drops off.
2105	1	a	Can't go wrong only 59 cents for 4 copies!!!!!! Totally worth it graphics are pretty good for an indie game, lots and lots of fun, coop is good (big community,not laggy and supports 5 players), third person or first person, huge levels and well designed game! 9/10
1538	1	a	A 6 year olds wet dream
1507	1	a	Got 360 no-scoped by a T-Rex throwing a rock at me  11/10 IGN
2276	1	a	For Â£1 this is amazing! The game i have imagined creating as a kid is finaly a reality now i am an old man.  Tempted a few mates to get this in the Â£2.99 bundle, and everyone one is now loving it.  Does not deserve that low MetaScore! Co-op, Jet packs, Invis, turrets, tanks, mech and Dinos... what more could you ask for. Having alot of fun.  I would love to get in contact with the team though for some improvements. Animation has improved but could go further.  Optimisation is a given. I have a uber rig, and while it isnt taxing at full more than 30%, the system is running soo hot, even with water cooling. Even WatchDogs at max doesnt make it that hot.  Cant wait to see how improves in Aug 14 
2928	1	a	Best $0.50 I've ever spent!!! This game is addicting!
282	1	a	suprisinlgy good...
794	1	a	Shank 2 is not a thing to remember for long, but the things it brings are undoubtedly bloody, crazy, weird and, best of all, entertaining like the first game. Although it's a slightly crippled remake of Shank, it's still good, but the gameplay just seems icky when compared to its superior predecessor.        Shank 2 - Ad&nbsp;
885	1	a	10/10.  That's it. Just 10/10.
4600	1	a	If this game potato, cheap potato.
2482	1	a	I am a simple guyuy I liek memes I like games i like dinosaur this game is no memes but very fun â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥d dinosaur game If i want meme i play undertale, if i want fun i play ORION: Prelubed
4597	0	a	haha lol 'it is unreal tournament combines with jurassic park' some people are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.... and 'halo and tribes in one' ? this game is fram from those titles, and the game sucks aso much â¥â¥â¥â¥
4718	0	a	Bought it on 2012 by the name Orion: Dino Horde and is a 4man pack too ! Played it once and left in my Library till today.  December 2015 Review.   How far Orion it has improve since this game sit untouched many years after my first gameplay. I would never imagine myself to touch this game again. It leave me a very really bad impression after my first gameplay but today Orion has make a difference in comparison to heyday.  I came back after I found out the reversal of the review been gaven, it goes from Negative to to Positive.One gotta see to believe. What can I say after a try out then letting this piece of game sit unattenended?!  Well... first of all, Do not expect any fancy or detailed graphic on this games,soundtrackwise is pretty decent and good to go with; to this you will find yourself TODAY Orion:Prelude is kind of Pretty-Cheesilly-Wonky-Onehella of Fun shooting game !! Seriously this game is FUN ! You will get alot of gun,ride a jeep,steer a tank,handle a Goliath and fly a heli-hover-plane-thingy. Not to mention there is lot of skin and hat to be applied from.  This game get really cheap when on steam sales. Buy 1 for yourself maybe a 4 man pack too as well. Sit back,enjoy the laughter and shooting frenzy with your friends. This game does earn a worth to be in your library. Give it a try today. It was insanely cheesy fun.  Well I feel like I'm the Marine in The Avatar and fighting that Blue Monkey and Toruk Maktor ! We are tryin to take over their planet after all !!!
2722	1	a	Addicting. Simply addicting. You may be thinking 'Boy, this is cheaper than Garry's Mod on sale and has science fiction elements and dinosaurs. This game is probably a piece of crap or just a Dino D Day rip off'- YOU ARE WRONG. This game has a LOT to offer. I just got it yesterday and I have a hard time NOT playing it. There's too many epic factors to it. The only complaint I have is a low amount of weapons. Don't get me wrong, there's enough to keep yourself satisfied...but there isn't much of a balance. Some weapons may be around the same price, but one is way better than the other. It's really cheap, so buy it, install it, and give it ago.
3680	0	a	When you jump. Your legs don't move. It's just scary...
546	1	a	even though ths game came out in 2009 im playing it in 2014 and its still impresive. the combat is joius and it is amaxingley gory and brutal some compare it to hlks ltimate destruction and i mst agrey it is the more mature cousain who doesnt mind showng you what you can be if yo complete the game. there is a new game plus+ so that yo can feel like a god when yo replay it whch some games shold do. im looking at you dishonored. this is one of the best games i have ever played and say that it is a 9/10 its not perect because the main persone you are fightng s easyer than the first fight.
6163	1	a	For me this game has alot of potential!!!!!! For me i thing there could be more options with weapons and armor but overall the game was worth it to me
4452	1	a	cool and good co-op 
4264	1	a	I Think it's a good game to have in your steam library. It looks good.   Rating: 8/10
3945	1	a	not worth the dollar unless yourcanadian then your dollar isnt worth â¥â¥â¥â¥
4242	1	a	i like to play orion prelude
1003	0	a	Crashes as soon as you log in, do not buy.
804	1	a	If you enjoy retrostyle sidescrollers with a modern feel, along with some dark humor and awesome game mechanics then this is for you. I've been playing this game since it came out in 2012 and I've been playing it since. Before this I used to play the first Shank. I usually play on the PS3, but this is for my gaming on the go =P
2394	1	a	went on a driving cruise with boosters  11/10
654	1	a	+Interesting gameplay (same combos as Poker, played more like Solitaire but where you can steal cards from opponent) +Nice music (though gets repetitive by end of campaign) +Easy to learn rules, quick but adequate tutorial +Great interface -Mainly good for one playthrough (approx 10 hours depending on skill) -First Turn Advantage factor is significant -Role-playing/Story is secondary to the card gameplay. (all conversations can be skipped safely)  ?Game will supposedly get free update putting multiplayer in the game (hotseat first). No paid DLC.
1484	1	a	im not sure about this game, the mechanics are cool and the whole physics engine behind it works really well i would suggest it for a little local flash game fun if you know what i mean.  the game runs smoothly and probably has the worst story line in history ( still better than twilight) but for a flash game it really is fun to play around with  I rate it 6/10
1884	1	a	The Metacritic score is a lie!
1193	0	a	I got this game for cheap. I'm happy I didn't pay the full price, since the game doesn't work. The resolution of the game is messed up and I can't run it in a windowed mode, even with startup commands. This means that I can't even start the actual game.
6201	1	a	If you dont have money for ARK: Surivival Evolved this is great game for you
633	1	a	Amazing game. Well done tutorials. Excellent roaming. A plethora of optionals. Tight main quest. Solid story. A number of different playstyles are accepted, and hell of a lot of fun!  I love this game.
2452	1	a	Probably one of the dumbest most unrealistic games I have ever seen.  Also one of the most fun.  This game doesn't try to be real and gritty like so many games now days. It just tries to be fun and whats not to love? Dinosaurs, helicopters, tanks, mech suits, multiple unreal - like pvp modes, play as a dinosaur.  Using a laser sword to kill a triceratops? 420/69 GOTY - IGN
3343	0	a	Where my dogs at man? Where my medic dogs at man?
3254	1	a	First off, that metacritic score is not legit it's for a different game, This game is a really great action dino game that will have you hooked for hours. There's one problem other then some buggs not big ones only minor, It isn't as fun by yourself , get a friend. Just get the game! 6.5/10
3418	1	a	By far the best coin I've spent in a game...  Go get it.   You won't find better shooter at this price. Fun, massive killing, coop or versus, lot of stuff to do.  7/10.
4150	1	a	This game has a ton of poetential. Its cool, Great physics, easy-to-handle guns, and a good concept, there are bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't have those. Give the game time, and it will grow more and more like it has in the past couple years.
4700	1	a	A quick pro/cons list of this game:  Pros: -Looks decent -Tons of game modes -Tons of character customization -Runs well  Cons: -Not the best graphics or animations -Not a huge playerbase -Really weird UI that reminds me of an arcade cabinet  The game is definitely fun, isn't too involving, easy to jump into a game on a moments notice and have fun. Great if you have a few friends.
4450	0	a	This is by far the worst game I have ever bought. I only paid $0.99 for it and feel I was ripped off. There is nothing about this game that is original, the gameplay is horrible and the developers should be ashamed for releasing such garbage. I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy as it would be to cruel.
2566	1	a	Pros- Fun horde gameplay Huge amounts of weapons DINOSAURS Mechs Tanks VTOLS Three classes Dinosaurs Swords Great looking graphics Reminicent of HALO Mulitple gamemodes Co-op PVP You can hover around a T Rex with a jetpack shooting it with a bow and arrow  Cons- Maps all seem similar Takes time to get guns  Hitboxes are buggy Random lag Some people on servers are evil  Overall- 8/10 would bang again
6029	1	a	I launched game for the first time and i joined a random game.. 2 guys were rly good to me now i have 2 more frends bcs this game. Everyone are frendly and want to help you.. Buy this game its amaizing!
5502	1	a	The animations make my sides hurt. Near-static dinosaurs are hurling toward you, and something about the human running animation is so awkward to look at. It's quite buggy, but it didn't really hurt my experience. I was battling against floating raptor heads, for instance. Quite hilarious. For $0.99, it's pretty good.
5408	0	a	When this game first came out in beta it was known as orion : dino beatdown...It was a complete and utter junkheap then...Hardly anything worked and the gameplay was crap.However with the most recent update 12/21/13 it has slowly started to redeem itself and is slowly starting to become a good game.   * Never mind its still a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2842	1	a	Just going to say DINO HORDE IS DINORIFI-Well Im â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lame. IT's AMAZING
5983	0	a	It's freexing to death. I don't know why it's popular.
4448	1	a	its a nice game
2688	1	a	don't take this game seriously...
4883	0	a	You know, I somewhat enjoyed this game. Cant really beat this kind of game for .99. I could rally a bunch of friends together and just go shoot dinosaurs. They didnt even have to have good computers. Just adequate ones and were on our way. I recently got my gf a gaming PC, and was going to get her this game.  I apparently had been living under a rock for the past year, as I had no idea the sequel was coming out back in December. I was excited. A better version of the .99 game that I had been playing with friends and loved ones. I decided I wanted to try and buy this game for her so that she could join in on the action. That is when I saw it. That is when I saw 'Mixed' for the recent reviews of this game, when it had generally been good. I had to check out what was up. I had to see what would make so many people badly review this game. Was there a game breaking patch? Nope. Worse.  After reading a myriad of reviews for the game from the recent fall, it became clear that this developer was not as wholesome as they would like to appear to the public. I dug into the recent debacle over the Activision DMCA, and what I saw was mortifying to say the least. A man, the owner of Trek Ind., playing victim and engaging social media wildly, starting far more fires than he could put out. To completely rip off guns from other games, and then blame the artist is shameless. Once is bad luck and I could see that being on the artist. But more than once and I no longer see coincidence. I see involvement. Either it was his idea, or they brought it too him and he gave the go ahead. Whats worse is that the artist likely cant even come forward with their side of the story as this a**hat has threatened to sue everyone for 'slandering' his good name with 'wild accusations'. Probably has some legal team ready to sue the moment he steps forward as they likely made him sign papers that would make him the fall guy in the very likely instance of this happening.  One things for certain: Trek Industries sure has earned a LOT of sheep. Reading through all of the posts defending this is aweful. Yes, Activision handled this poorly. But that DOES NOT excuse the owner of Trek Industies, or his handling of this matter. And then there is all of the other sketchy stuff this man has done... For instance: Funding your own indiegogo campaign to the goal just to get money from suckers. Sad. I dont know whats worse, the practice of this, or the suckers that fell for it.  So with all that said, I wish it wasnt too late to get a refund for this game. I will definitely not be buying the new Orion. And David, if you are reading this, please.... Please.... try to sue me for slander. It would make my day. You dont have a very good case becuase when you do stuff over the internet it is never forgotten
1707	1	a	SOOOOO BAD ITS GOOD  Like super fun. for 1$ on the 4 pack you cant go wrong.
5342	1	a	awesome cuz you shoot dinos and more dinos, then you shoot some more
6024	0	a	This game is like the new Jurassic World..... â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!
3121	0	a	This game is not up to standards. I am very dissapointed in Spiral game studios. I would like a refund, I would like 5 chocolate buscuits and some tomato juice asap. This is to feed my cupboard hobos as they are starving becasue of this game.
1518	1	a	Best 99 cents wasted of my life...
5729	1	a	Look, the game is cool and all and it would be worth a TON more than $1.00 ( $0.74 on sale ), but one thing..... YOU CAN PLAY IT!!!! I TRIED TO PLAY IT AND IT WAS SO LAGGY EVEN AFTER I PUT EVERYTHING TO LOWEST POSSIBLE EVEN THE SOUND, STILL IT WAS WAAAAYY TO LAGGY FOR ME TO EVEN MOVE MY MOUSE IN THE MENU!   Cool game, needs some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ computer suport ~ lewpro
747	0	a	This was pretty confusing, I wound up having to track down a walkthrough pretty quickly. Voices are okay but direction is not - you coud tell they were just reading what they were given with no context. Some more $$ thrown into localization would've helped. Maybe other languages are better.   Apparently this is based off of a novel. Maybe reading that first would've helped make the game more sense, but playing this first makes me completely uninterested in trying to find the novel.
1072	1	a	This had to be, one of the best 19 cents spent.            Just gets hard at level one in desert xD
4940	0	a	Not too bad of a game, but unfortunately, the devs are greedy morons who make no effort to treat their staff well nor clean up their product. The game is also incredibly broken.. play cloaker, cloak every now and then, and dinos run away from you... you're invincible.
1908	1	a	Jet-packs, dinosaurs and sci fi â¥â¥â¥â¥? literally my favorite wave-style fps.

2380	1	a	a good game. rather interesting concept! i quite enjoyed the fact that i can kill those who walk the earth before me! XD
5256	1	a	The perfect drug.
6052	1	a	This game is very original mixing with prehistoric technology also has good controls and excellent gameplay, I really like the idea of putting dinosaurs as enemies and gives it a more interesting touch to the game.  8/10 Good game but lacks some to be a great game.  LolerMan
5304	1	a	High tech and guns + dinos = AWESOME
233	0	a	I'm mildly upset; I've owned a copy of this wonderful game on a console before, and it was just fine. Great, even, I've had a fantastic experience. It has pretty good gameplay, not much in the way of story, but enough fun to leave a nice impression on you.   The reason I'm leaving a negative review is because the PC port is horribly broken right off the bat. It's the sound. The god-awful sound. it feels like it's been revved up to x64 speed. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the port.
412	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. Intense plotline, crazy combat, and freeroam. Different superpowers to choose from, guns, tanks, no driving cars but you can throw them...Company went out of business but I still recommend supporting the game.
2231	1	a	This game makes me think of Halo but with dinosaurs. It is really fun and has a great community.
5588	1	a	Saw this game durring a Sale, was .49 Cents, Thought, 'Hey I got nothing else to spend it on, might just be a boring game'. Boy Was I wrong, Game is very fun and only being a Dollar it's easy to get, Short time Ive played it enjoyed it

1816	1	a	If you want to shoot the dinosaur, this is the gaem 2 play to shoo tthe dinsaaur
5189	1	a	Orion: Prelude is not terrible.   Not Good.  But not terrible. Its a game that you know is kind of bad, but you can have fun with it with friends.  It has very satisfying controls, okay visuals and pretty good gameplay. But screw all that, its dang cheap. Pick it up for a few hours of fun. Its worth it.
6216	0	a	this game is not fun

3361	0	a	June 2014 I've noticed massive improvements since launch, but it's still a terrible game. The narritive voices are a joke, and are only there to hide the fact they don't have proper dinosaur sounds. Every dinosaur pretty much behaves the same way, they just rush at you when you get within a certain distance, and some have ranged attacks, or fly, but they are otherwise the same enemy. The game has a choppy and unpolished feel to it. It's cool that they are adding new things to the game, but the game really needs some polish rather than new game modes and items.
3834	0	a	All I can say is, thank goodness for the free week.   After about 10 minutes of playing, all I want to do is uninstall this crap. I honestly would have been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ had I even wasted the measly $0.99 on this.
2969	0	a	This game blows nuts
6091	1	a	If you like would like to shoot dinos in an fps this game is for you
1306	0	a	My friend gave me this. I had no idea what it was ,and he set me up for an amazing adventure. Needless to say I will be dead soon.
1032	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ will Blow your â¥â¥â¥â¥ off
3516	1	a	Its fun but for me lagish
5415	1	a	So worth the 99 cents. Got tons of laughs, really enjoyable, a bit frightening at time. But overall, a really valuable game to play once and awhile with friends.
3740	0	a	Allthough I did not buy this (My freind gifted it to me) I highly regret installing this broken shell of a game. The port is terrible, even on ultra high graphics the game looks like crap, The team based mechanic is non existant and this is the 'Fixed' version of the game.  PROS: It is 99 cents. CONS: to many to count.
4367	1	a	Knifed a T-Rex's leg to death as a friend blasts a stegosaurus to smithereens. 11/10
1886	0	a	This game is bad
3825	1	a	Slightly badly optimized, with netcode that could do with a LITTLE smoothing, but the true fun of the game is in the brokenness of some of the weapons. Cloaking and backstabbing (never breaking cloak) to your hearts content never gets old. Revolver shooting everything never gets old. Getting enough upgrades that you're basically a walking tank never gets old. It invokes memories of good old COD Zombies, but ten times more broken. Absolutely fun.
1185	1	a	A fun little game that is quite simple but still makes fun. Recommended if you like Puzzle/Indie games.
1956	1	a	I got eaten by a T-rex and got a achievement for it.  10/10
5713	1	a	Just look at the price.
5450	1	a	very easy to setup and play ! 
2433	1	a	The game is all fun and good, but I feel its no fun without friends. You should mee around in it and have fun. The only thing that sets me off is the graphics of the trailer it does not have those graphics unless the current free week is diffrent or im doing something wrong, but the graphics in the trailer show something like Halo 5 the graphics I see in game are practically Halo 3 and its not my computer I can run WoW on the highest setting besides shadow render to the max and the quality of shadow. So it isnt my Pc I even checked settings for the graphics didnt see much change.
3298	1	a	Still better than COD 10/10 
347	0	a	Janky Controls.  Decent Animation  
2265	1	a	Dispite the bad reviews, I have heard about this game, I feel that this game is tons of dino fun.
5848	1	a	cool
5106	0	a	i want my 49 cents back
640	1	a	Fun card dueling game. Uses traditional poker cards / hands, along with special abilities. There's not a whole lot to it, but the gameplay is mildly entertaining. The story isn't very good, but I'll still recommend it if you can find it on sale.
2371	1	a	one of the best game i ever played (that cost 1 dolar:-)
3305	1	a	heard it was bad
6250	1	a	This is the best game ever for the price, it is great. If you want a great game but dont have much money get this
5229	0	a	Got the game from a friend tries to join lobby 3 times ends up playing with russians 10/10    not
4693	0	a	strated to get really ticked off bought the game it worked the first time i tried playing it and now it doesnt even load when i try to play it def waste of$1
1522	1	a	Me and my friends were playing for 2 hours, but when we were almost done with the map, my friend drove us into a rock and we got stuck and we exploded.  11/10
24	1	a	Old Scool Games are the best kind of games
1431	1	a	great game 
2604	1	a	Knifed a T-rex to death 10/10
2547	1	a	10/10 best game you could get for $1
2272	1	a	Great game, reminds me of Halo but with Dinos.
4138	1	a	did you guys take down all the multiplayer? i cant find any servers, and i cant host my own
5950	0	a	I can't play this game. Screen will turn black then crash to desktop upon opening the game.
3186	1	a	Very first time playing just me and a friend, we spawn in have no clue what we are doing. We didnt even realize the round started and got swarmed, we composed ourselves and went on for 4 more rounds. Then a T-rex appears and picks my friend up a flings his lifeless body across the map, i died shortly after. 10/10 would bang
4019	1	a	Me and this game; #Besties.
1792	0	a	Don't buy this blanatant rip-off of halo 1 with dinosaurs. On top of the horrible framerate, graphics, and gamplay you are given very little direction once you start so IF you decide to buy this be sure a friend is able to hold your hand for the first few minutes.
2634	1	a	I would have gladly paid more than 99c for this game, it may be a bit glitchy but I have high hopes its going to turn out to be something legendary.  I am unaware of the previous iterations of this game but from what I heard, it was a disaster. And as people tend to get better at whatever they keep doing, I'm sure they will deliver a finely polished and optimized Orion: Prelude 
2061	1	a	this game is great! its a mix of Halo, black ops (zombie;deathmatch) and a little bit of Nosgoth. if you are hestitating to buy it, its like someone offers you a diamond for 1$: just take it. its not worth the money, this game is worth even more!!!! ps: if you realyy dont like it you can still refund it.  its the bestgame
1203	0	a	 Won't start
4837	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. Even at 99 cents, it is a waste of your money and time. In fact, I wish I could pay 99 cents to remove it from my Steam account.  Edit: I have since asked Steam Support to remove it from my account. Goodbye forever, Orion.
379	0	a	Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.
3869	1	a	What happen at the servers? I cant see any server at refresh except 1 Insane dinosurvival. HELP
4931	0	a	its s h i t dont buy this game
5598	1	a	Really awful game in a lot of ways, but I deeply enjoyed it while playing with friends. You get pitted against dinosaurs. The devs say it used to be worse. I can believe it. My favorite thing has got to be zooming away on a vehicle and sniping scary dinosaurs from a distance.
2029	1	a	Fun to play with friends but gets repetative fast.
322	0	a	I booted up the game and watched the 'intro' that you get after idling for a brief bit at the start-up screen, and to my dismay, the sound was completely insanely broken. 'Maybe it's better in the game', I guessed to myself, and proceeded to fiddle with the options, as one ALWAYS does after buying a new game.  But lo and behold, I then noticed that the highest resolution option available is a measly 1280x800. I wasn't aware of the fact that this game was made in gÃ¶ddÃ¤mn 2002. 'Fine', I thought, and went with it. I fixed the controls (the ones necessary, anyway, since I'm using a 360 controller for it), and exited the options.  I tried starting a new game (oops, spoiled it there, didn't I?) with the key word in that sentence being TRIED. Yeah. I can't even start the game proper without it crashing. Three failed tries and a cursory google search later, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a game that was designed for even REMOTELY modern computers.  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS NON-FUNCTIONING. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. 0/10
6077	1	a	First playthrough: Started off with a basic pistol, killed a compy and felt pretty successful, but then got stomped by a stegosaurus. Realised everyone was using bigger guns so I decided to get one for myself. Was about to buy a cheap assault rifle when a teammate came into the weapons area, started throwing credits into my face and said 'I'm about to make it rain, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'. This was enough credits to buy all the best weapons and perks. After the wave ended, another teammate made me fly the hover jet thing while he stood on top of it shooting t-rexs' with a compound bow, rocket launcher and grenade launcher. 10/10 - I have never felt more manlier in my life.
6161	1	a	It's an alright game for what it's worth don't get me wrong. However it gets repetitive and the jetpack makes the other classes overpowered. 6/10.
3362	1	a	this game is awesome, we can shoot the dino until turn to chicken
2361	1	a	This is a great game for a 0.99$ Game.  -The graphics are nice. -The gameplay is so much fun. -Great weapons   Keep up the good work, Developer :)
826	1	a	A good sequel, but not so good as the first game...
3374	1	a	best fps yet
935	1	a	This game is really fun and fast pased, the co-op is really fun. i really enjoyed playing the single player mode. this game is fun and if u enjoy indie games u should get this game.
6081	0	a	Good game. Highly recommended to play it with friends. The reason I didn't give a recommend to this game is because it's poorly optimized. If you can get past it, it's a really damn enjoyable Co-op game!
444	1	a	I guess I am late to the game but WOW...
6392	1	a	First off, most of the people reviewing this as a bad game are the people that make PC gaming look bad. They are the nazi neckbeards who need everything perfect.  Now that that is out of the way, this game was actually surprisingly fun. I never liked replay games like Killing Floor, or games like Halo, it was a personal thing. But contrary to people saying awful things about this game, I bought it for the sale and was pretty impressed. With the chemistry for replayability and also versus mode, it makes this game great with friends. The idea of a Dino survival game is also very novel and interesting. The game is sort of clunky in some places, but otherwise the game is really fun all around. Probably not worth 15 dollars, but definitely pick it up if its on sale.
3778	1	a	literally the best game i have ever played. puts tripple A titles to shame.
657	1	a	 https://youtu.be/v-L9C1_TE8U   In a dark medieval world where danger lurks around every corner, the only way to survive is to play Poker! FOR YOUR LIFE!  Long story short, if you liked Puzzle Quest, but wanted to play it by building poker hands instead this game is for you.
4646	1	a	i love this game
2163	1	a	It's so bad, so awful, so tremendously terrible, that each and every time that I try to Steam crashes   No lie...  Plz halp  10/10
2804	1	a	Awesome game. I wish i had more time to play it.
2645	1	a	nice game, but in my country, this game very lag :(
1482	1	a	The best game ever made 
3572	0	a	why? why??! why?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!%^$%#%&amp;^(*%*:LK%$^%#%
3606	1	a	Shot around 10 magazines at badly rendered dinosaurs. Crashed my pc.  11/10 - IGN
2085	1	a	Orion is a fun fps vs dinosaurs game. It's like halo meets jurassic park! With multiple play modes, lots of levels, perks, guns, 3 classes to choose from and a good community its always my go to game when I'm not sure what to play.  pros -take on dinos or even play as dinos -lots of game modes -good community -lots of maps -really fun game  cons -could use some more dinos, endless raptor waves get dull -more classes would be cool -some game modes feel repetitive
3988	1	a	This is a really good game. Hitler approves.
4759	1	a	One dollar, why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ not?
1349	1	a	BEEP is a game where the title was such a horrible swear word that the devs had to censor it in order for the game to still be legal.
3610	1	a	This is the dumbest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game I have ever played. Rather than researching and studying the dinosaurs you just kill them. This game would be much better if it included the PETA helpline so I could report it. 0/10 and I have crippling depression. Also as a side note, I noticed the guns look a lot like the ones from Call of Duty, not sure what that's about.
925	1	a	Combo potentional bonanza, loved this game, shank 3 please!
3377	1	a	The game plays like Killing Floor, but with dinosaurs and Halo-style gear. I'm writing this based on the second major iteration of the game. I played it when it was still ORION: Dino Beatdown - back when it got the low Metascore that still, unfortunately, weighs heavily on it. It wasn't polished, and I think people expected more from it. This was in the days before Early Access was a thing; the game was buggy, and felt more like a late alpha or beta build than a complete game. That being said, the dev team's work to completely revamp and tweak the game shows. They added a mode to play as dinosaurs, more maps, and I hear they have mechs and stuff now - but I have yet to play with those. Point is, the game has come a long way, and if it sounds like a game you'd like, watch a few videos, and take the Metascore with a grain of salt. It's forever going on sale, so just wait for one if you still have your doubts.
3941	1	a	after 2400 hours+ i have to say that this is the best videogame to ever exist.
4369	1	a	Really good game just bought it and i LOVE it you should try it and watch the video its really good by the video it wants you to buy it
3040	1	a	There are very few co-op games that everyone in my family of four enjoys playing. Somehow, this title appeals to our (normally diverse) gaming genres/interests, and has been a complete blast to play.   Also, I'm glad I read somewhere here in the reviews that the metacritic rating was for a diff. (earlier I think) version of the game and went for it during the steam sale. I can confirm, this game rocks.
3893	1	a	Right, this game never really caught my eye before for a number of reasons, primarily because they didnt really sell the gameplay well. It went dont to like 70 p and me and a few mates thought screw it, lets buy and it is actually such an amazing game. Yeh the graphics are nother special and there arent alot of guns to chose from, but the gameplay is so much fun. Thus far we have only played survival, there are only 4 of us and I gotta say its a really relaxing jokey game that can range from easy run arounds to extreme difficulty. I would pay 10 pound for this game id say, under a pound is ridiculous, its such an amazing game to have as an option to play with ur mates.  PLEASE BE AWARE this game is no fun without having someone to play it on, community isnt exact big or active anymore and you cant really joke around with urself..
2766	1	a	if its cheap get it ive played worse (black ops 2)
4079	1	a	Its Halo and Borderlands in a nutshell
5332	1	a	AWESOME GAME even though has a few bugs such as : The pistol floating for a sec after switching.
485	1	a	This game is game beyond gods, it's is action packed with a bit of difficulty. The story is amazing and gameplay is better. The abilities, weapons, creatures, everything! This game is just amazing! The only downside I think is that there are some very difficult parts, but I guess I'm just bad. :P 10/10 I recommend this game!
4745	1	a	The best game ever made.
3498	0	a	Some terrible game. Have no idea why it has such good ratings.
2716	1	a	First things first, that metacritic score is BS. That score was given way back when before the game was reworked and re released. I bought it for a $1 during the re-release and honestly i would of paid $30 for it. The survival mode is my favorite mode, infact i havent really played many of the other modes at all, but survival is endless fun. Favorite thing about the game is the avatar esque ships you can fly in survivor or the mech warrior war suit, or maybe even the tank. I play assault so i have a jetpack because if i didnt the massive trex would rip me out of the map and chomp me in half. He still chomps me sometimes while i try to jetpack away and he chomps rocks to throw at you if you try to land on a cliff and shoot from safety.  Gameplay 9/10 audio 8/10 overall experience with the game is an astounding 10/10.   As we all know games get old after enough play but seriously this game is more than worth it and its epicness is unmatched by many other games with much higher price tags. Also its in no way pay to play you cant spend any money to get better, you can only just play which makes this game better than all those silly microtransaction games.   One thing i want metacritic to do is to review this game again and give it the 90 or 95/100 it deserves. BUY IT NOW!!!!
3854	1	a	Nice one :)
3238	1	a	this game is worth so much more than the asking price, i have been playing it about a year now and still love playing it today.... i have had hours of fun playing it and u will too.....    so stop reading feedback and buy it haha (joke)
3933	1	a	For less than Â£1, it's a good game to play co-op.
4168	1	a	Good for a laugh, and some FUNNY DINOSAURS, that aside, running things over is VERY fun....erm,Yeah, just...there is no ingame selfie option, big minus, and workshop support :() OH NO, NO WORKSHOP! LOL. its very fun sometimes though, very fun.Extremely fun, Duper Super fun. oh, wait, HOW CAN A PTERODACTYLS TEETH EVEN SCRATCH A FUTURISTIC HUGE MASSIVE HELICOPTER!?!?!?
3830	1	a	'well I mean its 99 cents so i guess its goood if you like being castrated by a raptor as you are humped to death by a horny t-rex at a million miles an hour until you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing die' - anonymyus
4591	0	a	Bought this one when it was on sale. Provided a bit of entertainment but then found the game a bit pointless. Maybe I'm missing something and maybe some updates have made it a bit better, but probably better off spending your money elsewhere.
4683	0	a	As far as shooters go, zombies and people are the only thing I like killing!  It's fun for a while, but when you've tried all of the modes, it gets pretty boring.
1139	1	a	An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.
386	0	a	been stuck on the loading screen for 127 minutes now, hopefully it comes around
565	1	a	did you know you can somehow kill in one hit
4943	1	a	sucka butt poopoo dont buy
1741	1	a	  Orion....
5255	1	a	Not Bad
1254	1	a	I like this game. It has a Maria Galaxy kind of vibe, but of course that isnt a bad thing. If you are into that kind of gaming i recommend BEEP to YOU yes YOU. Another point it is dirt cheap! I got this game on sale for $0.19! I was amazed at how cheap it was for such an awesome game I totatally recommend.
5667	1	a	God dangit people!!!!! What are you waiting for??? It's 1 freaking buck. But it already!!! There's dinosaurs, multiplayer, good graphics, single player with bots. It's GREAT... Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! The game has seriously evolved over time and now is great time to buy, especially with the updated maps!
4703	1	a	Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did I buy this?  
1211	0	a	This game is too hard and whacky to handle not my type of tea the achievements are worthless and they cant speak for themselves!  it doesnt deliver an epic tale,cool preference tho,and globally might satisfy some old school gamers but not me love the burrito master
1731	1	a	you can kill dino with an egg 1000/10
6061	0	a	This game has so much potential o be a fun time-waster. It's inexpensive, it has a fun premise, and it's got a motha-â¥â¥â¥â¥in' T-Rex in it.   But it's just awful gameplay wise. The frame skip and lag levels are UNBELIEVABLE and it is utterly unplayable. I tried re-installing it twice and setting the graphics to the absolute minimum to make sure that I could run it smoothly, but it was still impossible to play effectively.   Once (if ever) these issues with lag and frame skipping get fixed, this game will be so much fun. I only hope it does happen, because I'm ready to start gunning down dinosaurs.
2511	1	a	For the price this really is sick.  If you are a (studious) student or someone with a stressful job, this is the game that will kill all that stress, if you combine it with a group voice call of friends.  Stabbing raptors while invisible may seem like a gimmicy sentence, but it is truly fun.  The weapons you can get are also pretty fun!
3732	0	a	From the bowels of some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ developer that had absolutely NO clue what they were doing, they bring you ORION: Dino Horde, a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  This is 100% objective. The leveling system is bad. Collision detection is awful. Mapping is bad, but not as bad as i'd think from basically a glorified Source Engine mod. You know, games that are free. I bought this game when it was Â£0.01 and it's not even worth that.  0 stars.
4026	1	a	Great game. It's alot of fun, and it looks great. The combat is fluent, and overall the animations hold up, though some are a bt wonky. A bit of warning ahead of time: It runs like â¥â¥â¥ on lower-end computers, so you might have to sacrafice some graphical settings it you don't have the best P.C.
2738	1	a	This game is absolute silly fun. It's best played with your bro's!
3798	0	a	This game is advertised as an amazing reboot. To be honest, its rubbish. Its laggy for all the 4 people i know who have this game even though we all have very good computers, Its confusing to play and a waste of 79p !
6019	1	a	This game is fun. Pure and simple.
2251	1	a	Killing Dino's is fun :D
2529	1	a	Great game!
2784	0	a	game sucks. I wouldnt have bought it if it wasnt so dirt cheap.
4131	1	a	Prelude sounds like Pre-lube, hilarious and brilliant. 10/10
217	1	a	This is an extended review about Prototype, so before starting, let me sai it short. This is a very cool game, but full of bugs and glitches in the Steam version. I bought it on sale, and I suggest doing the same thing. Now, let's start with the extended review.  STORY/GAMEPLAY: This is a sanbox game. very unique in its kind. In spite of being the typical delinquent who wants to rule the mafia, the main character is a human infected by a special virus that allows him to absorb other living beings, and mutate part of his body. There are a great deal of 'natural weapons' to use, and also the environment is pretty much destroyable, with the exception of building. The story in my opinion is the shining point of this game, and the funny thing is that it's not explained at all in the beginning, but it's revealet little by little through special events (that last far over the 'main story', if you want to collect all pieces of it). The free roaming is quite good. It's cool being this spiderman-like character, and desn't get boring over time.  GRAPHICS: Graphics are average. The main character and the cinematics are quite pretty, but the rest sucks pretty much. There are 10 to 15 'characters' in the game, so the world feels pretty monotonous and dull. The building are quite monotonous too, put together with a little variety. Despite this you can feel some slowdown when there are many enemies on the screen, even if you have a last generation video card.  BUGS: If I understand correctly, this is an xbox/ps porting, so it's full of bugs and glithces. Looking on the internet you can manage to fix pretty much everything, but still sucks having to 'open new game &gt; return to main meny &gt; load saved game', or else the game crashes.  AI: Artificial intelligence just sucks. After just a couple of hours of game you can perfectly predict what will happen, even what moves your enemies will do. I think that you can pretty much expect it from a sandbox game, but the overall scarce variety of character is quite dull.  I think that's all. To sum up, this is a short list of pros and cons.  PROs: - very good story - feels incredibly cool - complete it 100% is quite challenging CONs: - bugs - AI - graphics (i put in the cons because of the overall effect, and the slowdowns)  That's all. Hope this review is helpful.
3026	1	a	Fun when playing with friends.
1364	0	a	Doesn't run very well for such a crap looking game.
5997	1	a	Best Dino game ever!!!! Grab some friends and have fun, or try to beat the wide veriety of levels.
1541	1	a	7.5/10  $1 thats pretty good for dis game.
6073	1	a	Random dude -Why should you buy the game?   Me -NO QUESTIONS JUST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY THE GAME ALREADY, geez.
4935	0	a	minecraft more funny then that
3708	0	a	  Go play map that there is snow or is dark.You won't see sh**t
6527	0	a	This game was worth the $0.75 I paid for it.
2310	1	a	Really fun and good gameplay 
3928	0	a	dont lose mony on the sh'/'/t
1626	1	a	Dino horde brings back my childhood dreams of paleontology. Rather than digging them up, you put them in the ground. An absolute blast.
460	1	a	It's basically a Steam port of Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction
2207	1	a	First of all I have to say.... I love this game! Not just for the dinosaurs(which honestly was the main thing that pulled me toward it), but for.... well, all of it! Apart from a few glitches and bugs here and there, it's not that bad. There's lovely areas for you to explore as you fight off the hordes of dinos, with nice music to help with immersion. Also, I really like the credit system that allows you to buy character upgrades, weapons, items and more. It's also fairly easy to pick up and play as it didn't take me long before I was doing well(and I usually take quite a while to pick up stuff in games X3).  So if you can ignore the small amount of glitches and such, and you love dinos and/or FPSs, then I reccommend this to be added to your library.
4001	1	a	Great game, don't be put off by the metacritic score. It's fast-paced, loads of fun and does a good job of tying RPG-style progression into a sandbox FPS shooter. Vehicles were fun too. Absolute carnage with sci-fi and dinosaurs, you can't go wrong.
5619	0	a	Bored. If I could give it away I would.
1372	0	a	This Game gets repetitive.
991	1	a	A good game marred by horrible console porting. Poorly optimized and bad controls (arrow keys instead of a mouse, wtf) means it can be very frustrating to play at times. But still, you should probably try it anyway. It's like Portal but with more exploding scientists.
5778	1	a	This game has many epic raptors but they're weaker than the tractors. &gt;:D
6352	1	a	Kill them all, buy weapon kill them all, get vehicle kill them all. You will hate dino so kill them all.  Good game for cheap price.
5801	0	a	NOT A JOKE REVIEW  One of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly trash. THe dino AI is simulatenously OP and dumb. The weapons are all the same and the minimap might as well not be there.
2978	1	a	It's...actually pretty fun. There's a pseudo Killiing Floor aspect to it in that you level up each of the three classes, gaining new passive abilities for each one as you go, and those persist across games. Shooting dinosaurs with guns is dumb fun in the best way, and every aspect of the title has been significantly revisited since the last free weekend. I hated this game the last time I played it, but I can see myself playing this somewhat regularly now. For a dollar, there is no reason not to check out Dino Horde.  Quick update to mention something I forgot to earlier, the game has a 'cash shop' in it that seems really out of place in a paid title. It's all really rather â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking cosmetic items, though if you have a dollar or two to spare in your Steam Wallet you may be tempted to purchase a camoflauge for your character so you aren't the standard blue. It's worth noting you can unlock a camo, a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking hat, and some other dumb thing just by earning achievements, so if cosmetics are a big deal to you, don't feel like you are being forced to spend more.
3533	0	a	Its not bad, but definitely not good  graphics are really not impressive, but considering i got this game for less then a dollar you get what you pay for.  gameplay is pretty poorely done in my opinion with so many other clones out there that have done it so much better even for free.   Connections for gameplay are just bad in the best case senarios and when you have to rely on fast twitch movement and need smooth gameplay to make good shots. Without that a FPS is nearly worhtless.  3/10
6277	1	a	Well worth the money
2391	1	a	For a $1 game this is actually surprisingly enjoyable
287	1	a	If you like...  - Cutting people into little chunks of meat - if you hate the government - if you like being a god - if you hate being talked down to  this is the game for you  10/10 -ign
2157	1	a	1 dollar game,.... most entertainment Ive had for a buck, thank you
241	1	a	This game is kinda like spiderman but not for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5458	1	a	the best game
5566	1	a	This game is very fun and i bought it for only 0.79â¬!
397	0	a	Bad pc port  Just like gta iv  screw this mÃ¤n
3097	1	a	A Dinosaur kicked my car and I went flying 39million/10
4897	0	a	Would you like give away 99 cents to steam, thats basically what you are doing when you buy this game.
2114	1	a	MLG aproooved ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
331	0	a	Game is fun, but it's very poorly optimized.
5079	1	a	This game was released as a buggy mess. After it was rereleased it was still crap. However after about a year of patching, this game is great. BUY IT!
623	1	a	Open world game where you kill everything with super powers.
3714	0	a	The game is buggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
843	1	a	If you ever played the first Shank, then you pretty much know what to expect from this sequel. It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall.  Second, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well.  On to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully. And then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable.  It's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.  [Rating: 73/100]
4779	0	a	Very laggy and slow. IDK if it's my computer or not.
1768	1	a	Pretty much the greatest thing I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
3311	1	a	Pretty fun game. It got very low metascore ratings due to it being released VERY early on when it was very glitchy with little content.  Its had a lot of improvements, though and it quite fun now. Good if you like slaying things with your friends.
6098	1	a	A fast-paced, straightforward, fun game where the only thing you need to do is take down dinosaurs. Graphics aren't cutting-edge, but doesn't at all detract from the overall experience. Dramatic soundtrack, hectic gameplay rhythm and simple Halo-like reminiscence add up to a great time-killer with or without friends.
3927	1	a	This is a good game, but ive had lots of problems with it, it lags out so much that i cant even play it. fraps says i get about 6 fps in this game. yes the ideas good but the execution is poor. but i would still say its a game worth getting as long as its on sale.
4522	0	a	When you paid $0.99 And Now It's free...
1945	1	a	Really great game to play with friends
1834	0	a	Very good game for $1 it needs more hats and less dinos
1727	1	a	Such a good game 10/10  1. Jetpack 2. Bow and arrow 3. Amazing 
3510	0	a	Just... wow.  I regret the decision to even download and play this title.  I came into the fray with optimistic thoughts screaming loudly 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD'.  'Cause 'Turok mixed with Halo'? I love both titles? Damn right I'm going to play this, I have to. I didn't even know the history to Orion: Dino Horde, or what Dino Beatdown even WAS. They weren't even on my f**king radar, at ALL! Now I completely see why.  But god damn what a f**king lie that was because the entire game is executed so badly, the high expectations that it set itself begin to smolder into a pile of broken Alpha-testing nonsense, yet this is DEVELOPED and RELEASED at that. Going to mesh two good games together is aiming to pull alot of fans of both types of genres and when you invoke such f**king power words like that, you need aim well and aim high to appease both audiences because the bar has been as such by those previous titles. But oh man, you guys pulled a number on me good, man.  (You might as well sub out the 'Halo' bulls**t and replace that with 'Tribes', because that is the only thing that screams to me besides halo. A bad Tribes clone with dinosaurs.  Every gun in the game has around a 100ms delay for firing and for hitting a target, so you have to probably calculate the Coriolis effect before you hit anything thats more than 50 f**king meters away from you and it's worse if it's in the sky.   Everything feels like its clunky and runs like its just an amalgamation of crap, and the fact that when youre playing and you die from...oh lets see.. a f**king pterodactyl immediately lifting you off with no regard or warning, or a couple of small dinosaurs that you cant even see because the grass texture is so tall and its dispersion is not very good whilst the dinosaurs in question are hidden in plain sight until you're on your back pockets bleeding out attempting to shoot at them to revive.  Theres another thing, the dinosaurs. The pinnacle of this game is the dinosaurs, right? Wrong. That couldnt be more far off from the truth. Because you might as well be fighting newborn babies in the form of giant lizards that are radioactive to the touch. You wont know that youre getting hit because the animations for your foes are so terrible that when they do them its literally NOT what theyre actually doing. ------ Example: Dinosaur walks up and is right in front of your face and you just hurt terribly for some reason, no animation, no nothing its just a roomba moving at you with dinosaur legs attached. You move away and eventually it begins to do an animation for a bite in your face that does nothing, until you stop then you begin hurting because the vacuum is back on again.  Example 2: Be me and my friend, on a boulder next to a cliff with a tree on it, stegosaurus walks towards us and looks at us and and a floor stomping animation sends us up into the air out of nowhere but the dinosaur did nothing but look at us. It could have farted and I'd believe it at this point. Then it raises its front legs to stomp us because im right infront of its face it would definitely hit me again. It lands and nothing even happens, we didn't even move. What?   Man I'm already tired of thinking about everything in this game that I encountered that im not going to continue much on this anymore. In the THIRTY SIX MINUTES that I played I encountered so many things that would put me off of it I wouldnt even consider replaying this until they redo it entirely. (OH WAIT YOU DID THAT?) Well too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad, make it again. Or dont. Either way until you do better this game WILL NEVER CEASE TO EXIST. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. IT CANNOT BE UN-DONE. ARE YOU PROUD? IS THIS A CONSPIRACY TO TARNISH SPIRAL GAME STUDIOS?  This game tells me nope.
3101	1	a	I bought this game as a joke because I had 50 cents on my account left   It's actually a pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in good game
828	1	a	'Shank is back!' From this words a new chapter of Shank's story has begun. After his revenge, Robert 'Shank' Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called 'Militia' takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style. The fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10 Plot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10 Music and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10 Graphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10 Cooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?  I have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10
4663	0	a	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of poop pooo i mean the creators can just shove this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game up their poop shoot and jerk off each others asian size weewee's and just â¥â¥â¥â¥ this and guess what.......â¥â¥â¥â¥ U MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ERS this game can suck all the dongs in the world because it's a horny â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!!! s............l..................u...........t.........and it may be the jews fault white power im rotting in hell.

2516	1	a	I picked up this game, and I was like, k. Dinosaurs. Then I started playing and proceeded to Katniss T-Rexes left and right. I discovered my inner Katniss with this game, and had **** tons of fun while doing it. We are Katniss. We are one.  All seriousness, fricken awesome game. Definitely deserves a 10/10.
6111	1	a	Started playing and fought many small dinos. FUN until the triceratops. Got stomped and died and lost my awsome bow. 11/10 would get stomped and lose bow again!
6326	1	a	Game is awesome and only for 0.99 can not beat that best game on steam for 99 cents!
2190	1	a	Most fun i had in a long time, Thnx Spiral
1430	1	a	This game is *BEEP* Awesome
5545	1	a	Join Shoot Upgrade Die Game Crash Repeat
1220	1	a	I thought that it was only an cheap not interesting game. But it is not fully true. The graphics is enough for me and you can kill time with this game without getting bored. Worth the money
957	1	a	A really nice game with brutal animations :=)
3037	1	a	Year 2016 and we are hunting dinosaurs.
3120	1	a	This is ridiculously fun, Halo meets Turok, without the unnecessary theatratics, which is saying something because you don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ about Turok.  10/10 would smash your girl again.
5546	1	a	At this point dont bother trying to differentiate the Orion games. If it goes on sale, pick it up and play it until you're bored. It's like a $1-5 gumball.  With dinosaurs.
4908	1	a	brilliant game but has many errors. maybe make the raptors smarter?
3788	1	a	This is a perfect example of a game steam shouldn't be selling. It's more than disappointing. It's downright terrible. The idea that this could be sold for actual money is insane.
5990	1	a	The best Â£0.59p I have ever spent.  This game is alot of fun, the maps are pretty huge there is multiple game modes, there's vehicles, many weapons, 3 human classes to choose from, lots of dinos and you can also play as the dinos in some game modes.  And for those of you (like myself) who love achievments this game has plenty of them.  At the end of the day, value for money wise this game is awesome.  10/10. 
6249	1	a	Cool game and cheap :&gt;
5208	1	a	This game... It costs very little and yet I'd rarther play this than some of the triple A titles such as Call of Duty. This game is such fun for a small price, I recomend it strongly to people who love to fight off waves of Dino's or face off against the humans as Dino's whilst protecting your egg! Just a Beautiful game...
5833	1	a	What a game for a dollar.
4270	1	a	This game is horrible. Incredibly bad. I love it.
3982	1	a	Nice game me and my friends love it, good job developers!!!!
4286	1	a	Its a strange, buggy, incomplete, unreasnable game.  Buy it.
2140	1	a	REALLY Fun game 10/10 from here
4304	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER IF YOU DONT BUY THIS GAME THAN U R A IDIOT PLZ BUY IT IS RLY WORTH 300,000$ BUT THE DEVS R KNICE AND LET YOU GET IT 4 THIS!!!!!1  jk it sucks
3187	1	a	Graphics aside, this game is great fun to play with. The survival mode is very similar to CoD: Zombies-but with dinosaurs; however there is a larger focus on protecting objectives. Great fun to play with friends
4385	0	a	The best thing about this game is its quick uninstall time!
647	0	a	Promising start, with really polished UI and tutorial, but game crashes upon leaving the first village, and there's no known solution nor support available. Until I figure it out, or find a computer on which it doesn't crash, I cannot give a better review. But watch out for this if you want to buy the game.
5070	1	a	I LOVE DINOS and the game and its only 45 cence but i don't know how to get cc points i recmend this game for 8+
4820	1	a	STAY AWAY FROM ME DINO!!!! &gt;:V ILL KILL YOU!!!! 10/10 would run from the dinos again!!!!
4768	0	a	THank God its only 0.99$.....  do i have to say more??? The game has no direction....Just dont waste a single penny on this game....Graphics is not good enough...dinosaurs looks like its made of clays and crayons....Gameplay is aweful
1089	1	a	Thanks for cards! YAY!
697	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Its challenging, and casual. I love it and im not even a poker player.
1117	1	a	  It's a really cool game, It's like Wall E and Mario
50	1	a	One of the best adventure game series of all time. It's also worth noting that the games in this collection run pretty smooth on Win 7.
2486	1	a	Sucks so hard that it's good again
5034	1	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me of i hate it boooo
369	0	a	Broken â¥â¥â¥ sound problems if you are using an onboard sound card. Fixes found online just break other parts of game. Either way completely unplayble unless you like playing games completly muted.
1412	1	a	Enjoyed this little game.
5706	1	a	I bought this game through the steam store when it was on sale for .74 Cents !! i figured what the hey 74 cents. this is a pretty good co-op shooter ! no its amazing! good for team play and just all out Blast Fest super fun game ! Its Sort of a Unreal Tournament / Turok combonation everyone should try it !
3066	1	a	You get to be a soldier fighting angry alien dinosaurs.... It is badass and crazy fun at times and I would grab it if you like multiplayer horde as much as I do. I would say 7/10 Has a few tiny bugs and is kinda goofy but is really good fun.  Quick Update: I wrote this review when the game was still Orion: Dino Horde, I felt it was better back then. the new content and crappy new menus hurt it in my book but it is still a decent game. The fact that it is 99 cents now helps and it does still have great in-game horde. Hope they fix some of there mistakes soon but I will still play the crap out of it!
5099	1	a	A great game the objective of the game is to survive and protect your base from hordes of dinos.  After awhile bosses start spawning and your team has to work together to defeat them.  Your earn money by getting kills which you can use to buy weapons.  With 3 unique classes I could spend hours on this game.   Would I reccomend: Yes
3894	1	a	Orion, Onion.   Game - Awesome  Graphics - Makes the game not that awesome
6301	0	a	To laggy cant play idk if it the game but i know lots who are haveing the same problem it ruins the experience and it look like aploute â¥â¥â¥â¥ worth Â£0.39 at max
2962	1	a	Want to play a 2nd first person shooter? Try this game out! Its like team fortress 2! 
6074	1	a	Awesome game and it's really cheap!
3532	1	a	(UPDATE) i cannot belive how much i downplayed this game. since they devs began to update this game it has become one of the most unique and fun fps games out there. THE METACRITIC SCORE IS A LIE. THAT WAS A REVIEW FOR DINO BEATDOWN WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST CLUSTER â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ STORM OF A GAME. BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND REVAMPED AND YOUR MAKING A MISTAKE NOT TO PLAY IT.  This game is actually not that bad. the graphics are pretty decent and everything else is pretty good. too. the reason why metacridict is so low is because it is the review for dino beatdown, which is a game that was a sin towards humanity. but after all the patching and updating this game is pretty good. reminds me when i played turok on the n64......
5519	1	a	1 dollar for loads of fun* Only if you play with friends, THIS GAME IS THE BEST.  Rating : 6+x of 10 x= amount of friends
1347	0	a	This game is not fun, unless you are a young kid then maybe it would be fun. It is a nice indie game but for steam, not the best publisher. IT IS A GOOD GAME it doesnt interest me though and to people on, because most people on steam are 13+ so it put this game it steam not a smart move.
4269	1	a	This is a amazing game , the developers have had a lot of hardship but they have persevered and made a very successful game , my only complaint is that it is $1 it should be more :)
1197	1	a	It's a fun game.
4727	1	a	This game is really good. To me it play well. But I suggest seeing for yourselves.
6476	1	a	It sucks 
2076	1	a	Really good for the price. And it has dinosaurs.
6058	1	a	This is game is incredibly fun! Best Dollar I have spent in a long time.    10/10
4870	0	a	I only have ~40 minutes logged on this game - make of that what you will, but rest assured that I don't want to log any more time on it. Good premise, could have been fun, but the priorities are ALL wrong - a very pretty frag-fest with no atmosphere and nothing to hold the game together except scoring points. Dinosaurs don't behave convincingly, the maps are tiny, and despite having 4 Gb of ram and 1 Gb dedicated Vram the game doesn't run all that smoothly even with nerfed graphics settings. I picked this game up for 79p in a sale - I suppose it was vaguely worth that, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone at all. It's a poorly implemented set of bad decisions with no polish - they've left the fecking xbox botton markers in the menus FFS!
1754	1	a	Actually really fun, get a few mates and it's brilliant, I'd get it in the sale mind!
1059	1	a	Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.  Best game made with MS Paint ever.  Okay, a more serious review.  Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.  Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.  Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.  The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.  Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.  And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.  Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.
945	1	a	A very good game, cheap and easy to learn. The style of the games great and I love the gameplay. Controls are can be a little hard to get used to, but after the first 20 minutes or so you'll have them down. One of the few rare games when the 'Hard' mode is genuinely hard. Would recommend to all friends. 
4533	0	a	No. Not a horrible game, *ahem* REVALATIONS 2012 *ahem* but still not good. It's trying to be Borderlands, but it's failing. Meh graphics, meh gunplay, meh fun. Good way to describe it: Meh. I'd give it maybe a 2/10 or a 3/10.
2646	1	a	if you enjoy killing zombies , on endless survival modes . You must enjoy facing dinassours on the exact same situations , except that in this game you can use vehicles for deslocation or attack purposes.  You need to be constantly capturing the outposts , which makes the game harder.
6072	1	a	It's actually pretty good for I bought it for 50p but that's at a sale I think normal price is at 75p but a really goof game if you like hunting dinosaurs, only problem is that using workshop maps is confusing but I figured it out so yeah I RECOMMEND THIS GAME very highly.
4299	1	a	*sets large dino spawn rate to 500%* *has to fight 5 triceratops, 5 stegosaurus, 5 t-rex, 5 deinosuchus, and 5 spinosaurus all at once* *wins after a grueling 30 minute long fight* *realizes I have 5 more rounds to go before securing the base* 10/10 would fight 25 large dinos again
2578	1	a	very fun. u wont reget buying this.
5872	1	a	this might be the best 99cents ive spent on steam yet.
1590	1	a	Though lacking in polish, it's a  fun  game,  for $1 or $4  you can have a fun afternoon playing around with your friends for  free .   The  UI  is pretty bad as is the quality of many of the interactables and markers, but it's functional.  Some of the modes like the (Player)Dinos VS Marines(Player) require lots of players since they can't be played with bots.  The netcode could use some work, PVP between 2 computers in the same network was pretty laggy, so LAN play would be a nice addition.  It's a pretty basic game and on the lowest settings practically any PC can run it.   Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for some  fun  co-op if you know you can get past the game's lack of polish, and no there's no barrier to entry.
616	1	a	The One and Original PROTOTYPE
6235	1	a	Being a badass and going all in toward a trex with a lightsaber.(true description of the game)  1999/10 highly recommended
5563	1	a	real men dont use guns, they use swords, 10/10 for manliness score, now go solo a t-rex with a sword
306	0	a	An interesting freeroam game, with a good idea and interesting story. Those who like free roam games will like it. Overall it's good. But the story is full of clichÃ©s, the combat system is too console like, and resembles the Force Unleashed (I just beat before this game). The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.
4236	0	a	This game is awfully buggy and quite crappy. I guess one could like it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way but honestly it isn't worth it. Good for one fun night with friends but after that you'll never go back
4161	0	a	it mite be my pc but the gaem is 2 laggy
1402	1	a	*BEEP*in' good time for the couple of days is lasted me. *BEEP*in' good value for the 19 cents they asked for it too. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ugly though.
200	1	a	Fun game to play if you like to have a lot of powers. I personally skipped the story, as it didn't really interest me and was too confusing.
3094	0	a	This is BS. I bought this game now its f2p microtransaction PoS
6485	0	a	this game is so lagy
6059	1	a	I gave it a try and I liked it :)
2490	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents!
6557	0	a	Dont waste your money on this trash game!
6389	1	a	This game is so cheap yet so much fun. A must buy I spend so many hour on this.
675	1	a	the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this shet
1617	1	a	I like this game because you can try out wepones and meet new friends
6474	1	a	It's better than the metascore implies.
1299	1	a	I just want card drops.
3324	0	a	There's a good game in here.. somewhere.  The gun and vehicle play are solid and there are sparse moments of real squad camaraderieâ.  However, they're the exception and not the rule as lousy UI, poor squad communication (someone just hit the 'Follow me!' voice bind. Who did it? Not displayed.) and incredibly frustrating player death (wait 10+ minutes for the round to be over, and all your stuff is now gone.)  The item loss on death can be mitigated by unlocking permenant character gear through levelling, but the players who need this boost the most -- the newbies -- are completely left out. As a result, it's not uncommon for a new player to join up on wave 6 with nothing but a pistol and be completely slaughtered before he can earn the credits to get anything else. It's kind of heartbreaking watching a dozen of these players join your game, get murdered, and leave, one and two at a time.
2592	1	a	Best, or Worst, 99 cents you'll ever spend, depending how you look at it, Those who judge a game for every little detail will find it to be a terrible mess. Those who accept the game for what it is (a game that costed you next to nothing) will find it a fun and joy-filled game.
2356	1	a	This game was terrible as Dino Beatdown, but the recent update to Horde is MUCH better, and was actually fun to play. I reccomend it!
4438	0	a	This is ark 26 euros cheaper  NAH LOL KAPPAPRIDE1234 GOT YOU FOR A SEC
1557	0	a	These developers are frauds.  As much as I hate Activision, these guys are just frauds.
2968	1	a	Pretty good fps co-op game but going on solo it is insanely hard to kill the biggest dinos while they try to kill you. I would say 8.9/10
2026	1	a	Even though it runs like garbage on my computer It's still fun
441	1	a	Very Good Game, Addicting, Lots to do and Open-World which a lot of people like and awesome powers and abilities.

1657	1	a	YOU ARE NOT IL-2 BOS.  CONGRATULATIONS ON SAVING YOUR 0,50 EU
5170	1	a	I got this game for free from a friend who bought a 4-pack.  Unfortunately it lack content, you play a couple of rounds and explore, try the weapons, have some fun and that's about it.  At it's current price 0.99 it's a good deal for one nights fun, but don't expect much more than 5-6h of enjoyable playtime unless you reeeaaaally love dinosaurs.
5380	1	a	dam every fun with people :D recommend :D

4640	1	a	ya can't go wrong with a 1 dollar game. Over 60 updates, awesome and a large array of guns. What do i mean by all this? GET IT ITS ONLY 1 DOLLAR IT WILL MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO IT
5599	1	a	It's horrifically awesome
1353	0	a	too expensive, how will I choose between feeding my children and playing this game
3295	1	a	This game is verry glitchy, But its a verry fun game still. Buy it, its cheep why not?  8.6/10
2944	1	a	A 'Sci-Fi FPS' is quite a mouthful. But let me tell you, it's a mouthfull well worth it!  First of all, the game is just 99 cents. That's honestly a great deal for a game like ORION: Prelude that offers so much. The game has a pretty simplistic storyline; you fight dinosaurs. I will tell you the storyline is kinda weak, but in all honesty, did you pay a dollar for the storyline, or to fight dinosaurs?  The gameplay runs pretty smooth. The graphics are pretty nice, but only real complaint is that the dinosaurs are kinda generic, but again, it was only a dollar.  The game is downright fun, especially with friends. I'd reccomend this game; all you really have to lose is a dollar if you don't like it.
3946	1	a	An exquisite, meticulously-crafted dinosaur survival game that surpasses the quality of gameplay of ARK: Survival Evolved. Also conveniently has a diluted price and can run on a mediocre graphics card.
2671	1	a	Thumbs way-up.  The most fun I have had playing a FPS in a while. It reminds me of early Quake LAN parties, constant gibs, and non-stop action. There are several different ways you can play (survival, FFA, conquest, etc), lots of weapons, vehicles, various difficulty levels, etc.   So far, I have only played one class - 3 to choose from. Don't forget, you can play dino classes! Favorite vehicle so far: two passenger assault vehicle with rear mounted machine gun. You can ram/crush hearding dinos, but bosses toss vehicle and crew into the air.  This game is not thought provoking, deep, and will not solve any of the worlds problems. It is entertainment. There are games for solving puzzles, this is not one of them. Low metascore, but hey, it's easy to be a critic. You can stare at the idiot box, or you can roast some Raptors!   When was the last time you had this much fun for $0.99? Keyboard finger cramps included at no extra charge! Buy it. If you play for more than 5 minutes (and you will) it is worth it.
5282	1	a	This game is awesome. Shot a stegosaurus in the face with a grenade launcher then shot a pterodactyl that was diving at me out of the sky while backpedaling.
2406	1	a	A medium dino game. You team up with players and have to survive as long as possible ( i think you win by reaching wave 10). Graphics are medium and gameplay is full of bugs. That doesn't make the game less enjoyable, but it gets boring easily and some times it might even crash. For it's price, I don't see a reason not to buy this game. NOTE: It doesn't have any kind of story mode! It is 100% co-op,multiplayer! Online matches only. Overall 6/10, recommended for it's low price (got it on 0.10$ winter sales deal)
523	1	a	I still don't get if Im the bad guy or the good guy o.O killed infected and the military :3 lolwut.

575	1	a	Don't get me wrong, i played more than steam said.  When this game came out, it came out during the golden ages of assassin creed. And like the idiot i was, i pretended alex mercer was a modern day assassin. And i pretended my parkour was enhanhnced templar ablitlies (Facepalm)  Throughout the whole game, instead of smashing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I painfully enlonged the game by Stealthing this game, running away from weak â¥â¥â¥ enemies. Disguise kill everyone and bases  10/10, Wrong game simulator
265	1	a	Great game, great plot and a lot of fun.
2239	1	a	This is a very fun action game, it is similar to Black Ops Zombies, but with dinosoars. I definitely recommend it. :)
2866	1	a	The price is really nice and its funny to play with friend
3503	0	a	I only have this game because I bought a four pack so I could taint my friends' libraries.
3567	0	a	I bought this game 4.99 1,5 year ago, they made it F2P few months later, didnt recive any refund what so ever, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! Dont play this to encourage the devs!
501	1	a	Awesome! I allway's wanted this game, but now i know it's on Steam! I really recomend this game, and thanks Activision for making it
2744	1	a	This game is great already and its getting greater. OF course it has soem bad things like all games however it has some good things as well. I really love the game but i barely got time to play it and not much people to play it with.   I will list some good and bad things about the game at least in my opinion and then what but I cant choose for you. So just use this as some information about the game.  First of all the game is really fun to play with friends. I mean it as its one of my favorite things to do. Not just the open world to roam around and explore (That is not endless and always the same) but also like surviving the waves of hungry dinosaurs they throw at you. But also the versus mode can be extremly fun for playing with friends. As one of your friends can be a dinosaur.   I cant say anything of the pvp mode thought as i never did it.  Second the game has a different set of weapons and is a bit level based. The level is not that inportant in a few of the early difficult settings but it can be for like insane or higher. It gives you a goal to work to. As well as the weapon choise and the other things around it is great. And that you can heatshot dinosaurs sort of is also a fun fact.  Third the game is going threw a lot of good changes and got better form were it started. I played it when it started and it was not that great at all. But I loved the idea so even thought my friends suggested no to me I still bought the game. And well the game grew and made more rewarding. However my hours of gameplay are not that great i can tell that the game is going a nice way in upgrates and bug fixing.  Fourth the creators of the game are spending hard work on it. They even check the forums for ideas and post replys. As well as plan events and do work on the game. However there budget is low so they trying to do anything they can to keep the game alive and growing.And they are doing it good as they are fixing problems even added a few of the most requested dinosaurs in the forums to make.   Well i also have to say some bad things but they are working on those problems mainly.  Well one of the bad things is the ragdoll. The dinosaur ragdolls or the movement can look a bit messed up. But trust me its better then when the game started so they are working on it.  Second thing is like its not that active online. Well this is slowly changing as well but not that fast. There are more people coming in the game and it is a growing game. But its a slow growing game so you got to wait some or get some friends or people to know to play it with. Futher after the next patch they are making its propally gonne grow as well. But there is also a single player mode but thats less fun.  Third the teamkilling fact. There is no friendly fire in the game so thats a good thing. However in a small amout games and trust me really small amout of games you can find people that love to drive a car against you and drive you off a cliff. Or they try to get a achievment to drive a car full off team members in a big dinosaur.  I can list many more ups and downs on te game but i listed a few of them.  And my opinion is that the game is a good game but propally gonne become a great game when they are finished working.  I would say you should buy the game to play it and have fun but also to support the creators to be able to make this game into a great game.  However my opinion is not yours so not instand buy this becuse i say so.  Thanks for reading and your time.  Rust.
892	1	a	Alot of fun :)
5766	1	a	hours of stupidity with the buds
3950	0	a	I fell for the trailer and the reviews. I thought it was a really good game. Then when I started playing it, I had the worst lagg (probably bc of the lack of servers) altough there where like, 20 people playing this game worldwide. I didnt know what to do, there was no information anywhere, and the graphics sucked, so no I dont recommend this game.
3673	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
4280	1	a	This game is the meaning of fun i got this game for 1 doller adn i got payday 2 for 10 still cant decide which one is better this gaing is slowing becomeing a must own

2254	1	a	Cool game..... Be open minded Jurrasic brothers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
221	1	a	Okay Game play wise, its okay. Nothing to freak out about. I mean you got your destroy everything, but since thats basiclly all of todays games in general there's nothing special about it.  As far as story goes. Ive seen games like this all the time, your some guy who gains powers of incredible poportions and you go to seek revenge against the bad guy yada yada yada. If you dont belive me look at the games such as, Infamous (the whole inteir series), Dishonerd, Bioshock infinite, and so on. So as far as story wise, its pretty basic. This game is nothing to aw at, but that does not mean you shouldn't get it (well at least while its on sale) My Gaming Score 5 Hungry Alexses/10
1939	0	a	Dinosaurs that walk on air. 10/10
3912	1	a	Played it when it was free probably going to buy it again. One of the games I actually felt like reviewing. You can have many weapons and it can be an endless amount of fun. This game is one of the fun ones.
3084	1	a	Start the game: 200 ping. First dinosaur to fight. T-Rex Insta Death. Keep shooting every dino in the map. Lv 2. YAY!  Pros: It has dinosaurs. More dinosaurs, Dinosaurs.. And Dinosaurs.. or i forget something? Ah, yeah. Dinosaurs.  Cons: Where the f** is the Carnotaurus Sastrei.. C'mon..  Prehistoric/11.
4261	1	a	shot a pterodactyl with a tank shell, then tank got flipped by stegosaurus and fell of cliff with my tank..... true story 11/10 
1012	0	a	Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!  The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.  On that note...not shabby! ;)
5978	0	a	Terrible game bad animations to much walking to slow for what it is trying to be...
1503	1	a	Great game, tons of not-too-serious fun. I actually felt bad only giving the dev's 99c for this ... so I bought 2 :D  PS. msg me if you'd like that extra copy. I've only got 1 for now!
1594	1	a	It's fun.
5988	1	a	Cheap, fun, easily worth your 1$
5270	1	a	Neat idea. However the gameplay gets boring fast.   Since the update, this game has become actually playable and enjoyable. It still needs some work/balancing. The most unfortunate part being that each game is a fresh start, so you can never truly enjoy character building. Also there is no storyline, just killing hordes of dinosaurs until you succumb to a t-rex.
5288	1	a	An FPS where you can actually see your feet. 10/10
2714	1	a	can 360 noscope a t-rekt with a racket launcher  `10/10
5493	1	a	Hate dinosaurs? Shoot em in the face.  Unlike most games, this game needs a lot of attention. it would be WAY better if the community was bigger. One of my main problems with this games is that when i go to check out all the servers, theres hardly ANY open servers. 
440	1	a	Apart from all the audio glitches during cutscenes, this game was alright.
5952	0	a	I can't see many problems with this, but it's simply just... Not fun. I tried to get into it but it got very boring very soon. It was also extremely confusing at first and took a lot of questions in chat to understand what I was doing. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. :)
4645	0	a	The game is still crap even after all the updates its not user friendly and has texture loading and connection problems it doesent give you hints when playing. I TELL ANYONE WHO DOESENT HAVE THIS GAME {DO NOT BUY IT} i will give my copy away in a trade menu for 30 cents for anyone looking to buy.  This game should be bought by absolutly no-one. The amount of time making level's in this game should be the amount of time a player playes it for.  When you push sooooo many people away buy making a game that cost money that should be free you push away player's because of NON POPULATED server's this game is multiplayer but there is no one online to play with congrates because this game sucks.
4258	1	a	A must have for fans of thr Zoo Tycoon series.
4691	0	a	I played this game for 1.2 hours total. I feel so dirty, There isn't a shower that can wash away my regrets for accepting this game on my steam list.
3959	1	a	Jesus christ ! Only a dollar ?! You guys need to increase the price :\
20	1	a	That's an old piece of magical white snake.
4145	0	a	played again after a year break. game is still empty of players.
3286	1	a	This is a fun game, but what has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off is that I paid for it and now it's F2P. I'm quite annoyed. Is there a way I can request a refund? Hahah. But non-the-less it is a fun game and great gfx. 5/5 if I get a refund
3407	0	a	So I am going to be rather honest with this short verdict, if you are expecting miracles or top-notch gameplay or graphics, stop reading and avoid this game like the plague.  This is essentially a multiplayer game, one with co-op and versus options. You have your stereotypical bore options such as capture the flag, or we can actually explore the aspect of the game which is any different, the co-op mode versus those pesky dinosaurs.  The menu is rather broken, click refresh too many times and you need to reboot the game. It is essentially a bad version of Natural Selection 2's. You can tell why the game got a metacritic of 30, and after a year of updates, it is probably in the range of 50 now.  Getting in the game has its own issues, there doesn't seem to be good/dedicated server support, so you would end up joining some random guys game, most of these are stuck on the lobby with the host inconviently afk browsing x-rated sites, so I recommend perhaps starting your own game like I did. Wait for a few people to join, which tend to come like buses after waiting 5 minutes, then the game starts.  There are three classes, assualt, support and recon. I haven't played support, so I won't comment on that, but out of the other two options, I found Assualt to be the best. Recon has a really good cloaking ability, with some upgrades you are essentially invisible to the dinos and with a stealth weapon, it doesn't break, when getting attacked, cloak makes the dinos run after someone else too, making you totally vanish to them. However, energy is limited and it will take a while to get to that point, which leaves assualt. You might go 'Cloak versus a Jetpack, cloak sounds better..' but the thing is, most dinosaurs cannot jump, so even with the beginning, you can clinb upon a big rock and be untouched (save for spitters and rock throwing t-rex, and flying dinos). So it is consistently good from the start, and with upgrades, you can fly around almost carefree out of trouble.  You basically start in an augment building, the 2nd is a weapons building. If you set 5k as the beginners amount, you can go over to the weapons building to buy an assualt rifle, If not, you will need to do waves, which will get you money quickly since popping a dino is an easy 100-200 credits. weapons range from rockets, rifles, lasers, snipers, bow(!) and others.  You will get access to vehicles depending on the mode, with survival being unlockable after taking bases. You have swoopers (like out of starwars), jeeps (think warthog), a mech, a tank, and a helicopter.  The enemy AI is rather simple, it is a combination of mindless running around until they spot you, trying to take you like a female dino. Most of your time will be spend running around backwards and shooting them, unless you are on a big rock, then you shoot them from that as they cry foul of lack of long arms to climb after you.  Despite a lot of negative comments and feedback from the above, I actually ended my first couple of games. I audibly expressed 'aaagh..!' as I was getting chased down a slope by a t-rex, trying to jetpack away with no energy, firing wildly at it to try to kill it (we did! i survived). It is definitely one where you enjoy the novelty of the concept, plus, I really love co-op games opposed to single/competitive.  The game does have good controller support whilst in the game (not for menus). You would want to make some keymapping adjustments so it fits the typical console fps setup, but it works rather well and it is playable. Only downside is the slow aim-moving, since petradycals attack you in a frenzy like a moth to a lightbulb, which I found a lot easier to handle with m/kb.  Overall, the game is 5/10. It look and feels low-budget and it definitely does not have any polish on it.  However, if you got a few friends who are interested, pick one with a good rig/connection to host, talk on skype/ventrilo/mumble, get a drink and have a laugh. If you don't have any friends, you will probably play a couple of games and not bother more.
5757	1	a	You cant beat the price. Fun for atleast a few hours, a sh it load more fun if some friends have it too. 8/10 would shoot dino again
4774	1	a	this game amazed me for 0.99 Euro! TRICKSHOTTING DINO'S 4 EVA    9.5/10 -IGN GOOD GAME WE ONLY DONT LIKE THE FLYING â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4924	1	a	What a fantastic co-op experience! I played this a while back only to come back recently and they've taken a great game and made it even better. If you miss the $1 week, shame on you, but even not on sale, Orion: Dino Horde is well worth your money.
6556	1	a	it's all right as it goes !! 
4277	1	a	I have to say , this is a nice game , the vehicules are good and there a good choice of weapons but if you want to make this into a better game you need to fix the colision system and lag issues . There also a imbalance in the classes , everybody use the jetpack .
128	1	a	Imagine playing GTA or Saints' Row, except you're an infected, murderous shape-changer. This game puts you into a simulated city, controlling a character with strange abilities, and proceeds to turn you loose. You, Alex Mercer, are a science experience gone wrong, worthy of the Umbrella Corporation, and you will have to bust some heads to get to the bottom of it. The game is slightly dated, but provides a really unique and enjoyable experience, thanks to the active controls of your shape-changing powers, and a new perspective on the 'mutant infection' story.
240	1	a	Prototype is a quite amazing game with the unique gameplay. You can jump, sprint, kill, consume and become. Here's the pros and cons:    PROS
4347	1	a	This game is like butter Soft when you put it in the microwave But cold when you put it in the fridge I burned my orion prelude copy and i can't play it Recomandation: Don't let your Orion Prelude Copy in the microwave for 20 minutes on High
4308	1	a	good as far as i can tell. but i have issues with performance even though i have a good pc

1847	1	a	graphics arent the best but its fun so thats all that counts better then duty of call  ITS .99 CENTS WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ASKING FOR
2443	1	a	Much Fun. Many Impress. Such value. Wow.
4748	0	a	This is an all around disappointing game. I spent $0.99 on it, and still got extremely depressed after playing it. ORION: Prelude is an FPS dinosour survival game, that focuses on simply shooting dinos before they eat you.   When I first entered the game, after playing five minutes, I knew it wasn't anything great- but at least at that point it was still worth spending one dollar to see what the game was like. Yet after each minute passed successively, it just got worse and worse. I realized that the graphics were pretty terrible, and that if you wanted to really obtain good gear, you would have to play for at least 30 hours, which I just wasn't willing to put into a crappy game that was not fun at all after 10 minutes.   Since then I've played a little more, only to realize that very few poeple play it, making it hard to find specific lobby of your choice.   ORION: Prelude is NOT at all worth the $0.99 it charges. It is disappointing and just plain stupid.
6543	1	a	This is not a great game - it's pretty buggy, poorly balanced, poorly animated, unpolished, very cheesy, and actually pretty fun to play.
3963	1	a	11/10
1961	1	a	This is the best cheap game on steam.
4092	1	a	not bad at all.
4949	1	a	Still a better lovestory than twilight
6465	1	a	for $1 its defiantly worth it.
3626	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer. Don't buy it. All the maps are the same. The dinosaurs ice skate jet li quick style.
6164	1	a	Now, ignore the negative reviews, this game is a huge stea when you compare it to cs:go skins 'oh my gun looks cooler than norma, it was $10 and tracks stats' Nah, i could buy 13 copies of this game with that money( 3 4-packs 1 normal) so this game no matter how 'bad' it is because of 'ai' it's still killing dinosaurs with miniguns
4478	1	a	it's A pretty addicting game! it is still a really rough diamond,but it has potential! Just needs a little more optimizing and better voice acting and this will be an outstanding game Hope it gets more updates!
5763	1	a	This game is impeccable fun, and its only $0.50!
664	1	a	I do not understand card games. But I won't make a negative review about this game only because it's not my kind of the game. It seems okay... It just does not make my diÑÐº hard enough to play it.
3781	1	a	I punched a pterodactyl with a pistol, I stabbed a Stegosaurus with a sword, I tackled a Tyrannosaur with a tank... It's an okay game.
6033	1	a	YES YES! i like this game so much!!!!
4555	0	a	It was â¥â¥â¥â¥ when it was dino beatdown but it was an allright game when it was called orion dinohorde when they made it prelude most of the older players did not know a thing about it causeing it to turn into a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game it looks good thats it
1580	1	a	Best Cheapo on Steam and a must own!   again. good thing they realized, that F2P was a crappy Idea)  
4049	0	a	Is there any way I can refund this game? It's WAY too laggy
5562	1	a	very interesting fps game, recommended to play, i like when hitting a t-rex with my gun, so say hello to my little friend :3 #bang #bang
127	1	a	buy this game and play it with a controller  perhaps the most fun i ever had playing a game in my 40 years of life (along with the sequel)  you are completely overpowered, but still the game can be challenging, but being so overpowered is so much fun in an open world  story, acting, and characters are very well done. the way this and the sequel trickle aspects of the story based on 'collectibles' is also a great plot device that makes you want to complete all the collectibles (moreso in the sequel)  seriously, if somehow you found this game and are reading reviews, just buy it. so much fun to play. strongest recommendation to play (again, use a controller)

4475	1	a	This game is definitly worth your dollar. I just can't stop playing it!
5334	1	a	Worth a go if you find it cheap, played for ~5hrs and want to play more.
2536	1	a	i played it with low spek, even though i feel heavy lag, but that wont hold me down to play this get gun, get skill, buy bow, ez unlimited ammo 9/10 would play again when i buy high spek laptop
4667	1	a	wow wasted 50 cents on this game and its f2p now lol 
6018	1	a	I fly up 50 feet, look into the landscape with the filthiest, most â¥â¥â¥â¥-looking graphics I've ever seen in my life, and the game proceeds to have a stroke on the floor with foam coming out it's mouth. The game then writes on the floor 'We know the dinos are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the invisible rain gives you a headache from pounding on the plexi-glass you have on your face, but what did you expect for 50 cents?' To which I reply, I expected more foam before you died on the floor.  NeedAnAdvil/10 -My Head
117	1	a	Best. Super Powers. Ever. I want to wear that jacket. I want my flesh to writhe in power, indistinguishable between muscle and bone.  Why yes, I am for human advancement through drugs, machinery, genetic manipulations, and other wonderful things, why do you ask?
884	1	a	Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun.   Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win.   Make Shank 3!  10/10
6140	0	a	Gets boring very fast.
1142	1	a	No man's sky in 2D and guess what the price you pay for, it worth it and same as no man's sky it has the need for co-op. Game is fun though.
2973	1	a	Hey you! yeah you! do you have one dollar? if so buy this game! its cool
4811	0	a	This game made me s*** out my d***! Would not play again...
2986	1	a	Awesome game the first time it came as a free thing i played it a ton and had tons of fun
6505	1	a	:3
1565	0	a	I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.  Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.  Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.  It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.
6136	1	a	Okay so this game... -Not realistic -Terrible Graphics -Stupid AI -Overall crappiness BUT HOLY CRAP IS FUN! Its like eating Nutella from the tub, you know its stupid and frowned upon, BUT YOU CAN'T STOP!  seriously tho, its worth like 1 dollar or 50 cents, because its a blast to play, Heres an example: Me and ma friend we be riding in da hood in my warthog *ahem* turret-car, and we got the WHOLE server on this car, then the friend I was playing with got picked up by a pterodactyl and gets dropped into a T-Rex Overall 7.5/10 xD
3652	1	a	  NOW THE GAME IS FREE??? GIVE MY 40 CENTS BACK!!    JK, the game is good, so its nice more people can enjoy it and probably this means more players to play with so i gess it is a win for all
620	1	a	Prototype: Not Even Once
2763	1	a	A rudimentary Dino FPS, great game for 90 cents.
4014	1	a	Great game, but a bit pricy
1991	1	a	This game is very fun and entertaining. I enjoy the battle of the T-Rex
5732	1	a	EPIC!  I have numerous top titles and I do my best to try to make time to have a blast playing this game.   For $1!?!? C'mon!!???  9/11
203	1	a	Not sure if it's worth 19â¬, but it sure has nice destructive gameplay for that time game developing.
4428	0	a	Honestly, after a second ''remake'' and content update...it is still as buggy, cheap and boring as before. Seriously dissapointing and a waste of money.  I highly respect the devs for their devotion and the love they put in the game...but it is not enough.
538	1	a	You have been transformed into a biological Prototype weapon, and your only thought is revenge... and the destruction that preceeds it. There are plenty of upgrades and attack forms to make your killing prowess undeniable. Challenge events and hidden items cover Manhattan for plenty of bloat content. Traversing the map is much like Spider-Man and combat feels a bit like Infamous. Dangerously fun to tear apart civilians, monsters, and soldiers alike. The Web of Intrigue is a great way to reveal the background story piece by piece. Most certainly worth the fun if spending a few dollars!  The only character depth comes shallow with just Alex, while the rest just come through as plot twists or leave empty. New York is relived in yet another open world game. Monster design is torn right out of concept art from Resident Evil. The music was not impacting or memorable in any way.
1996	1	a	yes :D its good
4338	1	a	Great deal for a $1. Standard FPS game, fun with your friends.
4303	1	a	its a very fun game
3115	1	a	Get ready for some jet-packing, guns blazing, co-op game. The dinos only make it even better. This is the best game you can get for a dollar; Hands down. It is probably even better than some $5-$10 games.
5461	1	a	20/10 this game is amazing i love it 
3228	1	a	This is the cheapest fun game I've ever played. I don't think I've ever spent so little on a game that offered so much fun. I mean, even for only 14 hours played, that's about $0.07 per hour. I plan to play more, as my son loves the game and we played together last time.  Guns, dinosaurs, vehicles, and co-op action - what could be more fun than that?  As to the politics behind Activision - you filthy console fanboys need to take a good hard look at your precious CoD games. Every single CoD game is a blatant rip-off of a game that was released prior. Not to mention that they recycle their own assets every year to release yet another garbage game for a whopping $60, AND it gets released on both PC and consoles. Talk about greed and thievery. They're picking your pockets, and you have the gall to accuse others of stealing?!? Shame on you.  You people deserve Infinite Warfare. Enjoy that.
6108	1	a	This is the best bame evvuurrrr!!!! My and my clan for cod play this game everyday in hopes for Chop Suey to come out with a new song. Kelpy G inspired me to start making reviews for game like this one. So that is my review for Orion Prelueds, like this video and subscribe to my youtube,  https://www.youtube.com/user/JonDrinksWater  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also listen to my mixtape which includes classics like, 'It's Me,' 'I Hope You Die In Fire,' and the Frozen soundtrack!!!
2847	1	a	This is the most â¥â¥â¥â¥ game I have ever played and I will never get my time and money back. This is the only game I have ever played that I actually regret playing and feel like my life was legitimately wasted.
2281	1	a	The metascore isn't wrong, this game is a steaming bag of **** but for 1$ it's not terrible. 90% of the guns are useless due to crap dps and the dino's are idiots so there are some downsides. With that said if you have some friends that want to play a game where you kill dino's with purple guns then go nuts, it's the game for you! Oh and the controls are the worst thing possible!!!! Worth a buck, no more.
990	1	a	It definitely is a fun little game, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a simple adventure type game. I enjoyed spending time on it. You play as a little critter that can warp through thin doors and such. You can make people explode if you warp into a human so thats neat too :o
6531	1	a	DEFINENTELY WORTH IT :D  I spent all my school day playing this (offline), and still wasnt board.  The reason this game was rated so low was that  A- Nothing was origonal B- Half the stuff has no animation (come on, at least make the flamethrower shoot fire :3)  If you put this aside, it is definentely worth it! Really fun, online and offine mods, and hopefully more graphical updates are coming :3
1495	1	a	The community is very strong. Guys with jetpacks hide on cliffs, laughing while everyone else gets smashed on the ground. Not bitter.
5235	0	a	I didn't get this game. Nice graphics though.
5638	1	a	Bought bow and arrow on noob mode. Shot down a pterodactyl cause he was in my face. resisted urge to yell 'YOU HAVE FAILED THIS PLANET'  would play Arrow with dinosaurs again.  10/10
3719	1	a	Got lots of hours killing dino basterds great price, and playablity buy the four pack.
3919	0	a	waste of a dollar, too laggy to play, stupid concept. overall rating- 2/10
2781	1	a	It's a game that has fun gamemodes and also theres diffrent kinds of weapons.Also you can upgarde to be better
3124	0	a	This game seems like it can be very good, but right now it lags too much and my computer is pretty good so it shouldn't be lagging als there's no weapon flash or recoil so it just looks kind of stupid when you fire and all that happens is a gunshot sound and some blood appears when you hit your mark. This game has something going for it and I would be willing to pay a fair amount of cash for it once the lags get fixed but right now I just can't recomend it to anyone unless your willing to play a game that will probably be pretty laggy but still good overall or if you have a very good computer which may help with the lag but I don't know for sure.
1852	1	a	Still a better love story than twillight ^^
4605	0	a	i bought it and then it got deleted so i hate the game 
4742	0	a	Won't run very well on my mediocre computer. Put the visuals down as low as possible and it didn't help much. The game seems fun but I can't play it.
4959	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
3216	1	a	This game is cool !!! &lt;3
3152	1	a	Low graphics and stuff but if you like wave after wave of dinosaurs in Halo? It's pretty good.
4386	1	a	Fun to play enjoyable to alot of people.I think its one of the best games better then call of duty and tons more. Favorite game ;D 
1399	1	a	It was good in the 5 minutes I played of it. I got it on sale for 19 cents. the first levels awesme, same with the world map. thx for reading. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10
4944	0	a	I loved deleting this game !
6	1	a	Not sure why people complain; have tried this on Windows 7 (disabled DEP) and works fine. It uses DOSBox to run the original game files. So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as three different items).
1212	1	a	A fun strategy game that increase in difficulty with each level.  This game is a really fun, yet challenging (at the later levels) timekiller.  I bought it on sale and it was totally worth it, would recommend you give it a try :)
6575	1	a	My favorite game. It's an amazing game with a bunch of different ways to play.
4088	1	a	- Every map is the same except for different tree placements - There is no variety in weapons - Night maps ARENT AT NIGHT - Enemies spawn in between waves - The UI is painfully bad  11/10 Would reccomend.
6221	1	a	Only been playing the two modes Survival and Conquest. I personally like this game but i wont brag about it, simple and nice gameplay with 3 characters you level up. For the small price you get allot of game with the unreal engine.
2491	1	a	Good Game. it is like Halo+Jurrassic Park+Killingfloor=Orion Dino Horde
425	1	a	Nothing quite so liberating a mowing down slow walking normals while trying to save NYC from itself.
939	1	a	Just Wow !  10/10 ...If you're a Metal Slug Fan ! what r u waiting for ! go ahead and buy it xD ...
4898	1	a	i bought the game for 50 cents but then I refunded it so now i'm probably gonna get it again now that it's free. It was a pretty good game but if you want a real masterpiece you should play this:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/362930/ 
966	1	a	Great game! A Hack and Slash at its best! I started a blind lets play/first look on my YouTube Channel. Below is the link to my channel! Thanks for watching and let me know what you think!          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  &nbsp;
1079	1	a	ehh~~ buy this game for fun pls, not for farming card :P
3586	0	a	Even thought this game is free on Steam right now.Do not play it.It is competely unfinished and is unplayable.The game constanly lags(even in the menus) and isnt even gpu or cpu demanding.Please spare yourself and avoid it at all costs.
4416	0	a	Purchased this game long ago and asked for a refund as it was THAT bad.   There are so many bad things to say about it:  1) Gameplay feels weightless and unsatisfying  2) Multiplayer is lifeless and unabsorbing  3) It feels pointless, unrewarding and repetitive 4) There is no demo, which means people waste their money buying the full version, which is dreadful
4781	0	a	I saw the metascore of 36 but the game was on sale for a $1.50, so I figured I'd take a chance. Well, I gambled and lost. Let's just say that giving it a metascore of 36 is being extremely generous. It's an incredibly stupid and poorly-made game; I can't wait to un-install it.
2233	1	a	Dinosaurs.. Not that bad!
5515	1	a	the servers are lagy
2270	1	a	Its a good game just would be better if there was an option to turn off blood for the younger people like little brothers
3218	1	a	im going to be honest, this is the first f2p game i have ever payed for, seriously, you have to buy credits with real money . the only place ive ever seen that, is in free to plays, if your going to have people pay for your game, dont make it a free to play platform.  aside from that, the gameplay is really cool, the community is amazing, but hot diggidy dog man, turn down the damn blur effects, there's so much blur that i cant see â¥â¥â¥â¥ when im spectating, or even playing for that matter.
3346	1	a	I still have trouble accepting the fact that I paid $0.99 for this game. Even if you don't particularly love this game, you will still feel like you got your money's worth just because of how complete and all around solid the whole experience is. This is an A+ title in this gamer's opinion.
5359	1	a	This game is very fun, especially if you grab a few copies for you and your buddies. You'll get a few enjoyable hours out of it minimum, and for around a dollar when it's on sale that is an insane bargain. It does have its bugs--clipping and crazy physics among them--but if you can look past those kinds of things you'll really enjoy the game. Personally, I've already put 27 hours into it and I got it for LESS than a dollar. Best value I've ever gotten out of a game. There are several different modes, but the core game modes are Conquest and Survival where you're defending against increasingly difficult waves of dinosaurs. This does get repetitive after a while, (especially in Conquest) so if that bothers you it could be an issue. Personally I don't mind it, because it's fun. Gun game is my favorite mode for PvP. The class skills spice it up nicely.  tl;dr Give the game a chance. It's usually around a dollar on sale and it's a blast. But if you're looking for a polished gem, this probably isn't it.
228	1	a	The only flaws I have with this game are the controls at some points, and the graphics, other than that you should totally get this one. Plus it runs well on crappy computers. The storyline isn't that good either though, I just found myself having a good time creating chaos through each mission.
2690	1	a	Jetpacked into a falling helicopter then used it to kill a T-Rex. 10/10 Would play again
6188	1	a	like killing floor but a lot cheaper and with dinosaurs, vehicles (jeep, tank, mech suit, helicopter thing), jetpacks, more game modes, some hilarious collision physics, more bugs, and more fun. buy it 100%
4513	0	a	Do not spend money on this game.  This game seems interesting in premise, and as it may be fun at first, if you spend a few hours with this game you realize that it isn't open world like it says it is. It is also grotesquely repetitive and there isn't enough in this game to warrant a buy. I bought this game when it was ORION Dino Beatdown and was excited for an update, and it came in the form of hats and microtransactions. I am disappointed with the quality of this game and the potential that was lost with the greedy transition into a microtransaction game.
5180	0	a	Good and fun game, after a while it gets boring though.
4905	1	a	fun game to play with friends
2658	1	a	Well worth .99 cents, but for .49 cents it can't be beat
1842	1	a	I'm calling my lawyer because i spent 59 cents... now is free to play. I could buy 3 slices of watermelon :(
2379	1	a	This game is very cheap and its not a bad game the only problem is the graphics.
1916	1	a	This is orion dino horde a game where you have to fend off several waves of dinosaurs that want to eat you. Ok so the game has some bugs and glitches but every game has them and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the haters at metacritic. This game has changed alot since it came out. Oh and did i tell you that you can shoot dinosaurs with tanks and jets. Anyways i give this game an 8/10
6076	1	a	If you can run it on your computer, definitely get it! It's definitely worth more than $1, so I don't see why people wouldn't want to get this game
6068	1	a	Awesome..... enough said 
4099	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents.
3709	0	a	Bad game !!!!  Cause what ? well you just need to realize that this publisher: TREK Industries and this Development: Spira Game Studio, just stealing content from Activision product. Not just that, this Publisher just re-release the same game (but with diferent name like Orion: bla-bla-blah) and make people spending their money to buy the another series of this game.  I suggest you, not to buy product with name 'Orion' anymore. didnt trust what i said ? you can visit here:  Look at this proof 
1919	1	a	Hi there i want to start by saying this game is great. Its a survival game that you shoot dinos in and is unplayable i would recommend this to all who like to waste money.
4158	1	a	PLAY FOR TREX â¥â¥â¥
3023	0	a	 http://youtu.be/Xbk1nHaRBSM   http://youtu.be/w3qjfQieg2w 
5287	0	a	well I got the game to try out and let me say I DO NOT LIKE IT. The grafics are slow and multiplayer is bad. Its not worth the mony, I rather recommend tf2 or dota 2 than this. But the game can get beter with updates and help so what im saying is put some work into it and I'll recommend it but not now.
6402	1	a	Very fast paced but an amazing ly fun and adictive FPS I cant describe how much fun this game is.
2200	1	a	The only thing this game is missing is a random weapon generator!
5437	1	a	This game is AMAZING! There, I said it. This is what everyone has always wanted, a mix between Dinosaurs,Halo, and a bit of Borderlands. Not the bad stuff like 3 years olds screeching in their mics when they die, no, like the good graphics and FUTURISTIC VEHICLES! If that isn't enough, how about the ability to be a FREAKING DINOSAUR! Its everyones dream to either be a dinosaur or ride one, so why not both in this game? INFACT, there is an achivevment where you ride a dinos back (preferably T-REX)! If all this fun isn't enough, this game is $1. THATS RIGHT, $1 DOLLAR. And if you are the free-to-play sort of person, these developers actually give out copies of the game! These people care, and I don't think they get enough back, that's why I recommend this game to anyone who loves atleast one of these things on the list:DINOSAURS,HALO,BORDERLANDS, AND HINT OF CALL OF DUTY (minus the bad stuff, and no, its not everything). If you can get your friends to play this with you, maybe you'll finally be able to see how many dinos you can kill with an extra dino trying to eat you! Or just PVP with freaking light sabers, your choice. Final Verdict: 9/10 Would recommend!  (And a tip, maybe more servers that include rampage, rampage is fun.)
6237	1	a	Wait, I played this game?
5919	1	a	AWESOME GAME!!!!! AND ITS ONLY $1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4489	1	a	First Person Mode and Dinosaurs well made ORION: Prelude specially with our guns and special power per character type.
4967	1	a	It's not bad, but it's not good.  But 11/10 controller support.  I don't know what else to write here  I want hats
4060	0	a	There is only one time when you play a game for the first time. This game seems to not understand that.
5610	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a butter knife and then died to a chihuahua sized raptor. 10/10
4446	1	a	Ad a campaing
2175	1	a	This is the most fun Ive had since kicking my litte brother around a co op HALO map. This game has certainly taken the spotlight in my gaming time.  10/10 Would shoot dinosaurs again
1661	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ YES, THIS GAME IS AWESOME (Must play with friends that know how to have fun though.)
4263	1	a	Awesome game here is all you need to know 1. you shoot dinosaurs as space marines. 2. you can eat space marines as dinosaurs. 3. there is no real plot but I guarantee that you will not care once you aim down your sights at a velociraptor. 4. There are Jet packs. 5. It is a first person shooter and third person dino. 6. The ion blade is basically a lightsaber so you can kill dinosaurs with a lightsaber. 7. The game plays like a dream. 8.There are tanks. 9.There are mechs. 10. For the uninformed all of these things are awesome and completely cool. That is all 9/10
2684	1	a	Wow.... I relize the game is pretty loltastic what I mean by that Is that I mean i'ts glitchy terrible and just wtf. Buuuut to me this game is actualy very fun and it is a original game to me and I would recommend this game to everyone. Keep the updates going and make new maps also... GREAT JOB!
4393	1	a	this game was amazing. it was everything you want in a dino fighting survival game.
2036	1	a	The best pew pew for your bucks.
6381	1	a	'Protect our base!' 8.5/10
4626	1	a	Lemme tell you a story: One upon a time there was a player who was eager to get the 'You're Redikulous' achievement, so he hosted a game playing with his fellow friends. The group of dino hunters progressed as they withstood thousands of gigantic lizards. Two hours later, when they finally reached the last wave with the near victory in sight, the host started to run into a wall, followed by the message 'server timeout'.  GG  
4447	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥IN' LOVE RAPTORS.
1577	1	a	One of the only games I know that lets you fight dinosaurs     and I love it :D
6177	1	a	ORION:Prelude is a fun dino fps game similar to ARK: survival evolved but instead of taming dino's in a safe humane way you just blast their heads off with a 12 gauge shotgun. it has it's bugs, like the dragonflies constant spassing out, and my character glitching into rocks but those just add to the fun of orioni can tell you now like most first timers i tried to take on a t-rex by myself and it ended up with my 20,000 credit bow and 15,000 credit flamethrower being eaten never to be seen again, but that was really fun. GOOD JOB GM'S.  10000/10
2715	1	a	Such an ace game, had a friend gift it to me as they bought the 4 pack in the sale and I clocked a solid 13 hours on it from the moment it finished installing!  Most fun I've had in a while when it comes to silly shooting games!  If you're looking for something to kill 30-60min I would seriously recommend buying this
5179	1	a	The Quick Brown Fox , i mean i - recommend this game to you if you really like playing co-op games with your friends, that game could be your favorite game. It has a good game engine and cool HUD. Nice weapons to shoot some dinosaurs or cut them all. Following objectives and beating this beasts is really cool. Nice graphical quality also feels you good when playing it, almost a perfect game for it's tags. #Dinosaurs #Action #FPS #Multiplayer #Co-op so thats it all, see ya on game guys.
1524	1	a	My friends call this game 'The good game because it's so bad'. A bare mininum shooter game with surprisingly good varity of weaponry. Expect glitches and bugs because it's not a triple A game.
2499	1	a	Fired a minigun on a jeep at a charging triceratops, was flipped and thrown through the air while still manning the minigun, took out a few dinos while flying, and landed 30 feet up on a small mountain.   I was able to maintain a stable firing position from there. 11/10 would fly again.
2938	0	a	Crashes on startup
2007	1	a	I got thrown by a giant Spinosaurus, into a rock, then I died. My friend became Rambo and went on a murder spree to bring me back to life in the next wave.   Best co-op on steam.   10/10
1786	0	a	So bad, that is fun....but is a very bad game XD
3477	1	a	well... this game is just STUPIDLY AMAZING!!!
6331	1	a	Awesome Game For An Awesome price 
3595	1	a	Killing Floor, But much bigger wolds, pvp, and Dinosaurs. A lot of time and effort has been put into the game to make it really smooth. Good game, and super cheap. (At the time of writing this it was 99cents)
4368	1	a	Killing dinos is fun. would play again. 10/10. give me pie
1023	1	a	Interesting
3776	1	a	Shoot, run, shoot, run , laugh as the dinosaurs ragdoll on the floor like lifeless insects.
4305	1	a	This game surprised me. If you like guns and dinosaurs, this is the game for you. 10/10 would do.
300	0	a	Prototype is actually a really fun game, but its an example of one of the negatives of PC gaming that I've dealt with over the decades I've been nerding out... some games just stop working on modern hardware. This can be for a variety of reasons, and some people can fix the problems with a weird trick like disabling some obscure setting in your OS that you've never heard of... but for some people, myself included, the reasons are completely mysterious.  Prototype barely worked for me, and I eventually just sort of gave up on it. The common fixes posted online don't seem to work for me, so I'm kind of left in the dust.  If the game runs for you, you'll have a blast, but I can't recommend it based on how it performs. The developers also seem uninterested in fixing the issues as of April 2016.
4208	1	a	Interesting concept. Very buggy but still fun. I had the most fun after turning the graphics down as far as I could. Was worth the 4 player sale price!
2708	1	a	This game possibly the best dinosaur shooter I've ever played. That is all.
3787	1	a	Gave me motion sickness and an headache within an hour of playtime 10/10
3174	1	a	in this game i've put 20 hours. that may not sound like much but for a 1 euro game. i don't know if i would recommend you the game at full price but for 1 euro. this game is worth 1 euro at least. 7/10
1624	1	a	Ignore the Metacritic reviews, this game is a lot of fun. Survival game mode with friends is very fun and challenging. Gain money to buy new weapons an perks, choose a class, level up. A+ game.
5747	1	a	Once upon a time on May 4th 2015, the internet was slow. I knew it couldn't be the provide because I don't have comcast. What do you know, it was steam. I scroll down the big list of games, some great and some well, not so great. I stumble upon this game, Orion: Prelude. Oh yeah I said to myself, wasn't this a dollar, but with all steam games you never play them. This update must be good I say to myself, at 1.4GB it better be. Once done updating I open the for the fisrt time in months. Saw that it was the same gui, but I gave it a chance. Why not, I mean it's not like I have any homework that I left at school. I finally join a game... SAME GAME DIFFERENT MAPS, well not that I knew of, neverd played all the maps, aight 1.4GB update doesnt feel like it. Same weird chat system, confusing upgrade system. Thus I close my eyes and begin to shoot. Killed everything in my path. Won the game. Alt+F4 DONE  In all honesty I thought the update was going to be a graphical upgrade, but I'm sure it added a â¥â¥â¥â¥ tone more stuff. Get the game for a buck, about 3-5 hours of fun with your freinds.  10/10 Probally going to get addicted
5420	1	a	The MetaScore is a LIE. A very if not superbly underated game.
3638	0	a	I have a question for the developers, and I have some positive feedback. Question: Is this seriously all you managed to do with three YEARS of trying to improve it? Did you SERIOUSLY think any of these changes were improvements? Positive feedback: Great job with lowering the price. $0.99 is still a bit too much given the quality, but it's better than &gt;$20/
3995	1	a	ok dude so the game is all like badly made lagy glitchy man but its a cool game like take on dinosours like call of duty but with dinosours and fels like planetside 2 lots of game modes nice laidback communty not to many kids but i gota diss this man cuase my pc specs arnt makeing this lag but im dissing it not cuse the lag just cuase despite the fact i came into this game and never once failed to kick â¥â¥â¥ therse one major drawback in this game i cant overlook in this review   POTHEADS VS DINOSOURS nothing aobut that should ever happen  it about a  7/10 due to poor quailty codeing and genral game build  for demonknight gameing and potheads everwhere this is X_Dk_Green_Jesus_  Note: Would Buy Again If It Becomes A Series Possably   * STONER APPROVED GAME *  REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DURING FURTHER GAMEPLAY
3677	0	a	I want my money back
1292	0	a	Don't like games without the option to control the sound. This is poor develop crafting
3686	1	a	as a wise man once said   'clever girl'
337	0	a	Super-villian simulator, horribly optimized graphics. story most likely written by a teenage comic writer wannabe, but the movement and fighting were not that bad. Worth the bargin-bin price of a sale only.
1551	1	a	One of the worst games, I have ever played. It's pretty fun.
898	1	a	Hard to get into but very rewarding combat.
2455	1	a	a great game. the style of the game is like no other! i got this on a sale for 75p ($1) and it was a STEAL! the only bad thing about this game is that when i reload the gun is out of sync with my hand... i think its just my bad pc though... 8/10
5392	1	a	Great fun with some friends, just think your in jurassic park, and fight of waves of dino's !
1	1	a	Awesome game series from when I grew up. Sadly you cannot play all of them unless you have an old computer.
1450	1	a	Loved this game. I've apparently played 233.8 hrs of it in the last two weeks!
4968	0	a	uninstall this game even if you didn't get it yet 
5311	1	a	Spent $1.50 to kill some dinosaurs and have some fun. Left satisfied for what I paid for.
6324	1	a	I bought my friend this game to see how well multiplayer worked  He got addicted  Send help
1926	0	a	This is an abomination of a video game worse than the holocaust wouldnt download it again if it became permently free.
3165	1	a	Improved game. Honestly this is one of the better games for the buck I spent around $0.99 cents around the time and I actually enjoyed it I wasn't blown away by the graphics but by the gameplay it's seems as if the game alone should be worth around $10. If you want a couple hours of gameplay or even a hundred hours of gameplay this is by far one of best cheap games I have played in my entire life. Get this game if you want the best bang for your buck. Honest Rate: Graphics 8/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Concept: 10/10 Community: 10/10 (Very Friendly) Hackers: 0/10
4939	1	a	when i open up orion prelude it keep saying not responding please tell me
929	1	a	Not as good as the first game, but fine nevertheless. Beware: it's as hard as the first one. Even harder. :)
1643	1	a	Great fun Game to play with your friends
5436	1	a	idk much but seens fun
1174	1	a	You know what they say, a little BEEP never hurts, if you don't like it there is this other game named Brilliant Bob and it is just amazing trust me, (Don't see my review in Brilliant Bob) so yea you'll have the best gaming experience with BEEP and Brilliant Bob in your library, trust me, I do.
5571	1	a	Borderlands 2 + Left 4 Dead 2 + Halo + Jurassic World + Evolve = ORION : Prelude   9.5/10  Graphic good, environment good, gameplay good, but movement too stiff  I would like to recommend this game
6016	1	a	Best 1$ spent in my life. I could buy cola for that money and enjoy it for 5 minutes. BUT WHO THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ NEEDS COLA FOR 5 MINUTES WHEN YOU HAVE THIS?! JUST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY THE 4-PACK AND PLAY IT!   Conclusion: Orion:Prelude is better than cola...and GTA V   10\10 Duck enjoyed this game and you will too
4979	0	a	Big pile of trash, stolen assets. Terrible devs well not so much the innocent makers of the game who get sacked and replaced every ten minutes, its more the owners who run the company who are liars, cheats, and thieves. Avoid at all costs even if this game was Â£0.00000001 i would avoid.
6366	1	a	A nice mix between Halo and Jurrassic Park, can get glitchy time to time though
668	1	a	7/10  A sort of RPG card playing game. A great time-killer and lazy repetitive game. It's one of those games that require one hand and is fun to come back to every once in awhile.
996	1	a	There's the good news and the bad news.  The good news is- this is one of the best games I've tried this year!  You're playing this cute little alien guy who teleports around and brutally murders people by blowing them up from the inside. If you've played Unreal Tournament, that's also known as 'telefragging'- actually, this game could easily be named something like 'Telefrag-the Game' :P Now, that's kind of justified because the humans captured the little alien and were performing horrible experiments on it, and are trying to shoot it on sight without any attempt of communication, so... yeah :) The gameplay is strangely addictive and the puzzles (because of course there are puzzles) are reminiscent of Oddworld games, where one wrong step spells doom for the alien guy. Based just on those facts, I could HIGHLY recommend grabbing this game.  Now... the bad news. This game WANTS you to have an Origin account. Yeah, that's EA Games for you. It asks for EA login, then it asks for the serial key, then, after activating and starting the game, it asks for the SAME serial key, only this time you can't paste the damned thing and need to type it in manually. After that, you need to log in to the Origin account, AGAIN, from the game...   WHY? Why doesn't it just let me play the game when I try to start it? Why does EA HAVE to meddle with pointles layers upon layers of DRM?   I guess at least the only 'good' thing you have from all this is, the game actually registers on your Origin account as well, so yeah.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're prepared to endure a bit of pointless logging in and typing a 16-character serial number manually like in the olden ages (or registering an Origin account if you don't have one), this game is AWESOME. Go get it!
2259	1	a	Been playing this game for 8 hours now, i recommend this game to all killing floor fans. It is a never ending cycle of crazy dino shooting.  I admit the graphics quality of this game is not that good  but who cares about graphics? Real gamers judge a game by its gameplay.   If you are into survival and nonstop shooting of dinosaurs in all sizes (small/medium/large), then this game is for you. We have different preferences, for me this is a game worth buying.   Updated review as of August 17,2014. Game is still awesome as it was before, but i hope there would be more changes during the full release of prelude.   My present gameplay footage:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3rb-04O2qM 
3530	1	a	Nice game
5884	1	a	I just bought this game its really cheap,and my screen is black all the time.Can somebody help me pls? :)
613	1	a	Where Protoype shines is the open-world traversal around the city as you gain more powers. The combat is fun enough and the carnage you can cause is defintely fun. However, the story is all over the place and tires way too hard to be edgy, leading to a very, very unsatifyng final boss. I'd recommend this game to those who, like me, can enjoy a good brawler with open-world elements. Worth picking up on a sale.
4173	1	a	this game is the sh*t, buy it now
913	1	a	Very fun and controller friendly, an overall decent button masher and I love it :D
3409	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game 1337/10 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ a game again
6558	1	a	Its pretty damn good =3
1013	0	a	Game looks nice but on my PC, it runs at ~15fps. Unless I find a way to optimize (unlocking fps in warpengine.ini did jack) it's $2.49 wasted.
2136	1	a	Killed a T-Rex with an over powered knife, while jumping over it. 10/10 would stab again.  
574	1	a	Its recently started crashing when I try to start a game. it's too bad cus I liked this game
368	0	a	Horrible game. I cant compleat it because of glitches and controls
1420	1	a	This game is *BEEP* awesome!
5505	1	a	This is a very fun game. sometimes lags a bit even on my alien ware PC other than that a great game  - it should be more than 0.99cents  - i'll give it a 9 out of 10, fix the lag  - a few glitches
5548	1	a	Quoth the Mackelmore;  'But â¥â¥â¥â¥, It was 99 Cents!'
4616	0	a	Saw the devs begging people to give the game another try, reinstalled. Game crashes constantly on startup  0/10 Free is to expensive for this game, they'd have to pay to play it, and even then it would have to be a lot
1579	1	a	This game is seriously the most fun I have had in a long time, it may not be as polished as some other triple A titles but cmon, Mechwarriors, Vtols, Dinos, etc! This game is like a bizzare yet awesome fusion of Jurrassic Park, Halo, and Killing Floor. Its not at all a serious game but I love that fact about it and playing with other people you are sure to have a good time and laugh at some of the bugs in the game which were never breaking the game or experience but only enhanced it with hilarity! As they come out with more updates the few bugs in it that did kind of bother me will be fixed. If you are looking for a cheap game to play with friends that isnt all serious its WELL worth your time to try this one out!
3338	1	a	More better then 'EVOLVE'.
6270	0	a	For starters, this game crashes more than a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing drunk driver in a bugatti and it runs at 3fps or less even when i have a decent gaming PC.
4695	0	a	why does the dev suddenly want money for this game? i know its low priced, but to me its not worth it. uninstalling now.
5042	1	a	my friend is cute in this  
5250	1	a	Jetpacks, heavy weapons, and dinosaurs.  It could be more polished. But until you beat a raptor to death with a rocket launcher while flying.. you dont know what true glee is.
4110	0	a	To be honest this game is good when it is known as ORION: DINO ( open beta ) but now after its open beta , the graphics of the game is totally like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and lag much more worst if you are connecting to europe server
1855	0	a	ORION: Dino Horde is a painfully average game and still feels like a Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, even with all the updates it received so far. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar games and it has a long way to Killing Floor levels of greatness. However, if you think that aforementioned KF really need vehicles, dinosaurs and jetpacks, or you're really tired of zombies â wait for ORION to go on a sale and grab it. Everyone else, save yourselves some time. I've made a longer version of the review, available here -  http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-orion-dino-horde/ 
3352	1	a	I recommend this game for those who played L4D and L4D2 as this is an awesome survival game !
6116	1	a	This game is super satisfying.   for maximum fun only play with the knife and never get any guns. totally worth it because the struggle is amazing.
3935	1	a	Great game bought it when it was called orion dino horde but nvm dinos could have more intelligence though
355	0	a	I must say that one of the final combat before the final boss did make me totally rage because it is incredibly hard. I never did it, so I never finished the game.  To do quick. The pros : The gameplay is seriously amazing, even if surreal. The open world is really nice. The possibility to absorb everybody is kinda cool too. The cons : The storyline is boring. The militaries are such noobs it's amazing they are still in the army. The final boss is not reachable (see my first paragraph). You cannot possibly love the main character (you do however can like the other characters, it's not a problem). The dialogues are soooo basic.  What is not a pro nor a con : You can kill everybody if you like. The violence really graphic and clear in the game. Not really safe for work.
5009	1	a	this game is ok to buy in sale for Â£0.39 but if its more expensive then dont as the graphics are messed up no one plays and the game is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t in mechanics.
2193	1	a	I beat the heck out of a raptor with my elbow, blasted the crap out of a T-rex with a tank, and used a bow and arrow to kill a giant alligator. Best game evur 11/10
446	1	a	awesome game play it guys
5810	1	a	Used jetpack, accidentally landed on a T-Rex, and died. 10/10
143	1	a	Edgy McEdge kills everyone he sees. If you think Infamous was cool, play this.
2873	1	a	I love this game, why? like they said 'The Metascore is misleading' is true, it is a fun â¥â¥â¥ game if you really try it. Beside, I bet you will enjoy this game without doubt.So, why should I explain it to you ? you should try it yourself and see for yourself. xD
1438	1	a	Game didn't beep.  0/10 Game of the Year
5981	1	a	fun game played it when it was a free weekend! 
6568	0	a	Pro: I get to shoot dinosaurs. Con: Dinosaurs do not shoot lasers back Con: Can not play as laser shooting dinosaur.
2283	1	a	This game had a lot of problems when it launched and it still has quite a few such as a few things not being balanced correctly (versus mode, for example), there are a lot of things that not well explained by the game (like what you're supposed to be doing and how basic mechanics like teleporting back to base work) and a few sloppy or not well designed menus. However, all these things considered, it is not longer the laughably bad game that it once was before. I used to consider this game my greatest shame as a person who buys video games and the epitome of shallow, impulsive buying on Steam. Now, I consider this game to be a functional game that can be enjoyed with friends.
503	1	a	Fun if you can get past some of the more infuriating points of the gameplay. I don't think I've ever raged at a game as hard as I have this one. It's worth it though. Go on a rampage and destroy everything. See how far across the city you can throw random civilians. Eat those same civilians for health.  Scream obsecnities when you get caught in that stupid obnoxious melee combo that Hunters use. Hate the game because animation canceling doesn't work unless you're an NPC.  Don't forget to abuse the blade arm on tanks, super soldiers, and hunters. Works best from the air.  7/10
1922	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428IyxSfsls     10/10
1810	0	a	Even though this review says its not recommended its really not all that bad if you are wanting to play a game about dinosaurs, if you can get past the flaws. Said flaws include average gameplay, bad dinosaur AI, terrible animations, poor sounding, poorly excecuted ingame features and the list goes on. Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out. Overall its a bad game, but it isn't terrible as its fun at some points as its a basic shooter and can be thrilling when you are taking on the big dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Deinosuchus to name all the boss dinosaurs. For the causal gamer this is an ok pick up. For Â£1 its a steal so I would suggest picking it up when its on discount. Overall its a bad game but its not terrible.
5693	0	a	i got thet game free  :P 
815	1	a	A great sequel to the first Shank installment, which is also pretty good. I love the visual style and the animations in this game, its definitely one of most entertaining platformers i've played.  The length of the game is also good, controls are solid and easy to learn. Survival mode can be really fun, too bad i could not find anyone to play online. I should have played this back when it was released, but oh well. :/  The only thing this game lacks is online and local co-op for the Campaign, which could have been a great addition to the game, but still. I highly recommend both games if you still haven't played it. The first Shank did have local co-op, i don't know why they removed it.  Also, try Mark Of The Ninja, another epic platformer from the same creators  Score: 8,5/10
1480	1	a	I don't play free flash games in my browser anymore, I pay $0.50 and download them on steam now.
2932	0	a	Don't buy this, I have a god computer and I can't run this on low setting, one level it went to night and started raining, and for the first time ever, I had to turn the gamma on my computer up. FPS was around 13 and I wanter to kill myself
4688	0	a	MUST HAVE: fast pc in order to play right! very slow game, bad graphics. crashes when you least expect it! extreme lag, if you fix these thing would be a great game! (like tf2 but with dinosaurs)
3348	1	a	DUDE ! its like Boarderlands , Halo , Killing floor and Jurassic Park all in one game
4739	0	a	ABsolute piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Would not recommend to my friends. This game is so glitchy and the gameplay is just absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's literally just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ fest of awkward dinosaurs running towards you and you shooting them with you no recoil when hipfired gun. This is possibly one of THE WORST games of 2013/2014. Completely fix the glitches before you release the game. If there are a few glitches, I wouldn't mind. But there is one literally around every corner. Don't release a game that is still broken and is in progress. Even if it is on Earl Access or not. So yea. Enough of my rant. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. Spend your money on something better. Like, Natural Selection 2. Or Maybe even a classic like Star Wars Battlefront 2. But seriously. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. 0/10 would not play again. Waste of money. Peace.
5655	1	a	This is a very fun game at a insanely good price. Well worth checking out.
1217	1	a	Better than War thunder
4077	1	a	A fun game to play with friends!
6167	1	a	Its a fairly simple but fun coop game.  You level up your weapons and class the more you play so it gets easier with time, however higher difficulty levels Do seem to require you do have a high level character too or you will get insta chomped by dinos.  Great price, great fun and it will last you until you get sick of blasting dinos with lasers.
1651	1	a	Can't...Stop...Playing... Vehicles with weapons, plenty of guns, different play styles, and teamwork! Dino Horde gets a 9.5/10 because, unlike other dev teams, here development and new content never ceases. The community of players are great and you quickly meet veterans ready to help you out, share credits, and help you level. Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!  
5824	1	a	Cheap fun for the whole family.
2812	1	a	Got stuck between two rocks; had to amputate entire body with explosives to escape. 127/127
115	1	a	  So... if this is the Prototype... when's the game comming out?  11/10 - would make unfunny joke again
3053	1	a	This game is 1 Dollar. It's honestly not worth that dollar. You could get more substance out of a dollar store bag of chips. A STALE bag of chips that's been sitting there since 2009.  The potential for this game is pretty solid, but it blindsides you with awful animations, slow gameplay that makes you want to stab yourself in the eyes and so many bugs you'd think you were in a motel in detroit.   I played 34 minutes of this game, and I can honestly say I would undo every second of it. 2/10, go buy 'Mountain' at least then you have something mildly entertaining, and probably better designed.

1621	1	a	This is a really good game. You kill dinosawrs and they die. Worth buying. 11/10 Would play again. - Warning! - (Needs real friends to play with for this to be really fun)  By the time I'm writing this it costs only 0,79â¬ ... I bought it for 10â¬ or some â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that. So this game is REALLY worth 0,79â¬. Recommended. Play dis nao.
2094	1	a	Joined a game, bought a good ol 6 shooter, killed some dinos, got muched to death by tiny ones, figured out the melee attack button, bought a shotgun, took down a stegosaurus, ran out of ammo, bought an ammo refill gun, got owned by a t-rex, bought an LMG, upgraded everything, won the fight, back to step 1. 10/10!
277	1	a	This game is tough yet really fun with crazy storys for you to complete , when completed gives you a big achievement . after all the rage , its still fun .
5394	1	a	Loads of fun!  WELL  worth 0,99â¬.  Why haven't you bought it yet! 
6146	1	a	This game is loads of fun! I bought it last night before I went to bed so I could try it in the morning. I ended up trying it that night And was on it for 2 hours!
572	1	a	Tons of fun and crazy, crazy action. Can you say 'Drop kick a helicopter?' I knew you could.
4351	1	a	I was once a lonely man, with nothing buy my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ laptop that can barely handle more than 5 tabs open in google chrome. This game changed my life. The graphics are good enough that my eyeballs dont fall out of my head, and bad enough that my computer can actually run it without â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's self. There are tons of bugs in this game, some fun, some annoying, but I love all of it's perfect imperfections. This game made me literally cut my self in excitement when i first played it. I am a new man now. I've only killed 6 people, and that was because they were standing inbetween me and my game. I dream about this game. This game not only changed my insignificant life, but this game became my life. This game and I are one.  In conclusion...  6.45/10 It's ok I guess
2961	1	a	PERFECT GAME! lONG AS YOU DONT LAG ON IT YOU WILL HAVE LOTS OF FUN, much better than primal and dino d day.
45	1	a	Yes, I remember having to upgrade the RAM in our Tandy PC in order to run SQ1. I owned several of the games over the years but re-purchased this set to get them all, and to avoid having to pull out the 5.25' floppies. Do the games stand the test of time? Not really. Although I am sure the early text-entry episodes would tax some gamers today. But are they still great? You bet. Give me some Roger Wilco humor, sit back, and enjoy the pixels!
5333	1	a	decent with a group of friends
1513	1	a	You can fight t-rexes in helicopter gunships, enough said.
476	1	a	one of the best open world games i have ver played aside from just cause 2.Your a god with the powers every human has ever wished in a massive open world new york city,Well at least thast what the box says,in reality your alex mercer a normal person abducted by genko as one of there test subjects and you gain powers that in my opinion are great but you do have to unlock evolution points to get most of the weapons/powers that you have.As you progress through the game Alex becomes more powerfull and does awesome moves,which isnt a bad thing but by that point your as they said on the box:a God so that is the only issue i have with this magnificent game overall,8/10.I would reccomend this to all gamers.
6143	1	a	The best $1.50 I've ever spent on steam. This game went threw some major updates from when I originally watched a friend play it. Literally 'Watching a heroine addict turn into a successful banker' kind of updates, this has got to be the best multi-player wave shooter for your money on steam! I'd recommend this to any one and their family members, and even to family pets.
150	1	a	This is an early impressio of the game, I've unfinished my first playthrough. -This is now a review based on a finished playthrough on Normal. For other notes, I'll list my system specs below.  Pros: -The game runs great! (on my system) -For seven years old, this game has aged great -Keyboard/mouse and controller functions smooth -Straightforward upgrade system -Fast paced gameplay -Promotes diversity of powers, can be a real challenge -Murderfest  Cons: -In spite of smooth controls, there are times when movement can feel a little clunky -Resolution issues with vanilla game -Difficulty curve hops around early on -The AI spawn system can get almost to frantic at times, creating almost unreasonably challening missions -Story is pretty bland and exposition is mediocre at best -Resolution for modern monitors is pretty limited unless the game is modified or files are edited   On the whole, Prototype is a solid game with plenty of great and fairly well executed ideas. Though at times it's age stands out a bit in terms of some clunky combat; but is more than made up for in some fairly memorable experiences. The games bosses do what a game boss should do, test what you've learned so far in the game and forces you to explore available powers. Battles are intense and the overall sinking feeling of insanity as Manhatten island slowly turns into an outright murderfest.  Oh and the game runs great on my system which is running the Windows 10 os.  I've give it a solid 7/10.  System specs:  MS-7850 Intel Core i5-4670k @ 3.4GHz (4 CPUs) overclocked @ 4.3GHz 12288 MB RAM (12 GB RAM) EVGA Nvidia GeForce 960 4GB RAM ftw edition Modded game to run at native resolution of 1600x900
6122	1	a	BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME (MY OPINION)  1)TF2 2)ORION: Prelude 3)Super Mario Bros For The NES  I Love This Game
4983	1	a	This is the best game NA.
2976	1	a	Jesus, Everything i do needs to be Redone.  Dinosaurs, Guns, Jetpacks. Starwars. Jurassic Park. Do you people want MORE?!
1468	1	a	(BEEP) ! This (BEEP)ing flying robot keeps killing me and i can`t pass him, i swear i`ll (BEEP)ing destroy it. The (BEEP)ing piece of (BEEP) !  8/10
3398	0	a	it ran like crap in 2013, still runs like crap
1259	1	a	very simple game!
1371	0	a	I saw this and thought it looked cool kindof but it sucks
3882	1	a	It's a dollar don't be cheap, lightsabers, dinosaurs, and jetpacks, lower video settings to low if you're middle class citizens
1112	1	a	Simple game that has some interesting physics aspects. It is cheap so don't expect amazing but if you are looking for simple yet a little challenging here and there, this is a good game on the cheap.
178	1	a	This game rocks. A little bit of the ol' ultra-violence and all that.
2262	1	a	Pretty fun, it reminds me of Sanctum and CoD: Zombies. With dinosaurs, of course.
4836	0	a	its worth 1$ thats about it.. crappy sounds... crappy play.. crappy gfx and crappy controls.. but for 1$ its okay.
3069	1	a	best game so far ive played thats that cheap
3698	0	a	What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pile of dino â¥â¥â¥â¥... 2.5/10
3307	1	a	Great game! But hard to run.
5388	1	a	A great game with plenty of action. The weapons are nice and the ability to run things down in vehicles is a plus. Challenging and always keeping me on my toes and the A.I. is better in this game than in most that I have played. Overall, a great and challengning game.
6158	1	a	I'll put this simple: 12/10 Would fly a VTOL right on T-Rex's face again.
3654	1	a	i dont havev this ga mw si yeahghgh itsa very gooods
5059	1	a	Orion is a game worth playing, but is also likely never going to achieve the critical mass necessary to be as big as it deserves. The ambition of the developers is apparent in the massive, multi-level arenas, the scale and power of the larger dinos, and the range of abilities and equipment with which you can kit out your Tron-esk soldier. There's a tremendous variety of game modes as well, including multiple variants of PvE, PvP, and PvPvE. The three classes of soldier (Assault, Support, and Recon) each have their own tree of persistent skill unlocks, and a microtransaction shop gives you plenty of options for purely cosmetic customization. Orion is largely satisfactory in terms of the quality of its graphics, and even surprises with neat environmental effects and an excellent day/night cycle (the night is actually dark, and can add real tension to a match). In short, it is absolutely worth picking up at full price.  So why did I start my review with such ambivalent language, if I'm willing to recommend a purchase? Because I'm skeptical that Orion is going to live up to its potential; the variety of equipment and abilities I mentioned above is present, but in dire need of an overhaul in order to establish clear class roles (or roles, period, if you want to drop the A/S/R distinction entirely). Server caps are set at 10 total players, which means those massive, multi-level maps feel deserted. PvE modes will see you fight a T-Rex with a tank (or a tank with a T-Rex, in PvP), which is cool, but they'll also see you use the same tactics against the dinos over and over again because their behaviour is both predictable and exploitable, which is not.  I want to be wrong about this, but the game came out in 2012, and it still features what I feel are considerable design flaws. It is absolutely worth picking up - I've even bought several gift copies just to encourage people to try it out - but prepare to break out your disappointed father voice at some point while playing.
5346	1	a	I went in expecting nothing. Best god damn $1.50 I've ever spent.  You NEED friends to play with, it makes it so much better. I believe the metacritic score was for their old game before they overhauled it. Seriously, I spent $1.50 and ended up not stopping the game for 6 hours.
3992	1	a	This game is pretty underrated. I enjoyed this a lot more then I thought I would have with my friends. Best to play with friends so you can scream at each other when a TREX comes out of no where.
4480	1	a	Jurassic, futuristic FPS multiplayer. Plus, its free (now.. those dang developers). Could disappoint but again, its free. Just stop reading reviews ad give it a go. Oh and by the way, you can get a jetpack.
3725	0	a	$0.49 ?!!!!!!  So bad it's still not worth it.
2994	1	a	It's retro.
3715	0	a	And now it went F2P  Scummy devs are scummy
38	0	a	Very sad to say that none of the games will work. I loved these games when I was a kid and was really excited to see the whole bundle on sale. Unfortunately they are not configured to work on any modern PC. It is possible to work around this and load them through a properly configured DOS Box, but this takes some effort. It just relfects pure laziness and negligence on the part of the dsitrbutor who could have done so with minimal effort but preferred to just take peoples' money instead.
6401	1	a	Ive honestly had more fun playing this game than every AAA game ive bought in the last 2 years.. get a group of buddies together and its a blast. Almost feel bad buying for as cheap as it was, its def worth more than the dollar its on sale for.
4852	0	a	this game is very laggy
414	1	a	pretty good
2683	1	a	awesome game... I recommend it for everyone who like action game
6014	1	a	It's ACEstounding...
6210	1	a	cheap.. im mean....
1933	0	a	Why is this game getting good reviews?
1608	1	a	The port is kinda poor for low end rigs even 6 years later ahaha, but honestly, one of my favorite games, grab a couple buddies and hop on and youll have a blast!
4622	1	a	Worth the 0.99$ :)
1686	1	a	This is the greatest game I have ever played. I just love going around not being able to see anything except for the inside of my dinosaurs body. The graphical technology seems to have been developed in 2005 however this only makes sense as since the game is set in the prehistoric era. All in all, I can not see a reason why someone wouldn't immediately purchase this phenomenal title.
6311	1	a	This game really is good. Glad the devs stuck with it instead of ditching it like most do. Kudos, guys.
6274	1	a	T-Rex rekted me inside a full health tank in 1 go 10/10 Would play again
3334	1	a	Amazing game, pretty addicting and fun to play with your friends, at the price of 0.49$. Awesome! oops, forgot to mention. Open the door, get on the floor, everybody do the dinosaur!
2426	1	a	It's a mediocre game. I'd recommend a mediocre game for 1$, however. I got this game for the same price as I would have a can of Arizona tea, and this managed to last a little longer. Definitely a concept that needs work, but again, not bad for 1$.
5054	1	a	Got htis during the steam sale and i am impresesd with it. It's really fun and is definetly worth the 99 cents or if you get it during the winter sale 74 cents. I would pay atleast 2 dollars for a game like this. has pve and pvp modes.
5987	1	a	If you enjoy slaughtering dinosaurs and don't mind dishing out a hefty amount of money to do so, this game is an absolute must buy, mainly because it is extremely cheap so you don't have to dish out a lot of money. It's worth every penny I paid.
4521	1	a	To be totally honest, this game isn't that bad. It has very good and fun gameplay, but the developers gave up on the project a long time ago. It's still relatively enjoyable, and it's worth the small price tag. If you ever have a small bit of cash, throw it at ORION: Prelude. It's pretty fun with friends (although a little buggy), and the ragdolls are hilarious!  I've had this game since the day it came out, and I still think it's pretty good in terms of gameplay - acompanied by stunning graphics.
1379	1	a	Great game for 18 cents
1413	1	a	awesome game,really like the trine style of playing and its not easy for 19 cents it is a must have
1214	1	a	Goes on sale a lot. Worth the $.19 i had paid for it. Great Platformer.
5668	1	a	I loved the demo for Jurassic: The Hunted but was sad when I couldn't find the game. Then I got this cause it was on sale for 81 cents! And let me say I am so happy I got it! A total blast, four player dinosaur killing craziness. Worth it even at full price!
4182	1	a	I've never seen such a complete failure of a game turn out to be such a great gameplay treat. It may have taken a near complete rebuild, and it still needs more weapons and such, but damn it's a lot of fun......now anyway.
6168	0	a	If your friends own this game somehow, mayb- Nevermind, don't buy this game. Even though it's cheap, don't spend your precious time with this. Unfortunately unsuccessful.

6565	0	a	I felt i was playing the first halo but with dinosaurs which doesn't sound bad at all. When i actually played the game i realized i was wrong. The game never really seems to go anywhere and after a few matches feels old. Its like heres some guns now go shoot some dinosaurs! But even then, the dinosaurs only rush your position and the only needed strategy needed is to walk backwards and spray. Im glad I didn't pay the full price for this because i would have been seriously disappointed.
2454	0	a	Edit: Auguest 29 2014  This is the second time this game has changed names after giving itself an update. Kinda fradulent since when does having an update give you the ability to change the name of your game from the original version, to Orion: Dino Horde, and now to Orion: Preulde? Short story sweet, the game is fun for the first day but then gets really boring. Not worth $1 imo. If you want to know more, you can read the rest of my review below or look up TotalBiscuit on youtube for gameplay and developement of this game.  Date: March 12 2013 Lots of reviews of this game says 'This game isn't as bad as the metacritic score says it is' or 'This game has improved a lot since the original.' Sorry to say, but if this game improved a lot, it wasn't much of a game to begin with. There's no tutorial at all so you're forced to jump into one of th five or so game modes all of which pales in comparison to survival. There's versus and capture the flag, but it's no Left 4 Dead--that is, the balance is totally off. All the dinosaurs suck except for the T-rex who can toss instadowning rocks (OP) and who can instakill any person close enough to them by swallowing them whole (Super OP). There's other dinosaurs who all boil down to Dinosaurs who all suck and the T-rex. There's tiny dinos who die in like 3 seconds of getting shot or the big ones who can survive getting shot, but who have problems getting kited all day. The marines don't have much variation in viable choices either. There's the assault, the support, the scout, and the assassin--all of whom gets their asses ran over by the hordes of dinosaurs except for the assault who has a jetpack that lets him sits in the mountains on the edge of the map and allows him to pick off the dinosaurs one-by-one while being untouchable to them.  Sure this game (or any game) is a steal at $1 but after about 2 hours of playing I had enough as I got bored of sitting up in a mountain peak and shooting down at the dinosaurs, running around to random checkpoints for unexplained goals throughout the map for up to at least 5 minutes, and playing games where people were only OP T-rexes or OP Assaults. The most fun I had in this game was driving around in a car and running over dinos while I was spamming #Orion:Driving Hit &amp; Run Simulator but that and the game gets old very fast as you soon realize every map is just an excuse to get to random waypoints for no reason which just slow down gameplay just to shoot more dinosaurs.
420	1	a	Good Game Of Fighting And Stuff It Can Be Cheaty But Im Not Here To Complain So Over All I Have A Mixed Review But Recomend It 8.5 Stars Outa 10 It Just Has Moments But Its Still fun And Worth It
6512	1	a	Best 99p I've ever spent. I loved it so much i proposed it... it said no, it was to good for me
5277	1	a	Good game, has some issues with control but the game play itself is good. The graphical scenery is almost AAA title level in places. Great game if you can get it on sale
2724	1	a	cool $ 1.00
5579	1	a	Very Good Game
3856	1	a	Metascore needs to rate this game again.
6152	1	a	10/10, I love it. What isn't there to love? Dinosaurs, guns, money, more guns, jet packs, cloaking devices, and much much more!
1656	1	a	Pew pew pew pew You get to kill dinosaurs What more do you want  11/10 will pew
2156	1	a	first two game... got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by T-Rex and his little arms :D  very fun and fast pace
1684	1	a	Dino's / Halo Like Weapons and vehicle's / LOTS OF GAMEMODES / CO-OP / hillarious  What do you want more? better graphics? go play another game~!  i say 11/10! #ToFabForYou
2552	1	a	Halo, CoD (But better) and a host of other games smashed into one....AND DINOS. Who could ask for more? I loved it the moment I started playing, and bought it soon after!  Amoung the gamemodes, Survival, Free For All, team deathmatch, CTE (Capture the egg) and more!  Strongly suggest getting it, and help keeping this game alive, soooo much fun! 9/10  What could be improved is some of the multiplayer aspects; such as: While in F4A, enemys do not see the damage they;ve done to you when you've killed them. Not only is this frustrating, but they mistake it for you 'hacking' ultimately leading to un-kind words being thrown at said parties. Apart from that, I LOVE THE GAME!
1839	1	a	I shot a dinosaur or something it was pretty cool I guess
2501	1	a	For a dollar (and my first Steam online purchase) this game is amazing for what it is (except the little bugs). Good amount of dino's, plenty of weapons and perks and stuff, badass murderizing. It's great for $1
3161	1	a	this game is really FANTASTIC AND AMAZING !
5752	1	a	From buggy and laggy game turned into my opinion BEST dino game today
1526	1	a	   Basic Information
5143	1	a	Surprisingly fun. 7/10 only for the bugs, visual glitches and the stupid rain.
3240	1	a	Dino farm simulator is the more action packed version of farming simulator. Instead of farming crops, dinosaurs breed and spawn all throughout your farm. You then have the luxury of choosing which vehicle to farm their carcasses with.   10/10 would bake again.
194	1	a	Fun Single Player if you like fast-paced, meaningless massacres at your own hands.. or blades!
5252	1	a	I'm just going to give you the specifics in 1-10 ratings. Game smoothness - 6/10 (Meh) Class variety - 3/10 (3 of them) Weapon balance - 2/10 (Sniping with machine guns) Dinosaur AI - -4/10 (Hilarious) Bot AI - -â/10 (No) Vehicles - 10/10 (Killing machines) Game Hilarity - (1.6 x 10^8)/10 (My god yes) And last but not least... Is it worth the price? It has had more free days than i've had showers. Yes. Just yes. 
6131	0	a	Game no workie. Tried the only 'fix' posted on the Steam forums; got as far as splash screen. Worst part is it makes my computer practically unusable until I manage to forcible end the various processes associated with the game. I want my time and $.50 back.
1846	1	a	All you need to know is its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing concept with an alright execution. Imagine Halo, mixed with killing floor plus DINOS!! The game does get a bit buggy and really it still seems like its in beta version but overall the dinosaur-reking adventure is tops. Theres no campaign but its best feature is survival which is a classic earn credits, buy better â¥â¥â¥â¥, kill more dinos; repeat- although its not like L4D infinite wave survivals so its fun cause it can be completed.  Perfect game to pleh with m8s in 6 difficulties (but just as good by yourself- no AI standing around touching themselves) and the some 278 acheivements make it really competitive and keeps you interested. If you get a chance to pick this up discounted, its well worth its 99c.   10/10 would bang
4701	1	a	Very fun with friends
504	1	a	Prototype is an action packed, fun, open world, experience. The game mixes awesome free running, with superpowers! Although, there are many issues with the PC version of the game, the game is still quite enjoyable.
6013	1	a	Soda at McDonals: $1 5 minutes of enjoyment.  Orion Prelude: $0.5 3-5 hours of enjoyment.   Its a pretty easy choice     Seriously though, this game is better than half the FPSs I play and the devs released it for $1 or less. Thats a damn good deal.
357	0	a	Terrible console port avoid getting it for the PC if you can.
248	0	a	Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of whatâs happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people whoâve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body âat willâ to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say âat willâ I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can âconsumeâ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   Iâd say the graphics are dated, but itâs an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesnât get a pass for, however, is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassinâs Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no âlowâ video settings, hey). Iâm also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as itâs all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   Itâs not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If youâre extremely bored and want to play something that doesnât pose a huge challenge, itâs not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldnât recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.
5177	1	a	For what it's worth, it's pretty solid. It still needs moderate amounts of work. The price tag isn't half bad either, but I wonder if this hurts development. I've also not come across many players, and yes I've only logged 3 hours total. Learning curve is steep enough to engage you, but easy enough to master. Is it worth it? Only if you have patience, and you're willing to engage the developers in perfecting the title, they won't know unless you let them know. But it has enough to keep you interested for a casual encounter.  Pros: -Concept -Variety of Dinos -Abudance of achievements and trading cards -Borderlands art style -Action-packed, hardly a dull moment -Price Tag -Learning curve -Gamepad Support -Augments look promising  Middle Ground: -Vehicles (Solid, but have slightly clunky functionability) -Weapon Selection, limited, but not totally lacking -Environmental effects, rain, frost, etc -Gamemodes (showing promise, fairly solid, needs more depth)  Cons: -Servers are a bit unstable and lag spikes can be frequent (Might have been a clunky night, or a European server, even still, nothing overwhelming) -Limited Costumizability for weapons -Public reaction/community/support (Perception after 3 hours, can change)  Suggestions: After playing this title, I've observed that a lot of it has to do with cooperative play with close friends, or otherwise, gaming buddies. Now, I think a good approach for further development would be to emphasize more on this fact. All other issues aside. A little backround story, maybe some comedic voice-overs like that in Killing floor would give this game a much needed cult-like status. Adding a few story-driven modes, and perhaps even another class type or two. Also, I'm not sure if this is already the case, but sharing credits with others should be possible.  Overall assesment: I'd say it's promising leaning on above average, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for now. I'm looking forward to seeing steam automatically try to update the game over the coming months.
4028	1	a	Great fun for fps/sci-fi game lovers, very addictive, lots of stuff to it :) and giant triceratops :D To sum it all up its basically killing floor with dinosaurs
5843	1	a	I know.......only a few minutes in the game and a review..right? Well, just some info for new buyers, this game gets a little laggy. Its graphics arent the best, but the fun is epic. Big thanks to friends who got me this game.
2695	1	a	It's buggy, ugly, unbalanced, and full of questionable design decisions, .....and motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing dinosaurs. The worst best game I've ever played.
6482	1	a	Great Game can't wait till full game comes out 
1796	1	a	Awesome as hell.But very laggy ;c
5417	1	a	well worth the money gve me hours of fun.
6358	1	a	So when I first saw this game I thought, Hmm Its free for a wile and It has lightsabers spartains hornets and dionosaurs..... Sick!  So my buddy and i download it and yeah it was fricking awsome. Now ive played a few hours of it and Its still awsome and makes you feel like a badass at the same time. The graphics are good, the sound is good, the gameply is good, the animations are good. 8/10 This game is a lot of fun, and if you have some buddys they can play it with you easly because you dont have to set up a server or anything. Yay! So all in all this game is worth the fifteen dollar regular price but for 1$ Its a deal you shouldent pass up.
6246	0	a	It is not a good sign when the game has the graphics of a mid 2000s arcade game and has 15 fps. A game with graphics this average does not need to take up that much of my computer's power. I can run open world games that have better graphics at higher frame rates. i havent even started on the gameplay, which is ok at best, you basically just run around and shoot the little dinosaurs. I chose the assault class and the only weapon i could use was a pistol. Although I am sure this is due to my mental retardation, it still shouldnt spawn the assault class in with just a pistol, especially if you arent gonna use traditional ways of switching weapons (mousewheel, numbers etc.) and that is assuming it even has a rifle.  5/10 Wouldnt waste 5 mins on this ever again
363	1	a	7/10 GTA IV and Assassin's Creed got a baby. A cool baby that is. It's getting pretty dull too soon, because it's almost always the same, though...
3594	0	a	The trailer for the game made the game sound so good and so hyped but in the end result there was just no action.It turned into more of a hunt down dinosaures the size of a skittle.Even for a dollar felt like a rip off.
2091	1	a	i played this all the time before CSGO and it was the bomb 
1714	1	a	Best game that costs 50 cents you will ever play..... its very fun... multiplayer co-op.... aaaand you get to kill waves of Dinos using all sorts of hi-tech weaponry.
651	0	a	A good game in the beginning but later it gets boring and eventually even frustrating.
5751	1	a	Honestly, I bought this game as a joke for me and all my friends, but then later I actually started playing it and now love playing it. Its an awesome and fun game for playing co-op and just whenever. Best 1$ spent on Steam.
3793	1	a	why do i have to buy the game two times!!!!!!
6003	1	a	Used to be one of the worst games I've ever played. Is still terrible, but now terrible in a 'Star Wars Holiday Special' kind of way. Best to play with friends, probably while highly intoxicated or sleep deprived.   Tip: Buy a magnum, only spend money on upgrades, and have a blast.
367	0	a	Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing. Who doesn't dream of having super powers? Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush. On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).  The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?  There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing. It's completly mission-based. The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event. To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything. To complete missions I destroy and kill. To learn more about the story... destroy and kill. Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.  I could really only reccomend this game to people who: a. Like GTA style games (maybe only those who really enjoy stealing tanks and trying to evade the police) or b. Are into the revenge genre
2914	0	a	It's bad.
4322	1	a	Good game to play alone or with some friends.
3267	0	a	Steam seriously needs to get its quality control in order. This is an unplayably buggy piece of trash.
1521	1	a	From what i see this game changed a lot... +1 for developers that delivered what they promesed and that is a rare thing this days
6339	1	a	Great game for just 1 dollar. Like TF2 cross Halo cross Left 4 Dead cross Turok. in short it's an indie FPS masterpiece. However i keep experiencing issues maintaining a decent connection to the servers. It'd be nice if these problems were fixed. The game will often disconnect me shortly after joining, or time me out after about an hour on a certain server. This might just be me but i dunno.   Buy it and regret nothing.
3160	0	a	i should have listened to TB, this game is horrible, im running 2 titans and somehow this game still manages to drop below 30 fps on low settings, waste of time, horrible game. the mechanics are ok i guess, when they work right.
2403	1	a	Very cool game to play with friends. Nice graphics. Dont stop the good work!
6351	1	a	I killed a T-Rex with a lightsaber
2065	1	a	Really good game, worth playing co-op with friends, steam puts up the server for you so no need to use your own local network. Really funm, good graphics and on and on, recommended (:
1041	1	a	This game is insanely fun! The little guy reminds me of Stitch of Lilo and Stitch only he has no qualms with warping into a person and reinacting the chest popper scen from Alien. This game is a great mix of puzzles, stealth, and little bits of awesome that make me squee.
4617	1	a	OK so the previous review was about how buggy this game could be, and i â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not, for some non sensical reason, restarting your computer has fixed it... IDK. it shouldn't have made a difference, but it did. I beat 10 rounds solo, no crashes.... On the PLUS side, i get to play co-op with my new friends *YAY*  Someone needs to find out why a COMPUTER restart fixed this, that's like unplugging a toilet by flushing the one across the street....  So...  AWESOME GRAPHICS, FUN AS HELL CO-OP, Able to solo on easy or lower, PvP matches for the psychos out there who refuse to murder IRL. Unlocks, LEVELING, oh and weapons... It's Turok Co-Op meets Halo Reach... â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome   *FORMER REVIEW BELOW*Formerly the Brutaly Dissapointing Review    I want to love this game so badly, the graphics are great, the co-op survival is gorgeous, the controls are intuitive,it's beautiful, simple and fun.  So why the downvote? BUGGY AS ALL HELL! For 2 day playing it I've been getting freezing and CRASH TO DESKTOPS non stop, like NON STOP! There's only 1 solutions they say, Verify Integrity (done that more then a dozen times, no change) I reinstalled, i changed graphics settings which is BS becaue my rig can run BF4 on max with SSAX16 at 40 fps But it CONSTANTLY CRASHES TO DESKTOP What about solution 2? Send them the Dump File? guess what.. CTD don't make a dump file, i checked....  So what does the all glorious dev say to do? Verify The Integrity....again...and I pass.....again.  If it works for you, this is better then TF2. If it doesn't work it's the most frustrating thing because it's so damn good and you get a huge game 'bock clock'. It's almost as bad as getting friend zoned.  Don't expect them to fix the bugs, if it's broke for you it stays broke, don't expect help or patches. At least it was only 1 dollar. If it works though, you're are one lucky SOB   Derisat the Air Pirate
4203	1	a	Very fun and enjoyable game. A very cheap game that you can play with your friends.
1664	1	a	this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit i cry whever i play this embarassing display of a first person shiiter honestly this game is a lie 2 say it is entertainment becaus ther is like 1 game mode and its the sam thing over and over again so it gets supr â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring rely fast and there are like 2 guns that actually dont suk in the game and the scooter is op as â¥â¥â¥â¥ but the devs suk so they dont patch this â¥â¥â¥â¥ the graffics lack compared to iother leading fps es like batelfeld and cal of duty probs because this game was made by 1 doude in an underground bunkr in nigeria in 3 days 1/10 would ihghely not recomaend d not buy this game
1999	1	a	9/11 Ran into a base as Compy shouting JIHAD!
302	1	a	i like the game but you cant not even understand what there saying that one of the big down fall of this game
6032	1	a	It's ight
1630	1	a	it is a nice game, i hope they add more into it and best 1$ i ever spent, i recomend that everybody buy this game!
3605	0	a	Paid for this game years ago, is now microtransaction piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
820	1	a	This is a fun game as well, finished the 1st game a couple of days ago, gotta say this sequal adds for the Combat and follows the story, it plays well with a gamepad, used a X360 controller, also works with a K&amp;M, but you might not be comfortable K&amp;M. I found no matchs online, its ok, asI played it a while back, and it was fun. If you have a friend to play the game with, i suggest you play MP. It supports both local and online MP. So you can play MP localy with K&amp;M + Controller.
3304	1	a	This is just my first impresions,  It's avesome, gun play fun, dinos fun, movement easy, grafics pasable, sound effect a litle dull, but still fun  It's that rule it's so mediocore thats its fun... standard
4525	0	a	Forgive me lord for I have sinned  Seriously though, this game is incredibly bland and comes off as very ametureish. The UI looks terrible, the game still has lots of bugs, the environments are crazy bland (And WAY too big IMO,) the music is generic as hell, enemies are as dumb as they come and the gunplay just isn't that great. Sure, the game is usually $1 when it's on sale, and I've definitely gotten some great games for just $1 but here, it's not worth it. If you want a horde-mode style game that badly, just get Killing Floor. If you want a competitive shooter, get Counter Strike. If you really want to play a dinosaur shooter, I highly recommend the much more enjoyable Primal Carnage. Orion just isn't worth your time or money.
784	1	a	If Gatling Gears didn't require the absurd Origin login and require an internet connection every time you try to boot up the singleplayer game, I would probably more highly recommend this game. It's a hell of a lot of fun if you're a fan of any modern twin stick shooter and it really challenges you early on. If you can look past the terrible DRM, you'll have a lot of fun with this one.
1534	1	a	Enjoy this game for what it is, a buggy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ with horrific controls for Dinosaurs.  But â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's great.   Plus it's cheaper than a tap water from Starbucks.
309	0	a	Well, the gameplay itself is like a newer Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. That's great and all, but I ran into a terrible bug with the sound. All the sound effects and music are sped up when you're in the levels, and it's horrible, squeaky, and it's impossible to tolerate. If there's ever a patch, I'll re-install this game in a heartbeat.
619	1	a	Worth every coin for this game!
3569	0	a	GTA V runs better than this crab terrible perfomance...
1291	0	a	How to enjoy this game -Leave it on like 3-4 hour while your busy -Get and sell the cards  -Delete and never play this game again :D
3863	1	a	Got drop kicked by a velociraptor.  I r8 8/8 m8
1550	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and good gameplay, the soundtrack is cool. That was a unique experience playing that game, I liked it a lot.
1194	0	a	BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.  The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.  It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.
5617	1	a	This game is amazing. Picked it up for about 10 cents.... Best 10 cents I have ever spent. Even if you only get a couple hours of fun out of it here and there, it is still well worth the money.   In this game you fight dinosaurs and defend your power generator with guns and vehicles (mechs, helicopters, cars, tanks, etc.). You can also get perks that increase your survivability. That pretty much sums it up.  The graphics are nice, gameplay is fun and simple, and the multiplayer is great and active.  My rating: 7.5/10
3060	1	a	Got into a tank and a Stegosaurus picked me up and threm me across the map. 11/10 best game ever. Best $.25 I have ever spent
3336	1	a	For 79p, Tony Hawks Pro Dino Buggy 2004 is the perfect addition to your library. Marvel as the mighty Stegasaurus aids you in flipping your dune buggy into a crazy 2160 degree trick, which nets you the one thing gamers love more than anything else: points.  Highly recommended, never before has the Unreal Engine looks so lush; comparable to the mighty potato mentioned so oft in the archives of the venerable fountain of knowledge that is youtube.  Punched a T-Rex in the face: 13/7
3529	0	a	A game that cost 0.99 cents, is worth 0.99 cents. Dont expect much much from it.
3783	0	a	Every time I try to start the game it just crashes and i unintalled and reinstalled it and it still instantly crashes
3056	1	a	This game is great if you can get it on sale. Go check out the devs change logs. These guys are giving the game a ton of love. The meta critic for this game is in the dumpster, but I assume that has to do with the games rushed release back in 2012. I never played that version of the game, but it's clear they have done a lot to try and improve their standing.   also, F metacritic.  11/10 - you can back stab a t-rex with a knife
595	1	a	Great game! This game is a classic and non the less still is great to play.
5113	1	a	it's cheap, it's fun, it's something that you would want to bring to a party with friends or play by your self, and who doesn't like dinosaurs.
1729	1	a	Fun game! Found it way easier to go stealth as the recon class with a knife and melee ^-^'   Haven't experienced any problems with the game.
5006	1	a	I bought the game and now its free $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$44
817	1	a	I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.  My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.  There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on a sale.
2431	1	a	its bad
2247	1	a	Killy de dino :)
4825	0	a	This was a very quick review, because there doesn't seem to be a lot to the content. This game feels like an arena-styled, Jurassic Park meets Quake. You encounter waves of Dinosaurs, which get progressively more difficult. Killing these waves and surviving earns you points, which can then be spent to purchase new weapons and upgrades. Large Dinosaurs appear which you can fight and then assist in the capture of as side objectives for additional points. The game has a solo option where you have computer controlled NPC's assisting you as a team, or a multiplayer version where you can battle in a group. The graphics are slightly below average for games coming out today, the map board isn't very large and the game is very repetitive. Unless this is your cuppa java, I don't know if you would like it. I prefer better graphics, some kind of storyline, and less repetitiveness, but this game is more about Dinosaur Body Count. I wouldn't recommend it.
2874	1	a	So i bought this game because it was a really cheap for a 4 pack during the summer sale. i can say i was not really expecting much, but i was pleasently surprised. i actually found this game to be very fun. There are some things like the match making, tutorial, and getting to the base between rounds. A lot of time you don't have time to get to the base to get the upgrades. Also a better single player would be nice, but i understand this was made to be a multiplayer game. i would give it an 8/10.
6538	0	a	This game is the most broken, unfinished, rushed unattractive game ive ever played, the controls are broken and in many cases..just start huffing paint and stop working completely, multiple crashes, barely rendered textures and an atmosphere that makes me want to place a colt 44 revolver in my mouth and squeeze the trigger, never ever EVER buy this game...theres a reason it was 92% off...  Just go play turok, it works its pretty, and it doesnt make me feel like a 4 year old with a disability.
3133	1	a	This is a beautiful game, Mechs, Dinos, Guns...'nuff said. On sale it's worth it, off sale it's worth it...please play this if nothing else in your life. One hasn't lived until you kill a t-rex with a mech, or a lightsabre.
2558	1	a	It's worse than having T-Rex arms
1639	0	a	Even though I bought for discount nowadays I feel like an idiot for still having about 4 copies in my inventory that was supposed to gift for friends to play with, but felt embarrassed of doing so because the game was so unfinished. And the other issues with the company itself won't help its popularity. Still kinda fun to play if you take in consideration that it is buggyish.
1305	0	a	It's like one of those browser games everyone played when they were younger.
803	1	a	Shank 2 is a great game, so much fun! remind me old time arcades! and you know, it has STEAM TRADING CARDS !! yeap.. even in the store page dont say it , it has !
3106	0	a	Free to play now. Seriously? -_-
1255	1	a	Spent 44 mins playing and I sure as hell enjoyed them.
5880	1	a	fun with friends
1721	1	a	good side:  cheap dino killing  bad side:  lack of people
4894	0	a	this game sucks like Robin Chuuj
3934	1	a	I love this freaking game bought a 4 pack for my sister
3744	1	a	this game is insane. love it, ten outa ten would recommend to anyone
5744	1	a	fun to play because DINOSAURS
1226	1	a	I finished the game on a short time period with all things gathered and it was really fun. Waiting for the second of the game . Best money that i spent.
5570	1	a	Don't let the price tag fool you, this game is absolute gold. There are hours of fun to be had with a friendly community or solo. You can make this game extremely easy to kill everything or so hard you won't surpass wave 1. You will not regret buying this game, especially at this not-even-on-sale-price. The only thing this game is missing im my opinion (or, rather, what this game needs more of) are guns and abilities. Namely, class-specific abilities. It is a great game overall and is not an incomplete game, it just needs a few more abilities/guns/dinos/maps to play on/with.
4042	1	a	If you like dinosaurs, you will love this game. With a few friends this game is a blast!   AND YOU CAN PLAY AS A MEGASUPERAWESOME DINOSAUR!!    
1930	0	a	Fans of Jurassic Park and Gamers alike have been waiting for years to find a halfway decent Dinosaur video game! To see all of their favorite dinosaurs from when they were children to come to life in a dynamic world with beautiful visuals and emmersive gameplay! Now, after all this time...  THEY'RE! STILL! WAITING!  Instead, play a terrible game with badly rendered character models, horrible animations and ridiculously flawed, generic combat!   Witness a game experience like no other! The development crew spent Days! Hours! Minutes! Seconds making this game! Making sure it was absolutly perf- *laughter* Sorry, oh man, I couldn't do that one with a straight face. But seriously, F**k this game. xD   Experience all of the gamemodes that you've played a million times in every other first person shooter on the planet, but this time, with maybe 6 dinosaurs that you could kill with one shot!   You're going to buy this because you can play dinosaurs? WELL WE'VE GOT ONE GAMEMODE FOR YOU.     Thats it. One Gamemode.    Starring:  Discount Multiplayer Announcer voice from Halo.

1887	0	a	Pros: Uninstalled really quickly  Cons: DOESN'T SUPPORT MY SCREEN RES feels like shooting a water gun Dinos are Op Boring 3gb of waste   Conclusion- Dont buy
5811	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ a T-Rex to death with my Cryo Knife I punched a stegosaurus to death with my Assault Rifle I rode a car to a T-Rex's Mouth,T-Rex became pregnant      10/10 the only reason i buyed this game is for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ some dinosaurs
4411	0	a	Not that fun and there are barrely any in game sounds
543	1	a	this game is pretty much my guilty pleasure 10/10
2271	1	a	This game is awful, the server never work. I recommend you buy a hammer and beat your skull in instead of buying this â¥â¥â¥â¥ ass game
3480	0	a	I don't get it. This game went through so many name changes, trying to shed away the bad opinions of the game because the developers are supposedly working so hard on it. I bought Dino Horde because it was cheap, played a little, and clearly saw the flaws right away : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design. Apparently though, so many reviews of people begging players to give the game another chance because it was much better now than it used to be. So I downloaded it again...   First game : I load a map, I shoot, the gun is immobile. The hands/arms animate, but not the gun... Fine, it must be because the game isn't started, right? I need to find a generator, maybe it will animate after? I find a generator, walking very slowly because everything is sluggish, the game start, the gun still doesn't animate, but now it doesn't animate while a dinosaur is seemingly stuck in a circle in front of me.  Maybe the map didn't load right? I exit the game, start a new one, choose a new map... It's the *same map* as before, but with pumpkins, cell shading and a laughter track added. I play around a little, I die, next map loads. They ask me to choose my class, I don't, I press escape, I am brought to a Spectate other players screen. Weird, it was a solo game. I press escape, I am brought to the main menu, but the map is clearly still loaded in the background.  So in 5 minutes I am faced with the same issues as with Dino Horde : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design.   Why are reviews saying that this game changed for the better? It did not. Adding cel shading to a map doesn't make a game better. The player's animation and movements are all â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. When we jump and touch ground, we get a foot smaller and then pop back to full height. Guns don't animate. Gun's impact particles are oriented with the walls, not with where bullets come from  I have a download cap when I live, no ISP offer unlimited bundles, and yet I re-downloaded it based on all the 'This Game Got Better' posts. I feel like I was robbed of my bytes here. This game is *not* better than it was. I'm deleting this game and I will *not* fall in the Orion trap a 3rd time.
1687	1	a	i like this updated verion
2221	1	a	Really â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5969	0	a	Almost as high-quality as E.T for the Atari 2600.  do you like devs who boost reviews on their own games? this is a great start
6579	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ gets intense, wish there were more players to play with, awesome game
6490	0	a	these reviews sound an awful lot like the captions in the trailer. The game is only worth maybe a dollar... and thats all i paid. it looks and plays like a dollar phone app anyway
3349	0	a	I saw a lot of reviews said that this game offers a lot of fun for a cheap price.Well,that's not entirely true.It's just too boring for me.The graphic is mediocre,the animation is dreadful,the guns have 0 recoil and it's pretty hard for me to find someone playing online since I play from Indonesia.I can't feel the survival thrill like in other wave survival games.It's just too unrealistic and illogical.It's not worth your money,unless you'll want to pay for boredom in a couple of hours.
4881	0	a	This is a semi-good review.   it has great replayability but the core game needs some 'fixing up'   first of all if you look at the system requirements, you will notice that as soon as you start this game you will not be getting good FPS with the kind of computer it 'recommends'.  if they optimize this then I will give a better review.
449	1	a	One of the best game I ever played. I totally recommend this game :)
2154	1	a	Best part of the game:  'Bring me some pizza.' - announcer  10/10 would pepperoni again, all for 99 cents
2078	1	a	BEST Game.
3357	0	a	Nice world. Great Trailers. But sense of accomplishment? Nah.  Single player (solo) in 'noob mode' should be removed from the gameplay options for the maps in this game. There is no noob mode as it suggests. You arrive on the map with a timer to find everything you'd need to be wearing before the waves of dinos start, but you can't look for those things until you turn on the generator which is how you start the first wave, a generator which, for some amazing reason, is located far from the base where your weapons and augments are located. If the premise is that we're establishing ourselves on some alien planet we know is habitated by dinosaurs then why would we put the generator some 150 yards from our main base? One could say it'd be because it'll explode if it gets too severly damaged, okay, then it would also injure badly and/or kill whatever made it explode too. None of this appears to have been happening.  -The dino flyers that attack enroute to the next base we're supposed to capture disappear too quickly or take a flight path that makes hitting them extremely difficult for the new player (differnet flight paths, aggression, etc., in noob mode would have been a great consideration).  -The vehicles were destroyed rather quickly as well.  -There's nothing but a sign over a building that gives any direction, nothing inside to show what station or location in the building of your base you're supposed to use to get weapons or an augment. No tutorial walking you through your toon's options either.  -When the triceritops (I think it was) had killed me and the game went into fight to survive mode, the dino walks away and I am moving at a crawl, unable to carry out that fight, though it said I have 3 lives left, apparently there is no actual rez, just a fight in almost dead mode where you can't even follow the assaulting AI let alone fire at it.  One might think I am asking for a finished game (as I see this has a kickstarter). No, I am asking for the game to be thoughtful of the new player they decided to have a free weekend for (February 20th-27th). If they're trying to sell the game through that free weekend (and thereby also sell kickstarter contributors) then this was their opportunity and though the executable code seems pretty clean and well done, which I do greatly appreciate, the chance for a new player to appreciate the actual game, to have the fun seen in the videos is just not there in the first run experience.  When we compose from a letter to a written story, maybe better said as author a letter or story, to communicate something we are to write to the reader or we'll have failed to communicate to those we want to express something to. Games, and the industry as a whole, are communicating a story and are always looking for new players, yet, their considerations of game design in relation to telling their story seems to follow whatever path the experienced and elitist gamers say is good. These are given preferential treatment in influencing the game design and often of closed alpha and beta relationships. Their input is great for those areas of the game such experience would lend itself to aiding in the design of, but for the new player and selling a game to the vast audience it has potential to reach, the gaming company listening to the entrenched 'professional' game tester, as with this game, finds the game has a very narrow appeal, and that the gaming company ended up designing their game to a player 'first time experience' in an elitist vacuum of these types of gamers whose playing of the game alone will not afford to keep the servers open. Thus the free game play weekend is wasted if its intended purpose was to elicit a large enthusiastic interest of new and highly energized players.  And remember that this free weekend isn't just to sell a game but is also an opportunity to sell it well enough to gain those new players as kickstarter contributors. This will be very difficult to do when the first impression, that first time one plays the game it seems to have entirely ignored that first game play experience, to have failed to give that first time player an overwhelming positive emotional response that brings them to want to continue the game to see what's next, and, to help develop the game further by contributing to the development -- a desire to have a direct connection to whatever comes next in that development.  I can't recommend the game or say it's a good game, I didn't get to go that far and only know how my first experience was worthless in regard to feeling exhilarated, feeling good about the game, and having any sense of accomplishment -- all of these were lacking.   For what I played, however, Spiral gets an A+ for code that's clean and well written, that had no graphic or other odd issues and for creating a visually appealing world that through videos sold me to try Orion: Dino Horde.  I hope they keep at it but know that they can only rewrite the first experience by assuring the one they offer is well scripted to achieve as broad an appeal as they can while well informing the player of how to play, so the learning and achievement are mutually occurring and help give every new player an incredibly positive player experience where their sensation from this experience creates an obvious knowledge that the game designers thought of the player first and their need for newe players to assure the game's longevity. This will also aid in making sure noob mode is easily identifiable for the new player (meaning we know that we can try harder modes and thus want to experiment, the first step in gaining our desire to play and become immersed in the game and its world).  In summary, what I am saying is that if Spiral doesn't design to achieve a large and enthusiastic player base (that will naturally come from new players) then the future of the game is dim, and to take the time to play a game that has a short life span is only good if you're sure you weren't going to play this that long anyway, but if Spiral's design and idea is to have a long standing game then the first consideration should be the new player and making sure these are plentiful and will, over time, not require a free-to-play weekend to gain. It'll be a great game if the same integrity that went into the coding of the game goes into the game's design considerations and map option characteristics.
3653	0	a	Graphics of 90s, gameplay of 90s, bugs of 90s. I could recomend it if it will be 98 year, but now it is a trash. Not worth disk space usage.
4313	1	a	This is a great game. It's very fun to play and it's even more fun to play with friends. It's a very cheap choice but i recommend to wait because the 4-pack costs only 0,99 in the sales. Then you can play with your friends. Recently TREK Industries released 'Guardians Of Orion'. You can try that. But if you don't have the money or the computer for that, i recommend you to get this one.    Final verdict - 8/10
5153	0	a	Last time i played game i just entered in had no idea where to get weapons no guide at all it was rly messy no tutorials graphic sucked those pictures they show on fb community group are far from this game and will never be good.  All at all it not $0.something with no reason....
2745	1	a	Best futuristic dinosaur killer simulator of our day and age. Hands down.
6137	0	a	Uhh... No.
933	1	a	Shank 2 is a great followup to the original boasting good action and a fun amount of fighting. The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack. With an action movie charm, Shank 2 is great for players of the first or those wanting a fun beat em up experience.
5305	1	a	If you don't have a proper team or group of people, then prepare to get eaten. Surviving against waves of dinosaurs (big or small) is not easy nor is it a boring chore. The graphics suck and the character designs for the player are bland but at least the dinosaurs look good. Pick this one up on the cheap.
2567	1	a	Seriously a fun game. The graphics are what appear to be Cell Shaded like Borderlands. The leveling system is easy so you don't have to do a lot of grinding for unlocks. The sound effects are ok. Pretty generic. There's a lot of game modes available the one i like best is the horde mode. Its the only mode i've played thus far. The maps are well layed out and look awesome. My all time favorite graphical part of this game is the rain, snow, and frost that's on the screen. Even on the winter maps you have frost all around your visor. And when you end up ice frost over the entire visor once you go indoors it wil melt away which is really cool.   My suggestion while playing this game is have some music of your own playing in the background. It really helps from getting bored with the game. its a great game to come home to after a long day at work and just chill with some music,
3383	1	a	This. Is a great game for those who like first person shooters  If you ever get broad play this
6347	1	a	this is cool
5572	1	a	Very good for a $1 game, if your in to games with dinosaurs and your low on budget this is the perfect game for you.
4586	0	a	Not that Good.
6374	1	a	Great game for co-op. Very addicting. I nominated this game for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award.' I think this game is under played and more people should get this game.
3036	0	a	this is the worst game i have ever played
398	0	a	i want refound
4316	1	a	this game is awsome haha,love to play this over and over xD
4122	1	a	Very good game, I bought it years ago, it went Free to Play, I don't mind, really, if it didn't I would never have played it again with friends, so here's a summary of good and bad things about it.   The good :  + Lots of skills + Lots of different weapons to choose from + Really fun and all +   MOTHERF*CKING DINOSAURS   + The addition of PvP with playable dinosaur was a god damn great idea + Different classes with very different styles available + Runs greatly on every PC ever, really, if it doesn't work blame your PC and moreover what you installed on it   The bad : - I do not understand Melee :C - What the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on ? - OH MY GOD IT'S A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING T-REX !  Welp, that's it, I don't have much to say about it, see you later on Orion ! :3
4916	0	a	Do not buy this utter piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
652	0	a	Does not work in Mac OS 10.9 or 10.10. No support available from the company.
204	1	a	Exciting, fun, hilarious, gory. Highly recommended.
2622	1	a	Worth the 0.99c, 10/10 would kill dinosaurs again.
1629	1	a	The game is pretty fun, I would classify this game to be that type where u mess around and stuff. Unless you want to take it serously and go on the HARDCORE mode. Mostly all the 'bad' reviews are all the players that paid for the game and when it became free to play, players raged. Pretty good game. I would rate it 7/10
789	1	a	Shank 2 is a cheap game in every way, its hard, and occasionaly unfair. Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.  Before you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.  Another problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on 'esc' and close it, or Steam overlay on 'shift+tab'. Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press 'esc' again and then close menu window.  Boss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.  By accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).  I also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....    
513	1	a	Loving this one.
3274	1	a	This game is nothing like I have seen before. I thought you were dinosaurs and you have to kill humans but it's the totall opposite. I really like this game and i would recommend it
3288	0	a	Really really not worth your time due to bugs, bad game design and almost nothing to do. It makes the tutorals of MOBA's look good as you find out what kills you as you die again to no apparent souse.  This game is for when your drunk and want to rip the @Â£$ out of a game while making bad T-Rex jokes.
5874	0	a	At least the uninstall button is working 11/10
2677	1	a	Recommended.
3163	1	a	First thing I'm going to say is that I'm not clear on who's stealing what from who, as I've heard that the creators of this game are in on a scandal. But I don't really care, because I'm here to review a game, not who made it. ~~~~~Pros~~~~~ - Cheap $0.99 or $0.49 during the summer sale. - Good combat system, not too repetitive. - The multiplayer is great IF you have one of your friends playing with you and you have voice chat. - The graphics are alright by normal standards. But Fantastic for 99 cents. - You can play as a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DINOSAUR (I don't know why you're still reading this after I said that.) ~~~~~Cons~~~~~ - I'll have to get back to you on that one.
5652	0	a	I purchased this game when it was released, I don't remember what it costed me then, and quite frankly I don't want to know. The fact that I paid money for this game haunts me every time I see it on the store page, at least the rocks have textures now. 
6375	1	a	Pretty rudimentary, but fun for the price.
604	1	a	This game is one of the coolest I have ever played. The story is Cool Powers are awesome Controls are different but easy to learn Played for 20 hours Graphics are ok Over all this game is awesome!
2108	1	a	I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR.
545	1	a	This game has more freedom than the US Constitution! The parkour system in this game is amazing. I loved running around, jumping, flying. Sometimes I wouldn't even bother with missions or people and I would just parkour around the world, feeling like a badass. The parkour challenges were also something I enjoyed greatly.  The violence was pretty fun too, body slamming, stealing tanks and choppers, blowing up buildings, hunting for targets to consume, smashing people, slicing people, shooting people, sneaking into military bases.  And it has New Game+! Great for replayability.
5187	1	a	AWESOME! Dinasours, TANKS, Choppers, Biks, Lightsabers, &amp; JETPACKS!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!?!?!?!?
1924	0	a	The metacritic score is misleading? Really developers? REALLY? How hard are you trying to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t yourselves now? This game is an unfinished pile of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥. If anything the metacritic score is spot on. The servers don't work, the solo game is impossible to play, and the game does little to nothing to tell you how to play. The key mappings aren't the best and in all honesty the game itself just isnt finished. You put too much time into how pretty the game looks and not enough time into the gameplay. And I just love how all those 'Quotes' in the trailer give credit to no one. Who are they from? The developers. The funniset thing is I played this for free! Not only did they sell it at 93% off but I still have 4 days left to try out this utter garbage! This game is awful and I cannot recommend it.
37	0	a	I recommend SQ3&amp;4 but better to get the collection on GOG - you have the option to only buy half, it uses a better version of DOSBox (albeit still misconfigured just as here, but it runs best in SCUMMVM anyway). It's also not region locked on GOG as it is here.   Most importantly, the GOG version can be more easily accessed on alternative platforms.
3984	1	a	Got it about a year ago. Looked cool but never played it. Played this week because why not. Spent 31 minutes solo. Had more fun than playing fallout 4 last week.  10/10 would buy again.  #MakeDinosaursGreatAgain
2956	1	a	Yes this game is awesome it might seem lame but it is totaly worth it.
1027	1	a	Nice sense of humor and interesting mechanics. Teriffic stealth action game.
2852	0	a	So Bad Game ! Fail in Graphic and Gameplay ! Problem in PING  BUG BUG BUG ..... WTF
5489	0	a	it is a lot like a more kid friendly version of the game evolve
3981	0	a	This game could've been amazing. It's not.
2120	1	a	funny game to play with friends 
4818	0	a	It committed the cardinal sin of having flying enemies in an FPS.  0/10 no just no
776	0	a	For me, this Shoot'em Up lacks of that 'chaotic' feeling of the genre. Is a little slow for my taste and poor on the variation of the situations so is very probably to fall on monotony. Have some customization for your ship and challenges to take on but nothing special to recomend it.  Requires EA activation.
4268	1	a	awesome game to be fair :D fun everytime you play
5487	1	a	pretty dope as hell. wtb more guns though and a better fov slider.
2137	1	a	Not gonna lie. I bought this game entirely because of the trailer music and because the the developer honesty. Was it worth it? 0.99â¬ for a game that fits perfectly for those who enjoy fps survival games. 10/10 would buy again.
1868	0	a	This game is just horrible. Metacritic has the right score. this game is so bad that they had to make a fake community apprecitation video to spread lies on how 'good' it is. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no replayability, The dinosaurs feel so robotic and unreal. It's way to repetitive because all you do is shoot dinosaurs or shoot other people and you pretty much get the same experience ALL THE TIME. Did i mention that the boss dinosaurs are so freakin bad. they're unepic, they can get stuck in walls and get glitched so you can just fire away, they also feel unreal. The animations are pretty bad especially for the stupid sword. it just looks like you're love tapping those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and not freakin slicing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of those dinos. I really dont want to explain anymore of the horrid features of this HORRIBLE game because there are many. I don't know why there are so many Thumbs up it's just making the developers big headed causing them to make a stupid â¥â¥â¥ video spreading their lies to the world. DON'T BUY THiS GAME.
4608	0	a	You know what this game reminds me of? Left 4 dead. But then replace Zombies with Dinosaurs. Then make the controls built SPECIFICALLY around a controller. Then make half your targets airborne. Then make them impossible to hit. Then replace the other half with chargers and tanks. Then â¥â¥â¥â¥ it sideways, call it Orion Prelude, and release it half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Steam with compelling looking art that does NOT look like the game in ANY way, then make it $0.99! 3/10!
1410	1	a	really fun, there are more levels to complete every time.
3478	1	a	ORION: Prelude is an awesome game that you can play with your friends that is both cheap and fun, it has many weapons, perks, and vehicles, as well as many dinosaurs that you can shoot and beat up, the graphics may be meh, but if you base a game of off just that, then you wouldn't know a good game when you saw it, becuase most games that have amazing graphics tend to have an awful story and/or gameplay, and you have to pay like $60, ORION: Prlude is a cheap $1 dollar game, there is a $59 difference, so even if you didn't enjoy, it's not like you lost money or something, so go ahead and stop reading this review and buy the damn game already, what are ya waiting for, go do it!
3663	0	a	After several attempts of playing this game, like for real. I didn't manage to shot a DAMN THING. I've spend over 20 minutes waiting , searching , sprinting... but I couldn't play it.  Why I couldn't play it? Because this game has tons of random crashes that random things causes them. Just no.
1378	1	a	5/5
4222	0	a	It's broken. Maybe a good laugh with your friends, but not really worth picking up, even for a dollar.
942	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
1281	0	a	Mario-like platformer and I hate Mario.
4066	1	a	EDIT:  So far, Orion: Prelude has not been that laggy. The menu is still a little sluggish, but the game seems to run fine. I will probably re-start playing this now.  Old review: It's a fun game. It can get kinda laggy for me sometimes, but it's not that bad and you get used to it.
314	1	a	I orginally played Prototype on the 360 back in the day and enjoyed it, although i remembered there being really stupid parts that I didn't enjoy. Either way, I decided to beat the main story once again, but in a single sitting because I didn't expect it to take too terribly long. (about 8 hours).  Everything went as I expected it would, It's a fun game to play when you want to goof off and free roam. You can endlessly kill pretty much anything and you have a lot of ways to do so. That's the good aspect of the game.  The bad comes in during the boss fights, the most effective way I found to kill the bosses was using the muscle enhancing power to increase the effectiveness of objects you throw and to continuously run around finding anything laying around to chuck at the boss. This becomes a very long, drawn out, and boring process, being repeated about four times during the course of the main story.  All in all, I DO recommend Prototype if you'd like to have a game where you are all powerful and just want to run around and break stuff.
2080	1	a	I liked the christmas special.
5118	1	a	This game was actually alot of fun! It suprised me
6448	1	a	not the best FPS out there but not the worst either. For one dollar it will provide enough fun. Im just glad I didnt pay $15 for it
5433	1	a	A first-person shooter that has light sabers and allows the player to kill dinosaurs; I am not sure what more I could ask for. Despite the lag I experience during the gameplay, I still loved the short hours that I tried this game.  A dollar well spent, I guess I could say.
4594	0	a	Don't.
2523	1	a	Defintely woth the 49 cents
5726	1	a	Over 9000% I Recommend this game!  - More Dinosaurs - Jetpack so i can kill those dinosaurs with sniper - camper - hh
3868	1	a	Great game, awesome 3D tower defense game. Like Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs. There isn't much bad about this game but the one thing that has me sad is the serious lack of different Dino's. Only 3 or 4 in the game. If you have to play that over and over, what's the fun?
2246	1	a	The only Dinosaur I'll be killing is my computer. Then I can hopefully run this game
609	1	a	Totally underated.
2993	1	a	great game 
1104	1	a	I am definitely too underaged for this game.
583	1	a	pretty good game
1901	1	a	Halo meets cod:zombies meets Jurassic Park. would play again!
4390	1	a	pretty fun game, now that its free i definitely recommend giving this one a try, the major downside is the way the hitbox works. it's great when your playing alone or are hosting, but the bullets register on the host side (which is dumb, hitboxes should always register on player side and have that info sent to the host) so you could be shooting a dinosaur in the face on your screen and not actually hit it at all, so the ping time has to be extremely (impossibly?) low for this game to really be enjoyable with friends
5656	1	a	A really good fun quick pace FPS. Though some of the controls are different than most FPSs they are still easy and fun to use.  The only disadvantage is that it stuggles with connecting and it can randomly lose you from the host it seems, other than that great game.
436	1	a	This is what I think when I play this game: HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL! 10/10 IGN
2711	1	a	easily the best dollar i've ever spent
3990	0	a	i really gave this game a try.. expecially due to the high amount of positive reviews. But in the end.. i couldnt get a single game to actually work.  Its lagging that much, that the game is simply unplayable. The maps are poorly designed. The AI is ultra stupid. There is in ingame shop. The game feels unfinished in pretty much every aspect (engine, AI, maps, HUD, controls etc etc). Nothing is actually 'smooth'.  IMO the game is not even worth the 1$ it costs right now.
1073	1	a	Extremely fun, highly recommended
1208	1	a	I'll tell you what this game, and what this game isn't.  It is: -An addicting, yet casual platforming physics games -Very ingenious with its puzzles  -An exprience worth having solo, and people should go into it blind or based off little reviews -Quite calming -Very buggy at times, but only adds to the goofy charm/replay value as some of the 'glitches' add new ways to finish  levels -Intense at times with battles against other robots, and a lot of the fun figuring out what weaknesses what robot has  It is not: -A game that should not be speedrunned, take your time with it -A hardcore game in any sense, I don't believe the few times that it can be intense isn't enough for the hardcore crowd  It should be: -Apreciated more, I do believe it is quite underrated  Buy it, especially on sales.
4951	0	a	  This game is trash, both because the developers shady practices and the gameplay isn't that interesting. A friend gifted me this.
5971	1	a	i got chomped by a T-rex and lay on the ground bleeding my life out.........while the entire team stood around me holding revival kits laughing their asses off and flipping me the bird.  11/10 would play with those guys again
1186	1	a	The best game for 10 cents^^
93	1	a	Prototype is a very underrated game that nobody knows about, but despite that, it is a hidden gem that provides for hours of fun rampaging through the streets of NYC.  The graphics don't look all that great even though it was released in 2009, however the gameplay more than makes up for this even though some of the missions can be very unforgiving without the right approach.  Oh and did I mention super powers from a mutated super virus and eating lots of people?
2750	1	a	The seal is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ 11/10
1543	0	a	Stop looking at the negative reviews this game is amazing and for $1 it's an absolute steal. 9/10
4777	1	a	But â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was 99 cents
6147	0	a	Bought this game to play with a friend and when I entered the match, it just keeped rotating non-stop, I restarted the game, restarted steam and the pc, and it was still rotating when I entered any match...
5869	1	a	I really like this game. It has several different game modes to play, 3 different classes to choose from each with their own special ability, there's the ability to level up characters, customize the appearance of your character, edit your starting loadout, different rewards each time you reach a higher level, there's a nice array of weaponry to choose from and some cool vehicles to use. You can play with up to 4 other players ie. 5 people in a team and the graphics are excellent (if your system can take advantage of setting everything up full I'd recommend it!).   I have played many hours on this with friends and we've had some epic hours gaming on it. I must admit the game has been buggy from time to time, problems with friends joining and some of the AI can occasionally be glitchy whilst playing like for eg. once I got killed by a raptor roughly 4 seconds after I'd already headshot it clean dead with the Longshot sniper rifle with the damage increase augment purchased. I suspect these glitches are simply down to internet lag between players. I plan to play this game over LAN (1 Gb/s) soon with friends at which point I will update this review.  I would like to note that I don't normally suffer issues gaming with my friends online, We play often on a variety of games and 99% of the time its perfectly smooth. My connection speed is 100 Mb of which I'm receiving speeds of 106.9 Mb/s (12.6 MB/s) Download and 6.09 Mb/s (0.7 MB/s) Upload (results from  http://speedtest.net  tested via closest server). In my rig I'm running an i5 quad core CPU @ 3.3 GHz per core (Corsair H55 Cooler + 2 x Fans), 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) Corsair DDR 3 @ 2400 Hz, MSI NVidia GTX 760 2 GB (NZXT GPU Bracket + Corsair H55 Cooler + 2 x Fans), Asus Z97-P Motherboard, 2 x Kingston 60 GB (RAID 0) for Windows 7 Ultimate and 2 x Kingston 120 GB (RAID 0) for games powered by EVGA 500 Watt 80 PLUS 12v+40A PSU.  My friends whom I play online with the majority of the time are on similar spec rigs with similar speed internet connections and we all live within a 10 mile radius. I suspect where some of the issue is coming from is there are 2 of us using the same internet provider and package, we get the same speeds. My friend who is on the same provider and speeds as myself actually has 2 people playing from the same house which will obviously greatly affect internet throughput. My other friends have much higher upload speeds, up to 20 Mb/s or 2.5 MB/s for those who'd like it converted :) We all suffer these glitches from the AI, some of us more than others so clearly its a common problem which leads me to internet connection issues must be the root. I have also forgotten to point out I also get these glitches when playing with newcomers when I host an open game although I haven't noticed them during solo play however I must admit I tend to mainly play this game multiplayer 90% of the time.  Additionally we tend to get these problems the most when playing Conquest mode which is a 30 round game mode which can last a good hour or more (depending on how many players have joined). I intend to play a Conquest mode game with my usual 4 companions on this game in a LAN situation. The same computers and players as usual, same game mode, rules etc but connected via a 1 Gb/s network switch and see if the problem subsides. If this is the case then it is clear that the most effective way to play this game with friends on this game in Conquest mode would be to get together to play via LAN instead of struggling with glitches via online play.   I have been very specific with this review to help those who may still be pondering over buying this game. It really is a good game, hours of entertainment, loads to do on it and its 95% smooth gaming but there are those little issues from time to time sadly. This is without a doubt a really fun game to play solo but even more fun with friends, as long as you are happy to live with a little lag if you gaming online.   All in all, long review aside, great game, well worth what I paid for it (got it in a sale happily) but its worth the full price in my opinion. :) Hope my review has helped!
3901	0	a	bought this game to play with my friends and was disappointed to discover that the game will not launch on my pc. instead i get a white screen and the task manager says its not responding. i hope this problem is fixed soon 
5243	1	a	You can't beat the price, and it seems like the devs are always putting out stuff for this. The game was kinda unplayable at one point, but it's made a big turn around. Check it out.
3541	0	a	When I played this game back during one of its myriad of free weekends, it was a half-baked piece of garbage that wasn't all that well put together.  When I played this game during this current free week, it definitely showed some improvements and the horde mode is OK but it's still not all that well put together. It also has one of the worst Instagib modes I've ever seen, the kind of Instagib where it is just easier to run up to the guy you're trying to shoot and kill him with the butt of your rifle.  Frankly, this game was more entertaining when it was a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mess.
1775	1	a	What a nice game! -Good points: -Nice graphics; -Good gameplay; -3 different classes, each one with it's gameplay and different; -Lots of vehicles; -Lots of weapons; Bad points: -My pc is a potato, so i cannot play this game over 40 fps; -When a T-rex appears, he throws a rock down into your face; ;-;  I reccomend everyone to play, cheap and always welcome to a shopper account!
5551	1	a	gameplay nice, play fast
799	1	a	So good ,I like game cartoon graphic!  10/10 In the BEST â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3923	1	a	its ok for a dollar
3010	0	a	I don't like this game. 
6300	1	a	I payed Â£0.78 to shoot at dinosaurs for 4 hours, I also managed to make my friends buy it, I also managed to make my friend waste Â£10 on it to get it for his friends. I had a successful waste money for me and my friends spree. 11/10 would 360 shotgun dinosaurs again.
5357	0	a	Halo styled play with dino's. Meh.
2664	1	a	I only played this game for a few minutes and found it to be quite amazing. Some of the aspects in this game remind me of Borderlands2. Very fun co-op modes, loads of guns and tons of upgrades which can turn you into a juggernaut. I really like that you can carry up to SIX GUNS! ( after upgrades of course ) It's an easy game to play for someone that doesn't have a lot of time for gaming and just wants to jump into action.   Graphics are good for the price of this game. The gameplay and mechanics are fine but the AIs' intelligence is a little limited.   All in all it's a fun, fast paced, dino in your face shooter. I give it a 8/10. Worth the price their asking! Thank you for reading my review.
298	0	a	this game is overall fun but the turtorials i had to search on google many times to understand what the hell they meant and they still didnt work. You lose your powers at some point and that gets really boring to play so i stopped when the quest for getting your powers back never ended.
5326	1	a	Pretty fun, got it on sale and it was worth the couple bucks
4202	1	a	But shieeet- it was 99 cents  For real, best spent dollar ever
818	1	a	Amazing game. Fluid controls, visceral combat. and best of all, great couch co-op!
5712	1	a	Great game, probably the most enjoyable game I have played this decade.
2131	1	a	Buy this game, it's a dollar. What more do you have to lose? Unless you're homeless... wait how'd you get a computer?
2652	1	a	A Fun game when purchased on a sale.
4160	0	a	Worst game ever it's a wasting of money. Don't buy it.
4844	0	a	dont buy that game, just dont. bugs like hell, flat storyline and gameplay. just dont buy it!!!
6435	0	a	Still cant find where my dogs at.
2794	0	a	I dont know I played for a few minutes adn unless you KNOW what to do and your in multiplayer mode you'll be fine.
6398	1	a	The game is good but can do with less lag the game was the worst game for lag with a lag so if you could do something about it. All in all the game gave a good scent to survial from really dinosuares. The controls were good in layout and well done. I would say play this game if you got a good computer but if not don't play look else where. One more thing the game could do with is a gameplay to learn how to play it. Thank you for reading this is dragonslayer20003 out...
4557	0	a	I DONT EVEN OWN THIS GAME&lt; BUT I GUESS I CAN GIVE A REVIEW.  Read all the negative ones about the stealing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, and move along
639	1	a	If you enjoy 'poker mechanics' you'll love it ! Would be 10/10 if multiplayer mode was available, sadly you can just face CPU Overall a good &amp; balanced card game
4267	1	a	People say mean things about me, and that makes me mad. Shooting dinosaurs in the face with giant robots makes me less mad. Metacritic don't know crap. Highly recommended if you want the true sensation of childlike wonder.
3976	1	a	For $0.89 this game is a solid choice for anyone looking for a game that is good to kill time also not P2W so thats a plus.
3860	0	a	A total piece of crap to me. I hate the game play, but you can enjoy it. I would rate it 3.5 out of 10
6377	1	a	Surprisingly very fun and enjoyable game.
1001	0	a	Love the concept and it's kind of fun, but. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ frames, weird controls and Origin... I don't mind Origin i use it from time to time, But i much prefer steam, that's why i bought the game on steam.
4165	1	a	Charming
2732	1	a	When compared the the like of Halo and Hatoful Boyfriend, you cant go wrong with this game. But if you compare this game against Airport Simulator 2014 and Gasp, Its still really good!  This game is best for young children. It shows them the importance of staying away from dinosaurs just like in real life. Dinosaurs and guns make a great combination to help their young minds.  Have some self respect and wear a diaper when playing this masterpiece. Taking breaks is a sin.
1678	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this game! 10/10
1485	1	a	10/10 Would Platform Again  
3171	0	a	The Metacritic score isn't lying.
1837	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde had started off on the wrong foot. It was like dino beatdown, and nothing else. Dino Horde, after lots of updates, is now one hell of a game! The game is truly amazing and is fun with friends too. If anything I would defintely recommend buying it now on the sale. Its a bargain for a game with this much potential (y).
3309	1	a	T-Rex grabbed my tank, throws me away. Flipped over. Dead. Raged hard, but funny. Spinosaurus brutally murders me just eating me str8 of the bat. 10/10 I mean it may seem â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up but hey it's really fun.  MAIN REVIEW:  Do you like dinosaurs? YEAH! Do you like getting like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing devoured by them? DOUBLE YEAH! Do you like the Jurassic Parks and Jurassic World? YEAH!  Well, lets do Jurassic Park/World / chomping which probably turns out to be this game. This game has very outstanding graphics and possible real impressions of what dinosaurs were probably and has many cool features such as being in the future and many cool gadgets.  GAMEPLAY: When I first got the game around a year after it's release for $0.99 on a sale when it was originally $15USD, I liked it even though around that time it was ONE of the worst games but I thought it was amazing. Even though it had many bugs and other things I didn't seem to notice those bugs (Maybe a bit but not a mountain full of them) and I knew the game one day would become much more popular. Currently the gameplay is amazing as your objective in the dino survival is to survive for 10 rounds without getting the generator destroyed by the dinos. It might've not seen much but it was very entertaining. Although you probably raged hard when the Spinosaurus ate you, you were still enjoying the game.  Pro's and Cons (Past and Present)  PROS: -The Devs were very supportive and tried really hard to revive the game and suceeded. -Certain maps have a weather system and on cold maps your vizor could freeze -Unique weapons to choose from like Adrenaline weapons -Unique upgrades/augmentations to choose from to help win the game -Well textured graphics -Many different sounds -Well done impressions of the dinosaurs -It only costs $0.99USD  CONS: -Can get bored of it for a while and not play it for a prolonged time -Needs maybe some more classes -Couple more weapons  CONCLUSION: Overall, it is a very well crafted game and very cool and unique features and I would very highly recommend this game and really, it's $0.99USD. Try their game! they are just trying to make a good game and it is so just go ahead and try it.
1200	1	a	&gt;buys for 19 cents &gt;gets 24 cents in trading cards &gt;best game i have purchased 10/10
5674	1	a	Hey, for $1 its a few hours of fun. c'mon a buck.
2896	1	a	Orion: Prelude is a mixed bag, but definitely a lot of fun...and for the price you really can't go wrong. Co-op with friends is a total blast.  Also, dinosaurs!
3413	1	a	rawr this is the best game evar &lt;3333333333 xD
542	0	a	Not happy with this along with Prototype 2, i have played these games on the Xbox 360 platform and i do enjoy these games, i have migrated most of my game play to the PC as i CBA to buy multiple platforms to play the games i like the most, on purchase and download of these games via steam ( Taking into account my Pc Specs i shall disclose below this comment ), i found myself disappointed.  I Cannot run Prototype 1 without serious lag and on the games lowest settings and its tedious that prototype 2 just does not load ( Crashed during basic startup ) i have reinstalled these twice and ensured my rig has its SLI correctly setup for the game.  I ran system requirments lab and well it says i have the minimum for prototype 1 ( il post the link also as its still confussing as it will not disclose the Recommended )  I have both minimum and Recommended for Prototype 2 ( again i can post the link )  My system is pretty high spec and high performance and i can play without a doubt Most games...there has not been a game ive played that i have had issues with and my hardware is quite recent.   i have also tried to go to activation for support but their support for this game on these games for this platform do not come avaliable on their website.....which is frustrating as there is a need for it i believe.  anyway here are the specs of my pc ( Below ) and all in all i would not recommend anyone buying th pc versions of this if they are below the spec i am about to post.

5301	1	a	dinosaurs vs humans. interesting concept and very un. Can't wait for there august update.
22	1	a	This port is rushed, incomplete and a pathetic attempt to cash in on a brilliant franchise while doing nothing to preserve its legacy. The color palatte is horrible, audio glitches abound, and the FMV looks even worse than it did 15 years ago. Steam normally does not dissapoint but this is one of the laziest releases they have ever put out and in its current form absolutely not even worth the $10 price tag
1332	0	a	Crap game with boring level design and â¥â¥â¥â¥ performance on a pretty decent laptop. Didn't enjoy having to search every inch of every level to progress.
1881	0	a	Single Player: PVE review. For PVP look for another review.  in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions. the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots). best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.   i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off. if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free. i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet? (honest question. i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)  basically this is the same terrible game it has always been. good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.  i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)  URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page. Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play. To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended. It STILL has a store.   Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon). Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).
1394	1	a	A fun and casual physics puzzle platformer with a good variety of game mechanics to learn. Very fair up until the last level of the last world, that can burn in hell.
4890	0	a	srly dont waste yout time on this â¥â¥â¥â¥
3674	0	a	Actually the worst game I've ever played.
2503	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game to play with friends. It combines everything you love about wave based multiplayer with the exciting concept of facing herd after herd of bloodthirsty Dinosaurs. This game is constantly being updated and developer Spiral has quite outdone themselves on the latest. Adding vehicals and open world maps has drastically changed the games function and flow, but it's all for the better.  The game's price point is average for a multiplayer-only game in my opinion, but Spiral has kept the in-game purchases limited to cosmetic items and their pricing isn't too hard on the wallet. This combined with how hard Spiral is working on the game and the limitless content that cound come in the future makes Dino Horde one of the best values in co-op today.
43	1	a	 11/10   'Roger Wilco... What else do I have to say!'  An  Epic  Adventure, an  Epic  Man, an  Epic  Game - &amp;hero of my childhood :D  + amazing point &amp; click sci-fi adventure + story + setting + atmosphere + graphics (then) + characters + puzzles + humor   Should be in every Adventure Collection. (At least if you were born in the '80s.) 
3134	0	a	I GOT PICKED UP BY A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TERRYDACTYL. NO ONE PICKS ME UP EXCEPT MY MUM.
1612	1	a	Kiwi spent 2 hours punching a grand total of 2136 dinosaurs.
2582	1	a	I found this game by complete accident while browsing the steam store. Seeing it only cost $0.99, I was intrigued to try it out. I got some friends to play with me, and had an absolute BLAST.    ABOUT THE GAME:
3328	1	a	A strangely fun FPS game enjoyed best with friends. The assets look like they were taken off of a Halo knock-off, but the gameplay of wave-based dino shooting and vehicle driving has a simple satisfaction that other AAA games don't always seem to provide.   That, and for less than a McChicken!
1066	1	a	its nice, starting to get boring but.
6460	1	a	Even though this game has it's bugs, it was probobly one of the most fun multiplayer games I have ever played! 8/10 on my list! However, I do not recommend this game on single player.
1676	1	a	Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, this is the PCâs premier military game. Authentic, diverse, open - ORION : Prelude sends you to war.
4923	1	a	  It's very awesome and fun for such a cheap game.
944	1	a	This is a decent, button-mashing time-waster. It's worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.
2815	0	a	Do NOT waste your time and/or money on this game.  To join a server, you have to wait until the current wave is over. If you die, you can't respawn until the current wave is over. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥. You could be sitting there for over ten minutes waiting to respawn. That is basically unacceptable.  It's like it was designed by someone who has never played an online FPS.   Stick to TF2. Forget this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5858	1	a	Jurassic Park and Halo had a love child. Then that child had cancer. Then the government conducted genetic experiments on this child. Then Microsoft hired this child as a game developer. The result is a hilarious, cheesy game to play with your buddies. For the price, I give it a 10/10.
1163	0	a	An annoying platformer, some will say this is fun because it's difficult, and I'm sure for some that is fine and good, but for me this doesn't do anything special or fun enough for me to want to spend the extra effort it takes.  In the fourth level I started running into physics issues and that sealed the deal for me. When my character just starts flying around the screen not because of anything I did (I think) and falling into a pit, I can't recomend it.
3046	1	a	for 0.99 this game if perfect. And it is better than FPS games like COD for me. I can play it as much as i want with friends and never get bored
866	1	a	Shank is back and hes more dangerous then ever. Shank starts a few years after the first game. Hes on his way to see hes orphanage keeper but to find out shes taken away by army people. So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them. Overall the games is fun as hell and you really need to check out the whole franschie and i hope Klei make part 3 soon i give this game a 8.5/10
1911	0	a	I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, 'why not?', and dove in.  After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click 'play', and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.  Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review.   God speed.
1598	1	a	Orion: Prelude A dinosaur survival/TDM/CTF/etc game that has you shooting dinosaurs wave after wave, upgrading your character and buying yourself better weapons. This game is incredibly fun and never gets old, I have been playing this game for quite some time now, and now that I persuaded my friends to buy the game, I play even more. I strongly recommend you buy this game if you have not already.
327	1	a	childhood game :')
4490	1	a	The game is not perfect, it has a couple of buggs but it is very fun so its worth the money.
877	1	a	Avoid this one, it's inferior to the first game in every way. Weapon loadout is more restricted, the difficulty ramp up is enourmous (even on Normal), and it doesn't have a co-op mode (IMO the most fun way to play the first one). Even the story is much worse: the first one is pure Robert RodrÃ­guez/Tarantino, while this one has zombies, cannibals and other supernatural elements. A real letdown, because the first Shank is a great game.
5678	1	a	Fun gameplay! It's really for those who enjoy a quick game with some challenge.
1931	0	a	This game is the worst catastrophe since Chernobyl.
6536	1	a	Wow this game is ridiculously fun. Get it!! Only 99 cents for a limited time! (Feb. 27th?)
2521	1	a	Hey yo, it used to suck. but now it doesn't. It's pretty average and that's not a bad thing, the gunplay is average, the graphics are average, the gameplay in general is average. You're paying a dollar for a 20 dollar game. Just buy it. You can get a lot of enjoyment.  Then again there are safe spots and the jetpack needs to be removed from assault or something because it completely breaks the game. But still, worth the price.
3707	1	a	i played halo 1 once
1279	0	a	Same sh*t with flash games you can play completely free on internet. Dont even bother, waste of time.
4166	1	a	Still better than GMod.
4613	0	a	Well, Its almost FREE, But sad to say Its just a time of waste if you feel like killing dinos all day with no story Progress, No well drawn people, And dont forget the Gameplay. Overall-1/10
4772	0	a	laughing just at the fact that they put random (fake? who knows) people comments on theyr video to show how good theyr game is..  'this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥' randomguy25 'never hated a game so much' trollaccount4ever
5816	1	a	I originally wrote a review back when this was Orion: Dino Hunt, I'll leave the original review at the bottom.  The developers have come a long way with this, they even admitted it was a disaster at first. But they did something I'm very surprised and pleased with; instead of abandoning this failed game, they reworked it, made it better and sold it cheaper.  It may be just another Unreal wave survival game with little-to-no story, but it is fun to play, especially with friends. The developers have realized that they should just make this game fun more than serious, so you get people running around in Halo Spartan-style armor with lightsabers and cheeseburger hats.  The devs have changed my opinion on this title, it is worth getting this cheap if you can and having some fun running around in this game with your friends.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Yes, I know, shoot dinosaurs in the face with high-tech weaponry, yadda yadda  But that gimmick doesn't last long. All the survival matches have the same format and waves of enemies no matter what the map is. Plus the game has a lot of quirks; the animations feel unrefined, the user interface is very user unfriendly (there's no labels or hover-text to describe what each number or button is for, and some buttons you have to double click quickly or it will only play an annoying select sound), the controls for vehicles feel awkward, and there's plenty of glitches.  I was in a vehicle when I was tossed up onto a rock by a T-Rex, none of the wheels contacted the rock, so I couldn't get down, and the vehicle was at such an angle that whenever I stepped out, I was magically forced back into the vehicle. I had to wait about four waves before my teammates could ram a tank up onto the rock far enough to dislodge me!  This game has an interresting concept (although I can't find a story anywhere for this to make sense), but it's just too clunky and unrefined for it to be a worthwhile game.
4675	0	a	i have more then 1 reason why this is not a good game (bad game)  1: i playeed this 8 hours then a long time not played and then when i want to play it (today) it doe not start so i look up forums aint standing me problem so i deleted and installed again and it said missing file but it stopt the download when it said missing file -_-  2: you need a good grapihc card and or good PC
4059	0	a	this gamne is terrible it has a bugg that makes it unplayable where you spin uncotrolably
2509	1	a	Great fun, would recomend for all fps fans.
5149	1	a	You're basically Boba Fett with a light saber, thrown into the world of Turok. 10/10 would keep killing Dino....**** I just died...
2173	1	a	Heavy Game , Need High Spec for play this game . cheap game but great , and need faster inet :(
3439	1	a	surprisingly good fun this game. if you have a bunch of friend to play with then you can have hours of fun with it. wouldnt recommend just for singleplayer
3930	1	a	Orion prelude is a great game and it has it's ups and it's downs but I think it has way more pros than cons lets look at that. Pros.  -1$!! How can you pass that up and sales are just amazing. (or so I have been told I have not know'n this game long enough to see one.) -Five player co-op and quite a few other game modes. -A lot of perks and weapons. -Being able to play as dinos. -Awesome vehicles. -Unlockables like starting weapons wehicle upgrades and starting perks and a few other things. I think I have gotten most of the things that are good now lets transition to the bad. Neutral. Stuff that is in between. -Trading cards they are nice but some people may dissagree. -Graphics im fine with them but they aren't the best. I think I have covered these too. Cons. Stuff that is not really of the liking of most -There are too many orion games to give this one too much attention to adding stuff and fixing bugs. -It is a bit grindy but this is not ussually a big problem. I dont know if I got all the cons but I can edit this later.  Final rating 8.5/10 I would get it.       Tl;dr This was my first review so I don't think it is perfect and I might view it differentally later.
2591	1	a	I rode on a Pteranodons back. 10/10 would fly again.
92	1	a	Honestly a brilliant game that I well and truly loved and getting it on offer 4 quid to boot. Bring on the next sale, I need Prototype 2!
530	1	a	Seems like i bought this game ages ago and finally got around to playing it. Pretty fun game when you are running around just blowing stuff up; but once you get down to doing some of the missions (aka the actual game) things go down hill quickly. It is fun to just run around the city roaming around killing people but the missions really restrict things which is pretty unnecessary. You are supposed to be some badass yet even a single enemy can pretty much kill you because the way the combat is designed you have to dodge everything with no option to block so basically if you get hit you are going to keep getting hit, and then you get hit into a corner, then you get beaten to death by giant mutant things. Is the game worth buying though? Sure if you get it for like 5 bucks, but just know it is going to be pretty damn hard. Not because the game is difficult, but because the occasional horribly designed missions and boss fights are going to make it that way.
5704	1	a	Watching this game continue to improve has been awesome, and they are right. Only developers can fail. These developers have not. If only more developers stuck to it the way these ones have, some wonderful concepts in otherwise terrible games would not go to waste. If I hadn't already bought the game for all my friends, I would now.
5341	0	a	this game is so horrifly terrible. Not worth a quarter
1510	1	a	Fun game. Was skeptical when saw it for a dollar. But it is a hidden gem. Definately worth at least 5.
2800	1	a	greatest game ive ever played 
4948	0	a	Someone else bought this for me and I still feel ripped off
2213	1	a	Unreal Engine vehicles/10
4469	1	a	10/10 like work  thanks :yay: good! all Rush buy  all -off summer sale
4101	1	a	Yes it's worth 1 dollar.
2324	1	a	A T-Rex threw a rock at me and made me fight to survive. My friend being the great comrade he is raced towards me only to get picked up by a Pteradactyl thus plunging to his death. 10/10 would play. For all dinosaur enthusiasts.
3588	0	a	Don't waste the time it takes to download this.
1048	1	a	Terrible, terrible console port. I tried my very best raising the FPS above 20, without any success. Don't buy this one for PC. Even if it's on sale.  Edit: Now that I've got a much more powerful PC it seems to work alright, with the exception of the framerate being capped when first installed. There's a handy reference to unlock it over on the PCGaming Wiki:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Warp  It's an alright, quirky little game and quite fun. The port still stands out as terrible though, so beware before buying it.
4502	1	a	Simple pickup and play fun, I do like punching Dinosaurs too.
813	1	a	Amazing game + need players to play with.. in survival mode
5453	0	a	Survival game versus dinosaurs? Nah,i dont really like this game Because the story and level gap is to determine the game ==
1309	1	a	Bought it on sale. Paid itself back in card drops. Decent game too.
5405	1	a	Ruined to my life!! Buy This Game I LOVE THIS!!!
4696	1	a	Futuristic weapons Prehistoric enemies Turok meets Halo, absolutely blast of a game!
3718	0	a	Argueably one of the worst games I've ever played. Guns without sounds, lack of decals and general polish, horrible UI and awful animations.  The little amount of voice acting present is low quality and repeated over and over. That this game has sold as many copies as it has makes me very sad.  Steer clear of this game.
6516	1	a	This is legitamely the most fun I've ever had with one dollar. Grab some buddies, spend a dollar, and have a blast! Don't miss your chance, get while it's still over 90% off!
5126	1	a	Costs next to nothing, but all the fun of games 10x, even 50x, its price. Buy it if only to have a game to play with friends. Drop-in, drop-out, play for 5 min, play for 5 hours. Great muliplayer. I mean you can fight a T-Rex in a mech. Do I really need to say anything else?
4180	1	a	The blood, sweat and tears put into the creation of this BRAND NEW sequel is true dedication from the best of the best developers...   But the fact it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes it fun!
2000	1	a	this is a great game when it comes to survival mode and could expand greatly i find its like a killing floor halo mix i bought the cryo blade which is like a katna and sliced at the t rex and just rampaged whiile my teamates distracted it and it was all slow mow it was amazing
6233	1	a	First off, let me just say that this game is unique from alot of other titles out their. You get to play in some power armor from the original Fallout and fight of dinosaurs. What more could a man want from a game?
5494	1	a	Oh my! I've played for only 20hrs and already I have had lots of fun. For 99c you get: Good graphics, a host of weapons, and lots of Dinos to wreck! Totally recommend this! 2 thumbs up!
5012	0	a	I stopped playing and lost all interest after being forum perm banned because the devs think the steam forum is not a place to say things about a product in which and where it's hosted to directly download, Banned from the forum for Complaining about the disconnection issue at the end of the round  Disconnected from Host How annoying  Several threads   Really a Permanent ban from the forum well die in a fire. No wonder this game's not so popular.  If this game ever picks up the pace i would say they changed kiddie developers why did i bother with the 50cents in the first place all the signs were there to tell people this is not a good game.   I sincerely hope the person who banned me gets some form of cancer and dies because.
373	0	a	Unplayable one of the worst ports I have ever played. Solid 13 fps no matter what the settings even on the menu's, audio was skipping in cut scene's and some resolution bug ment I had to play it in 720p. Screw looking for fixes just going to get a refund for this and Protoype 2 which wouldn't even start just kept getting prototype2.exe has stopped working. Maybe its because I have ATI/AMD graphics but even if you have Nvidia don't support this game.
705	1	a	Wow! What a great game. Neat take on turn-based strategy. Good story and characters as well. And a great price to boot!
4532	0	a	Worst 12 minutes of my life.
4197	1	a	I got this ame in Early Access through my friend's dad. Back then, this game ran choppily and was called 'ORION: Dino Horde.' I have not played this game as it is now, but it looked promising. Now that is in full release, the servers will likely be full. Also you get Steam Trading Cards, which you can sell. They fetch a good price too.
2564	1	a	Good game. Enjoyable when you're bored. Easy achievments aswell.  9/10
3227	1	a	Cutting edge. Regular updates hourly, and its only a pre alpha! Its like the best early access its going to change the gaming industry. Why dino you go get it now, even at full price of 59 dollars a steal!!!!!!  Five stars - and that aint the safety rating!
867	1	a	I shanked a mexican and he died 10/5
450	1	a	6.8/10 would throw a car on a chopper again,,,
2465	1	a	I can not express the greatness of this creation
1583	1	a	I ran into a dead T-Rex's body and it moved like it didn't weigh a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton. Dino/10.
5110	1	a	for the price, just play it. it is a crap ton of fun.
3364	1	a	Don't know why it has a 36 metascore, it's a fun relaxing game where you get to blow off dinosaurs heads and have an objective to complete with a team
3784	0	a	It's 1 dollar for a reason.
2181	1	a	WOW THIS GAME IS SO SIQ. GETS ME REAL HORNY. OH THE DINASOURS ARE REALLY REALISTIC AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN. IM NOT BEING FORCED AT GUNPOINT TO WRITE THIS, I SWEAR. THE GUNPLAY IS NEX GEN. THE QUICKSCOPING IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING 1337. BUY THIS MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ER RIGHT NOW.
1648	0	a	Unfortunately shady devs.
2596	1	a	Its a fun game. Shoot dinosaurs. The end.
844	1	a	Nice beat 'em up sequel 'directed' by Quentin Tarantino :)
6130	1	a	When you look past the terrible game connections and the horrible servers. This game is actually amazing. I don't think I've ever had so much fun just by getting eaten by a T-Rex. Everyone is usually really good when it comes to teamwork and as for the weapons and armor, it's all pretty simple. Grant you I haven't been in a game long enough to complete a match (connection) but hopefully after the whole connection bug is fixed, this game will be a pure diamond in the ring. [7/10]
6498	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks, they release a video saying its become so much beter, but all of that is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
5768	0	a	After playing for half an hour I guess I know y this game is so cheap. Because it's cheap. Nothing attractive, u can get the best weapon in coop after the first wave.  No challenges and strange task settings. And btw, totally a terrible firing sense. DONT BUY THIS GAME.
4336	1	a	dinosaurs and stuff. would recommend
4378	1	a	Punch Dinosaurs. Nuff said. But in all seriousness, this is a very fun game. But it's better if you have friends to play with. if not, it's still great to play.
2517	1	a	This game has a great idea and the core gameplay is super fun. It's really fun to play with friends and is well worth the price.  I just have one problem with this game: It runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my computer and desperatly needs to be optimized.  Other than that, 10/10.
1487	0	a	Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.
5689	1	a	Cheap and fun.
5660	1	a	Killing dinosaurs with a lightsaber using a jetpack = priceless. This game = 1â¬. Your profit= infinity - 1â¬ = infinity.  And on the plus side there is no voice chat so there are no crazy russian kids.
4440	1	a	nice in the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2112	1	a	For the price 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Sound 8/10 Overall i give this game 9.5/10  Fun to Play!
3200	1	a	I enjoyed the game thoroughly. In just an hour, I rode a plasma-laser Warthog, killed a Triceratops 20x my size, got thrown off of a cliff by a Pterodactyl, shot about 3x as many bullets as you can find in an armoury in Texas, and found myself lost in a winter-wonderland, forgetting that it wasn't an action-rpg, and that I had a base to defend.  7.5/10, would pay up to $20.00 for this game.
900	1	a	Excellent game with very good action and, ofcurse, violence! Very bad Shank's sequel, one of the greatest disadvantages of this perfect game. Shame...
5694	1	a	superb game if played online..
3645	1	a	This game should be part of 'Steam's early access' Program it needs a lot more work, came out year ago and they revamped this game for the better but more effort is needed to be done to call this a 'completed game'
483	1	a	To start, the port of the game is acceptable. The game's highest resolution setting is 720p, and the graphics certainly aren't very impressive for a 2009 PC game. InFAMOUS looks better on PS3 really, and it came out at the exact same time. I played this game with a controller, so I can not tell you if the mouse and keyboard controls work well. The controls with a controller are alright. They aren't as precise as I'd like, but their good enough to keep the gameplay enjoyable. I experienced a couple crashes, but the game was fairly stable overall.  The gameplay is better than the port and is a nice bit of mindless fun. You can slice, throw, crush, and consume people by the dozen. The homicidal maniac within the player will have a blast butchering helpless soldiers for quite a while. However, eventually your inner homicidal maniac will realize there's nothing else to do but kill kill kill, and he or she will begin to grow tired of the indiscriminate mass murder. You'll probably reach this point before you finish the game, especially after half the enemies become super soldiers, large mutants, tanks, and various other enemies that will knock you about stunning you constantly and throwing you around like a baseball among a group of American children. Getting around the city is quite enjoyable. There's just something satisfying about jumping 50 feet into the air and gliding around New York, but this also begins getting old with time.   The story is forgetable, but if you're buying a game where you play as a superpowered mass murderer for story, then you're clearly looking in the wrong place.  This game fills a good few hours with hack and slash joy, but outstays its welcome. I'd recommend you get it on sale.
5765	1	a	got trampled various times by triceratops. 10/10 would do again.
4206	1	a	Its neato burrito :)
5291	1	a	This game doesn't seem extreemly polished at first but for some weird reason it's really, really fun :D
3226	1	a	It sucks. There you go. Everything about it sucks. I bought is for a dollar on a sale. It was hardly worth that dollar. I've only gotten around and hour or so on it, and that was when me and my friend felt like getting angry at a game. Just don't bother yourself to buy it. Please, don't. Don't let the developer sucker you into this crap. It's so repetitive. Please don't.
208	1	a	Aside from it's graphics, Prototype is much more in-depth with it's gameplay and overall being a badass than in it's sequel. Anyways, it brings up a slightly interesting plot. But nonetheless, everyone buys this game for it's AWESOME gameplay. The game is challenging, it may not be rewarding, but it gives you upgrades and extras for doing such challenges and overcoming them. As a personal owner of the game, it doesn't have a ton of replay value, play it one, two, or maybe even three times and it becomes stale. That's when the game's challenges and events (oh god the events) come into play.  This game is worthy of a 6.5/10 rating, i really couldn't decide between it being a 7/10 or 6/10.
1763	1	a	this is a great game a mashup of halo jpark a little bit of ctf &amp; survivle
4487	1	a	This game has awesome co-op! They seriously have improved so much since last time when I played! Go and get it, It has beautiful environments, and has Multiplayer go fight against players and friends  I. Am. Now. A. Huge. Fan. Of. This. Game. You. Should. Be. Too. :)
2647	1	a	Shank a raptor, for cash....
4702	1	a	this game is very fun if you have a decent computer.
5422	1	a	Running i7,8GBRAM, Geforce GT 720.  Stars: 1.5 ASSTAR RATING (so low it hurts my â¥â¥â¥)   -Pros- -FPS Dino Counter Strike -kill dinos -childhood memories    -CONS- -9mins and my â¥â¥â¥ hurt, so that means (ill be switching to a diffrent game.) -Play to waste time, in between wasting time like usual..
1893	0	a	A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.  Where to start?  First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.  The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.  The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.  The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.  Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.  The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.  I went down, it told me 'Fight to survive', there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.  Gunplay is fairly weak.  The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.  Voice acting is okay I guess.  A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.  Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?  So what are terms for buying it on?  If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?  Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.
6262	1	a	Great game over all but would be better if it was just a tad optimised for lower end rigs so i can play it with more friends
5427	1	a	 Orion: Dino Horde/Orion: Prelude.  This is a relatively fun game, It has quite alot of customizable options as well as a neat Combat System. Now one of the main objectives of the game is to defend against 10 Waves of Dinosaurs increasing in difficulty which each Wave passed; You have a lot of weapon choices to purchase and use as well as Vehicles you can use to help defend against Dino Hordes varying from Ground Troop Carriers to large airborne Helicopter-Like vehicles that specialize in dishing out damage to the Dinos. While the game is alot of fun it does take some time to get used to and lacking a Tutorial can see many new players dying to the enemy Dinos quickly and severly weakening your team. Putting aside the lack of a Tutorial i really enjoyed this game in the short time i had to play it; It does have a tendency to crash every now and then but apart from that it's a pretty solid and enjoyable game.  I'd rate it a 8/10; Would have been higher if the game had an implemented Tutorial system, I did die quite alot in the first few rounds i played on this game.
4892	0	a	Please don't remove this negative review. I am but a wee boy.
661	0	a	I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.
3125	0	a	I got this game because I was expecting turok, what I got was a laggy blurry dino thing chase me around until I finally figured out the controls. THEN I was killed even faster than when I didn't know what I was doing, due in part by lag. I think this could be a great game, it just needs more work.
4561	0	a	this is a horrible game
3378	1	a	Literally don't know wtf this game is but I bought it and kept it cuz it had dinos. So worth it. (Idk if it is cuz I don't understand this game).
4237	1	a	I adore this game its a ton of fun I highly suggest it its like killing floor with dinos.   (also random tip you can ride on the wings of the Vtols and the backs of the dragonflies and its very very hard to fall off even if they start going in circles.)
4657	0	a	dead comunity laggy as hell you dont know what happens half the time wasn't worth the dollar i wasted on it  pros: my steam account got upgraded to premuim
6504	1	a	it vary fun:) 
5464	1	a	Its not all that but its fun.
3089	1	a	I like dinosaurs! (previous review)  [NEW REVIEW] ORION: Prelude is still one of the best games I've played, far better than most of those $40-$60 games. For just $1 hundreds of hours could be made and especially with friends. Because the price is so low it's very easy to find or get people to play. I'd also recommend their newest game ORION (The ORION Project), it's brilliant and more fun than this and this is already exciting to play.  I rate 5/7 (if you all don't know it's reference, get off the internet) If I find you on a server, I will rek you by sniping your balls off (and v-a-g-i-n-a-s for those who have)  Have a pleasant day...
1195	0	a	cannot enter the game. tried several times but it always freezes when loading  I believe it is a good game such a pity :(
3724	0	a	&gt;what is A.I B A D G A M E A D G A M E  I feel sorry. At least the devs tried to make this good.
6308	1	a	First, let me be clear that after 0.3 hrs in game, I was able to get the game to launch. I wasn't playing, just running an EXE that bombed. I have a Toshiba Satellite with Win10 and a few games just give it indigestion (Examina and Lost Mythologies, amongst others). I am not sure if this is one of them. I unistalled the program (a bit tricky) and reinstalled it. I got to the main menu and its subs and stopped.  So, I am giving a thumbs up for all the fan boys and a warning that it may be witchy if you are running win10. Try removing and reinstalling the program after you scrub all you caches and registry.  
3608	1	a	'Halo with Dinosaurs' My friend said to me. I find it to be pretty accurate.
5434	0	a	consolitis. The slew of positive reviews are developer shills.  Do not fall for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.
1404	1	a	Played through the first 3 levels, was fantastic fun, better than most platformers and more enjoyable too. 15 pence most definitely well spent.
1632	1	a	There was a dinosaur I got a laser rifle There was no more dinosaur  10/10 - Would murder dinosaur again
6125	1	a	Pretty fun game definately worth one dollar
2922	0	a	Fighting dinosaurs is boring, and the PvP is the worst I've ever seen. Aiming is unreliable, the game lags with 64 ping when 4 people are shooting, its terrible.  Dino D-Day is a much better game if you want to shoot dinosaurs.
1094	1	a	I bought this game on a sale for 0,19 cents, hoping that the steam trading cards that come with it, would grant me a profit once I sold them.  EDIT: 0,08 cents profit lolz
4002	1	a	best 99 cents i have spent :)  good game! love how u can customise your character. when you play solo maybe 2 or 3 bots to help out could be good. but whateves. fun game ! awesome idea for a game hehe !
4443	1	a	it is fun
5260	0	a	It was fun before the 'Prelude' title came about. Now the game feels like a generic P2W / F2P title.
1002	0	a	Crashs and doesn't run
2178	1	a	I got chased by a T-rex 10 times bigger than me. 10/10 would wet my pants again.
6162	1	a	Can Be Extreamly glitchy, overall a good game
5910	0	a	It is laggy and had a bad graphix on my pc but it has great dino-combat series , it doesn't have much weapons so kinda sad
1492	1	a	The Metacritic score is misleading. That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde. The game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.  So, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.  My only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.  But other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.
6478	1	a	Now my opinion on this game is both good and bad because this is both extreme ends of the scale. I played this game for a while on most of the game modes and stacked up just shy of 40 hours game time so I hope my opinion on this isn't dismissed lightly. Anyway, Orion: Dino Horde is both a great game but it needs a large amount of tweaking before it is worthy of its famed rating. It has great content with weapons from a basic .45, fully auto or duel high powered pistols. A good variety and mix of guns including Light Machine Guns (LMG's), Sub-Machine Guns (SMG's), shotguns and sniper rifles, and not to mention the high grade adrenaline weapons to add some bang to your buck. There are some awesome perks to that give various boosts and take the game to a whole new level of entertainment.  Now onto the maps. The maps are epic to say the least, they have a great range with all varieties from night to day and even frozen varients, some are even on an enormous scale taking 10 - 20 minutes just to get from one side to the other while at the same time avoiding or killing dinos as you go. The community on this game is great and all are very welcoming and just make this game that much better, a big shout out for them.  Overall Orion: Dino Horde is a rollercoster ride of fun, planning and a rush of excitment when the going gets tough! But as all games do they have room for improvement so now I shall speak of the down sides.  Firstly is the most dominant of the problems, the lag. Despite this is a great game all round the lag really dents its rep and causes it to become almost unenjoyable and in some cases unplayable do to whats known as a 'rubber band effect' which causes peoples eyes to hurt from the lag on the screen. This is a server issue with the game and once its gone will be a huge improvement to the quality of game play.  The next issue would be dino controls in rampage mode, using the dinos is fun but is almost impossible to use them to any effect, in all my dozens of games I only met one person who could use the horde dinos well. If they were given an aimer to help guide biting, grabbing, throwing and spitting it would make it so much more fun but at the same time the dinos do seem a little over powered as they are but if the human's were given the option to spend money on guns or perks instead of a set class loadout it would level it off nicely.  Finally to my personal suggestions, these are neutral what I feel could spice things up. More guns! currently there are:  6 pistols 2 SMG's 2 shotguns 2 LMG's 1 Assult rifle  3 sniper rifles and 1 sword (excluding adrenaline weapons)  Although this is a great range of guns I think it would be nice if we had more of each type and if the stats were tweaked because SMG's are actually better than LMG's and LMG's are a support weapon designed to use high .cal bullets with a large mag, not as a controlled weapon like an SMG. But more assult rifles would be first rate with me, I personally am a fan of assult rifles and was quite sad to see only one of them to use so adding more would be a big boost to weapon selection.  My last suggestion will be a more base function that is currently missing from the game as a whole, a tutorial. When you start the game your thrown in the deep end and I personally dont mind because I catch on quickly but others might not and would take a while to learn the game. Adding a practise mode with a built in tutorial showing all the game funcions and what all the buttons are and how to use all the equipment to its fullest would be a big improvement. Not only would it leave less questions but give a direct insight into how to better play the game.  This is all I have to say on the game at the moment so based on my experience this is a great game that has lag issues and needs improvement but has amazing potential to become a truely epic first person shooter.  My rating for this game on a scale of 1-5: graphics - 3 weapons - 3 Speed - 2 connection - 3 vehicles - 3 controls human - 4 controls dino - 2 game modes - 5  Overall score - 3 (with improvements could become 4)  
6338	1	a	i would totally recomend this game (i cant really explain that much ) but its one of those games you have to spen ur money on
2034	1	a	Would never have thought id enjoy this game, but it was free to play so i thought id give it a try. 12 hours of gameplay later and i guess you can say im addicted! Definitely a must play. Worth way more than $14.00
5481	1	a	Great fun with friends for the low, low price of only â¬1
3848	0	a	Litterly not worth the trading cards i sold to get the .99 cents to buy this..... soo glitchy, very little ingame instructions and the animations are terrible. THE worst game i have played  
5290	1	a	Years old and not quite all out action but none the less addictively fun and entertaining running around shooting dinosaurs in an Unreal Powered environment.
3479	1	a	This game is so bad you can't stop playing it.
3556	0	a	Where do I start with this game? I don't even know HOW to describe it. Its like dinosaurs, future tech, and master chief all jumped into a blender and was then consumed by the game developer. Time passed, and so did the product through the developer's intestines, leaving us with this 'game'.
1115	1	a	BEEP is an amazing physics platformer made from good developers. It has lots of fun and tricky puzzles that will make you feel determined to solve them. Definitely worth its price especially if on sale.
4400	1	a	Fun to watch your friends get eaten by dinosaurs, 10/10 would watch/play again.
2653	1	a	This game is Awesome to play with Friends! if you got friends to play buy it if its cheap
4218	1	a	As silly as this game is, it's addicting and awesome :D You slay out dinosaurs in many different game modes, purchasing weapons and upgrades as you advance, as well as vehicles
3457	1	a	The best thing since buttered bread.
539	1	a	Pros: Great (anti) superhero-like game. Gameplay is fun, combat is good, and storyline is so-so.   Cons: Fun game but one play-through is probably enough, so get on sale. Storyline is blan, but the gameplay makes up for it. Characters seem blan as well, but definately worth a playthrough.  6/10 (Kinda reminds me of the Hulk video game on PS2)
4954	0	a	A pretty bad game overall just MP worth it none at all. Buy it for a 1 cent or max 50 
3452	0	a	ok for its $0.99 deal but not very fun, quite repeatable
6349	1	a	Ok, this might not be the BEST game ever, but it's pretty damn fun for a while. Plus, it's only $1, so I'd say it's worth buying.
1043	1	a	Just buy it !!!
3414	0	a	Where to start....  I played this game when it was a disgusting clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of bugs. It was as horrible as their trailer depicts it to be. I played for maybe 30 minutes before I had enough.  It has come a VERY long way. However, it is still astonihing to me that action propmpts are still missing (it took me about 3 waves to figure out how to purchase weapons, and an aditional 3 to figure out how to get reloads). Granted, most of the game breaking bugs are gone, but don't expect your gameplay experience to be close to what the trailer sells. YES there are high intensity moments...every few waves.  The controls are ok. Except when you are trying to hit flying enemies...that feel closer to puppets following a rail. Then you have to have very precise aim, else they will smack you and fly away. Or, play it risky, get the shotgun, and wait up until they are about 90% in your face before you take your shot.  The game, to me, is not worth $1. This game feels like a F2P that would beneffit from a microtransactions scheme. Seriously, not for me.
3354	1	a	Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ does this game keep changing names? Nah I don't care whatever it's ok, I got it for free so â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, have a recommendation.
3694	0	a	WASTE OF MONEY RATHER BUY A BATTLE SCARRED SKIN IN CS:GO!!!
2211	1	a	I really don't understand why the game has such a low rating, it's super fun! Playing with friends is fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking to have some casual fun
5276	1	a	A few cent's to experience how truly the dinos died C:
6195	1	a	I can afford this game with the coins under my sofa.  420/420 NGI
1028	1	a	Really nice little game. It will be worth your while.
1681	1	a	There are a lot of reasons to play this game, but none more important than being able to answer the question of why the dinosaurs went extinct with 'because of me'.
1791	0	a	game is very laggy and graffics are bad, if you are looking for an fps that will make you poop your pants this is it though. the game has such lag that the dinos come out of no where and kill you.
4126	1	a	Dragons and cool â¥â¥â¥â¥. Never played tho
1265	1	a	11/10 would buy for 21 cents again
1989	1	a	Good game Though i did buy it of Dino horde that was like 15 Bucks?
2489	1	a	This game is sooo awesome! and cheap... It's sooo worth to buy it! its fun to play and it is really enjoyable! Buy it and play it with your friends!
4732	1	a	from what little i played of this it was fun but i didnt get much time into it 
1815	1	a	a bit hard to get in the swing of thing but when you do it is very fun game. lots of achivments and ZI like to try and get them all I like Conquest the best then the slopes I dont care for the free fo all or one v one better to kill if you get the right team on conquest it will keep you going for an hour or so .try and stay alive is the point of the game .MOOSE
2553	1	a	This game has come a long ways. It doesn't feel like the same game and that why you should give props to developers who stuck with it and made it bettter.
772	1	a	I really love this game.First hours in and I am in love with the game.The graphics are just okay-ish. The campaign has a decent story, overall this game is almost worth your money.
6484	1	a	This game is definately ALOT of fun, Played it during the F2P weekend and now I own it. If you like the thought of teaming with your friends and fighting for you lives against hordes of Dinosaurs this game is for you. There are vehicles (ground and air *INCLUDING a Tank and Mech*), Augments (character improvments), many weapons, and even deployable turrets!   The game is being updated and improved, Check out the kickstarter and see what they have planned! 
4845	0	a	the joke sale of the day -10% on 89 cents of total 'value' they say once they did a CONSTANT 90% off on the game.. in hopes it will get people to actually play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1528	1	a	Have this weird need to drive all of my friends into things and get blown up. Drove a vehicle full of my buddies into a triceratops. Blew up. Killed all my friends. Got an achievement: Teammate From Hell. Pleased. 10/10 Would drive buddies to their deaths again.
3720	1	a	Jetpacks, tanks, dinosaurs that the game calls 'dinos,' this game has it all. Jurassic Park meets Deus Ex meets your birthday; 2/5 for some decent co-op, dino destruction. Recommended if a dino fan and on sale
6348	1	a	This is one of few games I really enjoy playing both single player, and co-op. I have not tried the PVP as I am more into team play then PVP. If you like shoot em up games, this one is well worth the buy &amp; you can not beat the $0.99 price here for this game. Yeah I know, you see a low price &amp; automatically you assume the game must suck, but it doesn't! Its well worth a 99 cent, and honestly I would have paid as much as $19.99 for it, because I think its worth it.  Getting the game &amp; want someone to co-op with? Feel free to send me a friends request, and I will be happy to play it with you.  Get it! Its worth it!
5804	1	a	I Love This Game It Contains Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch And The Favorite Defender.
6480	1	a	suhold free the game 
4143	1	a	So, I beat suvival mode by myself with out the useless bots with the starting pistol... this game is broken but worth the 99 cents because it is hours of laughter. GLITCHY DINO MURDER FEST!
4486	1	a	I cried, I laughed, I shot a dinosaur in the bum. 11/10 best accounting software Ive ever used! Makes my taxes fun to do every year! Rawr!
4399	1	a	Blows up car with grenade Car doesnt blow up Car bounces straight up I lose it out of my sight I miss my car.  10/10 would miss again.  Edit: After 40 years i still could not find car. I am thinking of starting a campaign to find my car again, please help me on this quest. Possibly in orion prelude 2.
3486	0	a	Traditional score - 4/10 Recommendation - Avoid. There are much better alternatives.  I found this to be intensely generic.   The gun physics are a joke, the weapons themselves are entirely too expensive for how much use they are, the enemies have intensely stupid AI, and the player skills are almost entirely useless.  The graphics are pretty, but the sounds and music are utterly forgettable, the level design is generic and repetitive, and the waypoints the game sets for you are way too far away. Especially given how the game allows you 60 seconds between waves (even if pterodactyls attack you continuously).  It quite possibly may get much better later, but you know so does Killing Floor, and it's fun from the get-go.  But hey, give it a try, you might love it. I have 2 free passes if this review didn't scare you off.
3049	1	a	I just realised that when you are in a server, and if you click'invite friends' the game will crash for some reason
4843	0	a	I bought this game when it used to be called Orion Dino Beat Down, it is hands down the worst purchase I've made on steam. If only steam had their new refund policy back when I bought this game I wouldn't have this horrible piece of trash sitting in my library today =(
4029	1	a	You can pistol-whip a Stegosaurus, would recommend.
5537	1	a	This game is just really fun. I love the concept of it and I love how you can upgrade to different weapons! It's a great game for such a price, a steal really. I recommend this game. It might get boring at times so I will give it a 8/10.
3700	0	a	This game sucks and doesnt run correctly yolo swig. 
992	1	a	lemme just say...I hate Origin...the game was fun though :)
307	0	a	Mouse inputs didn't work. Kind of hard to like a game I can't play.
6085	0	a	this game is lagging alot
1757	1	a	The Metacritic score of 36 / 100 is way off base...I'm thinking that the game was released a little early with too many bugs, but the Developers have fixed that and added a ton of content. This game is a lot of fun. There are many different weapons, dinos, vehicles to drive, game modes, upgrades, etc.
4068	1	a	Looking Forward to more Improvments. Cool Game. Good cheap fun, best with friends.
4980	1	a	For 99 cents, this game does everything you want it to do. It is fun and you can get a lot of gameplay out of it.
3299	1	a	my friend got eaten alive bij a T-rex. :D 10/10
495	1	a	Pros: - Great freedom like in GTA or Carmageddon. - You can go or fly wherever you want.  Cons: - Boring storyline. - After 3 or 4 hours repetitive gameplay.  If you want to fly above the city and have absolute power, this game will give you that. I encourage you to buy this only on 75% discount.  PS: I finished the game in 6.2 hours.
5916	1	a	yeah, preety decent game Best thing! It is playeble!
2952	0	a	This game rips off so many other games, and it does it poorly, the animations are horrible and the overall quality is bad. It tries very hard to mimic games like Halo, and it even has an in-game cash shop. It's not even F2P! This is one of the worst games I have ever played, there is so little content and there is almost no depth. I recommend this game if you are mentally unstable.
5296	1	a	This might be the weirdest game I've ever played. Well... maybe not the weirdest, but certainly odd. You can play some sort of marines, or dinosaurs... and fight. It's simple. I mean... that much info about the game made me buy it, so maybe that's enough. Great game.
2024	1	a	Orion Prelude is a good cheap game to have fun with friends and if you like achievements then don't worry. You will get an achievement for everything , even for just pausing the game.
3823	1	a	Jetpacks and dinosaurs. What more do you want in a game?
5912	1	a	I killed a triceratops with a lightsaber off of the hood of a jeep.
4231	1	a	Ignore the not recommended stuff, although the game is slightly, ONLY SLIGHTLY buggy its still the best game ive ever played, I mean someone who did not buy the game when they saw 'dinosaurs and Jetpacks' the games itself is exiting with huge boss fights with t-racks and other HUGE dinosaurs, lots of weapons easy controls oh and TANKS AND MECHS because we thought it couldn't get better, with all that said I definitely recommend this MORE than the beautiful game
4017	1	a	It is the coolest games. It is like a advanced version of Primal Carnage although I still like Primal Carnage
5738	1	a	Quite a nice game, still some bugs, but all in all a good start for a dine FPS shooter :D
2309	1	a	Orion Prelude is Fun to play, I like running around and killing Dino's. It has Good Graghics, Sound and Music. I'm just not a first person shooter kind of guy but I do recommend this game and you can get it like for a Buck. Now down to business I would give it a 7 out of 10
41	1	a	I'm not normally one to post reviews, but the Space Quest Collection is something different and worth sharing.  First things first, this is actually a collection of games, all of which were published around 1987-1995, way before I was even born. How I got into these games is that one day my dad was talking about some of the games he played way back when: DOOM, Duke Nukem, Leisure Suit Larry, and Space Quest, among others. Now, this last game was his favourite and seemed the most interesting to me, so I did some searching around and found this collection. So, following its purchase, my dad and I would play an hour or so of one of these games each night. I may have 20 hours played on record, but that's just online. At least double that number and you'll get how many wonderful hours I spent with my dad.  GAMEPLAY They are all text-based/point-and-click adventure games. I don't want to give away too much about these games, but you walk around, solve puzzles, complete segments, earn points, and die in horrible ways. It can be amazingly trolly, but rarely in a rage-inducing way. For the age of the games, they can be amazingly detailed in their settings and animations.  PROS +For my dad, this was one great big nostalgia explosion, and for me, it was amazingly fun in its simplicity compared to modern games. +Genuinely hard puzzles that have you scratching your head for ages. +Subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) humour and references abound in these games. Example: There's a town called Ulence Flats. Also, in one of the later games, you have the option to uninstall Leisure Suit Larry from an in-game computer and you get points for it.  CONS -The very first, original Space Quest game is not included; however, the 1991 remake of it is included in its place. Personally, I prefer the remake, but some people would like the original. -This is my biggest gripe: Not all the games are playable as-is. As an example, I had huge issues with colours being weird and games not saving. If you do a bit of digging in the Steam forums or online, you'll find the solutions, just like I did. -Even though I absolutely loved the first five games included, when I got to number six, I just couldn't play it. Not because it was broken; it worked fine. But because it was plain awful to play. The interface was garbage, the action was unexciting, and it was just plain meh. At least the other five made up for this one bomb. -There is no replayability. Once you solve the puzzles, the game is over. The only real option is if you keep replaying the games to find all the secrets and get the highest possible score.  TIPS ~Make sure you look at the virtual manual upon launch! There are 'firewalls' in some of the games to combat those who got the game illegally back in the day; if you didn't buy the game legitimately, you wouldn't have the manual, so you wouldn't be able to play the game because you wouldn't know, for example, an encrypted in-game destination included in the manual. ~Open up each of the games in turn to see how well they function. Do they look fine? Do they save? If not, do some searching on forums and you'll find a solution which can be implemented in ~5-10 minutes. ~DO NOT LOOK UP PUZZLE SOLUTIONS! You lose the joy and sense of accomplishment of actually discovering where you went wrong. That being said, there is a point when you should look at a solution to save your sanity, and there are solutions available online.  TL;DR 1) Did you play any of these games when they came out? 2) Do you like vintage games or have a thing for pixel art? 3) Do you like trolly text-based adventures? 4) Do you like pounding your head against the wall for hours trying to figure out a puzzle? If you answered 'Yes' to one or more of these questions, get the game, especially if it's on sale.  Solid 8/10.
3265	1	a	This is a extremly fun game that has an amazing replay value, SO much fun.
1425	1	a	The game is just a little something to do when your other games don't appeal to you at the moment. Its a nice little game, nice graphics, a cool little ship you can fly around and smash into asteroids and space rocks. The dark areas add a whole new aspect to it as well.
1456	1	a	It's like a downloadable flash game you have to pay for. Still, really good.
5707	1	a	You know, I never played it when it was supposedly trash. But now that it's been updated, and the free week has been a thing, I gave it a shot.  Well, that shot became a good 81 cents Canadian spent.  It's not fantastic, but it's definitely not bad. It has a store, but it's cosmetic items. Armor color, hats, capes, that kind of stuff. And... It's $1. There's no reason NOT to get this.

3689	0	a	Really wanted to like this one. Got a copy for my son and myself to play together, but I just can't recommend it. We simply did not have fun with it and only played for a little while before we moved on to other games.
2159	1	a	Very Nice Game :D
1888	0	a	I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10
1019	1	a	if you are going to buy, GET A CONTROLLER ON YOUR COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY!!
2312	1	a	i honestly didnt know what to expect when i got this because it was lik 1.00$ but when i played it... sure the graphics arent all good, but they arent terrible either the real reason i like this is there is litteraly SO MUCH CARNAGE my pc can't handel it and if you want to customize you charecter well... you gotta pay IRL but you dont see your person at all so there really isn't a point. With amazing vehicles that may be slightly OP the dino carnage is at its max! most carnage i ever whitnessed... ever pretty much
2479	1	a	Dinosaurs? Check. Jetpacks? Check. More firepower than a National Guard battalion? CHECK. Grab your buddies and go harvest T-Rex Steaks.
1177	1	a	Not as easy as it seems...
4044	0	a	its sad that ppl are acutally create this games  bad Graphics No alot of guns  I aucttaly think that its no worth 1 $ its should be Free to play dont waste 1 $ for it i no like it!
5114	1	a	You can kill thousands of dinosaurs with a bow and a grenade launcher
3850	0	a	No thanks.
5774	1	a	Like a cocoon it emerges majestically.
795	1	a	Great 2D beat-em-up  PROS +Big Arsenal +Great Battle System +Nice artstyle +Big amount of skins +Nice storyline +Survival Mode with coop  CONS -NO coop for campaign -A bit short  Nice and enjoyable beat-em-up=)
2954	1	a	seriously one of the most fun games ive played in a long time!!!!!!!!!
2297	1	a	T-REX did a backflip 10/10
2303	1	a	yes its pretty and fun 
5871	0	a	Tried out one server, then hated it. Hard to get momentum in this game. Slow. Sloppy. -infinity/10
5986	1	a	cool some weird glitches not enough people on
1696	1	a	Great fun. I love skyping with friends and playing a few hours of this game. But, to us? It will always be Dino-Horde! 
709	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
3938	1	a	This game is Gr8, buy 4 pack for a m8 and use him for b8 this game is under8ed m8... BUY IT
2204	1	a	Man, this game is pure fun, plain and simple.
3643	0	a	This game is not ready to be released to the public.
1397	1	a	This game is 15p! BEEP!
2769	0	a	This game sucks, I paid $0.99 for this game on sale and I don't even think I got my moneys worth. My total play time isnt even a whole hour and half of that was firguring out how to play with friends. There is no strategy in the combat because all the dinoaurs out run you. Never buy this...
4571	1	a	I bought this game and now it's free? Why? And do i get some bonus game items or what? Pls tell me I want to know.
5749	1	a	Come on Its only    $0.74
4833	0	a	I think this is one of the worst piece of sh*t games i have ever payed for i want my .79 cents back. The graphics are horrible, the game is a laggy piece of trash. 0/10 War Z is better-IGN
812	1	a	Is realy good game but,is hard,VERY HARD
2056	1	a	FUN!! EXCITING! I can play a dino or have a good choice of weapons and vehicles to hunt and kill them :) Oh and the best part is I can play with a jet pack!!! :D Wooo Hooo!!
2363	1	a	I really love this game, The graphics are awesome. 1000000 dinosaurs, Aircrafts, Vehicles, And awesome weapons and upgrades! Don't believe the metascore, The game has been updated so much and got so great. The only downside seems to be a bit low on game servers. However achievements are fun too! (I did notice a ingame-store that was a bit of a turnoff, But doesn't seem to make it pay-to-win)
4919	0	a	LOL so bad, avoid like the plague. I managed about 5mins in a game before I got so bored with not knowing what to do. Also the dino's don't even look good.
4330	1	a	so game, very cheap,     such dino, many hours    wow
6157	1	a	Why don't you own this?
94	1	a	The missions are super repetitive, but the progression/combat/eating people is fun. Buy on sale but don't feel pressured to beat the story, because the story is yawnworthy and the real fun is in running around, hijacking helicopters, and throwing cars at pedestrians.   6/10
4510	0	a	Not even worth $0.99. Horrible.
3838	0	a	very ugly, very boring game...looks like it is from 2009 so ugly. The gameplay is very boring too. Looks like Dinosaur meets killing floor.
552	1	a	Interesting for the first 2-3hrs, but starts to lose captivity as the story progresses. If you buy it, don't toodly around. Play the story before you get bored.
2031	1	a	This game is quite the bomb digity and I enjoy playing it all dayyyyy
2602	1	a	It has dinosaurs and its .99 why not buy it?
4413	1	a	This game is OK, but its not someting you HAVE to have. It has a lot of bugs, but it is playable. Though, IF you consider getting this game, do not pay more then $2-$3 for it. I played it during the FREE week when it was $3, but it did nothing for me. A week is more then enough of that game to get bored of it. The META score is a bit harsh, but it justified.
6408	1	a	Could be a nice game, unfortunately reactivating/protecting the generator is not fun. Would have been much better if it was just about surviving the dinosaurs or having a compound to protect. Also the 'Fight to survive' mechanic is absolutely annoying, i'd rather die instantly on the spot. Who thought it'd be a good idea? You fall on the ground, limping to your death, all the dinosaurs runs away from you and your goal is to kill one of them before they escape so you can magically be revived (Must be some form of blood magic)  But I still have to recommend it, the sheer terror when the ground starts shaking and a T-Rex appears, screeching, is absolutely fantastic. Those annoying raptors and tiny little green â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs represents exactly what they are. The guns and the leveling up mechanics are great. It'd be great if there was a better; more detailed interface to tell you exactly the bonuses you have on what you're about to use/buy.  This game needs either an invasive expansion or a sequel, that would shape the game differently.
2338	1	a	Great fun especially in a group with friends. Excellent game for the price well worth it!
2424	1	a	Glorious game, nothing more needs to be said.
3706	0	a	sucks shÃ­t
1016	0	a	This game is bad. The AI is bad. The level design is bad. The gameplay is bad. The story is nonexistant. Another poorly developed EA title.
3574	0	a	This game is reeeeally boring. I regret buying it. I regret a lot of things. But most of all I regret dating Jenny for five miserable years.
2689	1	a	ORION: Dino Horde is an awesome game for gamers all alike. It has all of my favourite in-game things: dinosaurs, guns, death, blood and dinosaurs. Now who doesn't (except for girls) like killing huge prehistoric beasts with futuristic weapons or being the beasts and eating people? WHO FRIGGING DOESN'T LIKE THAT?! Oh and the gameplay is great, although a little laggy and buggy in places, but still great! I give it a 9/10.
6425	0	a	Wow, where do you start. I thought this was a re-release or a new Beta or what have you. Turns out, this game has always been buggy and well, kind of bad. And it still is. Where do I start?!  The sound, well, it is just, bad? The voice acting, the quality of the voice recording, the sound levels, the guns, the dino's, the music that cuts in and out. All pretty bad. Not horrible, but it is kind of like they just dumped a bunch of stuff in there, DONE!  The Animations are just plain weird and buggy. Your main starting gun, when you draw it, is drawn before your hands are in position. What?! The scope zooming is done like this is a game from 2007. The Dino's jumping animation is bad, the bites are wayyy off, flying dino's make insane 180's midair, the T Rex takes weird bites from the ground and proceeds to trow these 'boulders' at you... They spin and are only half animated, one side is just flat. Did they ever take a look at this game? Did they even test it and play it themselves?  Physics, well, ehh. Yes, Shoot a 10 ton Stegosaurus with a bow and arrow for 20 times and it dies, but the last arrow sends it flying like crazy. But a tank shell on a minature critter has no impact. Oh and did you know, dino's can pound the ground and send you flying off into the air, but their own kind is just glued to the floor.  And then the actual gameplay. Did they ever test it? What where they thinking? You are teleported out of fortified buildings when the enemies come in. Never heard of using bunkers I guess. You NEED the jetpack, if you don't have it you are just picked up and dropped to death. And fightning from a rock is way to go. So why are there 3 classes? It won't help if they don't get something like the Jetpack. So you defend this generator, that has no healthbar and needs to be recharged. You get random vehicles for liberating outposts but it all has very arbitrary time constraints. These game modes just make NO SENSE AT ALL.  3/10, would not play if F2P. It is now, but even at â¬1 it is asking too much. This game is bad. Cool concept, nice scenery, but the gameplay and pretty much all else is bad.
3770	1	a	Great game, bit glitchy but for those money, must have
5159	1	a	
2949	1	a	Holy crap! So much fun for such a low cost!   Pros:
6515	0	a	Game is impossible to play by yourself, there is no scaling for single player when you have a weak pistol. Trying to get into a lobby so I didnt have to play alone tried for ten minutes with no success. Glad I got it on a sale price of almost 95% off.
6258	1	a	Definitely recommended, I shot at dinosaurs for nearly 70 hours and I still come back to it from time to time to have some fun.
5439	1	a	This game is fun... I was a bit skeptical at first due to the bad rating.. but some of the reviews convinced me to try it.. i have to say its enjoyable... fun for some killing sprees on dinosuars ... its a bit on the basic side, but the devlopers keep polishing it... its well worth its price... i must say i do love jet packing over a T-Rex's head then putting some slugs into it with my dubble pistoles as im dodging flying terrodactos,
1971	1	a	Make sure your FOV doesn't get set to something less than 90 as mine did, and the game feels great. For some reason it defaulted to a low FOV on my widescreen monitor and looked like crap until I changed it to 100.   Other than the FOV setting being off, this game is tons of fun for a price that is unbelievable.
2595	1	a	Absolutely rediculous, however, that is what makes it really fun. Drive a tank, man a mech, fly a hover ship thingie! It's definitely worth checking out on the free weekend or picking up for a dollar for some good laughs to perk yourself up! xD 8/10 This rating is so high because it wouldn't be as great without its many flaws. XD   www.twitch.tv/crescenda 
2639	1	a	I played this quite a while ago. It's definitely not worth $15, but the gameplay was kinda fun. However, considering it's now only one dollar? Buy it, because you could get a dollar for literally ten minutes of work if you felt like it
4520	0	a	When you paid $0.99 And Now It's free...
2512	1	a	Shooting dinosaurs AND getting high tech weapons? This game is awesome!
4735	1	a	This game is to C.O.D. what Adult Swim is to The Simpsons.  If this makes sense to you then you DESERVE to own this game.  It's a Buck. What else are you gonna buy for a buck? A Candy bar? You'll get FAT. A Soda pop? You'll get FAT. A Cheeseburger? You'll get FAT. Don't get FAT, get this instead.
6272	1	a	Only $1...what more to say? Super fun and super buggy and super stupid concept. Can make it either really easy or really hard. AI are so dumb its funny. Lots of guns (kinda) and fun with a friend.   5/10
1937	0	a	I cant believe people paid money for this
2964	1	a	This is an amazing game, i use an Intel core i7 laptop with 8GB RAM and this game plays beautifully :) i reccommend it to anyone who likes dinosaurs and guns.
5905	1	a	This game is fantastic. Bought it for $1, made 5 cents on the steam cards system.
4377	1	a	Not as bad a game as everyone says, buy it with some friends and enjoy shooting dinossaurs, its fun and with the new updates its playable and enjoyable.
1108	1	a	I got it on sale for $.20, and it was worth it. It's a fun platformer you can play when you're bored, but sometimes it can get too repetitive. It's a short game, so don't spend too much money on it because it doesn't last too long. With some more development, this will be a really good game.
4149	1	a	SO glad I bought the 4 pack... It is simple, which is all the better for just getting some battle in. However, it is tons of unpretentious fun, none of the blah, blah bits that I usually just want to click through as fast as possible to PLAY (could use some tutorial snippets, though, still haven't figured out what the hack/decker looking thing is about). It's all about the action.   I didn't get into the Halo types of games much, could play for a bit, but, don't need or even really want the big drama story, and it is pretty much the same thing over and over - we're getting attacked, kill the funk out of all attackers, and try not to die too much in the process. This one, we played for 7 hours straight right after buying, and will do again with more friends. The achievements are amusing also, although I am apprehensive about actually acquiring all... it certainly feels like an accomplishment when you kill a T-Rex without assist.   I do wish that the 360 style controller had the mic button (maybe if it was among the programmable options?), that's what I use because I'm used to it, and taking a hand off to press left ALT is not really feasible... But, as the only real complaint in a $1 game, that's pretty impressive.
3581	1	a	The game has seen radical changes since it's original release and has finally become a rather solid and enjoyable game. There is still room for improvement (some people complain about the Bots). Personally I enjoy it. I like the leveling system, buying perks ingame, buying weapons in game to suit your playstyle and the pure JOY of running down dinosaurs with a jeep.  Upsides: Fast paced action, lots of maps, lots of weapons, lots of perks, easy to get started, epic Tyranosaur fights. Downsides: the Bots in single player are...dull, could benefit from more 'visceral' dinosaur related fatalities.  Overall an excellent value for less than the cost of a chocolate bar.
4135	1	a	This game is stupid fun, lots of maps, gamemodes, etc. Driving in a buggy running from a T-Rex while your buddy shoots at it with a turret? Nuff said Definitely worth the asking price of $14.99
4765	1	a	:)
2889	1	a	This is game is really good and fun. There is not much to say I guess, just that it's pretty fun and LOTS OF DINOSAURS. GO GET IT NOW!
318	1	a	in a part of the game it crachd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plaz fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
506	1	a	Hey, very good game for this price (5 â¬) ! The first hours of discover are so pleasurable. It's a little bit repetitive once you understand the mechanics, yet graphics/sounds/musics are very good and the scenario is exciting. You have full liberty in the way you advance in the story. There's a lot of side missions available beside main ones. The whole city of New-York is modeled and you can find missions everywhere in there. You can spend a lot of time before getting bored, but ... some could get bored before finishing the main scenario. A little bit repetitive I told you ;)  Whatever, for the actual price, it's a must have. I may not have been recommanding this at 60â¬/$80, but at 5 â¬, there's absolutely no reason not to jump on it very fast.
1405	1	a	Wow this game is so good. Platformers have been under represented, this is not like that though!
1776	1	a	10/10 The most graceful thing I have ever experienced.
856	1	a	This game is extremely fun but the survival mode is damn near impossible alone.
1665	1	a	First game, survived a few rounds, bought the 'worse' guns and got eaten by a T-Rex. 10/10
3865	1	a	dino horde is a great game filled with futuristic weapons but i often get big lag spikes that last for about 2 min. but exept for that its great
5705	1	a	i shot down a T-rex with a rocket launcher while jetpacking 8/8 would m8
741	1	a	ANTI-RECOMMEND Sweet Jesus this hurt. I will drink heavily, replay it and tell you how I REALLY FEEL. Posting this now so you won't commit the same irreversible mistake I made and shell out money for this game.  
197	1	a	insanely fun urban horror/sci-fi. you get to climb walls at breakneck speed, jump 20 feet in the air and elbow drop some zombified New Yorkers, and glide over rooftops like a majestic, horribly mutated eagle. combat is button-mashing glee; Alex's powers are hilariously over the top; both the main missions and the side objectives are pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fun. like... you can go on joyrides in armored tanks &amp; helicopters firing heat-seeking missiles at pedestrians, or decimate as many zombies in 60 seconds as you possibly can.  on the flip side, Alex is a Typical Brooding Protagonist in a disjointed plot. the boss battles are pretty gosh darn repetitive. the parkour also suffers from the same 'stickiness' as Assassin's Creed (oh, you meant to sprint along the sidwalk and dropkick that monster? well, that's too bad, because now you're running straight up the front of this building instead). there are a lot (really, a lot) of powers, and many of them are redundant or only useful like once or twice in the entire game. also, the controls on PC are garbage so use a controller.  overall, an incredibly enjoyable game with some minor flaws.
3815	0	a	They make jokes that in 2012, they made the worst game ever, but now theyve turned it around.... NO.. The gaame is still pretty bland. i may have found this game interesting back in 2005, but here we are 10 years later and their gfx still look 10+ years old. the community seems pretty dead... there is barely a choice of server/game mode to choose from, i still cant get past the fact that this game looks like it would be ok back in 2000-2005. I wouldnt recommend playing this game unless its the very first game you play in history, that way you cant compare it to anything else.
3944	1	a	This game......THIS GAME doesnt need a frickin review. its got thousands of those. THIS GAME doesnt need fixing, or a story, or just about dang anything. THIS GAME IS BADASS. you will play it. you will play it some more. you play it for 9 hours in a single sitting. but most of all...you will play it, and YOU. WILL. LOVE. IT.
4756	1	a	Theres no faking,I love this game its one of my favorite indies on steam!
2408	0	a	This game is weird, the camera is odd, the controls are bad
2614	1	a	Orion Prelude is the ridiculousness of awesome that I didn't know I needed.
2405	1	a	Addicting and fun! Exciting and always an adventure with friends! Blasting dinos or competing in Gun Game, this game has it all and is simple enough that it is relaxing and enjoyable!
5535	1	a	For the money the game is well worth it. Its fun to play with Friends and make new friends 8/10
4460	1	a	Good gameplay. Wish graphics looked a bit more realistic. 7/10
6330	0	a	Bad graphics, and boring gameplay. Not my type of game.
4387	1	a	FANTASTIC GAME!. 100% worth the 1$ cost!
1745	1	a	10/10! Have played with my mates (bought the 4 pack)! Super fun MetaCritic deff. goofed up? I wonder how much the big companies have to pay to get 97's (looking at you Valve). -Note I did not help develope the game!
508	1	a	love this game
2028	1	a	This game is really good for .99 cents.
6563	0	a	Average not my type of game but .... Average
333	1	a	Incredible game. You should pay up to $100 for this game.
1697	1	a	i love this game :D
3752	0	a	This game kinda sucks. idk how else to put it. Very weak overall.   Repetitive and boring. With very low production value. honestly way better Horde mode co-op games to be played than this one.  Would not recommend
759	0	a	Good Premise, mediocre execution. Having not played a point-and-click since Titanic, over 14 years ago, I thought I'd try this as the WW2 spy theme seemed interesting. Sadly, it proved nearly unplayable. Someone experienced with this sort of game may do fine, but I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and eventually gave up. You have to do so many boring tasks to get something simple done, as if they tried to prevent the game from being to short, instead of making a better longer game. Example (MINOR SPOILERS): struggle to set up spy camera with correct lens (no instructions given), tripod too low for view out of window (seriously?), go back to office and search for taller tripod, try camera again only to find steam from leaky pipe in nearby building blocking view, find someone to fix pipe...take photo...develop photo (no instructions given), give photos to your boss who does not accept them because you apparently had to take more photos (this was never made clear). The game is full of this, tedious and not enough guidance or help. The voice acting is very mediocre (why get sleepy americans to do german voices?). There were also some problems with screen resolution and loading crashes. All in all a pity, as this game clearly had some potential, with great and historically authentic looking visuals. If you like the subject material and have a lot of experience with these sorts of games, you may like it, otherwise, give this a miss as there are probably much better point-and-click games out there.
5057	1	a	Dinosaur's+FPS+Horde mode+upgrades+vehicles+5-player coop + 0.99$ = why haven't you bought this yet?
4945	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS.  Or play the free week.  Then you'll know not to play it.
2273	1	a	I think that how the 'remade' the game in a way that it deserves a new rating for its metascore. This game is seriously improved.
448	1	a	Who doesn't want to be a one-man army of mass destruction completely capable of spreading across the city like some kind of plague or disease?
1319	0	a	I have owned this on steam for several years now before early access was even a thing, I'm confused how something I bought in 2012 is now a new release.
673	1	a	recommending this random game from my games library. if you dont like it, dont blame me: I havent played it, dont even know what's it about. To be more frank with you guys, I even think this game sucks. Happy playing.
4809	0	a	Unlike the trailer said, the steam reviews are right. The only thing nice in this game are the art assets, pretty much everything else is garbage. You truly get the quality you're paying for.
4628	0	a	birth controll should have been considered
5127	1	a	Sold!  For a buck.
559	1	a	Got juggled by rockets. Violated soldiers with tentacles. Ate an old lady. Body-surfed a zombie as an old lady. Violated soldiers with spikes. Ate a Mexican. Became  Mega-Mexican . Caused zombie 9/11. Became a killer. Became a monster. Became a terrorist. 10/10; was all of these things.
4801	0	a	'Can't Run On A Potato' -D00M   I guess it can run on Potatoes, game got stuck when I joined the server and the camera was just stuck on 1 view and I couldn't move.   =========Rip=========  ---60 Cents---   *You'll Be Remembered.*
4886	0	a	tHIS GAME ISNT EVEN WORTH 1 DOLLAR!
2362	1	a	It's stupid, all the assets look and feel like they were ripped straight from planetside 2, and playing alone is boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ after a few minutes.  But I will be damned if this game isn't a party with friends. When it's on sale for $.50 you can round up a group of bored people and have a great night. This game isn't something you play to be good and competitive or to challenge yourself, you play this to have a stupid, wonderful time with other people, and it excels at being just that.
6234	1	a	5 player co-op online, massive weapons, dinosaurs, drive-able vehicles, tanks etc. 9/11 1.2 hours played so far and I really enjoy it.  Oh.. And also, it only costs 0,99â¬. That's amazing. The 4-Pack is pay for 3, get 4. And also, devs doesn't bash their community. And now there's a sequel. Going for that soon.
4860	0	a	I thought this game was going to be good because who doesnt want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up â¥â¥â¥â¥??? Well no not at all this game is really boring and I wouldnt waste another second on it. This review is trash but I don't feel like listing everything wrong with this game because it would take me an hour
4359	1	a	These next gen graphics are really something :D highly recommended but we need more dinos!
6070	1	a	For how cheap the game is it can provide fun with or without friends. Blowing up dinosaurs is probably one of the best things you could want to do with friends online.
1296	0	a	Very simply side scroller. No better than the typical free mobil app.
3431	1	a	ORION: Prelude is a very great game for a very cheap price, simple as that.
5862	1	a	I killed multiple Stegosauruses and Triceratops. I ran over the tail of a T-Rex in a vehicle, then shot it in the face with a friggen bow. All in the span of 20 minutes. 10/10 Most spectacularly horrrible game ever.
1134	1	a	Fun and definitely worth your money, I got the game on sale for 50 cents, but the full $2 seems worth what i have played so far, definitely reccomended  ~Rating~ 8 bacon strips out of 10
2814	1	a	This game is proof that meta scores don't always tell you how good a game really is.   10/10
3461	1	a	I can see my legs 10/10
3874	1	a	this game is really fun i would reccomend it to anyone but there are some good things to it and some bad things to it soo im gonna tell you whats good and whats bad about it.  good things:  it has great graphics  it has alot of servers to play on it has mulitple gamemodes to choose from (my favorites are vital rampage and survial) it has a alot of weapons to choose from. it has a alot of different dinos.  it's only 1$ it has alot of maps to play on.   bad things: there are only 3 classes. you need a good computer or else it will lag insanely (i got rid of the lag by changeing my settings) it takes a long time to download bots are a little dumb. not too many but still has a few bugs.  besides all the bad stuff this game is amazing.
5886	0	a	4/10
267	1	a	A very awesome game to buy. This game lets you do something that every gamer has ever wanted... Free roaming... And it's also a stress reliever.  Seriously though, get this game. When I first heard about this game, I felt like it was just GTA all over again. Well, I was wrong. This game lets you consume anyone at anytime and disguise as them. You also consume whatever is a part of them, like their memories. But this game isn't all about cannibalism, it's about fighting for what you want... To legally eat people and infected monsters...  When the whole military is against you, what are the odds that you'll survive? The truth is... You won't. Not unless you're Alex Mercer, who can shapeshift into various weapons, has super strength and super speed, and parkour on buildings. Practically, he's a walking war machine.   I promise this to anyone that they will enjoy Prototype since the story also helps contribute to the game.
1505	1	a	The ONLY thing that could make this better would be if there were game modes with nazi dinosaurs.
3841	1	a	This game is beyond amazing. This is a cross between Halo and Ark. This game is worth the money also very fun with friends and it wastes sometime are you hands and its just a very good game overall.
6065	1	a	i recomend this game dude lie seriously might have not the best graphics but i recomend u try it
2340	1	a	guys... this is literally the best 99 cents/65 ruble you will ever spend. get it.
793	1	a	Do you wanna gut your way through a variety of foes continuously with your shank until they drop to the floor? Or Would you prefer to juggle them in the air with your machete? No?...Well then how about shredding them to bits with your chainsaw? Still not satisfied? Ok, lets throw a handgun or two into the mix? Nawww...What you really want is a shotgun, right? And maybe a grenade to go with your molotove cocktail? If you still aint smiling at the thought of all this, well, then...you my friend dont know what a REAL game is...  Shank 2 is an awesomely fun, yet challenging game; a veritable mesh of some of the more old-school platforming experiences mixed with the new. And if the campaign aint enough for you, and you have a friend that has some free time, then crank up the Survival mode and try and protect yo stash together against countless waves of enemies...and uh...zombies from time to time. Watch as you quickly lose track of time being sucked in by the thrill and enjoyment :D  Oh...and I forgot to mention that there is also a female character, complete with her own set of weapons and arsenal too? Yeah, thats right, and she's hawt...so go and spend that $9.99 you cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Cause there aint many games out there that deliver the same punch as this one for such a low price. Peace :D  
713	1	a	If you like poker and you like CCG's, do yourself a favor and get this game. Quick battles, just enough strategy to keep from getting boring and an interesting enough storyline to keep you wanting to progress and see what happens next.
6302	1	a	Awesome game , gameplay is nice i wont complain but the graphics are so-so . What else do you expect from such an affordable game? its a nice game to play with friends and have fun killing dinos . (y) truly reccomended for people who can`t afford other expensive games :)
1081	1	a	Robot has gravity gun 11/10 Half-Life 3 confirmed
3465	0	a	What can I say? This is it. This is the game we have been wating for. This game accomplishes so much and gives us gamers a truly next-gen experience. With all the content bundled in this game, for just a dollar you would be crazy to miss out on such a wonderful deal. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing.
986	1	a	I have played this for many hours on pc (without steam). I love the cute main carachter, and all of his cool powers. I would recommend this addictively great puzzle game to everyone!
5472	1	a	This game is $0.99 and amazing, if you don't buy it you're actually â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.  Seriously...  Buy it you â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4032	1	a	its fun but it keep's crashing when i try to get on a sever but i love this game reyminds me of a game i played whith my dad a long time ago  
1014	1	a	WARP is a stealth-action puzzler where players take control of little alien who is abducted by humans and must find his way out from research facility. He must use powers of other aliens to accomplish this task while completing different puzzles and defeating his enemies. While game may last only 3-4hours itâs actually great and enjoyable. There are 3 different powers to wield and amazing locations. Also to note you can collect grubs that can help you upgrade your powers like walking more silent or just make better use of your abilities. Finally after completing story you can try out challenge room to test your skills and manage to kill enemies as quick as possible. While it may be a poor port from console it still manages to hold on high spot as good indie game. The only flaw may occur is that you are required to have Origin account, and maybe for better gameplay use controller. Otherwise great game to enjoy and relax. 8/10-Overall. 7/10-PC version. 
780	1	a	Very nice co-op. Was a bit shame that it was only for 2-players but still... funny game. Maybe wouldn''t play singe player though.
5100	1	a	This is less than a big mac, and it last longer. Buy it
906	1	a	The gameplay is very good :D
6165	1	a	While killing dinosaurs i saw a T-Rex Tea Baging a dead teammate started laughing the T-Rex saw me and killed me with a rock.  11/10 would laugh again
1724	1	a	So i got ORION: Dino Horde for 1$ when it was on sale, and im so happy i did that !! this game is a great combination of borderlands and left 4 dead, when me and my friends played it we had so much fun !! ill try get my girlfriend to play it with me.  the positives: +big open world +lots of vehicles +diffrent type of enemies +great graphics +good time with your firends  +easy controls  the negetives: -not newbie friendly -some dino's have strange attack animations -usless ironsights  my score: 9\10 sorry for bad english &lt;3
1571	1	a	Fun game to do for a while  Their they come wave after wave. Just try to survive its awesome :D
2867	1	a	Orion: Prelude, more like Orion PreLUBE ME UP AND TOUCH MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS IS GOOD.  Not as catchy but I feel like the 2015 GOTY Edition Should be named that.  My Review- Ever wanted to be sent back in time and forced to shoot pixels at larger pixels making 18bit roars that you pretend you can hear so you dont instult the artistic immersion of this 2017 GOTY Blockbuster. Then this is the game for you. It has been designed with such pazaz that even Micheal Bay would be put to shame.   As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....  Regardless, 10/10 game with and amazing multiplayer, Potato Teir Graphics to make even the IRA proud, and last but not least a small indie team that has true murican beliefs. MURICA

352	0	a	This game sucks.
2201	1	a	A friend of mine said that the rocks in this game didn't actually look that bad.  He was right, they're pretty good.
4692	0	a	If you have an AVERAGE pc DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Very unoptimized to the point where it's not even worth the $1. But I guess if you have a pc that is Above Average, then get this game if you must. But why would you get this game instead of playing WAAY BETTER Free To Play Games?
5120	1	a	Well, it's a dumb game... but it is a ton of fun! What could u like more? I mean, how many FPS out there are $1 where you get to shoot dinosaurs?   It's awesome.
5016	0	a	I Think I Lost For This Game 8$
3954	1	a	This game was totally worth the $0.99 when it was on sale. This game brought in future technology and mixed it in with dinosaurs. Its very cool becuase you get to fly around in a jetpack shooting dinosaurs in the face. I would rate this 7/10.
5582	0	a	I'm glad the 'Quit game' button works.  This game is the most poorly optimised game I have ever launched, you know it's bad when you have to set the graphical settings to minimal with a 4GB graphic card. Please save yourselves by NOT purchasing this. I'm glad my friend bought a pack for us, so I can write a review. Please, do not buy this game. Developers need to optimise this game and fix several bugs to make it worthwhile...
6414	1	a	pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome
6297	0	a	My friends and I were arguing on Steam Voice Chat one day. We were trying to figure out the next multiplayer game we should all invest in. After agonizing deliberation that lasted several days over who was gonna scrounge up the hefty $2.99 sum for the 4-pack, we finally got the game. After all, how could we resist? It had dinosaurs and it was $2.99. How bad could it possibly be?  Prehistorically Bad.
2241	1	a	I highly recommend this game if you're into â¥â¥â¥â¥ eating.
626	1	a	WARNING: THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED This game is pretty cool, it had a noice setting, and tis a great game overall. If you ever wanted to run up walls, fly, or be bulletproof, this game is for you. If you have a crappy pc like mine, then the game will adjust to the best setting automatically, and it can run it well, probably with some lag. Overall, I r8 with no h8 8/8.
3701	0	a	STAY AWAY! Spend your money elsewhere, even if it's just a buck.  Clunky, unresonposive controls. Sluggish movement. Terrible mechanics. A.I. is next to non-existent.  I like to think I have a fairly high tolerance for bugs and and patience when it comes to quirks, especially for indie games. However, not only is this 'game' amateurish, it is outright unplayable.  The only consolation is that I spent a mere $0.99 for it. Then again, in hindsight, if I had put a dollar towards a lottery ticket instead, I probably would have a higher chance of winning a jackpot than buying anything developed by ORION ever again. This is by far the most intolerably unpolished game I have ever had the misfortune of having on my computer.
2884	0	a	Crashes when i change mouse sensitivity or anything else in options. Not buggy anymore my perforated â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4118	1	a	still 10/10 for 50 cents
253	1	a	An ok game, but nothing more.
2330	1	a	Dino !! Dino !! T- Rex RUN !!!!  Tecnologly = Win
2049	1	a	soooo much fun, controller support is great game works for low end pc's. its also only a dollar so i highly recommend
2657	1	a	This game is very much worth a dollar.  It's a competent (mostly), customizable dino-survival FPS with PvP elements tacked on. Granted there's some micro-transactions thrown in, but that's mostly just for cosmetic apperances for your character, dino, and weapons. The game has a tendency to bug out from time to time, but it's nothing really game breaking and at the most will make you laugh rather than get upset. People might be also turned off by the fact that the dinosaurs have a one track mind, meaning they'll attack whoever's the closest or whoever's shooting at them, but what do you expect? They also have a bad habit of puppy guarding the generator when you're trying to fix it.  This is an enjoyable game when you've got a group for it. Randoms are okay, depending on what kind of experience you want.
6341	1	a	Tons of bugs, but i mean, you get to shoot dinosaurs
6458	1	a	It has it all 5/5 dino
6307	1	a	Pretty Good Dino Slaying Sci-Fi Game, Still Has Alot Of Servers Going!
281	1	a	Once you download the wide-screen user-made patch (  http://www.wsgf.org/dr/prototype  ), download this ENB (  http://www.gta4-mods.com/misc/prototype-mixed-enb-f21907  ) and work out any stuttering issues ( remove all HID devices in your control panel before playing - after every reboot ) the gameplay is a blast! It's pure carnage on a whole new misanthropic level.   Having just completed the campaign the whole White People Are Evilâ¢ theme they used kind of pisses me off... So whitey, with the governments approval, tried to make a virus to kill non-whites and this is all their fault? Couldn't the writer come up with something a little less...blatantly racist?
971	1	a	A really good 2-D brawler. The 2-player 'survival mode' keeps me coming back for more.
5769	1	a	This got my â¥â¥â¥â¥ hard in 2.6 seconds
2581	1	a	Didn't give me a headache like other cheap games 10/10
6479	1	a	This is a very under-rated game. Who doesn't love killing dinosaurs and flying around in jet packs? A little glitchy but not bad at all.
5209	0	a	Claims to have full controller support, does NOT SUPPORT XBOX ONE CONTROLLER. This type of game NEEDS controller support. Please remove your head from â¥â¥â¥.    0/10 (unplayable without claimed controller support)
2111	1	a	friend drives into a horde of dinosaurs: - --Double kill ---Triple kill ----Mega kill -----Ultra kill ------Armageddon -------Bring me some pizza
3279	1	a	great game for that price

5050	1	a	BEST TREK GAME EVER 
258	1	a	this game is awesome!
2625	1	a	Yes i recommend this game ALOT you can be dinos!your teamss are dinosaurs or ?dinosaur killers?There GET THE GAME BRUH
3159	1	a	My lunch costed more than this game and yet its a pretty fun game, Especially the co-op
86	1	a	These games are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. How was I supposed to know that I could open a locker at the start of the game, and the content would only be important halfway through?  0/10, â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game
4235	1	a	I dont know why, but it wont let me even update it. It said clear up the hard drive a bit, and i did. That appearantly did not work...... Any help?
5129	0	a	THIS GAME ISNT WORTH THE SECONDS OF YOUR LIFE TO DOWNLOAD IT.
1440	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hhrySCbTdU&amp;feature=youtu.be   BEEP is charming action plaftormer with not-so-complicated puzzels and great physics engine.  The story is almost non-existent. In the distant future, people created BEEP-ships that create BEEP-bots and send them to explore the universe. One of the ship find something and goes to see what it is. That's it.  The game have two problems. First one: lack of any kind of options. The game graphically won't blow your mind, music and sound fx are fine, but still it would be nice to have some options. The second problem: you jump with W. It's just not intuitive at first. But those two problems are not a big deal.  I like art style. It's simple, but so charming, vibrant and colorful, especially the locations you visit. Swamps, volcano, ice and desert places, forests and caves. They are diverse and full of obstacles to shoot and puzzles to tease your brain. There is one strange bug. When you kill a little flying kamikadze robot , a black square appear for a few seconds and then disappear. It's bizzare, but other than that I didn't notice any other bugs.  The main star here is the gameplay. It consist of platforming, puzzle solving and shooting. Even the level selection screen is great. With the mouse you move the rocket and after hitting enough asteroids it's time to deploy the BEEP-bot. The next level unlocks after beating the previous one. The BEEP-bot have three things available for handling the dangers â a single weapon, anti-gravity ray or Anti-Grav and he can float for a breif period of time, that way he can jump larger distances. The first thing I notice is the physics engine. It's great. A lot of thing can be move, stacked and even used as a weapon. Physics are the core of the game and anti-grav will be your best friend. At some places you have to rotate platform to step on it or put few stones on top of each other to reach higher place and so on. For a few levels, you will even get jet pack, which keeps the gameplay fresh.  Through the hole game you will search, if you want, for antimatter and when you find it, most times puzzle awaits you. Some require just to move out something, others test your reflexes and so on. Anti-grav is required for the puzzels. Level after level they get little bit complicated, but not too much. Some of them have to be solved to continue the game, others, like those for the antimater, are not. But if you not look for her, you are missing half the fun here. It's satisfying to solve puzzle, that seems at first glance difficult. They are not too easy or too hard, they are just right, fun and diverse.  For all the things I said about the gameplay, you need perfect controls. They are. When you die, it's entirely the players fault. But like I said in the beginning, W is kind of not intuitive. It took me few level to get use to it. I think Space bar is more appropriate. There is even counter for the deaths.   Enemy design is okay, they won't blow your mind. Several types of robots with various attack and movement patterns. But few enemies require different approach, like one that first you need to remove his helmet-thingy from his head and then shoot. They may look mean, but at the same time they are cute.  Sound design is good. The music is great, not too loud, diffrerent tracks for every world you visit and they fits really well . Few levels don't have music and I wonder if this is deliberate or the game bug out. Sound fx are nice. When you kill enemies they make cute noise and I kinda feel guilty for shooting them.  I was quite surprise by BEEP. I didn't expect to have so much fun. I bought it impulsively on sale. It took me little more than 7 h to beat it and i was never bored. Great and cute world, lengthy, nice mechanics, great soundtrack, but lack any kind of options. The game ended with open door for sequel and I hope some day to see the light of day. I highly recommened it.
2390	1	a	if its less than 5 or 6 dollars than get it. otherwise just get primal carnage if you want to play a better version of this game.
2457	1	a	better than any â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've ever had or ever will have
5719	1	a	Best game ever made for a very cheap price!
4508	1	a	the game crashed... 10/10
4429	0	a	What can I say? I only bought this for my friends and myself as a joke and paid 0,50â¬ when it was on sale.. and that was way too much.   Let's list some 'features': No actual gameplay (except for running and shooting), UI is from the early 2000's and is horrible to use, artstyle (if you can speak of art in the same sentence) is mostly just mimiced from big sci-fi titles, the soundscape is just plain wrong...  Oh, and did I mention that the game is full of bugs? Ah, sorry no, it isn't full of bugs IT IS a fricking bug. The bright side is that the bugs are mostly hilarious (try driving a car head on to a dino).   That doesn't make the game entertaining or anything though. Let's just say it aloud: It's rubbish. And what I've heard, the devs (if you dare call them game developers) have been selling the game under different titles for ages. So basically, they're frauds and should not be allowed to publish anything in the first place.   I hope someone reads this. If I manage to save a single euro, dollar, yen or whatever from being spent on sh*t like this, I can die in peace.
6585	1	a	this game was super fun i recommend multiplayer but i loved being a dinosaur and a dino killer i made lots of freinds and warning tis game is very addictive.
494	1	a	ONE WORD: unbelieveably VIOLENT and FUN....was my favorite game until i discovered elder scrolls V: skyrim....the thing skyrim has over this is more plot and detail and the ability to mod, which i dont think prototype is a good choice for modding anyway, considering how EPICLY OP your character already is :D
743	0	a	First off it should be mentioned that 'Dead moutaineer's hotel' is an old russian movie, which would be fine if the store page would mention it, so you could research the movie at least a bit in advance.  Both Knox and VanDine would turn in their graves when seeing this misleading summary, that actually makes you think this is a fair and square detective mystery, while it actually isn't. And even if you are tolerant enough to call it a detective mystery you will soon find out that it isn't fair at all, since:     The number of clues telling you that everyone here is an alien robot,built to observe humanity is exactly zero.  Rather late in the game you get a clue that aliens might be somehow involved, by finding a strange device which would as well be a very sophisticated bomb.  But no matter how you look at it, its not enough of a hint to make you even remotely aware that EVERYONE (the detective included) is just an alien robot. The only remote clues in that regard you ever get is hearing that one of the cast apparently carried out some superhuman task (Think it was carrying a safe on her shoulders), as well as aforementioned strange device. - Notably very close to the end of the story.  But even if you consider this a detective mystery with sci-fi elements this clue, as well as the device simply come to late for you to be able to make 'xyz and txz are in fact alien robots.   And yet again, even if you would consider this a valid clue, there is no clue at all that you, the detective himself and the entire rest of the cast, is one of these robots too.     As a movie adaption - passable  As the detective story it pretends to be however it fails hard.
3339	1	a	Got 2 achievments and a card while jetpacking into t-rex balls.  11/10 would play again.
3596	1	a	This a fun game, pretty balanced, and the graphics were good. Overall, a very pretty game
9	1	a	Games of my childhood always have a sweet spot with me, and this whole collection has been one of my favorites. My father introduced me to King's Quest when I was young and he bought the first 4. I remember the rather unique official cheat books which required a special marker to make the invisivle ink to appear.  But to talk of this collection, the first four were originally text driven games. meaning that you have to type in commands like 'Look at woman,' or 'rub lamp.' The first three were then later re-worked with updated graphics (but still rather dated compared to today's games). Starting with 5, gameplay shifted a little, instead of being text driven, they became what is now called 'point and click.'  This collection is the story of how King Graham's family came to be, basically a preface to the more recent version that has come out, in whcih Graham recalls the stories of his youth, before he became king of Daventry. The first game in this collection covers the story of how Graham became kind. The second is about Graham finding a wife. The third seems a little odd when started, but it is about the lost children of Graham and their return to Daventry. In the fourth game, Graham, getting old, falls ill and his daughter, Rosella, undertakes a quest to find a way to heal Graham. The fifth game ties back to the third, the son of Graham, Alexander, having escaped the clutched of an evil magician, has brought upon daventry, the wrath of the magicians brother. It it up to Graham to find his now missing castle and family. The sixth installment ties into the fifth. Smitten by the beauty of Cassima, the princess that Graham rescued while restoring his family and kingdom, causes Alexander to search for her. The final game finally touches upon the queen Valance and Rosella, their rocky relationship of overprotective mother and rebellious daughter, and their way back to Daventry after being magicked away from home.  The games seem to work well on my computer, running Windows 10. I do have issue with alt-tabbing out in order to check the manuals for clues as to what to do in a few of the games. Back in the day, Sierra made games that had DRM imbedded in the manuals. What appears to be flavor text is really actually important, least you die is quite awful ways. This is the only difficulty I have with the collection. Alt-tabbing on my machine, causes the program to scrunch over to the left of the screen and in rendered in shades of gray.  There is one game missing in this collection, but it's somewhat of the black-sheep of the franchise, The Mask of Eternity. It was only set in Daventry and was panned as an awful game because of bugs, glitches, and graphic rendering issues. Of the old games, thsi is the one I have yet to play and have a slight curiosity in it. I udnerstand GOG does have it for sale, but it's bundled with the last game.
5232	0	a	DONT BUY THIS DESPERATE PIECE OF CRAP  Notice how no actuall CRITICS leave messages in the trailer, that's because they got random users to say unbelievable crap about this decieving â¥â¥â¥â¥ bucket of a game,  I know it's '99c' It doesnt mean you have to buy this game Just go buy a piece of paper, draw a dinosaur on it and you will have more fun doing so then you would playing this garbage
6087	1	a	played this back when it was 'â¥â¥â¥â¥' i have to say i enjoyed because it was one of those games that are soo bad that they are good, played it with one of my friends, having a good time. i really didnt care about this game back then, i though it was going to stay like that forever, i thought that the devs would just let it die, but turns out these guys are some stuborn mofos and i really think we need more devs like them.  keep up the good work guys this game is worth waay more than 99 cents.
641	1	a	Good: - Core concept - Like puzzle quest, but the gameplay is simple, not overcomplicated (there is no sword and other magic artifacts) - Fun gameplay  Bad: - Not to deep game mechanics - Not to long campaign
3888	1	a	What the?
5795	1	a	So cheap you must grab! And so much play value if you only play one match you have gotten your moneys worth!
5936	1	a	Jurassic park simulator 2015
6576	0	a	Lmao Ill tell you right now the games not even worth $14.99, I was given the game by a friend a while ago when it first came out. After the first like 15 mins I uninstalled because it was garbage. I came back just a little while ago because I seen they changed it since then and what not. No its still garbage. I almost bought it for 2 of my friends for the $ 0.99 however I didnt feel like it would be played much and would be a waste of $2 which i could go and get a soda or something better then this game. It looks amazing looks like it would be a lot of fun and maybe it is? but I just can not stand the graphics, the animations, or the gameplay myself.
3204	1	a	&gt;Be 23 year old gamer &gt;Surfing on lelelelele Steam for good deals and playing some games &gt;Hears a loud thud on the door. &gt;It's the Orion: Dino Horde Devs armed with a machete &gt;'My prices are killers' the devs said &gt;Then they forcefully command me to... &gt;To open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur
1969	1	a	buy it its only $0.99 and insanly fun!
2222	1	a	Fun game to play with friends more than it is to play alone. A little hard to get used to at first but gameplay isn't too bad. Obviously with any game there are downsides, and this has very few. Get it if you like playing online shooters with friends.
4362	1	a	Great game simple in idea but complex in practice. good level of dificulty, you get the feeling that your are getting better as you progress unlocking and uncovering new ways to survive, meet objectives, and eat people
1411	1	a	Pretty awesome so far! One bug i have noticed that is a little annoying, is when youre in windowed mode and not full screen if you click escape to enter the pause menu, the game crashes. Well it does on my laptop anyway- which is not that much of a potato. Lol. But anyway! new game! low cost! I'm sure it'll get fixed and improved. In the mean time, i'm having a lot of fun just playing in full screen, but it is handy to play in windowed mode when multitasking etc. THANKS! :D
4314	1	a	PLEASE READ  -------------- I would reccomend it in the future when I get some better PC. But for now my computer can't handle it and it even skips frames. I love this game truely and got it for a wonderful deal of 99 cents but be warned, your computer may not process this game well. 10/10 It's just my PC that makes the fault.
2799	0	a	This game is crap

899	1	a	this game is boss buy it and feel the power of tequila
1702	1	a	I would strongly recommend this game, it is a mix of Halo and Boderlands. If you like any of those I would spend the 1$ and get the game!
1234	1	a	Very cheap and well worth the 19 cents
5650	1	a	Can't beat the price for a fun play with the dino's!
1009	0	a	I hate when I need to loging to Origin while I'm playing a game I bough in Steam. I did it... Now I think I can go back to play Portal - it is way better!  
2700	1	a	you know what people get on my nerves? the people saying 'the graphics are not good' honestly in the 'rebirth trailer' i call it (commuinty appreciation' i dont think they metiond graphics just the gameplay dont judge the game on how the graphics are base it on the gameplay the mechanics and all the things it offers but if the game itself says good graphic sure hold that to them and other things they promised i see allot of promise verdict is                                                               8.5/10
3489	1	a	Dinosaurs+Weapons+Vehicles+PVP+Much more=Great game :3
2402	1	a	awesome game works well on computers 2010 and up... 10/10 mix of halo, dinosaurs and first person shooter. top game must have
16	1	a	I was very happy to find these games on steam as they were childhood favorites. was not disappointed in reliving these games again!
5608	1	a	One of the greatest stories in gaming ever. Absolute disaster turned into a hilarious and fun game with a simple and near perfect premise 'Dinosaurs attack and you have jet packs, rocket launchers, and 4 buddies.'
192	1	a	A fun and challenging game, if you can look past some mildly annoying to very irritating deficits.  First, there's the story. It isn't terribly innovative, and it greatly depends on whether the subject matter is your thing. The narrative pretty much consists of the elements 'military blackops dealings', 'bio-weapon research' and 'ugly mutants by way of doomsday virus'. I happen to LOVE these tropes. Aside from this, the narrative suffers from a fractured nature and sacrifices character development for spectacle. The latter is to be expected, but Prototype takes it to extremes. Don't expect anything more than cutout labels like 'sister', 'ex-girlfriend' or 'ruthless military leader'. Regarding the 'fractured' characteristic, there seems to be a strange divide between story cutscenes and gameplay missions, which I can't really explain except for diagnosing a distinct lack of flow. Now, this all may sound pretty negative, but what Prototype does, it does well. The scenario of New York going to pots and turning into a warzone is beautifully realized. The story is also more grounded in reality than, say, Resident Evil, which deals with similar themes. There is also a nice optional gameplay aspect called 'Web Of Intrigue', which is for everyone who wants to delve deeper into the world of Prototype. By assimilating certain individuals, you unlock small story snippets connected by a network representing the individuals and their relationships. While this is really cool, there is also potential for future improvement. Why not, for instance, sort these cutscenes by theme and, once you have collected all scenes for a theme, unlock an option to watch a small movie combining the footage into one coherent story?  Gameplay-wise, the game is a very fun power fantasy and, at times, exhibits a great flow. Parkouring through New York is exhiliarating, and once you experienced escaping from your exploding helicopter just to hijack the attacking chopper in mid-air, you'll know how great the gamplay can be. HOWEVER, there are two things that made it difficult for me to throroughly enjoy Prototype. The first one are the so-called 'Events', which are nothing more than challenges spread over the city. I don't like challenges (or challenge maps, for that matter), as I think they are lazy design choices disconnected from any immersion and only present to shoehorn more content into a game. You like them? Well, great, you can scratch this caveat! Unfortunately, my second gripe transcends individual preferences.  This big fun-killer is the atrocious lock-on system (INFO: I played this game with a XBox 360 for Windows Gamepad). There simply doesn't seem to be any logic or prioritizing behind it. It does not really work. Actually, it has no right to do so, as you frequently deal with dozens of enemies simultaneously. But the problem is that the gameplay depends on it. Most of the time, it's just mildly annoying as you have enough time and leisure to rectify any mis-selection. However, during the final act of the game, missions require you to constantly be on your toes and perform difficult tasks under time pressure. You are chasing over the rooftops of Manhattan in desperate pursuit of a chopper you have to stop before it leaves the area? Well, the lock-on doesn't care and prefers to select a tank roaming the streets twenty meters below you. You really, REALLY need to keep track of a powerful boss rampaging through the area so it cannot charge at you like a Chihuahua on meth? The lock-on decides that a common soldier strolling around somewhere requires your immediate attention much more. I can't remember when the controls of a game have infuriated me so much. It renders you and makes you feel helpless.  Yet, I recommend Prototype. It features a competently realized and atmospheric scenario, and the gameplay makes even menial work fun. Menial work such as the Events, which can even be circumvented by grinding. However, you should be prepared to get frustrated in the later sections of the game.
5227	1	a	this game is a result of star wars having sex with jurrasic park their son having sex with farcry their son having sex with Call of duty their son having sex with Killing Floor there was so much sex needed for ORION: Prelude to be born 10/10 ORION: Prelude will have sex with GTA
3050	1	a	its good :) just buggy/glitchy that doesnt effect gameplay.
960	1	a	Not as good as the first one, but a nice addition nonetheless.  Story is non-existent and the shotgun is still overpowered. Art is good, obviously. I mean y'know, KLEI ent. Co-op campaign is replaced by survival mode, pretty neat in it's own way (if you can get a friend to play), but again, not as good as the first installment.  So if you want to try a Shank game, go for 1 first.
757	1	a	i recommend that you dont buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game , i cant even get guy to move from spot i started game at . and i hit every key possible hehe 
4144	1	a	true aids, but good for $1.00
5426	1	a	its well cheap lad
4984	1	a	Worst and cheaply made game i've ever seen.
5416	1	a	I played only a small portion of this game, though I can say that it is amazing. Despite it being EXTREMELY laggy/buggy (Might have just been the server) I found a lot of promise in it. It is a $0.99 game after all. You should be getting a mobile game at that price, not a game full in every way. Thank you, devs, for this awesome experience.
4102	0	a	
5696	1	a	'Your connection to the host has been lost' 2.420 / 69
3145	1	a	Cheap and good for a couple of hours with your friends. 6/10 Too many bugs and a lot of lagg
984	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. It mixes top-down, Metal Gear-style stealth mobility with puzzle elements. You can upgrade several different skills that can really change your approach to the game -- whether you prefer sneaking undetected, running and evading capture, or blowing up enemies from inside.  Graphics, sound, and controls are all nice. The story is somewhat linear, but fun nonetheless. Granted, it has that EA account nonsense, but I'd reccommend this.
2555	1	a	Payed $1.49 for a 4 pack for me and my bros. Got at least $2.45 worth of fun out of it
6372	0	a	look yes i only played for 30 mins... but i bought this game as part of a 4 pack for me and my mates.... paid like a buck for it.. how bad does a game have to be.. that your m8ts try to return the game... and the dev's.. because of what ever they said.. Gave them more free copies to give away?!?!?!?  so NO.. this game is not worth even the $1 buck i paid......
1288	0	a	i do not like this game i want a refund please
5182	1	a	I killed a T-Rex in slow motion with a longbow. If that isn't worth your dollar, I don't know what is. It's a litle glitchy, but what game isn't? Graphics are very good for $0.99 cents worth, and the gameplay is just great, especially if you have friends. Buy the 4-Pack, and play with your friends. It's such a great game.  There are other games out there for the same price, but I'm confident that none of them will get you this much enjoyment.  8/10
3151	1	a	It's only a dollar. Most others would price this is a 15 dollar game. Think about that.
6107	1	a	Got a graphics card, great horde game
5509	1	a	Very fun game! Good weaponds, Great vehicles!  I give it a 8/10. Needs a little more polish for the ingame interface, but hey for .99 cents worth every penny! 
1246	1	a	Really nice game for only 5â¬, one of my favourite indie games!
1052	1	a	Short but really fun game!
1783	0	a	So. The Dino bit is...ok. Not that good overall. Then you open up a new ugly can of worms with actual PVP. Oh, good god is that horrible. The guns all feel the same. Bad. It's clunky and rough. accidenally alt-tabbed out and everything froze. I mean my computer on a whole. It was weird and easily fixed but still didn't bode well when the Voice button is ALT. yeah. No thanks. I'm done and good. I'll stick to my other mindless FPS games.
1429	1	a	I got this for 19 cents and made 20 cents from trading cards... good times  
3394	1	a	I had a knife fight with a Pterodactyl. So much awesome.
4771	1	a	the unintstalling process worked great.
1338	1	a	if it is on a offer, buy it.
1490	1	a	99 cents.  It cost me 99 cents to shoot at dinosaurs for nearly 40 hours.  Yes.
5459	0	a	prelude is a downgrade from dinohoard dont buy this game and it lags the mouse alot even with almost everything disabled or minimul
3896	0	a	What a waste of money. I will never play it again.
4251	0	a	What sort of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing computer do you need to run this game, i mean i got 12 FPS ON THE MENU. You know you have screwed up somewhere if your menu runs at 12 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing frames. 2/12 thanks alot Valve. Oh and say i have a bad computer bad it says i have over the recommended
167	1	a	I really enjoyed this game, the chaos, transfermations and storyline were great aspects of this game. If I had to rate it; pretending that I was writing this when it first came out I would easily give it an 8.5/10. The reasons it didn't deserve a 9 or 10 is simply because of the bad pc ports of which I was getting 55fps with a gtx 760 and an i7 4790 another reason is because of it's outdated graphics even for 2009, this doesn't bother me that much but for some it might and finally it begins to become repetitive after playing for over an hour. Over all I really enjoyed this game and it had a lot to offer and I strongly recommend it.
1865	0	a	I dug a bit deeper to find out why I haven't had the will to play this game for more than three measly hours. Found DMCA claims, multiple titles with the same gameplay, money-whoring Kickstarter tactics, etc.  I wonder if Steam will still accept my refund.
719	1	a	Nice little game, too bad it's way too short and way too easy.
1125	1	a	Not really a big chellenge here, but a simple, fun and colorful game. Excelente for an younger audience. The controls are pretty simple, enemys arent a big problem. Easy but brilliant game.
6150	1	a	Great game for 99 cents. Get one, buy one or two for your friends, and have fun!
1368	0	a	Bought for my friend. We aren't friends anymore
6245	1	a	Very great game!!! Recommend it! Shooting dino's for fun!
214	1	a	Prototype is very addicting, as it uses a upgrading menu to keep you playing. This game is identical to Saints Row IV, only this was realised before hand. If you want a game where you can't stop playing, I recommend checking out Prototype. The story is ok, but the gameplay is very fun as it involves the use of abilities such as disguises and a wide variety of weapons for your character.
4864	0	a	Don't believe what the others say. It is not a good game. I promise you. It is okay, but seriously, pick up Killing Floor instead.
5622	1	a	The game is absolutely crazy I really like the game, and it really likes me I was playing it, while drinking my cuppa tea the weapons in this are like fish, in the sea so buy this game it only costs a small fee i've added so many dinosaurs to my family tree we're really close but they eat endlessly  done with the tea, now i'm going for a pee!
3430	1	a	Tiss a fun game famo
2264	1	a	The metacritic score is lying to you.  Yes, I totally recommend this game, its a lt of fun with friends, and the funnythings that can happen when your being chased by large bypedal lizards makes for entertaining gameplay.  Great fun and a number of different maps and play styles.
1457	1	a	Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience. You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.  The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.
5281	1	a	Only played for 2 hours so far, but this game is very fun. I'm not sure why the metascore is so low, but it was def worth the on sale price that I payed.
3385	1	a	Fun Game Would get old fast but make sure you put silly Waves on ! Makes the Game Last a bit longer
670	0	a	Poker solitaire is simply boring
5406	1	a	You can try to run over a T rex... 'try' 4/5
3646	1	a	Hundreds times better than Primal Carnage ! Very well optimized ! You can purchase equipment like in Just Cause 2 (weapons, tanks, helicopters). Best 0,49 cents I've ever spent ! 9/10
1798	1	a	Played a bit. Great game (Y)
1539	0	a	Game is ok. Devs are shady little children who can't handle negative feedback or make original content. 3/10 needs new dog models
3867	1	a	I love this.
78	1	a	I receieved this collection in the Humble Sierra Bundle, but I've owned these games long before that since they first came out; from the mid-80s right through to today. I still have the boxes and floppies/CD-ROMs!  Simply put, this was my favourite game series ever growing up. I loved Sierra adventure games right from the parser EGA mouse-less days to the point&amp;click VGA days. Space Quest was always my favourite Sierra series with its beautiful graphics (especially the artwork of Mark Crowe), the hilarious dialogue (especially the writing of Scott Murphy), the puzzles, the deaths, the locations, the stories, and everything else! This is one sci-fi series that was golden all the way through. My favourite title in the series is Space Quest IV as it involves time travel and going back and forth between Spcae Quest sequels!  If you like to sit and enjoy a game for a while taking in its atmosphere and laughing a lot, I highly recommend Space Quest! 6 games plus a remake of the first game for a low price! It's totally worth it.
4634	1	a	What the hell do you even want more?This game is freaking amazing.For 0.99?!Do the devs even earn something?Or is it more developed towards the players than profit? It's worth the money.It's fun.Buy it.
6054	1	a	This version of the game is a good buy for only â¬0.99! Lots of fun if you like a lot of shooting and dino's.   Only con i can think of is the server size with only 5 players. I think it would be a lot more fun with at least 10 or more ppl.  8/10 - MNN
2916	0	a	Just watch this, it explains it all the best I can:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCY_jaCFMdw 
315	1	a	Clearly say's i don't have many hours on this game or none at all when i wrote this recommendation (And steams 5 minute gameplay before posting review) however i had quite a bit from when i played this on the PS3 which i don't have anymore so i am happy to have found it on Steam   If distruction and choas and some funny achivements (Which i noticed after writing this review that it does not have achivements for the PC version it seems) is your thing than i highly recommend this game   What other game let's you drive tanks in new york running over cars and flatining them like pancakes or drive a bonus tank that shoots shells that act like a mini nucular bomb while watching cars and people go flying as a resualt or flying attack helicopters and being able to highjack them while they are in the air.  Being able to jump redicuoles distances and throwing cars like your a mini version of the hulk  Also turning yourself into a human tank (Though i wouldn't classifie Alex Mercer as human) and plowing through anything in your path (minus buildings) running up the side of sky scrapers and much more   The story line i found was actually good not really any games i play just for the story line however i found this one to be an exception  My personal preferance for games are open world racing games and simulaters or games like GTA series Though this game doesn't let you drive civilian vehicles i'm alright with the fact they let you drive tanks and fly helicopters  But to each there own. The graphics are good at least to me they are. It's open world which i like though i wish you could explore all of New York like outside the quorinteen zone  controls are easy though going from the PS3 to PC could be interesting Least it gives a tutorial on the controls at the begining of the game   Well guess if you find my recommending usefull then you can find your own impression of the game  Have fun.
4740	0	a	would never recomend (no teamwork)
3419	1	a	Lax a little in the content area. But at $0.99 its worth every penny.
6063	1	a	Get Paid  Get Gunsaid  Rek Dinosauraid  360 no scopeaid  buy for friends play co-opaid 
6327	1	a	Great Game! only $1 for endless hours of fun with friends! Wether you want to work together in Survival Co-op, or fight against eachother in the numerous interesting and diverse 1v1 game modes, you're going to have a GREAT time! Why haven't you bought it yet? We will never know..
2459	1	a	i killed a tyrannosaurus rex. no team, no bombs, me and a rifle. i killed a trex with only a rifle. im the only person i know of in history to do this. remember me.
2060	1	a	No i do not recommend this game, but yolo its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awsome
4078	1	a	How to play this game: 1:Start the game. 2:Try to join an online lobby 3:Fail 4:Start single player 5:Shoot Dinosaurs 6:Buy new â¥â¥â¥â¥ 7:Get bored after 3-4 games 8:Pick it up again when you're bored just to have some quick fun, and waste some time 9:Repeat Did I mention it only costs a dollar?
940	1	a	Even better visuals and re-invented, more fluid combat. About as short as the first one, but the co-op survival mode adds longevity and is a lot of fun, especially with a friend. If you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel.
3231	0	a	I can only politely describe this game as a waste of hard drive space. The issues are as follows. 1. Weapon names can be misleading, an LMG is a 3 round burst rifle, and a light machien fun with the LMG tag is further along. 2. Enemies will still spawn, and attack you, when it displays wave clear. 3. spawn and upgrade room defense turrets start the game broken and don't fix themselves. 4. player character models look hideous. 5. the multiplayer lobby system is unintitive, with as far as I could see, no start game or ready up functions.
2047	1	a	This game is what Jurassic park would have been if the main cast were replaced by soldiers with futuristic weapons. Part FPS, part tower defence, part dinosaur massacre!
1131	1	a	If there is one word that I would use to describe this game, it would be adorable. Everything about this game is adorable. The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.
2198	1	a	BUT â¥â¥â¥â¥ IT WAS 99 CENT!!!
1473	0	a	There's nothing particularly wrong with  BEEP , but I think that's at least partly because the developers weren't innovating or taking risks with it, and ultimately, it just feels too generic and simple to hook me. The gravity gun, touted as a unique mechanic and the game's main attraction, really isn't unique at all: it's functionally identical to, and used for puzzle-solving in exactly the same way as the wizard's telekinesis in  Trine , which is a much more highly recommended game.
4246	1	a	Buy when on sale its a good game but not worth the 15 bucks i got it for 99 cents so yea i would give it a 7 out of 10 because it is a little to pricy anyway it is an overall good game with a little feel of tf2 because hats
1249	1	a	This is a fun and cute platformer where you play as the robot BEEP. You are trying to find out why the other robots... are fighting you? To be honest, I payed little to no attention to the story, but the gameplay was very fun! Good music and you can kill robots using other robots dead bodies! I would recommend this game, For $1 you can't go wrong! (Also, it's usaully on sale for 25 cents so just buy it then if you're super cheap) Creative, tough and worth it!
2194	1	a	Best idea for a game ever dinosaurs and jetpacks am I right?
3224	1	a	very fun if played with friends
6017	1	a	Halo + Dinosaurs? Nothing's better than these combined!
2890	1	a	Gripping the turret mounted on the back of a transport vehicle, You can hear the guns barrels spinning as a cloud of bullets rips into the head of Tyrannosaurus Rex himself. The ice covered Tundra of the games conquest mode seems fresh as our group of four sets out to claim the first generator. Wave One hasn't started yet, and I have already found more enjoyment in this game then I did with most other titles I play, and I'll let you know why. First of all, if you buy this game looking for the First Person Shooter aspect, where you roam killing Dinosaurs, you have the wrong game. Sadly this title isn't the best feeling shooter on the Market, although at the core it is a well rounded combat system. If you want max enjoyment from this game, get some of your PC gaming friends that 'Play well with others' start a Steam Chat Room, turn on your mics, and engage in what could be one of the most thrilling CO-OP Shooters you will ever play. There is just something gratifying about leading an armada of VTOL warships across the frozen earth only to reign death upon everything in your way. Or Emptying the magazine of an Assault Rifle into a horde of Raptors as your team struggles to regain supremacy over the swarm of Dinos. If you are looking for the most fun you can have with a group of friends, look no further. As soon the game finishes the install process you and your buddies will be cutting through the Prehistoric, one bullet at a time. 10/10
4599	0	a	i tought i just bought saints row 4 but apparently i got orion prelude  2x=4 x=4,53 ILLUMINATIE?
1756	1	a	Tremendously spartan shooter arcade game. Easy to get into, games can last for as short or as long as you desire. Plenty of weapons, vehicles and user custimisations. Several game modes, from TDM, FFA, 1v1, Survival and Conquest. Survival are matches consisting of several waves of dinosaurs attacking you and your base for you to fend off with you and your mates. Inexpensive, fun and easy to get into for video game novices and experts alike.

1715	1	a	When I saw this game for only a dollar I thought what the hell lets try it. Shortly after that I grabbed the 4 pack and brought some friends in and have had nothing but fun and good times. The $15 price tag might be a little much for some people but I have had more fun in this game than I have had with a lot of the recent AAA games.
3127	1	a	This game is right up there with Borderlands and Payday 2 in terms of great co-op shooters.
1068	1	a	This game is a cute adventure that starts out a cakewalk then ramps up.

4315	1	a	This is a really great co-op game to play with friends!
674	0	a	This is one of those games where you play it for a bit and then you get stuck. On the plus side, the main menu music is awesome.
5873	1	a	Not too bad for a $1 game. :P
4507	1	a	Fifty-fifty
284	1	a	Great game for just running around and doing whatever while listening to music.
1929	0	a	Everything about this game is terrible, down to the real money customization store. If there has really been so much improvement since Dino Beatdown, I don't want to think about how awful THAT was. But really, renaming the game was just a cheap ploy to escape the awful reviews it had deserved upon its original release.  A generous 2/10
2518	1	a	Dinosaurs and lightsabers. What more can you ask for?
4022	1	a	Dont listen to anyone who thinks this game is garbage, this is the best indie game out there
6223	1	a	Nice game :)
4123	1	a	I play this game is not to good but funn if i bored that i is when i don t' do. and i say this too hunk da trunk and right this for da good! so that you see this and tink that this game is good-becus it are fgood for the price it has on the game you buy for little price and when i say that i meen this game and not otehr game becaus i tell yo u its good forr only its price not more because it need mor to doo. i am not scuuby so me dont solv this case easy like them crew that he in so i only say this from my heart and brain not from sience or other sorcec like math, and otter stuff like cemistry and other that i think not of now that. i only whant to say this for not longningn this review forr too lon....
2837	1	a	I'm still trying to figure out why I like this game. It's so awful but there's also something appealing about it besides the incredibly low price tag. It's a game that tricks you into thinking that it's good. You know for a fact that it's one of the worst things ever, but it's hard to deny that it's actually quite fun to play with friends.  What can I say? It's cheap as dirt so grab a friend or a couple friends and go kill some mindless dinosaurs. Defend your base, augment your abilities, buy some new guns, hop in a mech or tank, enjoy the diverse weather system, and then die at the very last round.  Final Verdict: (3.2 out of 5)
5468	1	a	best dino killing game 10/10 would buy this for all of the people who dont have it jk
6399	1	a	This game, although not perfect, is rather good. What I mean by not perfect is that yes, it has its bugs. The server optimization and lag compensation is relatively minimal to nonexistent. Even with those annoyances you learn to cope. Then the game becomes a redikulous, yet fun. How many games can you use a gattling gun to kill a dinosaur in? this one. For a dollar, this game is worth your money. It will keep you entertained for many an hour. Plus you can drive a tank, and run down dinosaurs in a small land jetski. What else do you need in a game?
2902	1	a	Great game. Metascore is dated from it's last name and title. Wait for another sale if you want it, but definitely get it.  Easily one of the best games for it's price, runs on unreal engine.    Maybe a little too much bloom though. lol.
5979	1	a	With how inexpensive this game is, you're a terrible person if you don't buy it for your friends and have a hell of a time.
26	1	a	Unfortunately Steam is just selling 7 games that won't run. Was stupid enough to save 3$ on Steam instead of buying the games from gog. Well of course I bought them from gog directly after, running smooth. I just hate when big companies sell products like this, and you have no chanse to get your money back! Don't buy theese game here!!!!! Im recommending this game, but hopefully some of you won't throw 10$ in the sea, shame on you Steam!
3261	1	a	Takedown : Red Sabre, but with dinosaurs.  Only fun when you play it with friends and with a casual attitude.   Get it while its a dollar and have some fun.   (the dinosaurs have REALLY loud roars, I mean like deafening if you play with headphones)
6431	1	a	Best summed up: Dino survival 'Left 4 Dead' made with the Halo Engine.  This is a simple, standard shooter with a fun theme that when played with friends, is an amazingly fun time.  The game is also quite rough around the edges, but is still very enjoyable. If you have the chance, try it out.
6439	1	a	Grab some beer, some friends and buy this game. You will not regret it!
378	0	a	The most I've ever disliked a sandbox game. Boring, tedious and stupid.
2935	1	a	I just spent money buying skins on ORION dino horde... i immediately regretted it. 10/10  Edit: Still regret it Keepo
4868	1	a	It's alright..
3003	1	a	get the game ITS THE BEST 
5088	1	a	Probably..... yes.....
2960	1	a	Makes my balls soft
1978	1	a	Needed more Dinosaurs using Jetpacks.
3757	0	a	I spent 0.99 cents on this game. THIS IS â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
567	1	a	Where the hell is prototype 2?
6205	1	a	is a rilly fun game
1988	1	a	A poor mans Free 2 Play.
4003	1	a	This game is really cool and it is being updated constantly and soon they will be making a whole new better version of these game in replacement of this which will be cool. It is totally worth the price and expecially now since it is $1. Only problem i see in this game is the lack of open servers and some weird animations with taunts and walking, having your torso move and not your uper body, but that doesnt impact the game at all.
473	1	a	The game is really, really, very unique and interesting.... I love it!
2709	1	a	one of the best shooter everyone should try
6584	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dinosaurs and â¥â¥â¥â¥. Gud gam.
2485	1	a	The Greatest Game of All Time
2947	0	a	This is survival of the fittest. Or the sickest. In this case. Do you like Halo? Well, you'll at least get the interface of the old Halo: Combat Evolved. Even though this game is built with Unreal Engine 3, it looks like an old PS2 game. This game has an incredibly broken AI, bad graphics and looks like it was designed within a lunch break by two drunk students.  This is not even remotely funny. Until you add friends. Then it gets slightly better. Maybe a little more than 'slightly'. Don't have any friends? Don't pick it up. Got friends? Go play something else. Seriously.  If this sounds harsh, I'm sorry, it is meant to be. If you are looking for something positive, look at the price tag and the fact,  that it's still being updated and recieves improvements well after release.
512	1	a	A bit short, but good. Damn, it's fun to be the monster! :D Also annoying gameplay, but the story is worth the pain :)
257	1	a	If there is such a game that can represent me, then that has to be Prototype. The reason is kind of simple. During the winter time back in highschool, I always wore a black jacket and a white hoodie inside, and blue jeans (In fact, I still wear them today), making myself look like Alex Mercer in a way. Did I wear like that so that I can look like Alex Mercer? No. I wore those even before the game Prototype was announced, so basically I felt that I had to give this game a try, as it looked as though the main character himself was myself.   And basically I beat this game on 360 a long time ago, and I remember myself having a real great time with it. And recently I bought myself the Steam version and have to say, the game is still a good ol' Prototype. Basically you are Alex Mercer, who is almost like a superman. The helicopters, tanks and tons of military men try to kill you all at once, but no worries, you are Alex Mercer, you have the ability to heal yourself by devouring zombies or people and no one can match your running speed and power. It is also possible to upgrade your powers and purchase new skills so that you can unleash extremely powerful move against your foes as well. But because of the fact that Alex Mercer is so overpowered, you better be moving fast otherwise, you may die quickly. I remember the game being pretty challenging back in the days, and even though I already beat it once, I still kind of feel some parts are still somewhat challenging.   Overall, great action game. 10 out of 10.
5759	1	a	Purchased this when it was still entitled ORION: Dino Horde for 99 cents.  Hands down, it is the best dollar game I have ever bought.  9/10  Did I mention you can kill dinosaurs with a Mech?
2773	0	a	Not bad at All, game looks like playing Unreal Tournament Evasion with more features, dinos, and vehicles.   Good: +Dinosaurs +a lot of Perks  Bad: +UI need more improvements and more easy to look +No Tutorials  it's worth if you want to try or loving co-op games, i'm not recommended because the game still need change some features and gameplay. for me, thinking before buy this one
6042	1	a	It's a good and cheap game.
3278	1	a	This game is quite buggy and I feel like I'm shooting rubber bullets but when your playing with friends, this game is actually pretty fun :D
4462	0	a	While I would recommend the game if you could get it for around two dollars like I did, I couldn't recommend a full purchase. The game runs horribly on even outstanding systems. The idea is at least interesting. I give the game that it has one of the more unique ideas out there, but its charm dimms a little after extended play. The gameplay is fun throughout with good upgrades, and challenging enemies, but it also containes some annoying bugs. If you do get it, get it on sale. Be prepared for extreme temperatures too.
4558	0	a	I had allot of fun with this game... However I recenly have heard they've stolen a bunch of assets and plans and over all a pretty bad company. So if a dev see's my comment, please give me a refund rather then a ban.
1370	0	a	Wasting money simulator 2015
3330	1	a	If a dinosaur, killing floor, and halo had a love child this would be it. 
4065	0	a	It is pretty funny, I'll give it that.
1384	1	a	What a load of *BEEP
3573	0	a	even if i was a trillionare, i'd still ask for my $0.17 back
2009	1	a	hey game creators, can you put in a new dino? carnotaurus please? its in primal carnage anyway it was medium size and would charge things with its horns. and maybe could you put in ankylosaurus and allosaurus? if you can put in one of these i would really be pleased. thanks!  -icerunner
1704	1	a	Im really happy to see this game in its current state...It used to suck, now its a Fun game!
6582	0	a	This isn't a good game, but for a 99 cent sale I could consider buying it then. But not for 15 freaking dollars.
2014	1	a	Good game despite the look of it at first
1774	1	a	So i bought this game when it was 1 dollar,so you may be thinking,everone who actually BOUGHT the game is mad that it just went F2P,well when there over game, The Orion Project,goes F2P,everone who bought the game at a premiuem cost gets 6 diffrent helmets FOR Orion. Which is pretty cool and this isnt P2W,as most stuff in the store is just cosmetic. So i would recommend you try this game out,as its a pretty good game to play on.
3	1	a	What can't I say about King's Quest? I was near about raised on adventure games, and this was a big one. I didn't really appreciate it as much as a kid as I have on my recent replayings of the series. The one thing I will mention in regards to this collection, though, is that there are bugs that occur because this game was not built for newer systems. You can find the patches for it at  http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/Patches-Updates-Games/KingsQuestUpdates.html . Alternatively, you can purchase the collection from  GOG.com . They have it split into three sections, 1-3, 4-6, and 7-8, and 8 isn't included in this collection. I have yet to determine if this is a good or bad thing.  I'll also mention that AGDI made a wonderful remake for the original King's Quest to give it icons like KQV and KQVI had, and they did a big storyline overhaul for KQII that even included the original voice actor for Graham. They also did an update to KQIII with a little bit more story to it, as well as the icons. You can find them at  http://www.agdinteractive.com/ .
4861	1	a	Got it at 93% off and its well worth the dollar spent. This game reminds me of Turok the dinosaur hunter from back in the day. Graphics, animation and fun are all decent enough to have a good time. I recommend it while on sale!
4996	0	a	NEEDS OPTIMIZATION DAMNIT QUIT BUYING IT BECAUSE ITS .99 CENTS!!!
5053	1	a	Pretty Good game
174	1	a	A great action game developed by the same company who made the Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction video game, this would be considered the more brutal, gorry successor to that game. Plenty of mechanics, powers and consuming fun to be had here.
4492	0	a	the optimization is awefull
4307	0	a	needs better optimization
6497	1	a	In all seriousness. I bought the game before seeing any reviews. After watching some reviews (that bombed the game into oblivion) I was worried about spending that 1 dollar per game. I bought a pack to play with friends and didnt even see it was f2p for 3 days :P. BUT I must say that even though it has some bugs wich aren't game breaking and a bit out of balanced pvp, the survival mode was great and I would even have payed 5-10 euro's for it. Just for the survival mode. It felt like a sort of halo coop game where you have to survive waves of dinosaurs and upgrade your gear (wich is quite fun to do and you have allot of options).   Verdict: If you are looking for a awesome deatmatch or team deathmatch game don't bother, there are way better games. But if you are looking for a great coop LAN game buy this indie misfit :). One of the most fun we had at our lan. In comparison we played: Loadout, Red alert 2, L4D2, Gary's mod, Cod5, Smite, UT2004, CSGO and Atomic bomberman.  P.S. For the devs: you can see the craftsmanship, sweat and tears of the developers in this game. They probably just needed better guidelines/manager and more polish. Try to make this games other gamemodes better and good luck on your next endevour.
5356	1	a	A quirky, yet satisfying FPS twitch survival game. Meet new friends, kill big lizards, bring me some pizza!
4741	1	a	Played once and it crashed my computer. The Metascore is misleading.
6454	1	a	It's Halo with dinosaurs. If you have an avid hatred for reptiles, and for all that they did to our mammalian ancestors, this is your chance for vengeance.
5698	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED! DO NOT INTALL THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! IT IS A WASTE OF DATA! 
2731	1	a	This is a pretty cool and fun game. You should get it.
6355	1	a	I didn't know I owned this game, can't find it in my library either?
5687	1	a	Really fun with friends, lots of weapon choice and cool mix of upgrades in a shooter. Fun dino shooter. Definitely worth the money. 8/10
3960	1	a	Jetpacked to a mountain and watched them die    11/10 Would be a Traitor again

5000	0	a	Gameplay is good. Graphics are good. Consistancy of Bugs is good. Bad updates are good.  4/10
3899	1	a	To be frank, propbably the best 99 cents you will every spend, regardless if you constantly play the game or not
2350	1	a	Very Enjoyable. Has a lot of potential.

4643	0	a	Looks and plays like a Roblox minigame.
2692	1	a	THIS GAME IS AMAZING 
2809	1	a	Crashed a vehicle into a T-Rex, vehicle exploded, died trying to fight off T-Rex with a pistol. 10/10 GOTY 
2746	1	a	This Game is as good as it says in the trailer, the only bad thing about it is when it rains or you're on a winter map and is disrupts your view because it either frosts up or you get rain dripping down your helmet, Exept that i give this game a 9 outta 10!
3695	0	a	I think they spent more time on the achievements than the game...
5062	1	a	For .99 cents, it's a steal. Me and a group of friends have had a blast playing hours for random silly achievements and exploring each map. Lots of different weapons and semi-permaperks you buy with in-game cash per match.  Price/Hour ratio 10/10 Replayability 9/10 Variety 8/10  Overall 10/10
4298	0	a	If you want to play a good dino game, dont try this. Very low budget game, but this isnt a problem. The models are low resolution, servers are laggy, and much more.

5913	1	a	this is the best game with dinos 
3664	1	a	I do recommend this game although it does get a bit laggy...
2329	1	a	Killed a Raptor with a T-REX egg. Would whack again. 10/10 
3180	1	a	Beat a group of Raptors in the face with a Lightsaber and took a high-flying tour with my friend Jeffrey the Pterodactyl, which resulted in my bones shattering when he let my fatass go. 10/10. Would stab more dinosaurs.
1101	1	a	Note: I'm trying to play all the games on my Steam library and give a quick review. This is based on aprox 30 min gameplay.   Despite looking like that Flash game your dad played one night that gave your computer a virus, BEEP is kind of ok. It's certainly not as tight as Yoshi's Island, and how dare anyone mention this glorified browser game in the same sentence as Half Life? The cheek, the very cheek of it! Despite being slightly overated, and over priced, BEEP has got some substance to it. The hub world in which you select your stage by navigating a rocket ship around planets is kind of cool. Shooting enemies and throwing them around with the gravity gun is also pretty neat. There are better games out there that are more polished and cost less that the 5 bucks asked for BEEP. However I will say I can recommend BEEP if you have little kids , or are looking for something kind of relaxing and easy to play. Pick it up on sale like I did (paid .21 cents) and you shouldn't be dissapointed.
3440	0	a	this game was NOT a good game. even if you have a awesome graphic card it still lags. played it for an hour and I was done with it. i dont recomend this game please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4245	1	a	WOW That discount 
1170	1	a	Heeey and this is my review about the game  You are a little robot, with asmall hover jet and some machine gun.  It's sort of a mario game, because u have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives if you die, you have the option to be teleported to your last checkpoint. Graphics are a little bit, classic? it's not high tech at all, same goes for backgrounds. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D  If you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.  If you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though. Game has some puzzle elements. The game is calm, music is calm.  Game is okay if u like platforming. Otherwise wait for a discount.  7/10
3198	1	a	its literally killing floor but with dinosaurs  get this game you stupid idiot its only a FREAKING dollar
205	1	a	Incredibely fun. There is nothing quite like this game, the only one coming close being Prototype 2. Nothing makes you feel more like destrcution incarnate.  The only real dislike that could hold up is how annoying some missions were, but that is a very arguable point.  Anyone that's looking into playing this game, I highly reccomend you do so.
1295	1	a	great game, if you buy for 19â¬ you get more money from trading card ;) xD    sorry for bad english   
3389	1	a	It's so bad it's good. Get it on sale.
3131	1	a	Posibly the best game of all time, its unbalivably fun.
4421	1	a	I was gonna buy an m4a4 zirka and then i figured out this beast was 1 dollar. addicted probably
3962	0	a	i would rather have my virtebrae remouved to suck my own â¥â¥â¥â¥ then to pay $0.56 for this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥
4317	1	a	Hey guys it's me, Ben Affleck. When I was filming Argo (maybe you've seen it lol) I would pass the time between filming scenes to play this video game. Orion: Prelude has a story that puts Good Will Hunting (another film I starred in with my best friend Matt Damon) to shame. All of the proceeds from this game go to relief efforts in Israel. I am a HUGE supporter of the Israeli plight and wish to see prosperity in the Middle East. I give this video game 357 Afflecks out of 5 Afflecks. Not buying this game would cause another Shoa goyim, oi vey!
4933	0	a	What happend to this game they changed everything.
2097	1	a	THIS IS THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥EST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAY, UNINSTALLED AFTER 8 MINUTES OF PLAY WASTE OF 99c, NEVER BUY THIS AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!!!!!! 'BUT â¥â¥â¥â¥, IT WAS 99C.......' MACKLEMORE 2012
3079	1	a	This game may include Dinosaurs and ebola.
3531	0	a	ENG:  It's change into F2P -model what was absolute 'NO' -for me so, i don't recomented that a game any more.    FIN:  Muuttivat pelin F2P -malliseksi mikÃ¤ on ehdottomasti 'EI' -minulle joten, en voi suosittella tÃ¤tÃ¤ peliÃ¤ enÃ¤Ã¤n.
3360	1	a	Fantastic, perfectly created for our enjoyment! No glitches or anything!
6280	1	a	This game is worth at least 5 bucks. Pick it up, you won't regret it.
1164	0	a	one of my favorite games the story is very touching
888	1	a	First just to get it out there i did buy this game while it was on sale for 2 buck so take that into consideration. Anyways, i feel that the comments of the repetitive nature of the game are not truly deserving. In my opinion beat em ups should never overstay their welcome and should be fun pick up and play games. Throughout the game Shank comes across different weapons that will help him on his adventure and provide a change in how you approach different situations. While not game changing, they provide enough intensive to play around with the options. This combined with the extremely addicting survival mode makes this game well worth the buy, discount or not.
1854	0	a	The company responsible for this game stole many asset from Activision for their new game called ORION, more precisely Black Ops 3 and Advanced warfare.   At first you might think that this is just some Big Guy is bullying a little company, but even if ACTIVISION is not a respectable company, theft is theft. Also, David Prassel of Trek Industries threatened many people on reddit to sue them if they didn't delete their thread calling out their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ behavior.  For more information on their dirty deeds.   https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/   Anyway, this game sucked harder than my vacuum cleaner (Repetetive, filled with microtransaction, physic was ridiculous, etc etc). This game didn't need this obvious theft to get a negative review.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ you anyway David, sue me all you want, I don't own â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1361	0	a	Im buy that game only for cards its dont good game. 11/10 farm cards liked.
2607	1	a	I bought this game when it was called Orion: Dino Beatdown. They changed it then to Orion: Dino Horde, It is now called Orion: Prelude.  The game is worth $0.99 if your body 'don't turn cold' purchasing this game you really haven't lived.
1036	1	a	7.2 / 10
5092	1	a	Although this game has countless bugs and not exactly the best animation, it is still a very great game. This game is definitely worth $1 or maybe even more. I will admit it is not the best but not the worst. ( If you purchase this game, get the 4-pack because it is 1,000,000x better with teammates.)
6422	1	a	Since it's on sale for a dollar and is free2play weekend, I thought why not, I expected it to be a solid game but probably wont have alot of features, but actually theres quite a bit to do already. The game basically just needs polishing and I'd be finished in my opinion. Definitly worth a try and for a Dollar? Why not just buy it and support the devs for more titles.
547	1	a	greatgame! singleplayer only
907	1	a	Hell yes. Works great with gamepad, fun campaign, and great graphics.
783	1	a	Excellent co-op experience. Ranks up there with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
809	1	a	Must-have. Awesome single player story mode &amp; VERY challenging co-op mode that's just tons of fun. Took us about 40 hours to beat Wave 30 and it was worth every minute :)
5750	1	a	Dino Beatdown x 2
5532	0	a	there is nobody playing the game and i cant play@!!! 
5666	1	a	So when I found this game I decided to buy it because it was 1 dollar and it looked terrible and when i played it i may have bought 4 other copies for my friends because ITS SOOOO AWESOME! there was one glitch that was the best glitch ever TWERKING STEGOSAURUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5730	0	a	I remember playing this a long time ago and thinking it sucked. It has potential, but it sucked. Now for 74 cents, it still sucks. The game feels too 'cardboard'. Guns lack oomph or any muzzle flash. Id prefer it if the dinos didnt actually walk, just glide around at least that would make it funny.
5984	1	a	This game is surprisingly cheap, surprisingly stupid, and, in fact, surprisingly fun. You basically shoot dinos - there's little more to say.  It's definitely not an AAA title, and it has a few flaws - the main one being that the terrain collision detection can get somewhat wonky around rocks or other structures with sharp angles - but it's undeniably fun to play, and it's definitely a game I will keep coming back to for quite a while yet. For a game that costs 80 pence, what more could you ask for? Go ahead and buy it right now, you won't regret it.  The community, by the way, is rather nice, too. For example, when you need to cap an objective that's ~1km away in survival mode, and there are vehicles on hand, people will almost always wait for everyone to get on before riding away. I have yet to encounter anybody swearing or insulting people.  In short - for this price, I definitely recommend this game.
5199	1	a	Expected more but I guess I got what I paid for lol
1188	1	a	easy to play  
4061	0	a	Tried for a solid 20 minutes to join a game. Got jack â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Broken game, don't buy.
6395	1	a	A moshpit of CoD, Halo, and Borderlands all wrapped up in one huge dinosaur world. Suprisingly addictive. It's a steal at only $1.00.
3225	1	a	I can absolutely recommend this awesome game. I only tried the survival mode yet but it is much more fun than the other coop zombie survival games like l4d2 or killing floor.
2656	1	a	Sry bout other review ment to be funny....... anyway for 99 cents who would not buy it? If you aint happy with it so what it was a buck....... not the animal! Anyway BUY IT NOW!!!!
592	1	a	I would recomend this game to someone who has never played it before just because it is a unique game. But I used to play this game all the time as a young'n I bought it thinking that it would be fun to play again but this is a game that has very little replay value and it is best to leave it as a memory.
2377	1	a	Better than Ark
637	1	a	If you like casual games and you like an RPG style twist, then this little game was executed very well. The concept of using a standard card game as a fighting system works very well actually. Solid little game, I like it quite well!
2422	0	a	its a rubish game isnt it 
211	1	a	Play as Alex Mercer on this amazing open-world game !
3607	0	a	How....How did they make a game about shooting â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hoards of dinosaurs boring...How...HOW!?!??!?!?  This game sounded cool. 'You should play this game because it has guns and dinosaurs!' and what i got was...nothing...Emptyness. A shell.  This game is SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buggy, the AI are dumb as real dinosaurs and you might as well be handling a payload of nukes at the rate which dinosaurs die to your hand...OH GOD! HOW DID IT GET THIS BORING?!
171	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played, i really recommend it! You're a guy with biological powers and there's a lot of things to do like atack a military base, destroy a hive, do events, just kill people... I really liked the storyline, the main objetive is find out who you are and what happened to you because you lost your memory, you just don't get tired of playing this game 10/10
1567	1	a	&gt;I get the game &gt;I join a server, the map is called 'Hell' &gt;It's ok i guess. &gt;Suddenly the map gets smaller &gt;A pumpkin appears out of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing no where &gt;Kills my team &gt;We restart the map &gt;Pumpkin King again &gt;Fight him &gt;Trip &gt;Get on the floor &gt;Everybody walk the dinosaur
6364	1	a	This CO-OP game is good,but need to fixed some bugs.(Why this game is free?DAFUQ?)
5813	1	a	This game was really rough when it first came out, but Spiral really upped their game and made this a BRILLIANT title in the updates since then. It definitely has a Halo vibe to it (its Firefight mode in particular if you're familiar with it), but much faster paced with a lot of upgrades and weapons to choose from. The environments are gorgeous, and the gunplay is satisfying. Definitely one of my top-10 games to play with friends, and a great deal at any price!
2611	1	a	This Game Is 8/8 M8 Must Get This Game
1523	1	a	Q:Do I like it?Why? A:I cant decide.5 minutes into the games and im noclipping though the dinosaur while reloading.  Q:Overall? A:stuck on level 1  Q:Any useful tips? A:nope  DA SENTENCEEE  help.
236	1	a	Fantastic. I refuse to play the second again, considering I much perfer this one. Alex for life!
4184	1	a	this game is totally awesome i reccomend it for true gamers!!!!!
202	1	a	If you liked Infamous 2 but hated the good/evil moral points system nonsense they put into it, then you will like this.  To be completely honest the powers in this game are better than Infamous 2 although they are melee, there is a lot more variation than the lighting bolt attacks from Infamous.  It also has the added bonus of being able to pickup weapons and helicopters and tanks.   The only big sigh for me is that Activision let the development team behind the franchise go so there probably won't be a prototype 3.
603	1	a	Alex's ability is very popular in Korea I love this game
4653	1	a	Could use more bacon.
6286	1	a	An awsome fps in a dinosaur world. It looks really good. Alot of houres to put in to this game
2955	1	a	It's good. It's *really* good. But it's not $14.99 worth of good. Unless you have nothing else to spend $14.99 on. *Then* it's that good.
4816	0	a	Dinosuars, guns and vehicles: The Game.  That's about it, unfortunately.
175	1	a	The way Alex Mercer curbstomped civilians and ate them alive really endeared him to me as a character. Y'know, that and when he suplexed a helicopter into a tank.
711	1	a	It's like Puzzle Quest, but instead of matching 3 pairs to knock your enemies health down, you play poker! The bigger your hand, the more damage you deal. If you like cards, it's kind of fun, just don't expect a great story or anything like that....
2786	1	a	This metacritic is wrong on so many levels! I am a huge fan of killing floor and this is beyond epic for me! I started playing this yesterday but would have played so much more if I had gotten the time. I recommend anyone who is also a fan of Killing Floor to get this game! I promise you, you won't regret it!
4705	1	a	could be better also could be worse 7/10 would bang againe ;p  EDIT: YALL BETTER FIX THIS BROKEN MACHINE CUZ AINT NO LIGHT THREW THE BROKEN SCREEN HONKY HONKY HONK  ANY OF YOU CRACKAERS WANA PURCHASE SOME OF MY METH
1448	1	a	It's awesome, and its not a gun game its like Rated E For everyone.
4213	1	a	This game is pretty fun. Especially worth it when it goes on sale for a dollar.
2818	1	a	You get to shoot dinos with a mech and punch a T-rex in the face to death 9/10 would recomend Also did I mention HATS!!!
2549	1	a	This game, oh man. When you get friends together this can be really fun. Fighting off hordes of dinos, having satisfaction for each head you blow off. You can fight to survive, so if a dino kills you, you kill them back and BAM you're alive! I suggest this for those with friends that want to play this. So far, good game. -12/-10
3620	0	a	So much about this game is wrong... The first thing you notice is that you have no guns. Instead, you have a textured object in your hand, that supossedly does damage as the ammo counter in the bottom of your screen counts down. You have no way of knowing however, as not only is there no data on your enemy, but the gun does not move; there is no recoil, there is no muzzle flash, and there are no bullet decals. This just begins to describe the potentially fatal experience of Orion Dino Horde, including hills that you walk through, no explanation to the gameplay, overly large maps with no navigation, game ruining glitches, a dedicated fan base of 11 year olds, and T-Rexs that throw rocks from their mouths. You read that last bit right. The T-Rex throws rocks from their mouths.  However, with all of the faults the game has, it makes for a hilarious experience, especially with a friend by your side as you smash into dozens of dinosaurs in overpowered vehicles, trolling the serious players into rage quitting. Only buy it if you have a friend(s) to play it with. That is when it holds any value.
3794	0	a	Don't believe their lies. It's a third-rate Unreal Tournament 3 mod, with tons of jank and like, one looping music track. It's worth 99c, but not a penny more.
2820	1	a	THIS IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!   100/100
2898	1	a	This is a game where you run around doin' I don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing know or care shooting pictures of dinosaurs ten outta ten hundred outta a hundred best game BEST GAME
6436	0	a	keeps crashing when i try to play a game on it this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
5530	1	a	Hell of a bargain for less than a dollar. Little bit laggy and altogether not very visually impressive, but a good time killer with friends.
3659	0	a	I don't know why I didn't like this game. so...   - I feel boring when I playing this game  - I don't know why I write this review I only played this game like a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' 0.2 hrs  yeah!! I'll rate this game 99/100 what?
615	1	a	Prototype is an amazing way to pass the time if you like being hulk that eats people and has a sword for an arm. I've had plenty of fun with it and i reccomend it to anyone who likes to blow things up. HAPPY BIRTHDAY PROTOTYPE
731	1	a	Just played it through and left wanting for more. It's a simple game to learn, if you know poker hands. Poker hands are used to do battle against foes. Among poker hands, you get to use spells, allies that have different powers and pet abilities. I love the tactic and mathematic side of winning the battles. Not having much time to play and having to get off the chair before my computer a lot, I'm happy that it's turn based and that you can save between every battle. Hope there's going to be more soon. :)
1241	0	a	The game does not even display the whole area. You're often under your screen, and getting attacked from units off the scrren too. This game needs to be updated to even be playable.  Other than the bug fix, I believe that the game lacks a lot of depth. It is very basic. Basic and buggy are not examples of anything one should spend their own money on.
3649	1	a	Ignore the negative reviews. They were all written before the game was so beautifuly updated. I would play it more if my laptop would handle it better but the devs are amazing and really put effort into theirs games. Recommending it unless you have a laptop not suited for gaming (are laptop generally suited for gaming?).
3716	1	a	shoot dino be dino
963	1	a	I have not played shank 1 A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well.   Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable.   You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.  Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.  Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.
5897	0	a	its a glitchy game
415	1	a	this is a amazing game try to get it
5657	1	a	WAY too much fun to pass up. The combinations that would describe this game are all fabulous apart, but even better when put together like this. Amazing. Just AMAZING. Entertainment for days at such a nice price.

4128	1	a	I never wanted to kill dinosaurs with a bow and arrow. Until now.
2635	1	a	Metascore is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This game is okay, fun to play and is entertaining. This is like CounterStrike, Left 4 Dead, Halo and, well, Dinosaurs, all wrapped into one. In my opinion, this scores an 7.5-8/10.
5335	1	a	Join random server first time playing. Was instantly thrown up and eaten by T-rex. 11/10
1183	1	a	i BEEP love this game like holy BEEP this BEEP game is so BEEP good I BEEP recomend this to all you BEEP people out there so BEEP get this BEEP game and if you don't I will BEEP you up and BEEP you in the BEEP with my BEEP so get get this......BEEP
2753	1	a	Very good Dinosaur Horde game even though there are other modes most players choose to play either survival or conquest. There are three classes in the game and each has a special ability the Assault class has a jet pack that allows him to go reach higher areas easier than other classes, the Support class has a healing gun that should be self explanitory although with a certain upgrade it can damage enemies and repair turrets, vehicles, and generators, and the Recon class can go you guessed it invisible. Gameplay is nice no glitches unless you have a bad internet connection so check your connection before you play any mode. Weapon choice is decent in this game with one assault rifles, two sub machine guns, two light machine guns, two shotguns, two melee weapons, three sniper rifles, and a plethora of pistols which can be bought in temporarily in any game mode and if you die you lose them but if you remember where you died or you use a custom made loadout from the weapons you've unlocked. Now onto the special weapons better known as (to seasoned players at least) adrenaline weapons which can be unlocked each class has two and a universal adrenaline weapon that can be used by all three classes which is a bow yeah a bow what are the odds; The assualt can use a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher, support can use a flamethrower and a chain gun, and the recon can use a laser rifle and a energy carbine. Customization is really the only low point in the game unless you have money with the choice to only change the skin of a weapon when you start the game you have two armor and weapon skin colors black or purple you have to buy more aromor and weapons skins except for one for that one you just have to get 75 achievements for it. There are helmets in the game with one being unlocked after getting 50 achievements but like the armor and weapon skins they have to be bought as well. Taunts are in the same boat as weapon and armor colors so yeah it's more of a pay to look good kind of game. The community in the game is also very quiet not many will use the in game chat function but no one will randomly start insulting someone so it's about 50/50. Final Verdict a 7/10 for hours of fun in survival and conquest, decent weapon choice, and the fact that when a class reaches level 60 that class has unlocked every weapon that is best suited to them do this for every class and you will have 10 weapons unlocked and ready to use for any class it loses points for mediocre community, low customization, no story what so ever, and the fact that you can't unlock every weapon
1610	1	a	One of my friends let me drive a mech onto the back of a jet, then we went around and murdered a ton of T-rex's. Then I got hit with a rock and fell 75 feet to the ground. Got out of the mech, and started flying around in a jetpack with a minigun and a rocket launcher.  Play this game, its only a 1.00$
3095	1	a	Lag is horrible, but a good game in actual gameplay.
1074	1	a	I bought this game, laugh and tears, looking for a reason to live. I then proceeded to download the 2 mb of joy this gem has, and clicked install. At first, I was astonished, stunned in front of such graphics. I was in the main menu, in the space shuttle. I bought this game expecting nothing, but it was so big. I have no further need to buy No Man's Sky, this game has it all. Alien tractor poop with physics of gamemaker 2003, I still don't know how I could be more amazed by such a game in the next years. This game has revolutionized the industry of gaming, and renamed the whole concept of fun. As an ex-Christian, I have to admit I changed my religion, to BEEP. This living creature gives me chill everytime I open it. It's a tunnel of fun which leads to confidence and creativity. Before BEEP, my life had no meaning and sense, but I now follow the true life that other people would be jealous of. I often post screenshots of BEEP on my facebook page, but it seems like no one else likes BEEP as much as I do, which is why I think it is the greatest spiritual presence I could follow.  If you are reading this, I am truely greateful for you, because your life can get meaning with the simple ''Add to cart'' button.   This game is a masterpiece, and I will forever be happy that BIG FAT ALIEN released this incredible pearl.
1718	1	a	A cooperative, wave survival, class based FPS that forgoes pomp and circumstance for a more pick-up-and-play kind of experience. Similar to games like Killing floor, but with dinos instead of zambos. You fight little dinos, get better weapons, upgrades and perks, collect xp to strengthen 1 of 3 classes, fight big dinos, get killed, rage quit, drink heavily, rinse and repeat.  The game is a little clunky at times, but it's solid fun with frands for just a buck.
4190	0	a	I couldn't get the game to work. My beast machine couldn't handle Orion Dino horde.
737	1	a	There are a few negative moments with this game like, some of the voice acting. But If you do like puzzle solving and classic point a click games, than give this one a try. These classic type of games are few and between. I feel that some people weren't giving this one a better chance. Story line is pretty simply, you are a detective solving a possible murder. Characters in game are some what interesting, but will get boring after awhile talking to them. And the setting in game could have been worked on more. Breakdown - Graphics: 2/5, sound 3/5, fun factor 3/5, difficulty 3/5, controls 4/5.
2937	0	a	im not gonna waste my time telling you how bad this game is, but its so poorly made I could not join or start a game.
4674	1	a	Similar to Killing Floor.
679	1	a	Surprisingly interesting game of cards. Though, everything else in it sucks )))
6112	1	a	A friend bought this game for me and two other friends.  Within 5 minutes we had our first hard crash.  10/10 IGN
6110	1	a	Straight up, good fun. Shoot dinos, cry over a T-rex tossing your beautiful buggy into a cliff before opening you up like a can of tuna. Place revenge on said T-rex with a turret and your entire rocket supply. Alot of fun, best with friends. For $1, just get the 4 pack bundle and bring people with you. You wont regret it.
688	1	a	This game surprised me. It is a fun combination of genres.
154	1	a	 'like GTA but with tentacle powers'
5653	1	a	Has evolve's monsters and halo's guns and AC:Unity's glitches MOST ORIGINAL GAME  10/10
3207	1	a	A great time-sink game.
522	1	a	Sort of ridiculous, sort of ridiculously fun. Lots of criticisms comparing it to Infamous and other games. Really, it's a good sandbox super powered game with villains, conspiracies, biowarfare, and an amoral inhuman protagonist.   I've had a ridiculous amount of fun with it anyway.  The only caveat is the end-boss is ridiculously unenjoyable.
2311	1	a	This game is Titanfall, Advanced Warfare, Halo 4, Crisis 3, Far Cry 4, and GTA V combined. As a matter of fact, all of those game copied this one game. This game is the best game i've ever played in my 15 year experience of playing video games. Even better than half life 2. Who needs Half Life 3, when you have Orion: Prelude. Best game, hands down.
2541	1	a	i wasnt really sure about this game...... BUT â¥â¥â¥â¥ IT WAS 99 CENTS! (on a more serious note its a good game for 99 cents)
1923	0	a	Toxic Community:  I thought hey, it's only $.99 so I'll check it out. The gameplay is great, graphics are okay. But it's the people you play with that make the game what it is. Within my first five games. I was consistently told to gtfo. If you're wondering why the recent reviews are 'mixed.' Then you might be part of the problem. Not the experience I was expecting out of a dollar purchase.
2825	1	a	It's $0.99 for endless dinosaur kills :D, what more could you hope to ask for? Killing dinosaurs in real life isn't even close to the amount of fun you'll have in this game!
6259	1	a	Realy good.3 years of suporting.Low price+good game.Its posible 
6215	1	a	Game is very cheap and is fun and works well for its price!
5717	0	a	The game, though enjoyable, has its flaws. For one, it can't run AT ALL on any computer that isn't high-end. Therefore, I am unable to write a suitable review for it. If you have a high-end computer, good for you. If not (I'm assuming most of you don't...) don't waste your money. Orion: Prelude gets a 4/10.
2418	1	a	It's a little silly, a little janky and borderline broken in spots, but damn if it isn't fun. :) Worth $15 and a no-brainer if it goes on sale. Also, the recently re-worked Conquest mode (Dec. 2013 Arctic Update) is a blast if you've got a few hours to play through it and a few friends to play it with.
1609	1	a	  You can't go wrong with that tag.
948	1	a	LOVED Shank 2, never played Shank (Is there a Shank). Oh well this game was fun and action packed from beginning to end and it was a great difficultly level for this 40 year old gamer. I have really been enjoying these side scroller games alot as I enjoyed Ninja Scroll just as much. This one was a lot less on the stealth and much more on the action. As an 80's kid who grew up on kick @ss action movies like Rambo this one was right up my alley!
6093	0	a	This game sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 0/10
4847	0	a	Don't waste your money on this one, the devs went over to another title... again.  We will probably see more re-releases of this game in the future.    
4224	1	a	Just about the best game that I've ever played. Graphics are on par with Assassin's Creed Unity and overall gameplay is above and beyond anything I've seen in the last decade.   I did play it under a different name. Dino Hoard. And it was great. I recommeneded it too all of my friends and they all played it for 2 hours each.  If I had a dollar to buy this game. I would.
151	1	a	What may seem like your average game is in fact a New York City simulator from 2009. As any New Yorker would, you can: - Chase taxis - Elbow black people - Dismemeber minorities - Get shot at by law enforcement - Fall out of tall buildings - Get run over by tanks - Get minimum wage slave labour in clearing bright red boils off of buildings for the military - Get shot at as thanks for saving lives - Run across a shrunken central park - Flee from flying things - Vandalise water towers - Beat back mindless, diseased hordes in times square - Sniff out tourists to devour - Catch leprosy - Forget that Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx exist And this only scrapes the surface! This game finally fills the gap in the need for a good game that simulates daily life in New York City. I'm glad the American goverment shows the world how it deals with Swine Flu
459	1	a	Take all the powers of the various zombies from L4D/L4D2.  Shove them into one cranky little hoodrat.  Give said hoodrat amnesia and a serious hate-on for public property and the military.  Proceed to Parkour destructively around an infected NYC.  ????  [PROTOTYPE.]
6445	1	a	Would not recommend it at full price, but 0,99â¬ is hard to argue with. Its equal to what you would give to beggars or musicians on the street, or hell, even less.  And I have to say, it's a pretty fun game!  Sure it has its bugs and its mediocre at best, but nevertheless, it actually is a nice game to play together with your friends, just mowing down those evil dinosaur â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!!1  So, buy it while it's 93% (93%!!111) off and have a great time! :]
5195	1	a	this game is only 0,89 cent . For that kind of money this game is really good i've seen a lot of games for 30\40 dollars that are way worst . This game is really fun to play with friends so i reccomend it a lot and it still has a lot of poeple playing it
3367	1	a	Halo and dinosaurs?! This game is sort of like Halo but with waves of dinosaur killing. Its a pretty cheap game and fun with friends. When it is on sale get it!
4734	1	a	i love this game the feel and desin is uique and awesoe (not good at spelling so dont judge and my keyboard sucks)
2079	1	a	It's rough. It's buggy. It runs like crap. The resolution is grainy, the music is repetitive, an you always, ALWAYS lose connection at the most horrible times. But you know what? It's only ONE freaking dollar. And for that one dollar, you will get some of the rootinest, tootinest, dino-blasting fun ever seen in a video game.  There are only a handful of different game modes, most of which I honestly haven't tried. The tiny bit I've experienced of the PVP was terrible. Unfun, frustrating, and faaaaaar outclassed by pretty much every other multiplayer FPS ever made. But really, who plays this game for the PVP? It's all about those dinos, mayn. And wow, are the dinos fun.  The two game modes I play the most often, Conquest and Survival, pit you and of team of up to 5 other players/bots as you fight to defend your power generator from hordes of ravenous prehistoric monstrosities. There's no story. There's no explanation for why the herbivores and carnivores are working together and not eating each other. But, honestly, this game doesn't NEED a story. Just don't think too hard and shoot dinos. It's awesome.   The gunplay is quite smooth and incredibly satisfying. Blast a raptor's head with a shotgun and it freakin' EXPLODES, splattering bits of brain all over your stylish uniform. Drive a tank up to a T-rex's butt and fire a super-high powered explosive round directly into its crotch, obliterating it mere moments before it's about to devour your teammate. So awesome!   The best parts of this game are the moments you experience while playing, these little things that stick with you long after you turn off your computer. That time I leaped out of my helicopter to revive my fallen teammate, getting him to his feet and out of the way of a Spinosaurus before flying away and unleashing a barrage of missiles into its side. That time I used my flamethrower to keep an entire swarm of raptors away from the generator while my team respawned. That time I cleared an entire group of dinos using only a knife. It's these things that make you feel like an unstoppable lizard-slayin' hero.  TL;DR, this game has a lot of issues, but it's only one dollar and you could easily get at least 20 hours out of it at the minimum. Really, really good fun.  8/10    As a unrepentant dinosaur nerd, there are a few things I have problems with in this game's portrayal of its prehistoric creatures. First of all, they put two pterosaurs into the game, a rhamphorhynchus and a pteranodon. They called the rhamphorhynchus a rhamphorhyncus (which I have much respect for), but then they went and called the pteranodon a pterodactyl? What?? They also refer to them as dinosaurs, which they are not, they're actually flying reptiles that are barely related to dinosaurs. It also refers to a Deinosuchus as a dinosaur, and, well, its not a dino, just a big crocodile.  Its portrayal of the Dilophosaurus is more accurate than most other peoples, but the thing still spits acid. Guys. There is absolutely zero eveidence that in real life these things spit acid. STOP MAKING THEM SPIT ACID!  And that's it. Great game. Good game. Go play, now. Trust me, it's worth all 99 of the pennies you pay for it. 
100	1	a	This game taught us to love our sister :v
4807	0	a	This game is only really worth it to play with friends. Even then its way too glitchy for my taste coupled with poor gameplay. I only put the number of hours I did because me and a friend turned the difficulty high up and laughed at the newer players getting slaughtered by an ocean of meat and teeth.  Would it be worth trying out? Maybe. But I would not recommend it unless you want to play a game with cartoon stupid enemy ai, cartoon bobble-head accessories seen on players, and a musical number that repeats itself so much that I have to listen to heavy metal to get it out of my head.  Oh yes and the Rex himself likes to throw giant boulders at you with his mouth
1838	1	a	I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge.   If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun).   There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.
3453	1	a	Don't listen to the star ratings. This game is one of my favorite games on steam. This game is awsome!!!!!!
3734	0	a	This game is awful. Every aspect is awful. I think all these positive reviews must be fake. srsly...
3423	1	a	:) Yes, for a dollar, yes. :)  few servers but that could change in the begining few years back it was not all that but now i reinstalled and man i had fun, remainds me of small planetside2 with DINOS, with killing floor layout kinda. its a bit clunky on a few areas but if u like the above games im sure you'll find this to be fun for a while.   
6406	0	a	this game was horrible. The graphics were crap, and the gameplay in general was just bs.
4297	0	a	the graphics are bad alot of lags the ingame skins cost actual money to purchase and this game is just boring it has no plot and no consept except playing with friends and if you dont have at least 3 more friends that play this game this game is just boring
4402	0	a	Well you watch new vids, you see the price and look for reviews. You can imagine this game would be nice to play. Even for just few mins of fun... but no.  Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.
1227	1	a	Bought it on sale for the cards.
5371	1	a	THIS IS THE AWESOME! I know this comment isn't really the helpfull. But it is true.
3559	1	a	I just got to Say this is one of the best 99 cent or something and 6 day free dino Game 10/10 i enjoy and it even let's You play as a Dinosaur How epic? am i right!
4424	1	a	I highly recomend this game for thoose who have some good friends and they want to do something not too serous their weekends. Otherwise I recomend you to go away
4373	0	a	Not very addictive, unsure what I had to do*.
4874	0	a	poorly optimized
2737	1	a	You shoot dinosaurs. 10/10 IGN
4920	1	a	I am a stegosaurus!  But for real, this game is pure amazeballs. They got ya covered with all the cool stuff: -Dino's -Mechs -Rocket launchers -Overpowered compound bows -Tanks -Helicopters (?) -BABY DINOSAURS -NAZI BABY DINOSAURS (If your imagination is big enough) -Lightsabers -Pizza (Still waiting though...) -Achievements for just about everything  This game is a must try since it's even free now! (It used to be 1 Buck which was still amazingly cheap)
98	1	a	Story's great, but the cutscenes are short and explicitly to the point. Also, the game can be very unforgiving at times, and the first playthrough can be a hassle even on the easiest difficulty. Overall graphics are okay, but it takes somewhat of a penalty because you could probably count the amount of different generic NPC models on two hands. However, what makes this game worth the 20 bucks is the sandboxing. Plug in some headphones and just parkour around Manhattan, consume an army man and help take down an infected hive, hunt for collectibles, go on a zombie killing spree, play fetch with living people, troll the military, invade a base stealthily or guns blazing, go postal with a rifle in a civilian zone, hijack a helicopter and shoot at tanks, hijack a tank and shoot at helicopters, whip out your claws and slice people in half, eat living things until your hunger is satisfied, or do various 'events' around the city (races, gliding to a specific target, war events, and just flat out murder events). There's no shortage of fun to be had. This game is amazing for killing time AND blowing off steam. You can play it for 15 minutes at a time, or 5 hours at a time. It's the kind of game you can't really ever get tired of. My only real qualm with the game is that there's too many tanks and helicopters that spawn in. You have to be extremely careful about screwing around on foot, especially after you've beaten the story, because tanks will spawn wherever you are and even if they're far away on the minimap, they'll converge towards you and wipe out what little fun you thought you could have. And don't even think about taking on the tanks, because that'll just make more of them spawn, and a strike team is almost guaranteed to be called in as well (and another one, and another one, if your wanted level persists). Then if you want to hijack a tank, you'll get to enjoy it for maybe a minute before enough hostile tanks have chipped away your health. Likewise with a helicopter among other helicopters. Basically, vehicles take away the fun from the game and I wish there was some way to disable them, but unfortunately there isn't.
6115	1	a	Do not buy this game.  It may be 1 dollar but the cost of Chemotherapy isn't worth it.
