1	1	a	This game is a good old fashioned rail shooter that was decently executed. Its bright and colorful, and fast paced.  However this is ZERO support for this game, and if you use dual monitors the game will crash. You will have to disable a monitor to play.  I suggest a 360 gamepad to play.
3	1	a	A great little game that'll be of great joy to anyone who played old-school rail shooters. You're a stalwart human space hero fighting against the evil Skurgian aliens. Blow up enemy spaceships and enjoy alien warlords shaking their fist at the 'pathetic human scum'. Have I made my point yet? Great little game, takes about 45 minutes across nine levels, highly recommend.
5	1	a	Decent-ish. Difficult to recommend one way or the other. Poor resolution and gamepad support, but the basic gameplay is some fun starfox-like business. It's quite pretty, although the gameplay is not quite as nuanced as its contemporaries (sin and punishment 2?).  Still, compared to Yar's Revenge, Aces of the Galaxy is good, and might be the best on-rails shmups on Steam, if that's your fancy.
7	1	a	running windows 7 w/a 360 controller and game runs perfect. Fast, colorful on rails shooter. Old school fun.
10	0	a	It seems cool, it seems nice, but it's a trap. It's not close from being a solid platformer. The music is nice, I must say, but the game is deadly short and Storm is not that easy to control. All the nice mechanics are in the bonus levels. There are some cool parts in the game that are hommages to older games.  It's not worth 5$ at all in my humble opinion.
9	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a variation of the saying â€œa tempest in a teacupâ€ which really means taking a small event and blowing it out of proportion. Since it means making something out of nothing, Iâ€™m really struggling with why youâ€™d name your game that. Good news though, the title is really the only thing about this game thatâ€™s not awesome. And thatâ€™s worth making a bit of a fuss over.  Storm in a Teacupâ€™s controls are pretty straightforward. There are controls to move left and right and then a button to jump, though itâ€™s really more of a take flight kind of motion. You have a charge meter that starts to deplete the second you tap the button and take off. Once the bar runs out you start falling back to the ground and the meter refills. You can double tap to boost higher, and building up speed before launching will definitely send you further.  Youâ€™ll use this jump to navigate obstacles and avoid pitfalls, collecting keys and triggering little contraptions to move your way through the various levels. So really, all the standard tropes youâ€™d find in any platformer, except it puts a heavily reliance on its use of physics in the game world. As such, you could safely say the game took some of its inspiration from titles like Little Big Planet. Because both you and the objects you interact with are supposed to convey weight and momentum.   This is one of those cases where the game seems to have been changed in order to accommodate a witty title. Why is the character onscreen named â€œStormâ€ and why does he fly around in a teacup? Cause it fits the name of the game. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it works gameplay wise, itâ€™s just that it makes zero sense in the game world or reality.  Speaking of â€œgame worldâ€ Storm in a Teacup continually dazzles with its style, looking like something a child would dream up. Mean dark clouds have sinister frowns, platforms are tied up by rope, and some enemies look like theyâ€™re made out of cardboard. Itâ€™s adorable and trippy all at the same time.  But donâ€™t be fooled by the cute look of the world, this game gets hard with a capital H. Storm in a Teacup will look to test even the most veteran platform gamerâ€™s skill and patience. Luckily the game is never unfair about it, and youâ€™ll never find yourself in a place where you canâ€™t see because of a bad camera or faulty level design. You can always see what you need to do, itâ€™s just a matter of making it happen.  With the exception of the name, which is cute, but when taken at itâ€™s meaning does a disservice to the game, I have nothing bad to say about Storm in a Teacup. Itâ€™s gorgeous, controls well and offers a good solid challenge. Iâ€™ve played a lot of games that Iâ€™d consider a tempest in a teapot, but Storm in a Teacup isnâ€™t one of them.
11	1	a	This game is a perfect game for kids. I played this with my 4 year old and my 8 year old and they loved it. It can be tough at times, but most of this game is forgiving. It's a typical platforming game with a cool floating/soaring gimmick attached to it. It takes a bit to get used to, but once you get the hang of it the game itself is pretty simple. The graphics aren't anything to really brag about, but they fit the gameplay. Overall, a great game to play with your kids. If you are an adult, you might lose interest from its simplicity. Even the achievements are simple.
12	0	a	I genuinely feel bad about this review. I don't recommend this game, and yet, I do. I did not particularly love my time with this game, but I have family members who would. Its charms were fairly lost on me, but I have no problem imagining that others would be completely absorbed.  The reason for my conflicting emotions is that this game does not have any specific failings. It is enormously adorable, has a great visual style, pretty tight controls (including controller support), a charmingly cute soundtrack, and simple level design / gameplay.  The only real problem is that it is not captivating at all. It is spectacularly simple, and fairly repetitive. I could have kept playing without really forcing myself, but I also would have been just as happy to stop playing and turn on an old rerun of Top Gear.  So, I'm torn. Do I review a game for how I could see others taking its charms? Or, rather, do I review a game with my own personal opinion of it? I tend to lean more towards the personal aspect of reviews, so that's why I chose not to recommend it.  It's not that I think it's stupid. It is cute, it is easy to play, and it is incredibly cheap. If you have a young child in the house, they will probably love this game. In fact, I will be recommending this to my father, since he loves buying games for my nephews to play when they visit. I tend to like my sidescrollers with a bit more substance, however. Give me Cave Story+, Chasm, Guacamelee, or any 2D Castlevania any day of the week.  Take this all with a grain of salt, of course. If the video in the game store looks interesting to you, give it a try. You have only $5 to lose, and you can barely buy a burrito for that much any more.
13	0	a	The best thing you can say is that this game is incredibly average. Just another mediocre platformer like hundreds of thousands of others. No special and interesting ideas, no cool/spooky/funny story and nothing that would make you improvise while playing. Gameplay is very forgiving so its good for kids or if you look for easy game.
13	1	a	This is really quite a sweet little game, very relaxing. There's challenge if you want it, in beating each level first time, but it can be played slowly and in bits too. Quite fun!
15	1	a	Decent platformer, worth getting in a sale/bundle.
17	1	a	A fun 2D platformer that provides sufficient challenges to frustrate yet reward the player at the same time.  The game is easy to play bar from one or two of the later levels that see a difficulty spike.  Trying to achieve a perfect score on every level kept me coming back for more, yet it never felt like a chore; more like a fun way to further enjoy the game.
19	1	a	Storm in a Teacup is a nice little platformer with puzzle elements; the levels are short enough to play on coffee breaks, and there's a nice amount of variation in backgrounds, game elements, and throwbacks to classic games like Space Invaders. It runs on a 2D physics engine meaning there's a lot of things bouncing and swinging off of each other; this gets especially interesting in the bonus levels that can turn sideways and upside down. Once you've completed each level, you can try to do it again finding a hidden object and without dying, to get extra rewards (well, achievements).  The downside is that there's only one song in the game, which may get repetitive after awhile. There's no story to speak of, and not a lot of replay value. Still, the game is well worth a shot.
21	1	a	Nice little game, good getaway from all these AAA titles. Also, its my first perfected game on Steam :D
14	0	a	I really dont reccommend this game, it was a waste of money when i bought it, very repetitive gameplay, one whole music track thats just 20 seconds of music looped, and just in general an extremely boring game:/
23	1	a	If you like mobile games, but wish they were less mobile, then this game is for you, I guess.
25	1	a	Great for competitive play. Worth the 74 cents I spent on it.
15	0	a	It's... really bloody basic. It looks kinda cool, but the gameplay is just way too simple. So... just like every other iOS game!
16	0	a	Quite boring.
27	1	a	Cute platformer with cute graphics. I don't really understand why they chose a teacup but that's not really important. It took me around 4 hours to get perfect in all the game modes and I had a lot of fun completing all of them. There's really nice and unique level design thoughout the game. For the price of ~4â‚¬ I will happily recommend this game.
29	1	a	This game gives me nightmares
31	1	a	If Super Mario 3 and Braid had a baby, this game would be it LOL....Dodge the madbro clouds of firey doom, jump over the buzz saws of death, and flying/gliding through death traps...this game is pretty cool. ( ps - don't fall in the lava XD )
19	0	a	This looks awesome but it deosn't. Repetitive and annoying music. Gameplay is bad. It should be a free flash game. Waste of money!
20	0	a	Repetitive... good for a mobile, got this game in a bundle so.. 6/10
21	0	a	This was the most painful 92 minutes of my life. It is not only locked at 30fps, but it makes no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sense. Why is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a teacup? What is the premise of this game? Why is he so slick? But most importantly, why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would anyone pay $5 for this peice of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I am physically sore from the stres this game has put me through. I am fairly sure that i have lost %50 of my hair. I need compensation for this, but mostly, i need answers. 
22	0	a	This game gave me progeria.
23	0	a	The simplest and least-adorned iOS/Android 'worthy' side-scroller that I've finished on Steam. An appropriate challenge level and presentation for young children, who are probably much much better than me at video games. But hey, at least it ran on my impossibly unhappy video card!
33	1	a	This is such a cute little awesome game, I highly recommend it!
35	1	a	This isn't really a POSITIVE recommendation. It's more of a 'Beware of buying this' recommendation.  First of all, this game is SUPER easy. I'm thinking it was probably developed with 10-13 year olds in mind. As in, if you have a 10-13 year old, they MIGHT find this game challenging (maybe), but you certainly won't. The only way you'll find this even remotely challenging is if your fingers don't work, for some reason, and you're forced to play with your toes and/or tongue.  That being said, it is kind of cute, though. The levels start out super bland, but as you advance through the levels, the puzzles and gameplay turn more and more clever and amusing, although still not any more challenging.  I'm betting a good gamer could finish the whole game in about half an hour. I guess that's why it's only 5 bucks.  I'd suggest getting it if you're extremely bored and have nothing else to do and want a good way to waste half an hour. DO NOT expect a hard game, though.
37	1	a	Game of the century!!!!!!! 100/100 10/10 5/5 1/1 PERFECT SCORES OMG YES SO GOOD PLEASE BUY. THIS GAME SUPPORTS SLAVERY. THIS GAME ADVERTISES NUCLEAR WAR. THIS GAME RECOMMENDS DRUG USE, SPECIFICALLY ECSTASY. THIS GAME IS LITERALLY A BAG OF RAINBOWS STUCK IN A HAIRY GORRILA â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. THIS GAME IS SO GOOD THAT I BOUGHT THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AFRICA BECAUSE IT'S SO NUTRITIONAL. GREAT GAME. YES. MUCH BUY. VERY GOOD.
39	1	a	With many similarites to 'Little Big Planet', this cute classic platform game has you running and jumping around crayon-drawn environments with moving obstacles, collecting sugar-cubes and stickers before finding your way out of the level. 'Storm in a Teacup' also has lots of Steam achievements and is definitely worth every penny of its tiny price tag.
41	1	a	A very short platformer game. It's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. I went through all the levels in approximately 90 minutes. I finished a quarter of them with perfect score, but I don't really see any reason to return to the rest and try to improve. All the same with the bonus levels.   The game itself is pretty decent and the difficulty is quite okay. The physics sometimes behave a little erratically, and/or counterintuitively, but at least the behaviour is consistent, so once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.   Overall, the game is not bad, but I suggest you go and play some Tobe's Vertical Adventure instead.
43	1	a	Super Meat Boy, as imagined by Disney. Don't be deceived by the looks, this game is ruthless.
45	1	a	If, like me, you dream of piloting a giant tea cup, through a hazardous land, collecting sugar cubes for ... tea, presumably. Then this is basically not to be missed. Even if you have at best an impartial attitude towards oversized tea cups and the collection of sugar cubes, it's hard not to recommend this one. I imagine the experience of playing this for such a person to be something of a spirtual awakening. The soundtrack alone is worth the money, infact if anybody knows where I can get a CD copy of it to play in my car please post below. I should mention though in this review it's probably not suitable for youngsters due to the obvious adult themes and content.
47	1	a	Not quite worth the money it is, but it's a fun little game!
49	1	a	Fun game, not to hard to 100% if you're into that. The game's style is cute and I would describe it as a Super Meat Boy for kiddies. Buy it if you have a boring weekend!
51	1	a	Appart from the classics, I'm not much of a fan of platformers, but this one is pretty good! Appart from the fact that the art is crap (I know it's obviously aimed at kids but even then it's still pretty poor) the gameplay is really good and it's very addicting! I got it in a â™¥â™¥â™¥ pack otherwise I probably wouldn't of picked it up myself!
26	0	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? yes 420/teapot   if you buy this game with real money re-evaluate your life
53	1	a	I love this game! I had a lot of fun playing this game! I totally recommend!
28	0	a	This game belongs on an iPhone, and it's a bad port for PC. The music is repetitive and the controls are floaty.
55	1	a	Should be a free game i guess...  But well its ok to play it with your kids or little cousins.  Too much hearts and stuff like that going on tho -.-
57	1	a	The game is fun and challenging without being frustrating. I recommend it. There is nothing that I disliked.
59	1	a	And incredibly adorable point and click game with a wonderful aesthetic and puzzles ranging from simple to complex.
61	1	a	Short and sweet. The handmade 'graphics' are beautiful. The puzzles feel fresh. Only significant critique is that it is too short.
63	1	a	I wasn't sure whether or not to recommend this game. In the end, I decided to recommend it. Why? Because even though it was extemely short, it was heaps of fun and quite challenging.  Pros: - Visually pleasing - very nice art which looks like a lot of effort has been put into it. - Unique puzzles. - Pleasant music. - Interesting and fun gameplay.  Cons - Extemely short - felt more like a demo than an actual game. - Overpriced - very expensive for what you get. Get it while it's on sale.  If you like point and click puzzle adventure games, I would recommend that you buy this. However, it is not worth it at full price, so I would say wait for it to go on sale. :)
65	1	a	First off: this is a game about the aesthetic. The hand-made set and camera moves makes this game among the prettiest I've ever played. It's also super short, serving as a taster for the upcoming Lumino City, made in the same handcrafted way - I personally can't wait to explore a bigger world that's this beautiful.  Niggles: - It sucks that the resolution is so low. It takes away from the awesomeness of the visuals, which is what the game's about in the first place. - The puzzles aren't that clever or anything. But it's a point and click, so what can one expect.  It's cheap. It's beautiful. Buy it.
67	1	a	Lume is a very short yet very well executed adventure game. The graphics are original, supposedly made entirely of cardboard, and the puzzles aren't too difficult to turn people away. You are a little girl looking for her grandfather and you have to figure out how to turn on the lights in order to find him. Very cute little game, though very very short. A sequel was just released recently, and I hope that when the price is right that I will get that in order to see the story continue.
69	1	a	A short little game with a few puzzles and beautiful art. The puzzles are quite challenging, but the relaxing piano music will help you solve them :)
71	1	a	music is very well. pleasant game
73	1	a	As beautifully-made as it is short, Lume is wonderful if brain-destroyingly difficult at times. I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of the puzzles, it got that difficult for me.  I would still reccommend this wholeheartedly, ALMOST to the point of taking it upon myself to offer a money-back guarantee of enjoyment. But I won't do that because that's just dumb. And it's not my job. And this isn't my game. And I'm broke. But it's still a game that's worth your money, even if just to tide you over until Lumino City drops.
75	1	a	A nice designed adventure puzzle, indie game. With an interesting variety of puzzles to solve. Simple story, cute characters, nice colors, I really loved the idea of making the environment look like made of paper. The music is in loop, so if you start feeling frustrated by it, you can turn the sound off, however there are some music-puzzles to solve in some places.  The price is low enough to make this game worth buying. A very nice way to spend some time on, recommended for kids too, pretty sure they will love it!  The game is under development, so this atm incloudes only the 1st part of the story. Can't wait for the rest!
77	1	a	This was one of the first games I bought here, and I don't regret it. This game is very short - only a Part 1 in what I assume is an impending series - but a fun point-and-click adventure with some pleasing riddles and puzzles to solve. Not to mention that 'gorgeous' doesn't describe the way the game's set looks; I'm likely to replay it just to watch the camerawork, motion and scenery in action.  As mentioned above, it is definitely a Part 1; the game is extremely short, and that should be taken under consideration upon purchase. However it's sequel, Lumino City, is out now. I look forward to grabbing it and adding my review to this one.
79	1	a	Short but nice. I like the artstyle!
81	1	a	This is a tiny taste of a game. It is a very quick play-through and, honestly, at full price I would be a bit miffed. Thank goodness for Steam Sales! The animation is unique. I hope Part II is equally well done.
83	1	a	Very lovely visuals and mellow music, Lume produced interesting puzzles that created some challenges. The only feedback on what made it unsatifactory was that it was so short. But I look forward to playing it's sequal. I do not regret buying this game because I enjoyed the artwork and low level stress involved in playing it.
85	1	a	An adorable little puzzle game (the cardboard and paper backgrounds are amazing!) that is fun, with easy controls. The puzzles range from simple to relatively challenging, so your brain will not be lacking mental excercise once you're finished with it.
87	1	a	A cute little puzzle game, but very very VERY short. Recommended if you can pick it up super cheap.
89	1	a	This is an enjoyable indie game experience. Nice puzzles and graphics. Was very short though.
91	1	a	An adorable little point and click game where all the scenery was actually made in papercraft.
93	1	a	This game is fantastic! Fun puzzles and a fanciful animation style left me wanting more!
95	1	a	It's short, it's a fun puzzle game, it looks pretty, the music is good. It's not worth the $7, but if you see it on sale (it regularly goes down by around 70%) then pick it up.  Honestly, it's short. Like, an hour short.
97	1	a	Short and sweet.
99	1	a	This game is kinda easy in parts and then kinda hard in parts without warning and unfortunately it's a tad pricey for being so short.
101	1	a	For what it is, it's not bad.  If I had to critisise it on any point it would be that it's pretty short.  There's a sequel out now called Lumino City that I haven't played, so I don't know if it lasts longer and how much it adds to Lume's story.  The strongest point of this game is the paper cut-out look of it and if you like puzzlers you'll like this one.  Purely based on the length of this one, I'd say only grab it if it's on sale or if you don't mind it being short.
103	1	a	Lume is a little game, packed with several puzzles that you must solve. It took some time to get them all solved and some of them are quite tricky (especially the second locker). What I found the most interesting is the design: Lume is an indie game to behold, made for those who cares about aesthetics more than anything else. After installing and entering the game, my first reaction was 'you must be kidding me', because everything is filmed, all the scenario is handmade and the soundtrack is immersive...  It's a short game and, definitely, a beautiful revival of the adventure/point-and-click genre. I spent just Â¥299, after looking for some indie games with the same vibe of those made by Amanita Design (Machinarium, Botanicula, Samorost 2). If you like Indie Games, Puzzle, Adventure/Point-and-click and, most of all, you enjoy the art and music, Lume is a nice one. Already getting ready for Lumino City.
105	1	a	This is a great game so far- the beautiful environment and music really makes it a unique and breathtaking experience. My main complaint however, is that this flash game is in such a small window. It is almost like a mobile game, since the maxiumum window size is so small. It would be much better if it was in HD and I could full-screen it. Also, the clicking doesn't feel too natural. The way that you explore the environment around you could be improved.
107	1	a	wish this game was finished!!
109	1	a	love it puzzles not my thing had to look them up as I got stuck on them alot :-P
111	1	a	The main complaints seem to be about the shortness of the game verses the price. While I do agree that the price is a bit high for a very short game, I do recommend this game. There was only one really unintuitive puzzle (the cupboard under the sink. I DON'T GET IT!!) but the rest was a nice experience. There is not a lot of replayability so it's definitely better for younger kids who may get a bit more play time out of it. Though repetitive, the music is soft and unobtrusive and can easily be turned off if it starts bugging you. I understand the creators put a lot of heart and effort into this so I understand the price even if I disagree with it. If you can catch it on sale, get it for your kid.
113	1	a	Really really nice, though I must confess it is quite short. If you donÂ´t want to feel a bit ripped off buy the sequel LuminoCity instead which takes much longer to play through. Okay for reduced price though :)
115	1	a	BUY ON SALE  The game is cute, the puzzels interesting -- but over all it is SHORT. The game really feels more like an intro chapter than a complete game.   I'm sort of ambivalant on whether or not the fantastic art makes up for the less than an hour game play. The story line is more like a story premis since you don't actually get anywhere. But I did have fun, so buy it but not at full price.
117	1	a	It is a fun game
119	1	a	This is a great game so far- the beautiful environment and music really makes it a unique and breathtaking experience. My main complaint however, is that this flash game is in such a small window. It is almost like a mobile game, since the maxiumum window size is so small. It would be much better if it was in HD and I could full-screen it. Also, the clicking doesn't feel too natural. The way that you explore the environment around you could be improved.
121	1	a	Lume is a cute little game with charm. I've honestly never seen another game like it. The aesthetic is definitely there, and the puzzles were fun and challenging. However, it almost feels more like a demo than a full-fledged game. I do recommend Lume, but I would wait for it to be on sale before buying as it's quite short and I don't believe there's enough content to justify the $5.99 Steam is asking for.
123	1	a	I understand the negative reviews. 6 bucks IS a fair amount for such a short game, it's only about an hour and a half long, and its more of a setup for a yet to be released sequal called Lumino City. Despite all of this, I reccomend getting this game on sale. The art style is unique, and the paper art style of the characters clashing with the realistic background is actually very appealing to the eye. It is one of the cutest games I've ever played. Even more unique are the puzzles. I would recommend not using a guide to this game, it makes completing the game that much more satisfying, Overall, If you can get this game on sale, or you are willing to spend $6 on ad hour and a half of gameplay, I would definatley pick it up
125	1	a	It's a charming game with great puzzles. I got a little lost and had a little trouble here and there, but overall I was able to manage without explicit spoilers. This was also only part one! So if you loved it, go support the guys to get the full game!
127	1	a	Fun little puzzle game, certainly pretty and colorful. Very short though, short enough that it is disappointing because the game is over before it feels like it even starts.
129	1	a	Loved this puzzle game. It was challenging and different. Just wish it was longer.
131	1	a	Okay, I love puzzles that give you the most minimal hints to solve them. And for the first few puzzles Lume was pretty fun. But then I hit the piano lock puzzle and the cabinet puzzle. No hints. No whispers of hints. I had to unmute the game to hear the noises of the piano puzzle (the soundtrack is a really short loop and not that nice). Worst part was the ending. This game took me an hour to do. I'm so glad I only bought it for $1.74 and not the full $6.99. I'd never pay 7 bucks for this. I know it's only part 1 of however many other parts, but really, you're better off not doing this. This is why I'm wary about Indie games.
133	1	a	very nice, very short :)  If you can get it for a good price (75% sale or bundle) - take it! ;-)  Those people who completed it in 30 min are eighter a genius or they play it with opened walktrough :D (or at least they are not blind like me :D)
135	1	a	It's a beautiful game with an interesting look. The puzzles were easy, given enough thought, though the answers were not always obvious. My only complaint is that it was much too short. I know more episodes are due to come out, but I was able to beat it in 45 minutes (including cut scenes).

139	1	a	The first few puzzles are... difficult, but doable. One near the end is 100% grade-A crazypants. Don't feel bad about cheating to get under the sink. :-P
141	1	a	Pro : Game graphics are original, the game is challenging enough  Con : Given that the game can be finished within an hour, the price is really high

145	1	a	This game's charm and visual style is phenomenal... But the length (about half an hour for my trip through it) is extremely jarring. I guess I sort of expected more once I realized the game's most complicated puzzle involved me needing to brush up on my music reading skills (which took longer than the length of the game to read -- although this is still better than learning to count in D'ni...)
147	1	a	Pro : Game graphics are original, the game is challenging enough  Con : Given that the game can be finished within an hour, the price is really high
149	1	a	Very good thinking game. Love the puzzles... But kind of frustrating too sometimes :D
151	1	a	Nice short puzzle for everyone who enjoys a to tinker a bit. Made with love and features an original paper art!
153	1	a	Disappointing. Although the puzzles are enjoyable the game is very short and I wouldn't say the puzzles were challenging enough to warrent the game being worth much with the lack of a good story. I'd like to hope the next game has more in it but I don't feel safe in saying it will. It might be more other people's thing though, don't write it off without trying it yourself. I enjoyed myself a little, just not nearly as much as I had hoped.
155	1	a	Too short. Let's hope Part 2 et al. are free updates. It's a fun little game and the puzzles make you feel badass when you're done (if not frustrated at the obscurity), but Â£5 for 40 minutes of game isn't right. I feel ripped off, which is disappointing because it's a pretty game and I enjoyed the experience.  The biggest issue is I can spend Â£5 and get a better high that lasts a lot longer. Chocolate, man. The only way to fly.
157	1	a	Very very short and moderately difficult puzzle game. Approximately 30 to 40 minutes of play. Elegant, charming, and with an enjoyable aesthetic. Grab it for under $5 and it'll challenge and entertain.
159	1	a	Ok.... DO NOT pay full price for this game, you WILL regret it. I bought this as part of an indie royale bundle and I'm glad i did. This game took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to beat, and now that I know all the solutions. it should take no longer than 25 minutes. This game is part of some sort of series, consider this to be chapter one. It is nowhere near as satisfying as a point and click like machinarium. That being said, it's a nice little adventure game, with only a few unclear puzzles. The puzzles were logical, but some had a poor setup or were too difficult to connect if they were multi-room puzzles. The animation and transitional animations were great, and so were the short cinematics.  Do buy if it is part of a bundle or has a very low price. But just like 'trauma' it is way too short to pay full price for. But unlike trauma, you've most likely played a game like lume before.
161	1	a	Mrm, short. Way too short to even pay for it.
163	1	a	Extrmely!!!!!!! short. But the puzzles are way worth it. If you can solve them with the little hints they give you, then you are a genius. Overal 7/10. Gameplay, 2 hours.
165	1	a	When talking about Lume itâ€™s impossible not to bring up its length, so I might as well start with that. Lume is very short, especially considering its price. It took me an hour to complete, and thatâ€™s including stopping to admire the visuals, and I honestly canâ€™t see it taking much longer than that. You might draw it out to 90 minutes, but thatâ€™s about it. But if you look beyond that youâ€™ll find an absolutely charming and adorable game. There, I said it. Iâ€™m supposed to be cynical goddamit, but here I am calling a game â€˜adorableâ€™. But it is, it absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing is. Itâ€™s made out of cardboard for godâ€™s sake. CARDBOARD!  Yes, this game didnâ€™t take very long to win me over. Look at it though, itâ€™s gorgeous. Sure, there isnâ€™t much to see, but what you do see is incredible. I still canâ€™t get over the fact the gameâ€™s made out of cardboard. Man, this game made me grin like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing child, and I hate it for it. It is a puzzle game, though the puzzles are rather generic and simple. Still, some fun brainteasers, but I feel resentful towards them because they arenâ€™t made out of cardboard. In fact there isnâ€™t much that is made of cardboard because the area is very small and can be explored in a few minutes, meaning you backtrack a lot and most of the length is spent solving puzzles. The fact that you donâ€™t get much of the gameâ€™s best feature in a very short game is a bit of a problem, so itâ€™s hard to recommend at full price. I got it in a bundle which was perfect, but for a considerable discount Iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth experiencing. Then again, Iâ€™m all set for getting the sequel Lumino City (get it?), discounted or not, so maybe the price isnâ€™t so bad after all... Itâ€™s made of cardboard though, and thatâ€™s got to count for something, right? Besides, this game will charm the pants off even the most cynical of people, even if itâ€™s only for an hour.
167	1	a	Best puzzle game I have ever played
169	1	a	It is a 'sweet' puzzles game. Very short gameplay though. The way the environment is built is brilliant.
171	1	a	Bit pricey for such a short game, but enjoyable and cute and will work well as a full game. They should, whne the full game comes out, make this a free demo.
173	1	a	A charming little game, keep in mind though it is very short in the meaning of very few puzzles, but some of them are really headscratching mind-boggling, i had to use walkthrough because i was stuck at one point and i wanted to finish it. The game is only part 1 with more parts incoming. BUT from the looks of it, the other parts may or may not come. Definitely not worth the full price, think again. This is NOT like any of classic LucasArts adventure games, more like short mini game puzzles from the likes of mobile games, it is after all, a flash game lol.
175	1	a	In the ever-expanding gold mine of cheap yet insanely fun games on Steam, Lume is a dud. Beatenin less than an hour, the puzzles are simple and easy (with the exception of one very obscure solution). If I remember correctly, I got this game in a bundle with several others for around $6, which is actually the full price of this game now. I would advise to wait for a similar bundle or steam sale if this game really interests you.
177	1	a	A charming point and click puzzle game that's just under an hour. Only one of its puzzles is BS hard. Otherwise a cute and easy play.
179	1	a	It is an ok game - the music is relaxing but i struggled ti get into it as this is not my type of game. Would still recommend it though on the basis of its ambitions.
181	1	a	Lume was an interesting but too short game, the puzzles took some thought to solve and weren't too frustrating to figure out. The most disappointing part of this game is how incredibly short it was, it felt unfinished and lacked any conclusion. I recommend this game as long as you go in with the knowledge that the game is easy to finish in 3 hours.
183	1	a	The most impressive aspect of Lume is the visual presentation. That's not to denigrate the other aspects of the game, but the visual style is what makes this game unique. The world and main character are made of card board cut-outs and and and are flawlessly animated. The other aspects of the game are well done, too. The puzzles are tough and many considering the game only takes a little more than an hour to finish. The puzzles fit well into the story and environmental message theme of the game. Thankfully, the politics of this game aren't very preachy and instead offers a reasonably upbeat attitude towards making earth more ecologically sound. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.
185	1	a	You ( Lumi ) are stopping by your grandpa's house to see if hes around. however, with a partial shopping list reinstituted as a note spacifically for you tacked on the door, reveals that he is in town to see if he can be illuminated as to why there  there seems to be a lack of power. it seems that he wants to energize his own house, but has hit a snag, and wishes you to help him regain power with what you're able to find around the house. this sets you off on your sadly short, but quite touching 'adventure' around the property.  This is a point and click adventure, where you'll explore lumi's grampa's house in order to solve puzzles and acquire items to gain the materials needed to help your grandad to become more.. self reliant. power wise anyway. this is a heart warming, fun, and cheap title. it may only keep your attetion for about an hour and 10 minutes, if that, but there is a hint at more content being added later, so why not give it a try?
187	1	a	It is a fun game
189	1	a	A very cute game, although incredibly short; if you know what you are doing, it can take about 10 minutes. Aside fom the game play timing, I thought the puzzles were made (especially one lock puzzle) difficult simply because there was very little to go off of.  
191	1	a	10-minutes is all that it took for me to get hooked on this game. If you have played Curse of the Monkey Island, you might want to take a look at this. The graphics are surreal. The texture and colour palette, lighting and shadow, and the whole story of how a young protagonist who started off by visiting her grandfather's house spins off into a puzzle game like none other.  It doesn't require a high-end graphics card. It only requires an open mind.
193	1	a	Too many puzzle games rely on complexity--Critical Mass addicts you with absolute simplicity. If you've exercised you hand-eye coordination with FPSs and have a good mind for 3D objects, you'll love this game.
195	1	a	They weren't kidding when they wrote up the description for this little gem. Brutally simple to learn, simply brutal to master, Critical Mass is the kind of game literally anybody can just pick up and waste hours upon hours of their lives playing, all in a vain attempt to top the charts. And don't think for a second I mean any of that in a bad way. Far from it; Critical Mass possesses a fun, addictive quality rivaled only by the likes of Tetris and similar titles.  In case you still have doubts, bear in mind that this game only costs a measely two bucks, so it won't be a serious dent in your pocketbook even if you turn out to be one of the four or five people globally who don't enjoy it (you know who you are). With that in mind, what do you have to lose? I pride myself for being more discriminating than most when it comes to choosing which games to buy with a rather limited budget, so believe me when I say Critical Mass is a nearly fool-proof purchase!
197	1	a	This is a simple extension into the third dimension of a typical match-x game. You start with a vaguely cube shaped pile of blocks and then fire predetermined color blocks onto the mass attempting to connect at least four of a color, causing them to be removed. In it's base mode each fired block causes the mass to grow while matching blocks causes it to shrink. Take too long or fire too many blocks without clearing any and you'll reach critical mass and lose.  The interesting thing about this game is that at it's heart it seems to want to be a competitive game. In the base mode there are only 10 levels and they have to be completed in one sitting to get a final score and attempt to get on the leaderboard and this leaderboard seems to be what the developers hoped would keep you coming back. Personally I'm not really a fan of this type puzzle game and the competitive aspects are not a draw to me. If you enjoy doing something multiple times in an attempt to hone your skill then this will be well worth the price of entry. If, like me, you're looking for a more encapsulated experience then its probably best to move on.
199	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I don't want to have to think too hard, but still want to challenge myself. The controls are simple and easy to use even on a touch pad. This is one of my favorite mindless puzzle games to go to for relaxation. It is easy to get sucked in and just start a new game over and over again until you have spent hours on the game without realizing it.
201	1	a	I am usually not too much of a puzzle games guy, except maybe Tetris. But this game has really pulled me back into the genre. This is a game that I just keep finding myself playing. It's great to pass a little time. Plus I always want to replay it to try and exceed my previous score. The graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is nice. I got it for $0.49 during the Winter Sale. Worth way more than that. Bought two more copies as gifts. Give it a go. You won't be disappointed.
203	1	a	one of the best indie puzzle games i have played in a while! recommended!
205	1	a	This game is fun to play in short bursts. You have a cube and other cubes come flying at it, you match the colors to keep it from getting too big and exploding.
207	1	a	I must admit, that i got this game because i had 77 cents on steam! But, i din't expect such an addictive and fun game! The video and pictures might make the game seem hard, but it's easy. (at least the controls are) But, there are many so many challenging levels and addictive puzzles, that you want to come back for more! Never makes me bored! It's like the next gen tetris! I highly recommend this game! Get it while it's at it's cheapest! Btw, the music is AWESOME! What's better than placing blocks and watching cubes EXPLODE!
209	1	a	Critical Mass is a action puzzle-solving 3D game taking place in space, where you use the mouse buttons to rotate and place blocks. You start off with a cluster of cubes and your objective is to connect 4 or more, successfully make your way a little closer to zero.. or not and gradually it will start zooming in towards your inevitable fate. Sounds familiar? it's basically modern time tetris with a twist to it. My biggest problem with this game is the way the mechanics work, having everything in 3D can be very disorienting at times and given that you have the cursor pointing at an object isn't normally that hard but adding also that you're rotating the object at the same time makes it easy to misplace blocks which can be very annoying where you're playing the more time consuming levels.
211	1	a	This game was a lot more fun than i thought, i just bought it for the lolz from the steam winter sale 2013 because it was 0,50â‚¬ and i was quite suprised how fun it was. I would defienedly recommend it to anyone who just likes to relax and play 'easy' puzzles!
213	1	a	not a bad game, awesome music
215	1	a	Interesting little casual game.
217	1	a	The most fun i had in this was trying to survive... I was never good at Puzzle Games Especially games that have a Rubix Cube, Space design.  9.75/10
219	1	a	This game is quite simple, but is great for when your wifi breaks.
221	1	a	A frenetic match 3 puzzler painted with vibrant color and absorbing gameplay. The object is to simply eliminate the cubes in the playing field before the field reaches Critical Mass. It's cheap, it's great and it's worthy so why isn't it in your library?
223	1	a	The most fun i had in this was trying to survive... I was never good at Puzzle Games Especially games that have a Rubix Cube, Space design.  9.75/10
225	1	a	Great little puzzle game. If you can get it on sale, even better! :D
227	1	a	This is a good timewaster make sure to buy it if you got some extra $$$.  Needs more game modes though :|  7/10
229	1	a	This is a very fun puzzle game that really makes you use your brain to create a 3d tetris of blocks. 10 / 10 for price and value!
231	1	a	This game makes you think; if that wasn't enough...it makes you think.  Think about that.  What do you think about that?  You know what I think about that?  I think you should give it a try.  It's worth the investment.  It's like 3-d tetris in space.
233	1	a	A simple single block take on tetris to a new deminsion. Make this even more like tetris and then we'll talk.
235	1	a	66/100 Colour matching game, more of a 3D version, wish there where more stuff such as power ups or w/e.
237	1	a	so great....simple but makes you think :)
239	1	a	This is a fun 3D puzzler vaguely reminiscent of Tetrisphere and the puzzles from the Android game  Hero Forge .  Check out the demo.
241	1	a	My mass was rock hard critical after I played this game. Seriously though, it's a lot of fun
243	1	a	this game sometimes gets me quite annoyed but it's not the game's fault, it's just really hard at times ;) It is constantly installed on my computer and I play it for a while almost every week.. It is cheap and recommended.
245	1	a	This Was An Addicting Game
247	1	a	I dont have much to say about this game... It's not bad. 6/10
249	1	a	Most action packed adventure ever!                                                      (DON'T BUY THIS GAME! IT'S SO BAD!)
251	1	a	Fun game. Like 3D tetris... Good game for the money.
253	1	a	Challenging game and mind numbing, but it is a great and addicting game. I hate it when you place the block in the wrong place!
255	1	a	This action puzzle game pretty simple. Line up colours on a 3D point to destroy them a gain points. Fun, simple and cheap, but not much variety.  59/100
257	1	a	I like this game. It's not a great production, the background is the same all the time and the music is annoying, but it's cool and the game modes are creative.
259	1	a	Played 4 hours - i am a HARDCORE player, with 7 hours of gameplay you get the title of ELITE player in AMD gaming evolved.  Still it's nice - i enjoy the meditation mode. Recommend to buy it when it's on SALEs ONLY.
261	1	a	A fun puzzle game. Worth playing if you want something challenging.
263	1	a	Fun game. Like 3D tetris... Good game for the money.
265	1	a	OK WTF! The achievements are really buggy!!!
267	1	a	Tetris/Columns, but in 3D with you having no control over the slowly rotating chunk of blocks - all you can do is decide where to place the next coloured cube adjacent to another cube's side. If 4+ cubes of the same colour connect, they pop.  The lack of control of the orbit is an absolutely fantastic mechanic - it reduces the frustrating navigation other 3D block matches have suffered and allows the player to focus purely on placement.  Did I mention powerups too?  Absolute gem of a puzzler!
269	1	a	I love this game and I highly recommend that you buy this game. It is somewhat of a challenge, but it is really fun and the music is awesome. I give it a 10/10. Superb game!
271	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I get bored of shooters or other games. Very fun and challenging with rewarding online gameplay. There is no reason why you shouldn't pick it up for $1.99
273	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
275	1	a	Great game tons of fun and addicting as heck.
277	1	a	This game is quite fun, it builds up to a frenzied pace but doesn't leave you feeling brain drain. At the price of $2 you can't go wrong with it unless you hate having fun. I recommend it as both a casual play and as highly competitive at the same time. The better and faster you get at it the more fun it becomes.
279	1	a	Great title. Love it. Play it when I don't want to bother with more in-depth games.
281	1	a	The game is fun, and at such an inexpensive price, should be ownable by all.
283	1	a	Just bought it and i already like it. With the summer sale its a good game for only $1.25.
285	1	a	Well, something to have at hand when you don't know what to play and jsut want to  have some casual fun...... good little game
287	1	a	Dangerously addictive 3D Tetris-esque; requires decent graphics acceleration for good experience.
289	1	a	Wow... It was pretty difficult at first, but after a while I got the hang of it, A definite buy. I'll give it a 8/10
291	1	a	An excellent game. It doesn't do much but what it does, it does right. It's a great time waster and for 2â‚¬, i'd say it's a very fair deal.
293	1	a	Critical Mass is nothing more than what you would expect. Its a fun little game that you play for 15 minutes at a time. That being said it's still a good game and is a lot more challenging then you would think.
295	1	a	Absolutely love this game, if you are into puzzle games this is a must get.  I havn't got extremely far into the game, but I will say it does get very challenging fast.  4.5/5 Cant give it a 5 because I havn't played it all the way through.
297	1	a	:)
299	1	a	Combines 3d tangrams with tetris. Good for the price, but possibly too frustrating for most people. I like all the pretty colors, but I get confused what color is next sometimes.
301	1	a	Fun little game, with lots of replayability. And for that price tag (especially during a Steam Sale), you can't go wrong.
303	1	a	De you feel bored at work and want to relax? Do you have some time you don't know what to do? Are you waiting when your girlfriend will be ready to go out? Does 'Angry birds' bother you? This game is exactly what you need!  + requirement even for weak notebooks. Trust me, I know. + easy to play. You don't need even to pass tutorial!  + carry away for some hours and makes you a zombie in front of PC. + price. Accessible even for me - beggarly and lazy student.  Conclusion: must have.
305	1	a	This game screams for touchscreen support!  It is a very quick block puzzler where you trim down the Mass by throwing like colored cubes at like colors. If the block grows too large it will reach Critical Mass and explode.  I find this to be a very relaxing puzzler to play with some nice ambient/downtempo tracks.
307	1	a	A fun little puzzle game, quite addictive, and an awesome time waster.
309	1	a	Interestign little puzzle game.  try it out and see, fun for thoses in to puzzles. 
311	1	a	3-D tetris anyone? A neat game, fun idea, but frustrating. It has several modes for all types of players, pretty colors, and some nice sound, but it is a typical puzzler at its core. Sale or bundle buy, casual gaming only. Again, the marathon players and achievement hunters will be especially frustrated by it.
313	1	a	This is a great puzzle game, joining coloured cubes together to make combo's. Personally I think its a brilliant game to unwind with. Kind of another take on Tetris.  There are also several game modes and you'll be suprised how as you rank up the levels intense it can get to match those combos to stop it all from exploding.
315	1	a	This game is really fun. I enjoy the music and the way the game is played. Challenging yet chill puzzle game. Worth every penny.
317	1	a	After buying this game for $1 on sale, I have played quite a bit, and I enjoy it. the negative reviews keep getting stuck on the fact it needs internet connection, and one reviewer sounds like he was pretty stoned when he was playing, 'hands shaking'. Its a good, cheap puzzle game that is well made, cheaply priced and very addictive. if you like puzzles, try this out. if your stoned with shaky hands, try a Booster Juice drink.
319	1	a	I found the game very intriging, after a couple of minutes I had to stop playing as I became a bit addicted. I don't recomend this game for people whom are easily addicted to games and have things to do, but if you don't have anything to do and you have anything to do, then by all means do it.
321	1	a	one of those puzzle based indies which are more like weed than game. This one put me into a trance instantly and I lost myself completely in it. This game is for everyone. Fast, slow, medium, all sorts of pace in gameplay, must play for everyone! After Hexic HD I think this is the game worth trying.
323	1	a	A fun little game that I play when I get bored of shooters or other games. Very fun and challenging with rewarding online gameplay. There is no reason why you shouldn't pick it up for $1.99
325	1	a	Like an exploding rubics cube, but extremely relaxing. Will satisfy the completionist and the casual in you. Worth giving a shot.
327	1	a	great casual diversion with an endless mode. nice brain exercise
329	1	a	An excellent game. It doesn't do much but what it does, it does right. It's a great time waster and for 2â‚¬, i'd say it's a very fair deal.
331	1	a	This is a game I bought in conjunction with Super Hexagon, try see that critic one. Nevermind that, though. This game, actually, just really, like a game where you just do it without any storyline to come up, arcade games, of course. Upon trying, I can't really think if I write a critic, it would be Recommend or not. But suddenly today, day I write striked me up with recommend. One thing is due to its brain usage, where you can keep playing all other days when you think you're good enough. Maybe you could be good enough to not die. Try it yourself.
333	1	a	        YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  PirateFraser Plays... Critical Mass #UploadMonth&nbsp;
335	1	a	Got some time to kill? Don't want to play something involved? Chill with this game.
337	1	a	Critical Mass is a fun, simple game.  Its low price and somewhat addictive gameplay make it worth trying out. If you enjoy playing puzzle games, you will enjoy this. 
339	1	a	Rubik's cube Death simulator.   This game. IS just amazing.   The gameplay is so random at times. For all you know you're going great, but then. Nope. Sometimes you want to connect blocks up so you can execute them together.
341	1	a	Critical Mass is a fun, simple game.  Its low price and somewhat addictive gameplay make it worth trying out. If you enjoy playing puzzle games, you will enjoy this. 
343	1	a	Very neat casual game, good for mindlessly passing the time, if you are like me.  Only thing I've had wrong is that the game is a bit buggy. It has crashed on me a couple times and constantly goes offline for some reason. And the other thing is that the cube is difficult to control - I have misplaced blocks many times which is annoying, but I guess it's okay since the game is so random anyway.
345	1	a	I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Geometry Wars. The gameplay and graphics are very similar.  The scoring and combo system took me a while to get used to, but once I did, it was pretty fun.  Perhaps some more effective tutorials would help ease players into the mechanics.  My only real complaint is that gameplay sessions lasted a bit too long. Geometry Wars was fun because the sessions were short, and you always wanted to play 'one more time!'. Here you get a bit too many lives.  But still, a fun experience overall.
347	1	a	Rating 9/10 Overview: Twin Stick Arena Shooter  The Good:  +The game has an interesting premise. Killing enemies levels you up. Upon leveling, a score multiplier is randomly placed in the arena. Collecting this increases your multiplier by 1 permanently. Killing lots and lots of enemies in a short period of time also increases your combo meter. When your meter reaches 10 you get to drop a bomb that kills enemies in the surrounding area. You can also slow down time for a brief period if this get a bit too crazy. You add all of this together and you get a fun fast shooter .  + The game has plenty of interesting modes to keep you engaged. Each mode is vastly different from the last and offers plenty of different ways to play the game.   +Great music  + This game is the definition of pick up and play if you are looking to kill some time. Lots of replayability  The Bad:  - Some achievements are very hard to get   - Can be frustrating at times  Conclusion  Considering I got this game for one dollar, it probably is one of the better purchases I've made. If you love the genre then this is a fantastic game to add to your library. If your just a casual fan like myself then you will also find it enjoyable.      
349	1	a	I love twin stick shooters i've played them all this one is fantastic great graphics and numerous play modes elevate this one to the top of my list,i picked this up in the sale last week for under 1 euro after it was on my wishlist for about a year i should of got it earlier i know.I recommend this to all the arcade junkies out there who love building up highscores.
351	1	a	 A twin-stick shooter with a calm, polished, cybernetic aesthetic, Waves is a solid member of the genre with interesting mechanics but limited content.   Waves is a game where you control a sphere rolling within a cylinder, shooting a spray of bullets with the aim of removing an array of shapes which you are motivated to kill because A) They give you points, and B) You blow up and stop moving when they hit you. The game has a few interesting auxilliary mechanics. First is the buffer which is a rechargable bullet-time power that is a main panic button, and the second is bombs that become available based on your combo multiplier. If your combo breaks than the bomb disappears so there is an interesting anxiety if saving a bomb, and also a chance to chain together a large number of bombs for maximum efficacy. As difficulty ramps up and the chances of missing decreases due to the large number of baddies on the screen, bombs become more and more frequent, which leads to a fun chaotic dynamic when things get tougher.  This game has a small, understated, relaxing techno themed soundtrack that goes well with the hex-gridded environment and the polygonal, computer themed enemies. It took me a while to appreciate the game's design as there is quite a bit of subtlety, but in the end I appreciated the vision.  Though ultimately enjoyable there are some minor gripes. First, I can't pause between death and respawn, though often I wish to simply restart the level after an early untimely death. Also, the challenge mode often perplexingly doesn't trigger success for the challenes appropriately. Further, the UI is a bit crowded and oddly designed. For example, a high score is often displayed proiminently in the middle right of the screen, while the current score is displayed on the middle left of the screen. There is a lot of data on the screen. Aesthetically it works in a sort of augmented vision manner, but practically I would like to reduce a lot of this clutter. My worst is criticism is Ithat he amount of content is limited. Many game modes play out quite similarly and there is only the one stage. After a few hours you've seen it all, and you may not want to grind the same set up repeatedly.  Though unfair due Waves' differing mechanics, I feel this game asks to be compared with installments of Geometry Wars. If you liked Geometry Wars, then you will like Waves. If you didn't, you won't. If you've never played Geometry Wars than Waves is a cheap introduction to the genre when it is on sale. The game is a solid effort, and personally, I'm excited for the sequel, which as of this writing is in Early Access.   Waves are a physical phenomena resulting from specific excitation in a medium. Most waves involving the medium itself are limited by the speed of sound in that medium, while the travel of optical and electromagnetic waves depends on the speed of light in that medium. This review brought to you in part using waves from  Original Curator Group . 
353	1	a	I've owned  Waves  since its release in 2011 &amp; I still come back to for a few rounds from time to time. My original review written back then was pretty hyped, basically chanting slogans like 'I'm Hooked', 'It's Uber!', 'Grab it now!'  (As you can tell, I was pretty impressed!) .   In a retrospective  (&amp; more balanced)  look,  Waves  boasts solid mechanics, simple design &amp; challenging arenas/modes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity though, this game is hardcore! The small circular  'Neo-Cyberspace'  arena to navigate, along with the swiftly increasing viruses, bugs  (&amp; other strange spawners)  that trigger  wave after wave  make this a true challenge to survive for any extended period. This difficulty can be off putting to some, but I really enjoy the intense gameplay - it keeps me coming back .. sweaty palms and all!  Being a twin-stick shooter you are obviously able to move &amp; shoot independently on each analog stick, but in Waves you also have a slow-mo  'Bullet Time'  rechargeable power-up which gives you those split seconds needed to make an escape or clear some spawners when things just become too hectic. You can use this strategically to boost your scores too, such as getting a combo to enable your timed  'mega bomb'  or get up close &amp; double your points with the  'Point Blank'  bonus. Movement &amp; aiming are fluid &amp; these additional tactical features become instinctive to use after a very short time playing.  Enemies are distinct, visually, clearly identifiable &amp; have complementing attack moves. They have some cool mechanics, although you will learn there patterns before long  (there aren't a lot of different enemies) . The sheer numbers in later waves &amp; the combinations of enemies used negates their relative simplicity. When you experience these large number of enemies with the vast amount of effects &amp; action happening on screen, it can be hard to keep track of your location. This is the only downside I have found overall, and is really due to having such nice graphical effects  (take the good with the bad I guess  :)  ) .  Of all the modes, the classic  Survival  mode remains my favourite, although there are another six unique modes also available to tackle. Some are harder than others. There is the  Challenge  mode offering unique puzzle like waves to clear,  Crunch Time  offers short burst 3min timed runs &amp;  Bombing Run  where you have no guns, only bombs to defend yourself with. Destroy the Cubes as quickly as possible in  Rush , try the  â€˜Run'n'Gunâ€™   Chase  mode where you need to hit the spawning markers within 5 secs to continue &amp; the newest mode call  Hold  where you have a small moving circle to stay within to enable your weapons which I find perhaps the toughest of them all!  Below is straight gameplay footage of Survival mode - A taste of what  Waves  is like in action:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325677941   All these great modes, enemy types &amp; overall challenge add up to a lot of replayability. When you wrap that up in some smooth controls, gorgeous visual eye candy, pumping electro musical score  (that has that tendency to get stuck in your head!) , add online &amp; friends leaderboards, a swag of interesting achievements &amp; a big picture friendly design, you really have something special. You can see a lot of time has been put in to balance out, refine &amp; improve the gameplay by the one-man development team @  Squid In A Box .   Waves  has held strong against the tide of new twin-stick shooter titles over the years, remaining one of the best available on Steam. If you missed this when it came out, itâ€™s certainly worth a look now its half the price. It's great quality &amp; great value!  Just as much fun to play now as it was when I got it!

355	1	a	Excellent native 3D vision support. Thousands of colourful pixel are popping out of your screen.  Gameplay: easy to learn. Difficult to master.  Great shooter. I bought it for 2 EUR on sale. Totally worth it. Check out the demo to see yourself. I rate it with 7/10.
357	1	a	Why do I have 250+ hours in this simple, yet captivating arcade game?   because i have no life   11/10 m8  EDIT:  My serious review.  Waves is a arcade shooter that is very easy to get into, but requires an adept to achieve a high score. It's more for the old school and casual gamers like me. Just buy it and play.
359	1	a	This game is like adding nitrous oxide to a high powered classic from the eighties. It is rush hour at the busiest intersection in Mumbai during a lentil sale. And shockingly, this game is sold in finished form for a pittance but inspite of that they just added 'Hold' gameplay which has actually improved the game in ways that I couldn't even imagine. If Skyrim is a ten out of ten, then you'd have to give Waves an honest 16.
361	1	a	 Definately one of the best twin-stick arena shooters I've played.  There are few frills here - just good old fashioned schmup fun. The controls are tight. The battles are fair, and the music is good.   Pros:  +Tight controls +Several game modes, and they are all pretty fun +Music is high energy and very solid +Graphics are nice, and while things get hectic, I can always discern what is going on +I love chasing my Steam friends scores (friend me if you wanna get crunked) +Price is too cheap   Cons:  -It doesn't bring anything new to the table - which is usually a  huge  con for me, but in this case, I'm cool with it   Excellent game if you are into this genre.  Well worth full price. 
363	1	a	Fantastic twin-stick shooter similar to Geometry Wars but with lots of it's unique gameplay devices. Great soundtrack and acid fuelled graphics.  In conclusion if you like fun, instantly gratifying arcade shooters buy this game, it's well worth the price.
365	1	a	WOW! This game was EPIC as it should! I got this game when I saw it was on sale, so I quickly buy it to see what's inside. I loved the graphics, but should be increasing the mouse sensitivity as the mouse sensitivity was a little low. The gameplay? Simple, but beautiful! In the game you should shoot AS much as you could because the virus (Usually the enemy, I used to call them 'Virus') always seeking to you, and that's the best part of the game. Eventually, the virus will grow up, spreading throughout the arena, then eventually, you could be killed by the virus. This game had so many game modes in it, but the only game mode I've played is Survival.  Oh! The music was awesome! I've been wondering where in the world I could get the music :v Anyway, keep it up! Beautiful Game, Beautiful Graphics at such a reasonable price!  Note : I've made a review of this game, check it out in  https://youtu.be/Z-GC1S8wf34   Thank You!
367	1	a	I mean, it has colors, I guess thats pretty cool  Edit: Now it has Colors in 4K
369	1	a	  Waves Review - Ace Elite
371	1	a	This is a good twin stick game, though not quite as polished as Geometry Wars 2 or 3. Looks wise it delivers for the most part and I like the short written verdict on your performance after each game, a nice touch.  The bomb dynamic is a refreshing and clever new twist on the GW format. I'm not totally convinced about the slow-mo ability which seems like an unavoidable fix for the inertia based player movement. Without it you simply cannot change direction quick enough to avoid some potentially impending deaths. With it I feel like I'm activating a cheat, albeit a metered one... The longer I've played it the more these two issues bug me but on the whole the gameplay is pretty good, maybe just not quite perfect for my own taste.  I would have liked the leader boards to show the total number of scores/players, this is a common annoyance also found in the GW games, it is hard to measure your standing without it.   It is good and I would definitely recommend it still, but not as much as when I first played it. Waves 2 is out in early access and I am tempted, while the slow-mo ability remains the player movement looks to be greatly improved...
373	1	a	Not bad shooter! Currently for 0,99 Cent.... ..... ..
375	1	a	Waves, where being a ball that spits out bullets becomes fun.   I think it's a shame waves always takes place in the same map, I wish there were more of them. I don't think it would too much effort. The graphics are avarage for an arcade game, (naturally) there is no story, the controls are very userfriendly and the gameplay is fast and satisfying. I love the local highscore feature. It's too bad waves only has like what, three soundtracks?  I personally like this game a lot, it's great to kill some time with (for example when you're facing a long loading screen), has user friendly gameplay and is fun to play with friends. I'll rate this game a 7 out of 10.
377	1	a	If you like twin stick shooters this game is a must buy. It's my favorite TSS (I use KB &amp; Mouse) that I've played. I enjoyed it more than the PS3's Super Stardust. It's very addicting! Get it!
379	1	a	Pure crystallization of thousands of explosions! 9/10
381	1	a	Old style arcade shooter fun, if this doesn't get your blood moving then you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dead on a slab.
383	1	a	This was my first dual stick game, it is also my favourite for relaxing. The music and the colours just keep the player mesmerised. There is a score cap but can you reach it?!
385	1	a	I guess for a shooter that isn't beatable, it doesn't make sense to wait until I beat it to review it, and I've played it for several hours already. This is just super great. In some ways it's just a very well done twin-stick shooter, which makes for a good game but doesn't really stand out by itself. It's polished, and all the fundamental mechanics feel and look and sound good. The things that really keep me coming back for a couple rounds every few days are the extra mechanics on top of the basic ones and the well thought out game modes (one in particular).  A slow motion ability is not exactly a new or unique concept, but it's used well in this game, with a limited meter for it that drains VERY quickly and recharges moderately quickly, so it's very often available, but only in small amounts. You also get bonus points while using it, so you have to decide whether to trade off using it to save your life or be risky and use it to pad combos for more points. The other main mechanic is the bomb system. Your combo multiplier goes up as you kill more enemies without a break of more than I think three seconds in between, and at certain multiples you're awarded a bomb, which as in most games insta-kills anything in a relatively large radius around you. However, unlike most games, you cannot save it for later use. You have a few seconds to activate it, or it's gone forever. If timed/chained properly though, you can use a bomb to get you a good chunk of the way to your next bomb, then repeat. Of course, when there are enough things on the screen that you can get away with that, you need to be on your toes or you won't last long.  It has some common game modes like unlimited time with a limited number of lives, or infinite lives but a fixed amount of playtime, and some more exotic or panic-inducing ones like the one which lights up a small spot on the screen, and if you don't move to it within a few seconds you die. Once you get there, it picks a new random location. Oh, and you also have to keep playing the normal game while doing that. Good luck. The one I've really gotten stuck on is Bombing Run, which takes away your guns entirely but continues to spawn enemies. It places a bomb pad at a random location where you can pick up a bomb, at which point it creates a delivery point at a different random location. When you bring the bomb there, it detonates like a bomb in the other normal modes, and a new bomb pad is generated. If you get a high enough combo, you can get a single-use defensive shield, but mostly it's about positioning, movement, and reading patterns and paths through what becomes a huge, chaotic mess at higher levels. It's really great for practicing that stuff without being distracted by all the shooting you're normally doing in most modes of most games, and it's just plain fun.
387	1	a	there's no reason not to have it in your Library. great Soundrack, simple but addicting gameplay
389	1	a	If you play other games that include using team work with friends that are not the shapest knife in the kitchen (like scott) then this game is a refreshing change as the outcome on this game will only be impacted by you and you only. Thats right! doesnt matter if mid is feeding, or your adc has 4 cs at 10 mim, this game is completely relient on you.
391	1	a	The game constantly challenges me, and even annoys me at some points but ultimately is really fun. It is hard to control using only your keyboard (my mouse is broken, don't ask how) so the controls can definitely be better but using a mouse it should be no problem. I do recommend this game!! just .. don't get too addicted aha.   oh oh !! and it has really nice music to go along with the pretty graphics and gameplay so theres that too.
393	1	a	'But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was 99 cents!'  Fun game (bit challenging tho), great soundtrack.
395	1	a	Rating 8,5/10  I played this game about 3 hours at once. Definitely, I can say it is very fun. You shoot other balls that come towards you. It can be seen as very simple and boring, yet there are different game modes such as rush, survival and bombing run, that I liked and enjoyed most. With them, you can have different gaming experinces
397	1	a	I honestly couldnt think of a single complaint about this game. It's pretty much everything I could ever want from a twin stick shooter.  One thing unique to this game that I really liked was how the bomb loadout worked: instead of picking bombs up and stockpiling them, you can only use them whenever you reach high enough hit combos. This forces you to think ahead and time your kills, and on higher levels things get very frenetic with you dropping bombs every few seconds. There's also a slow-mo ability that recharges automatically, which is another helpful feature.  Plus the controls are smooth and responsive, the graphics shiny and colorful, the music excellent (accompanied by a cool Glados-like robot voice), and there are enough game modes, achievements and leaderboards to keep you occupied for many hours. A very solid and satisfying shoot-em-up experience.
399	1	a	This is one of the best indie games I've played in my whole life. Soundtrack is fun and enjoyable, but could have a little bit more bass. Graphics are really cool, neon color scheme fits with the gameplay, game modes are kind of lacking in change, but overall, this game is a must.
401	1	a	Polished twin-stick shooter with addicting gameplay, colorful presentation, and incredible soundtrack (seriously, I sometimes play the game just to hear the music). Although it comes with a handful of other modes, most of them are the same game with different objectives. Despite lack of content, the content it does offer is solid. Not mind-blowing, but will leave a smile on your face.  If you enjoyed Geometry Wars or enjoy topping high scores, this is the game for you. I wouldn't pay full price unless you dearly love the genre. I would highly recommend waiting for a sale of $1 or less and kill a few hours with it.
403	1	a	Pretty good time killer with a nice soundtrack.
405	1	a	Waves is a fast-paced, funny shooter with lots of interesting features. If youâ€™re looking for a fun pastime, this is highly recommended.
407	1	a	Pure meditation. Be sure, u wanna play it.
409	1	a	Simple and fun gameplay, with several game modes and leaderboards to keep you playing. A game where you can spend a few minutes for fun, or hours trying to beat your last high score. Could have used a few more background music tracks, there are only three tracks looping. Absolutely worth the money, if you want to kill some time before work or school.
411	1	a	This games is amazing cant stop playing it, the sound tracks just add to the awesome feel of the game. 10/10
413	1	a	Probably one of the most underrated games on Steam. And it's pretty damn cheap too. Fast-paced gameplay, easy controls, great graphics and light effects, awesome soundtrack... Do you really need more reasons? Go buy it, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥it!
415	1	a	So far I haven't played much of this game, but when I play more or the game gets an update I will edit my review as I see fit.  Waves is a twinstick shooter with the main objective of getting the highest score possible by shooting enemies.  Graphics: The graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful. Even the smallest details in this game look amazing. 10/10  Gameplay: Personally I haven't found any problems with the gameplay, it's very smooth and fast paced. This game can be played with the sticks on a gamepad, or if you prefer you can play with a mouse and keyboard. 10/10  Soundtrack: The music in this game is very nice and fits the 'environment'. 9/10  Overall: I love this game and I think it is definetily worth $5 dollars. 10/10   
417	1	a	Totally LOVE this game! Great pick up and play game. Find myself playing it more and more. Really like the diverse playing options. Reminds me of Geometry Wars, an all-time favorite, and, much to my surprise, I find myself liking Waves more thatn G.W. Definitely recommend this game!
419	1	a	This game is truly amazing, if you like Super Stardust and retro shooters, this game is for you. The graphics are nice and even on my slow pc it runs smoothly. The music is amazing, too. Stop reading this and buy the game!
421	1	a	Easily one of the best time wasters there is. First game i bought and cant stop playing it. Humor just is the icing on the cake
423	1	a	Good casual game with relaxing music
425	1	a	How-To-Play Section alone makes this game worth it.  This game is hard as hell and also addicting, But there are only few soundtrack in the game and I personally think its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ suck! Theres a music that is too loud and theres some that is almost non existant (humming ambience). Playing third party music in the background is highly recommended.  8/10 Great time killer, When theres nothing better to do. I'm occupied most of the time so I dont get to play it alot.
427	1	a	Probably my new favorite arena shooter. Not a complicated experience, but an enjoyable game to pick up and play, whether you've only got a few minutes to spare, or a few hours. It's a lot like Geometry Wars with more than one mode of play, and with the mechanics tweaked a bit so that the game gets more exciting and rewarding the longer you play and the better you become. The demo is highly representative of the overall experience, so do yourself a favor and check it out. I managed to snag this for $2.50 during a Daily Deal, but if you're into these sorts of games, the asking price of $9.99 isn't shabby considering the insane amount of fun I have with it.
429	1	a	Exciting and challenging, on my list of essential Steam games.
431	1	a	For fans of Geometry Wars and similar twin-stick shooters, there's a lot to enjoy with Waves. The addition of a slow-motion powerup based on kills and a bomb system reliant on kill combos makes for a unique experience. Although the selection of game modes does not differ significantly from Waves' competitors, there is enough variety to offer great replay value for fans of the genre. Highly recommended!
433	1	a	I have little time in this game, but it is great. It's no hardcore professional shooter, but it isn't lacking in intensity. It's very nice for just passing time.
435	1	a	Very beutiful and relaxing game, for me at least. Reminds me alot of Super Stardust and Geomtry Wars. I love these kind of games and I can play them for years as a stress reliever. The worls needs simple games like this for when you're just tired of everything else. Oh and the soundtrack, bravo.
437	1	a	Anyone who is a fan of oldskool arcade arena shoot em ups, stuff like geometry wars.. This is really amazing. Very easy to jump in and out of quickly. I found the games in geometry wars took much longer to get exciting, waves gets into the crazyness quite fast and keeps you there as long as you can stay alive. It looks great, the soundtrack is great and the feel is very responsive. High scores can be destroyed if you manage to pull off amazing stunts. Don't get me wrong, Geometry Wars was and is a true classic, not saying Waves is necessarily better.. I just find this more modernised and it requires less commitment to get that burst of fun in :)
439	1	a	I enjoyed this game quite a bit, its very reminicent of a certain geometric game that has you shooting colorful shapes, while this is more in depth than the PC port of that mini game, the sequel to the minigame, is better than this one, but this is the best you're going to get because the publisher does not want to spend the money to port the sequel over from xbox 360, which is a shame because I enjoyed the hell out of it.  This game is different in that, there is a 'leveling' system that tells you how difficult the game will be as you progress, the game has a great soundtrack and interesting enemy types, I just wish there was more variety in the game types, and weapons for the ship.
441	1	a	you spin my ball right round, right round.
443	1	a	Was expecting a Geometry Wars clone.... got something with way more strategy and scoring satisfaction. I got it on sale for $0.99, so I came out ahead regardless :)
445	1	a	This game really helped me get through alot of homework. The soundtrack is amazing as well.
447	1	a	Beautiful graphics, good controls and an amazing soundtrack! Would I pay full price (9,99â‚¬) for it? Maybe. If it's on sale for half then certainly!
449	1	a	Great shoot 'em up with a similar voice as GLaDOS, great music and a British humour. Check the demo and buy it!
451	1	a	I was a little skeptical at first when i was about to buy this game, but since it was so cheap, why not right? I was so glad to give it try, i really got into it, the gameplay is fantastic and soundtrack as well, you will certainly be hooked up for hours, if you like Super Hexagon this game you will love this one, if you don't, why not give it a try? it's cheap and you may like it, believe me, you won't regret it.
453	1	a	Nice Cool and Awesome Game looks just like Sci-Fi :D
455	1	a	It's a lot of fun esp. for .99 when its on sale
457	1	a	This game is awesome, and the creator has an awesome sense of humor. (Go to the FAQ and read the sayings after every game)  It's addicting!
459	1	a	 I beat a high score and the game's narrator said 'whatever.' 11/10   A really tight twin stick shooter. The graphics, music, interface are marvelous. The menus are peppered with snarky remarks.  The gameplay itself is highly enjoyable and offers several modes that suit differen't people's tastes.  Highly recommended for fans of twin stick shooters.  PS. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode. Bombing Run mode.
461	1	a	Love the Game loving the Soundtrack, definatly a good buy!
463	1	a	I bought this on a whim because I wanted to play a shooter, but nothing in my library seemed appealing. Absolutely worth full price ($4.99 at time of writing). Ton of game modes, challenging without being cheap or frustrating, great soundtrack (if you like electronic/dubstep) and beautiful visuals. Easy to pick up and play for 5min or an hour.
465	1	a	Nice looking and great game overall from music to mechanics.
467	1	a	If youve ever wanted to blast geometric figures with a sphere that shoots plasma balls, this is the game for you.  You control a sphere that you roll around inside a cylinder from a top down view, making it a 2d circle. With your sphere you shoot plasma balls/beams that destroy other geometric shapes when you hit them. Those shapes spawn in intervals, depending on the level youve gotten to. You gain levels by destroying the shapes and collecting little blue orbs of EXP that conveniently home into you when you get close enough.  This is a greatly fun game in short bursts. Its simple to learn, but difficult to master.  It is also clear that this game is a fantastic way to increase your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking potential, and accuracy of short-term logical predictions. As you gain levels it becomes exponetially more difficult to coordinate your spheres movement (cannot touch any other shapes or youll explode!), your plasma beams, and the path youll need take your sphere in the next 1 - 3 seconds to avoid the semi-predictable paths of the other shapes and avoid touching any of them, lest you explode.  Graphics: For what the game is, Im satisfied with, and enjoy, the graphics. They are colorful, appealing to the eye, and mesh together well. 10/10  Sound: I have no complaints about the sound other than that there are not enough music tracks. I believe there are 4 total, which are nice tracks, but a little on the low side quantity wise, which can start to become repetative. 8/10  Gameplay: Intense, is the best way to put it. Perhaps even 'overwhelming' at first once you get 8 or 10 levels into say 'Crunch' mode (3 minute game, get highest score possible). But thats not a bad thing; as stated above, Waves really has awesome potential at training your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking, and movement prediction capabilities. 10/10  I got this on a whim while it was on sale, and I am very satisfied that I did. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys intense, even overwhelming levels of information that need to be dealt with immediately lest you explode. I also see this game as having the potential for being a training game for just about any other fast-paced video game out there.  Final score: 28/30 = 9.33  PS: Ive seen reviews questioning if this game is OK to be played with mouse and keyboard instead of gamepad. I play with M/K, and I find no intrinsic problems using them as opposed to a gamepad. Ive used both on Waves, and prefer M/K myself, but it all comes down to personal preference. Im very adept at M/K, but not so great with gamepads that require stick usage.   Id recommend trying both, and seeing which feels better to you right off the bat. Whichever does will probably be your best option.
469	1	a	Dang this game is addictive.... if you like games like Geometry Wars, this is a game for you!!!  The music is very catchy too... I actually like the music for this game more than Geometry Wars.  Definatly worth the cost... actually it is a steal!
471	1	a	This is one of the better games on Steam, it's so very simple yet addictive and good-looking that you just can't stop mashing the buttons. Such colors, very eye candy, wow. Unlike many 2,5 dimensional shooters which are repetitive and uninteresting, Waves is totally awesome like a zombie ninja Jesus riding a motorcycle into outer space.  Playing Waves is very easy, but getting good at it is next to impossible. Needs good eye-hand coordination and swift reflexes. The game gets FAST in a minute or two, and that's an old school definition of FAST, where 0,05 second gap really matters and a slightest error kills you instantly. TO DEATH. Like, really.  Just go ahead and buy it right now. This game is good, and you should feel good about it.
473	1	a	It's Freaking Glowing! 10/10
475	1	a	Amazing super fast paced game for just a few minutes break here and there.  Don't forget to blink!
477	1	a	Superlative arena based twin stick shooter ala Geometry Wars but uniquely utilizing a combo based use em or lose bomb acquisition system. Employs slow motion techniques for extended scoring but usage or buffer depletion lessens recoverability in tight situations so as the great Johnny Cash would say  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-OrzG3id_8) . Allows for zen like mastery where you perpetuate in a zone and keep extending time (Rush mode). Multiple game modes. Supports the Xbox 360 controller. Without being overly dramatic, where did this come from? It's awesome.
479	1	a	F is for friends who do stuff together U is for you and me (try it!) N is for anywhere and anytime at all  Down here in the deep, blue sea!
481	1	a	Similar to Geometry Wars in a lot of ways but a heck of a lot more modes to play. Combat could be more interesting but overall it's a very fun popcorn game.
483	1	a	If you like twin-stick shooters (keyboard+mouse is actually more fun) and/or score attack, this is a definite recommendation. I like neither. ... I likeD neither. Then I got Waves. ^^  Upsides: - Launches quickly without forcing you to sit through endless logos. (Two skippables, and if you rename the video files, you get undelayed launch.) - Many different game modes that all utilize, hone and broaden the basic skillset of the player. - Good music. - Some peculiar, moderate humor that is almost like a sports coach at times. - Plenty of achievement goals.  Generally very motivating. Many details I cannot put into words. The whole package just is a lot of fun. And, hell, it has a demo! You can check for yourself! Yay!  Downsides: - You can't choose which music plays. - Maybe some minor obstacles when using a game controller for menu navigation. - Leaderboard display tediously slow.
485	1	a	a great game
487	1	a	Of all of the non-Geometry Wars twin-stick shooters, this is becoming one of my favorites. Cool graphics/effects, frantic gameplay and a decent selection of game modes make this a really good game for the price.
489	1	a	A fun little diversion that's well made and somewhat clever. Well, what's so clever about it? Light travels in waves, and there's waves in water, and you seem to be a little ball in a petri dish causing waves in the water while viruses, or whatever they are, reproduce. Oh, and there's some music, and sound travels in waves! And when you slow down time, the music slows down! Oh, how clever.   There's a twinge of sarcasm there, I know that some have a hard time being able to notice that on the internet. Anyway, the game IS a lot of fun, and it is a very fun diversion, as I stated before. For...a little while. I can't see anyone dedicating tons of time to this game because, to put it simply, it gets boring pretty quickly. It's great to have a game to pick up for a few minutes at a time if you just have a few minutes to kill, and this game is perfect for that. However, it's so similar to some other game *cough* Beat Hazard *cough* that do the concept just a little bit better. The things that make this game unique also make it rather samey in the move-around-in-a-specific-area-and-shoot-crap-dead niche, which I happily subscribe to.   Big fat A+ on the gameplay  B+ on the visuals, which are nice, but they could stand to be toned down juuuust a hair so that thing you need to pick up to refill your slow motion gauge isn't completely indiscernable from an enemy spawning in the same exact friggin' place (that's not challenging, just cheap.)   C+ on the soundtrack - now, don't get me wrong, the songs in the game are FRIGGIN' GREAT, but there's exactly 4, maybe 5 of them. The game could stand to use a bit more variety in a soundtrack. I have a hard time believing that the combined length of the tracks included equals up to the 25 minutes they have set for one of the survival achievements.   Overall, 7/10 - would definitely recommend buying, but you won't be putting hours and hours and hours of time into it. Honestly, if it let me use my own music to play with the same game modes, this would probably overtake Beat Hazard for me, of which I've put something like 40 hours into playing. Give us a little bit of customization. I'm begging for a sequel, no, really.
491	1	a	best pac man clone ever !!
493	1	a	Without a shadow of a doubt, the best game ever made by someone I know.  Buy it, and help him afford to eat.
495	1	a	GGUD scrubs,   Come for my title... 13th global bombing run.  Im waiting...
497	1	a	very fun to play
499	1	a	If you do not buy this game you do not enjoy things that are the best.
501	1	a	this game is awsome alot of trophies and i been missing resogun and this is my fix, and the music is bumping definately worth buying if you love playing twin stick shooters like resogun or geometry wars.
503	1	a	Shoot colourful thingies, I like. 8/10
505	1	a	I got 99 problems but this fun little Geometry Wars clone isn't one of them!
507	1	a	Back in the days when I just purchased this game, I wrote the following in my recommendation:  'Waves is rather funny, in fact. It's a good casual game to kill some minutes of your day, if you like shooting, running away from multiple enemies and dropping megabombs to make a rainbow of sparky explosions. It reminds me of old 2D games representing some spaceships rushing through hordes of aliens or asteroids with their Big, Terrible Guns. Also, after each game you will receive some witty remark from the devs; their sense of humour is... remarkable.'  There's not been really much to add since; I'd just say that buying the game gives you rather little advantages. The other music tracks that are not available in the demo are actually quite dull; as for the other game modes, they do add some difference and new experience to the gameplay, but generally the demo version of Waves fulfills its time-killer functions exactly as nicely as the paid one.
509	1	a	It's just (J)awesome!!!
511	1	a	I feel this game is perfect for Pick-up-and-plays before work or as a reward for studying in the Crunch Time mode but is also an enjoyable progression curve for durational play. The soundtrack is active and the gameplay sucks you in. I love playing this game once a day so far!
513	1	a	A very fun and innovative game for the twin stick shooter genre.  Classic scoring system allows for competitions among friends and maybe even tournaments.  Fun game that's worth its price.
515	1	a	Waves is one those indie games i've never heard or seen before but beats some AAA titles despite being simple.  Things I liked: +Graphics Shiny, coulorfull and eye catching  +Gameplay Has many game modes to keep you entertained  +Soundtrack Motives you to play and it gives a nice touch to the game  +Scores You can compare scores with other players in the world   Things i didn't liked -My right arm hurts. :P
517	1	a	This is the kind of game that when you lose you say 'Ok, I'm gonna play just one more...' and then you wake up 3 days later totally wasted with you controller crashed against the wall and all you can see is colorful dots flying around your vision. Seriously, this game is a challenge that makes you keep trying to best yourself even though you know that, by the end, the game always wins.  It's fun, it's cheap, it has a high replayability factor and don't let me get started with the sarcastic jokes all around the game!
519	1	a	amazing :) this is a must have game
521	1	a	For those that played Geometry Wars, this game right here I very similar to it! You are a ball shooting other balls, what is there not to like? You can also buy the soundtrack!
248	0	a	I've fell for recomendations but tbh this game is boring as hell. No campaign mode, no upgrades, there are LOTS of better twin stick shooters on PC. This one is pure garbo
249	0	a	Launch at startup.  - Worked at first, but tabbed out to close other applications that I didn't need. - Tried to get back in the game, but was no longer responding and proccessing was at 0%. - Tried launching again, freezes at startup. - Tried guides by developer, or adding to ask the following questions because none of his methods was working, but obviously he declined. - I'm not smart with game developing, but this needs further development.   Also, my current res. is 1366x768  I want a refund for now.
523	1	a	My 1.7 ghz and still works. XD Great game, Quick, Simple, Fun, etc. Great music too.
525	1	a	Great twin stick shooter
251	0	a	Make an ok bullet hell shooter... ....and set a max score reaching which literally terminates the game  FOR WHAT PURPOSE
527	1	a	
252	0	a	This game is way to 'laggy' for its world. I mean come on, only geometric figures and this can't run smoothly on a decent machine...?
529	1	a	Shoot em up on a fixed arena. You get to play many different modes. Basically shoot a veriety of bad guys, collect light to level up and boost the score. Cool soundtrack and very neat graphics!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0euskyHDdBU 
531	1	a	Probably the best top-down shooter I ever played. Highly addictive and it gives you that 'one-more-try' feel to it every time.  Also, the game will insult you no matter what your score is at the end. Yes, it's funny.  10/10 will play it every day
254	0	a	It's really just a time waster. It looks nice, but there's literally no point.
255	0	a	+ Interesting game modes + Nice style  - Will not recognize my controller - Only 2 weapon types - Only a single map - Has no power-ups to speak of - Slowmo isn't very satisfying - Music is uninspired  It's an addictive game if you can get past the bare bones, but you're better off elsewhere in this genre... *cough* Super Stardust HD *cough*.
533	1	a	Pretty cool Geometry Wars. Sadly no spiffy multiplayer.
535	1	a	A funny casual game with many options. Took me a time to get bored of it...
537	1	a	I really like the game but it kinda gets boring doing the same stuff over and over again. Nice soundtrack though.
539	1	a	This game is awesome. It's cheap and so worth it. The game is trippy so don't buy this if you can't handle it. I'm sure I've seizured a few times while playing but I'm so into the game that I don't care. It's a great game and I can't suggest it more if you're looking for a cheap trippy experience.
541	1	a	Very fun and challenging game, if you are looking for a casual game to pass the time, this is the game!
543	1	a	Great twin stick shooter. Geometry Wars clone but it's great on its own.
545	1	a	really fun game soundtrack is amazing
547	1	a	Can be played using WASD for movement and the mouse for aiming the firing solution but it may be better to use a control pad with dual analog sticks. The game is great if you like things like Geometry Wars. There is a mode where you don't run out of lives but instead try to score as much as you can in the time limit. The music is great.
549	1	a	I always start to play without the intention of going on too long. That never happens and I end up trying to beat my high score for quite longer than I expected. It has smooth controls, glitzy graphics and a pulsing soundtrack(with one really really great song on there).
551	1	a	This game just devours your time... who would thought?
553	1	a	Elegant simplicity, comfy soundtrack. Would recommend.
555	1	a	This game is so zen I actually achived a state of enlightenment
557	1	a	A perfectly formed shoot them up, novel in its execution. Perfect for lunchtime spot of zen destruction, or late night andrenaline jolts.
559	1	a	Good old arcade style game with good music. If you liked Geomatry Wars, you wil like this. Just a shame that these type of games dont have levels or a goal to work towards other then high scores. But other then that, its very adictive.
561	1	a	This game is light casual shooting game. I like this style game. Very Fun! :D
563	1	a	This game rips off quite a lot from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.  A lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.  I haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' 'Crunch Time' and RE2's 'Deadline' operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays ('Bombing Run' in Waves plays much like RE2's 'Pacifism', but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the 'Chase' and 'Rush' modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called 'Waves').  Sadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* 'heavily inspired' by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off.   Also, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.
565	1	a	I made it to 2nd place in the world on survival.
567	1	a	Had a hard time getting a non-xbox controller to work with it, but the price point and game itself are spectacular already. If you loved geometry wars, or other arcade style survival shooters... you will love this.
569	1	a	Awesome game for chillin
571	1	a	This game has a unique storyline behind it, amazing graphics and excellent detail. It is for hardcore , intense and adrenaline loving gamers. I can see this game becoming more popular than the Minecraft franchise and more detailed than The Last Of Us: Remastered.  This game is no joke.
573	1	a	'Connection lost!' has become one of my least favorite phrases! Great game though...tons of different play modes. Easy to learn, hard to master. Challenging and addicting, for me anyway. Enjoy!
575	1	a	Waves has a surprising number of different gaming modes. Only after playing it for a few days, I have my favorites and find the entire game quite addicting. The more I play, the better I get and the more I want to play. I have a controller and find the controls very smooth. The in game tools at your disposal are limited (Slow-Mo and bomb), but are very useful and affective. Both have saved my life numerous times. As you level up, you have a chance to get a score multiplier. I really hate when it disappears before I can grab it, but it does add some difficulty to the game. I purchased this game when it was on sale, but it's definately worth the full price.
577	1	a	Frantic and soothing at the same time. I have no idea how that works, but it does work, and so very very well.
579	1	a	Okay, this is nothing short of amazing. It's a Williams game - Defender, Tempest, Robotron 2084. It's pure evil, and it wants to hurt you. Probably laugh while it's doing it, too.  Gorgeous graphics, an excellent selection of very different gameplay modes (an unexpected and very welcome touch!). This has one-more-go hard-wired into its DNA. It's brutally addictive.  The graphics, though lush and lovely, never get in the way of what's going on. The colours do trick you sometimes. You think you're heading for a green bomb pad, but no, it's a virus cluster of nearly the same shade.  Slo-mo helps, but is in short supply. The bomb mechanic takes some getting used to and doesn't always work. One time, the voice started saying 'Bomb ready', but the combo had dropped (and with it, the bomb) before she'd even said the two words.  I paid 79p for this game. Honestly, if that decimal place had been moved two places to the right, I still would have thought I got a brilliant bargain.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
581	1	a	Totally scratches that twin stick, top down shooter itch on PC. Highly addictive. Great soundtrack.
583	1	a	A very basic twin-stick shooter with absolutely nothing new to bring to the table. But I can't give thumbs down since there isn't anything especially wrong with it.
585	1	a	Hell Yes!! Ive been looking for something like this for a while.
587	1	a	bought for 99 Cent, great little game!  
589	1	a	If you like Super Hexagon or games similar you will find this just as fun.
591	1	a	Do you like shooting things? Do you like flashy colors? Do you like polygons and polyhedrons? Then this game is for you. It's a very fun game with quick paced action, with the ability to slow down time every now and then a great twist. It can be played for a quick round of a few minutes or for however long you can handle it depensding on which of the many gamemodes you choose. It's not a complex, story-driven plot game. You just enjoy shooting dodecahedrons.
593	1	a	What I like best about this game is that the laser weapon is not something to make the game easier but is something to give you a diiferent experience. The bullet gun uses spread fire to quickly &amp; efficiently take out enemies but can sometimes miss. The laser is able to quickly move across enemies eliminating most in quick sucsession, however it sometimes can not penetrate the entire enemy or moves too fast across it. So you see each weapon has advantages &amp; disadvantages. Not many top down shooters like this are that generous. Plus the graphics &amp; gameplay are fanatastic.
595	1	a	It's beautiful with a retro type theme and an overall amazing depth with elegent lighting that'll make you stick on it like glue!
597	1	a	Addicting and quite entertaining, with the little humor and 'all-in-good-fun' insults thrown at you, not regretting the purchase one bit.     For those of you who like arcade style wave-like games, this IS for you.
599	1	a	Great little pick-up-and-play twin stick shooter with pleanty of game modes to keep you interested.
601	1	a	Awesome graphics songs!!
603	1	a	It's like someone mixed Geometry Dash with Gearcrack Arena It's perfect and don't even get me started on the soundtrack
605	1	a	1000x Better than Super Hexagon! So addictive and very beutiful graphics! Love the concept behind the defending yourself from computer viruses! Overall great game and if you dont grab it while its $0.99 you are going to be missing out!
607	1	a	I bought waves expecting it to be a simple, boring time waster. Little did I know how wrong I was. Waves quickly becomes an intense battle for survival, with thick swarms of enemies chasing you constantly. I prefer Waves to Geometry Wars, as waves comes with a unique artstyle that I quickly grew to love. The different gamemodes are delightfully hard and enjoyable all round.   9/10 would get my face eaten by a giant cube again
609	1	a	It's a fun game. But you'll get bored of it most probably after playing a while, but that's with alot of games...  Overall, it's fun to play.
611	1	a	like this game only i cant play it for hours 10/10
613	1	a	Lots of fun if you like shmups or twin stick shooters. Play survival, and don't use bombs! It's a whole new game, and a whole lot more fun.
615	1	a	They just keep coming
617	1	a	I bought this thinking it would just be a geometry wars clone with some dope music. Oh man, I could not have been further off. This game is crack. BUY IT NOW! Srsly, its only $10.
619	1	a	Good twin stick shooter. Feels well balanced. Offers some challenges, looks pretty. RIYL geometry wars. Don't see any obvious flaws. For the price, it's amazing.
621	1	a	This game is pure Awesome! The mecanics (I think I spelled that wrong...) are solid! The music is great! The challenge is real, and I love the comments when done with a round! Just Brilliant! 11/12 though, because I have a pretty good cpu, but still lags quite a bit, especially with 'hold' mode. But that doesn't bother to much!
623	1	a	I love this game! It's the only game that i bought for 1 euro and i have played about 3-4 hours by the time i'm writing this review! It has about 9 modes which you are freely able to choose from which to play.It has nice effects and beautiful colours all over the screen! And an epic/motivating music which fits absolutely into the game!It's really a good game and i recommend it to everyone that wants to spend a euro/dollar or whatever currency you have!
625	1	a	As a happily married man, and loving father of three, I can only say that my family just can't compare to this game. Buy it, and leave your troubles behind. Great prices (usually ~.99) for a great game!
627	1	a	This is a very fun top down shooter! The music is great and the modes are avilable are fun to play as well!  Ifyou like top down shooters this is a good one!
629	1	a	this would be a sweet arcade game at any diner. worth a $1 easy. The game isn't too complicated as a foundation. The small stuff is great, I like that the descriptions of things sound more adult speach than technical writing.
631	1	a	Feels kindoff like playing pacman with an arsenal of guns and bombs at your disposal. Had a blast, no pun intended.  9/10
633	1	a	An extremely fun and simplistic shoot em up top down 'twin stick' shooting game. Its easy to pick up and put down, and with a variety of modes to choose from and the ability to slow time or blow it all up, it is a wonder its not more expensive.
635	1	a	Got it on sale for 0.99â‚¬. Very nice game and not boring at all. Recommended.
637	1	a	Do you like insanely complex and visually striking dual stick shooters? Then look no further. Normally I don't like games without customization, score driven or arcadey-feeling top down shooters. In fact, I ususally hate them. The permadeth reminds me of all the frustrated moments I spent in mcdonalds playing galaga when I was a kid, and normally they get really sickening, really fast. Waves is the only exception. I've already logged a few hours on it, and being the noob I am I die, a lot. But the visuals, the challanging but deceptively simple gameplay, and the complexity of the enemies makes me want more. Slowing down time and setting off your bomb (completely controlled by building combos mind you) is the difference between life as death as the game goes on. Seven different game modes lets you choose what means of firey neon death you want to go out on. In short, the game is beautiful, insanely difficult, and heartpoundingly fun. On top of it all, it's probably the best bang for your buck you'll get in a long time, especially with the sale going on. If you don't have it, get it. Now. Don't even finish reading this. Buy. It's a 10/10 in my books, and by the looks of it I'm not the only one. Thank you Squid in a box. Your sarcasticly beautiful programming and commentary just made this sale worthwhile.
639	1	a	This game is a meth trip and a half 9/10
641	1	a	Awesome game. I like to play it in short bursts and it's always satisfying to play it when you're bored.  Superb controls, great graphics, multiple modes and an awesome soundtrack makes this game a winner that keeps you coming back.  Works very well with a controller.
643	1	a	It has flashy lights!!!! And explosions!!! Also my body is leaking some fluids, I believe this is what you call a scoregasm!
645	1	a	Waves is a unique, fun shooter with great visuals and graphic style, and some good music. Definitely a game worth buying if you enjoy top-down shooters.
647	1	a	Way better than Geometry Wars 3. Music lets you completely zone out into the game.
649	1	a	Great relaxing tool! Love this game!
651	1	a	Addictive game. Music is great and matches the theme. Worth every penny. Hope it is compatible with Mac OS. 10/10
653	1	a	Fast paced to stick action, but its less fun if only with keyboard and mouse controlled.
655	1	a	Great game but like similar games, it can get old pretty fast.
657	1	a	Very classic casual game. worth the penny especially when it's on sale.
659	1	a	in the first few minutes its like 'hey wow, not bad', but as soon as u understand the game mechanics this game just become mindblowing, also it just looks stunning.  10/10 worth every penny
661	1	a	This is one of the best games that I have purchased under $5. Waves is Very Addicting and Intense. While the Soundtrack is outstanding. I highly recommend this game as I have over 10+ hours into it.   Final Verdict 10/10
663	1	a	A great game to just play and relax.
665	1	a	Waves is a great example of what's possible with UDK from an indie perspective. It enjoys beautiful visuals and fast paced action.
667	1	a	Easily compared to Geometry Wars. Ive played both and this by far a better game. Music and controls are top knotch. Just wish there were a few more tracks. Easily worth the $10 or so I paid. Graphics looks great, especially when everything gets hectic and 360 controller works perfectly.
669	1	a	Best score atack game ever!!! + the music is the best time atack music you will ever here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
671	1	a	Best twin-stick gunner crack around!
673	1	a	This shoot 'em up game offers a few different modes to keep you entertained and techno music to keep your mood u. Can I just say I LOVE the smell of exploding geometry?
675	1	a	Well, its not often you stumble across games such as this, a gem of an indie which is both gorgeous to look at and ridiculously addictive. The basic concept is a two stick arcade / high score / challenge type affair, guiding your ball across the 'waves' and defeating various enemies to achieve combo's and bombs. The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.  All in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!
677	1	a	Not a bad game. basicly a copy of a xbox 360 but can not thinnk og the dam thing
679	1	a	great 2 stick shooter
681	1	a	A addictive game that will keep you amused for ages.
683	1	a	Waves is similar to Geometry Wars in the sense that it's a strictly one-arena twinstick shooter. There are no 'natural obstacles' in the arena, just enemies to shoot.  One notable difference is that the sphere the player controls in Waves has momentum, so it won't switch movement directions on a dime. There's also several different game modes.  The enemy cavalcade isn't all that impressive, though, based on what I've seen so far.  The game has plenty of challenge, mind you, for a semi-casual twinstick shooter fan like me, and it also has online scoreboards.  Waves is one of the better twinstick shooters I've played. It's too bad its follow-up failed at Kickstarter.
685	1	a	Wow. This game is awesome. It looks amazing, is really fun, has cool music, and addicting. This game is totally worth the 2 dollers and I would reccomend it to anyone.
687	1	a	This is a great game whit som fun put in the mix
689	1	a	BEWARE TO ANYONE BUYING THIS GAME: This is one of the singlemost additive games of its kind. be prepared to waste alot of your precious time, as this will suck you in like a vacuum cleaner. The only thing I would like to see if a bigger variety in music, as good as the soundtrack is at the moment, it feels way too small (with having only 4-5 tracks). A music update with an extended playlist would be hugely appreciated :3
691	1	a	Recommended litttle game, fun if you are bored or just want something to do.
693	1	a	A fun, though a little graphics intensive, arcade shooter to play through to burn a good couple minutes off. Kinda feels like Geometry Wars+. Similar gameplay, similar attitude, more game modes.
695	1	a	This game is fantastic. I bought this hoping it was similar to geometry wars and it completely blew me away. I love the different game modes that you are able to play. Slowing down time is also a pretty cool feature and allows you to escape without using a bomb. If youre a fan of geometry this is a must!
697	1	a	Not a game about surfing.
699	1	a	Twinstick Shootery Fun!
701	1	a	A game that would be perfectly at home on Xbox, very polished and addictive. Good stuff
703	1	a	lots of fun, easy game play. Quick pick up and play, can be played inbetween waiting for the rest of your team in a different game, or can be played for hours on its own.
705	1	a	Arcade-indie game, I bought it when it had a discount, but totally worth the price it has now!
707	1	a	Geometry Wars on roid really.
709	1	a	A ton of fun with plenty of gamemodes and tasty graphics. If you see this on sale, grab it!
711	1	a	Pretty cool...for like an hour, then get's pretty boring.
713	1	a	This game is truly something magical. It has all the qualities of a 'geometry' shooter along with a beautifull ambient styled soundtrack that will mezmerize you everytime you click the Start Game button. If you've always enjoyed playing ambient shooters, definetly consider buying this one.
715	1	a	this game is cool :3
717	1	a	I've had Waves sitting in my library for some time now, but have only recently gotten around to giving it a solid go. Waves offers up a fairly simple arcade arena shooter. You might associate 'simple' with some sort of negative - not at all. The mechanics on offer here all gel well together to create something that you can pick up for a short playthrough and have a great time.  It would be amazing to see a multiplayer (co-op) mode and see how far you and a friend could get. Given the various game modes on offer, I can imagine some interesting co-op mechanics to keep the pace going.  As it stands, this is a fun little shooter that is perfect to pick up when you have a few minutes of down time.
719	1	a	One of the best twin stick shooter i've played in a while. If your a score junkee or you just like this type of games then i highly recomend it.
721	1	a	One of the best Twin Stick Shooters out there you can WASTE HOURS on this thing trying to get best your score.
723	1	a	Waves is basically the best twin-stick shooter in existence. It is so good that I love it even though I donâ€™t as a rule like twin-stick shooter. Addictive as hell, with multiple fun modes, and ridiculously polished; its only downside is that I now dream of geometric shapes and my thumbs hurt.
725	1	a	Alot like Geometry wars, but in a good way. if your in too high scores and easy/challenging fun, this game is for you.
727	1	a	This is the motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing shiznit.   That is, if you like Geometry Wars, otherwise you'll think it's balls.
729	1	a	Poster child of a twin stick shooter!
731	1	a	So once upon a time there was this guy who made one of the best games of its genre and then he couldn't afford any advertising so nobody bought it and so he was sad and didn't really make a lot of money even though he should have. If you've purchased either Geometry Wars game then you really owe it to this guy to buy his game since he did a way better job than was done on Geometry Wars. It would be like buying Singularity but never buying Halo or Gears or CoD. It's just silly really. So don't be silly, just buy Waves. If you haven't purchased either Geometry Wars games then that's really good because now you don't have to because now you can just buy Waves instead.
733	1	a	Amazing twin stick arcade game like Geometry Wars, with sweet 8 bit music in it. Utterly addictive. Works with 360 controller on PC too.
735	1	a	A fantastic Astroids-esque game. If you've ever played Geometry Wars then this is very similar - in fact, a lot of the game modes are almost identical (with slight twists like bomb pads instead of gates like in Geometry Wars) . That being said, if you're looking for a game to compete against yourself and friends this is it. I've found myself saying 'just one more game' over and over with this one.   My favorite thing about this game is that the duration of play time is totally up to you. If you only have 5 minutes to play, you will still easily be able to play a full round. Likewise... If you have 5 hours to kill, prepare to get mad at yourself and have a blast doing it.  Pros: Great visuals and music, addicting gameplay Cons: Limited selection of game types, leaderboards are implemented poorly and are slow to browse  7/10
737	1	a	Surprisingly Awesome!
739	1	a	A lightshow of a twinstick shooter, set within a round arena, The game typically plays like Geometry Wars, but takes the best from all the Geometry Wars clones over the years and even the bomb chainreaction gameplay from Every Extend and multipliers when you destroy multiple enemies with one shot. There's also a slow mo feature which you have to keep full to use, again, by destroying more enemies in sucession.   The game has it's own flashy 3D style, a very short soundtrack and multiple game modes. There isn't any real incentive to play this game but beating scores and no real level progression, just one arena until you lose all lives/time, unless you play the other modes.  A pretty damn good twinstick shooter. Squid in a box is one to look out for.
741	1	a	Fluid WASD + mouse controls, great graphics, great soundtrack, and refined gameplay... this twin stick shooter basically does everything right. Even the menus are nice. The ability to sparingly slow down time is really useful, as you can never have enough of it and it will save your â™¥â™¥â™¥. Solid recommendation.
743	1	a	Pretty cool, small little game. The basic idea is that you are ball that rolls around shooting other objects to get score. Had several game modes and all of them were decent.  Very colorful and easy to control, and if you get a combo of 10 hits quicky - you get a bomb to use to lose.... but I did wish that there was 'random' powerups - the bomb is the only power up.   You do level up, but I never noticed what leveling up does. Good little game, I played a little under an hour and got 16 achievements. If you love bullet hell style games, you might like this since the twist isn't bullets but instead so many enemies.
745	1	a	Waves is a game very much in the same mold as Geometry Wars: you control a little abstract gun platform and you move and shoot in twin stick fashion with the left stick moving and right stick aiming and shooting. Like most games of this ilk the fun is in the relentless and frenetic action of the unceasing hordes that home in on you and the satisfaction comes from the 'dodging raindrops' finesse you acquire when 'in the zone'. There's even a charging bullet time effect to help you out in a pinch.   As a bonus there's some extra game modes available, but the primary action is the best. There's a trippy electronica soundtrack and a lot of glitzy effects to go with the excellent color palette choices.  My only beef is that there's not an escalating sense of your own lethality which means the climb in intensity levels off and you just continue fending off the frenzy, which while fun can lead to weariness if you're able to pull off a long survival streak. Other than that it's a delight!
747	1	a	If you enjoyed Geometry Wars or anything like it, this might be your new favorite game.
749	1	a	Twin stick shooter heaven! 
751	1	a	Waves is an arcade action game that is slightly less twitchy than Beat Hazard and Scoregasm. The game features a variety of modes that help keep the action refreshing and the addtion of controller support and widescreen modes are welcome. The graphics are not amazing, but the use of a ball instead of a space ship adds a physics element to the challenge missing in other similar titles. The music is average, not particularly bad nor memorable but taken altogether Waves is an above average entry into the field. I recommend this game to anyone who likes either action or strategy, and particularly players that prefer gamepad controller play.
753	1	a	Yes it may be very much like Geometry Wars but it certainly has refined it to a absurd degree in terms of gameplay and design, making it my go-to game for twin-stick shooter fun. The differnt game modes coupled with the numerous enemy types makes me always want to give it one-more-try. Definitely give this a try if you like shooters, puzzle, or twitch like gaming.
755	1	a	One of the best Twin-stick shooters I've ever played. Slow-mo, decent visuals and effects and a pumping soundtrack makes this a must-have for fans of the genre!
757	1	a	A fun small twinstick shooter. Simple yet intuitive mechanics, unique graphics and a good soundtrack. Perfect for some minutes gaming or to relax, though there are still multiple gamemodi so it doesn't get boring aso fast (especially because of the achievements). The enemies are very fun, some spread like viruses and some dogde your shots, it is enjoyable that the longer you play the harder and interesting the enemies become.  Only downpoints is no story, no multiplayer and maybe that sometimes it feels a tiny bit random, but that's a problem of all twinstick shooters I think :P
759	1	a	What an awesome game if you looking at killing time! Insanely fun!
761	1	a	This is one of the nicer dual-stick arcade shooters I've played. It has a relaxed vibe despite all the chaos on-screen, and the many different modes ensure that you'll find at least one way to play that suits you. The concept and execution are great; it's only a shame that due to engine licensing, this game didn't see a release on GNU/Linux. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Beat Hazard or Geometry Wars.
763	1	a	Waves is an awesome fast paced 'arcade' style shooter that for the price is an absolute steal! This game is incredibly addictive, has great graphics and colours, a great selection of different modes from survival to bomb run and also has an amazing retro themed electronic soundtrack to go with it.  Add this all together and you get a great addictive game that you will play for a long time to come, as these types of games don't really get old.. ever!   Would highly recommend and for the price it is 100% worth it! I would give it 9/10.
765	1	a	Waves is a highly entertaining top-down twin-stick shooter. With its retro aesthetic and its frenetic pace combined with a tight gameplay, Waves provides a great arena shooter experience. There is a decent number of modes with interesting rules, and also a good electronic musical score.
767	1	a	This game is AWESOME. its super fun and its worth the money. it is well made and is just, GOOD!   PROS: well made good graphics (i love it)  NOES: CAN be hard to learn how to play CAN be laggy the menus can be hard to work with  RATE: 8,5 / 10
769	1	a	This is a unique twin-stick shooter with great visual effects and sound. A really great game for old-school Asteroids fans.
771	1	a	WOW this game is just so amazing! 100% worth the money
773	1	a	asteroids on acid XD
775	1	a	Twin Stick Arena Shooter. Lots and lots of fun, highscores against your friends and a really good soundtrack to get into it.  
777	1	a	Great game, highly recommended!
779	1	a	Great random fun!
781	1	a	Addictive as hell. I always end up playing longer than I meant to. 10/10
783	1	a	Nice brainless twinstick shooter with extremely flashy visuals. I had no idea I was into chiptunes.
785	1	a	Pretty and manic, it's essentially Geometry Wars with a slow-motion button, but that's not a bad thing.
787	1	a	My hands hurt as I dodge right and swing down the screen, my gun swinging in the opposite direction as I take out the swarm of yellow at close range. In the clear but if I'm going to keep my multiplier I can't dawdle. I veer off towards a growing cluster of explosive death, hitting slow motion to dart between two oncoming enemies. Bomb ready, but if I just hold off for a few moments longer... oh crap.   At the heart of Waves is managing the risk-reward ratio. You can take the game at your own pace, but only by pushing yourself to your limits will you achieve your best scores. In doing so it manages to avoid the frustrating â€˜brick-wallâ€™ that can hamper many other dual-stick shooters. Dying is more often a result of you misjudging your own skill, than it is the game throwing more at you than you can handle, and very rarely a result of anything â€˜unfair.â€™ While as the genre-name suggests Waves works much better with a gamepad, Iâ€™ve found it is easily playable with a keyboard and mouse, albeit at the expense of finer movement control.   The game provides six different game modes, which serve to shift the balance of different elements of the gameplay. Survival, Rush and Crunch Time alter the balance between the need for speed, power and survivability; Bombing Run and Chase require you to move quickly from one target on the arena to another, favouring those with manoeuvrability and path-finding skills. Finally challenge mode is all about accuracy, and conserving your shots for maximal efficiency.   Waves is the first dual stick shooter that has really managed to capture my attention, managing to deliver on â€˜easy to learn, hard to master,â€™ without sticking a vertical cliff in the difficulty curve.
789	1	a	Basically Geometry wars retro evolved meets an elite upgrade. This is the most addictive game I have played in a while. The score board keeps you coming back for more. Chill playing this or take it seriously. Either way. Completely worth the price. 100% Legit. Though you might not enjoy it unless you have a controller. It's not really meant to be played with a Keyboard/mouse. You 'can' play with such but.... I strongly recommend a controller.
791	1	a	Better than geometry wars
793	1	a	Nice game to test your reflexes :)
795	1	a	God help you. God help you all. That drug addiction you kicked? A nervous tic. If your friends describe you as the poster child for addictive personalities, then just click away and save yourself the glorious, swarming, bullet-hell-esque heart ache.  I won't keep hitting you with vague hyperboles, but you need to check this out while getting it is easy. The value you're getting out of this game for $0.99 is stupid. It's simple, but visually it's surprisingly attractive, and there are several game modes to suit your play style. Perhaps the most accurate way I can paint an image for you is by drawing a parallel with Super Meatboy. It's lacks any sort of story depth that Super Meatboy may have, but it has that same lightning-fast, razor's edge pace that demands every ounce of attention you can possibly wring from your brain. That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.  Minimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics. Get this while it's on sale. Seriously. There is not another game on Steam as of this date that is a better buy for $0.99. If you're reading this later, I feel like it may well be worth the regular $5.00 price tag.
797	1	a	!!!
799	1	a	Pros: Pretty damn fun. Feels difficult, but generally without feeling unfair. Looks cool. Controller support is great, best way to play.  Cons: No rebinding. I'd like to bind the bomb and slomo buttons to the buttons instead of the triggers, but I can't. A few of the game modes feel a little unnecessary. Should probably have some kind of gun upgrades or something, it'd spice the game up and give it a lot more replay value, without it, this game gets old a lot faster than other similar games. Pausing is really funky. You can't pause while you're respawning, a process that takes like 5 seconds, an annoyingly long time if you've gotten a bad start to survival mode or something and just wanna restart. And to further the frustration, the menu takes a little too long to come up, and if you're trying to pause in a hurry and aren't sure it came up, you may accidentally unpause it by hitting it again. In a fast-paced game like this, pauses NEED to be instantaneous, nothing feels worse than dying because you were trying to pause.  But, it's $5, which ain't too bad, so unless any of those things are a dealbreaker, I still recommend it. Good few hours of fun to be had here. If they add more weapons/guns/bullets or whatever, and maybe some gamemodes that aren't just bouncing around a circle, like an actual map, then it's a must have.
801	1	a	i cant aim right 
803	1	a	one of the most fun twin-stick shooter out there. It starts off slow then puts you on steroids after a while
805	1	a	this game is the best. it reminds me of astriod but with some new things in it
807	1	a	10/10 Would run from hugz again This game is perhaps one of the most casual games in the casual section. Passive-aggresive narator? hilarious! help screen with an attitude? gut busting! purple rollys aimlessly want hugz orange rollys desperately want hugz and then the green rollys have an existential crisis over the matter!  while the hour count doesn't seem high each game is a fast-paced, short lived run and gun from geometric cuddles
809	1	a	Strategy + Sarcasm + Shapes = Waves
811	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in soundtrack and some great mechanics. Seeing how far you can push your combos feels great, and the alternate modes offer some satisfying spins on the traditional challenge. I was personally very motivated by the leaderboards and trying to catch up to friends' scores. If you like twin-stick shooters, definitely give this one a spin.
813	1	a	Shoot shoot shoot shoot  Points points points points Just one more OK ??
815	1	a	Very addictive,you really should play this game.
817	1	a	More challenging than Geometry Wars, however there is a severe lack in diverse polygon-based enemies
819	1	a	Fun game and not too expensive. Graphics seem to drag on my card pretty hard though.
821	1	a	I quickly grew to like this game and the subtle variations in play modes. The scoring is well done and visually its appealing. The ample number of achievements have been satisfying to complete. The interface allows for easy navigation and there are plenty of options. One minor omission is the inclusion of auto-fire, especially since there is no restriction on the amount of ammunition shot. I have no major complaints with the game itself however it does leave me with cramps from the rapid mouse movements needed to spray the hordes of nasties. 7/10
823	1	a	Simple but the best game you can get with that amount of money.Very fun and it's basically a very good chill game.
825	1	a	I kind like remind of Geometry Wars
827	1	a	If you're a fan of dual stick shooters already, waves is a very solid one. The gimmick here is that you can slow down time when you've charged up your meter enough, and this simple but satisfying mechanic really is enough to make it stand out. The avatar also has a bit of momentum to it, making it feel a bit different to control than other shooters.  Honestly, there isn't much to say. You probably already know if you like this style of game. It's fast-paced arcade action with replay value for as long as you can entertain yourself beating your own high scores. If you're looking for an exciting, flashy game to keep you entertained for a week or two, Waves is a pretty fantastic deal.
829	1	a	In this game, you can realise your fantasy of being a giant ball that shoots pellets. I know I did. I reccomend you buy this game on sale; I got it for a little under a quid, which is neato.  PROS: - Simple gameplay - Great music - Varied enemies - Awesome controller support - Witty menu text.  CONS: - Not really any cons, but the shooting can be a little finicky at times.   Graphics: 10/10 Sound + Music: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: n/a
831	1	a	- Realy cool game, you are a Ball that shoots even more balls with flashy effects. 7/10 :D
833	1	a	OK, here is the test for whether you should get this game. Go play some free twin-stick shooter, like Echoes. Did you like it? Then you're going to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game. The controls are awesome and tight. The enemies are all interesting and unique. But the coolest part is the mechanics. The 4 moves are: Move, shoot, bomb, and slow down time. The first two are self explanitary, after a ten hit combo you have a second to activate a bomb, and you slowly charge a buffer, that can slow down time and get you double points while you do so 'because it looks awesome'. Oh, and you also get double points for shooting enemies at point blank 'because it looks awesome'. This game is awesome.
835	1	a	you shoot things its fun and cheap give it a try
837	1	a	After playing this you are left wondering where all the time in your day went to. Very addictive!
839	1	a	Beautifully made game, enthralling and addictive.
841	1	a	Your basic twin-shooter, well polished. Worth having in your library for when you just want to play something short and fun. Watch the Lets play vid:  https://youtu.be/cu0RUB2iWIA 
843	1	a	One of my favorite arcade games. I swear at it fairly regularly.
845	1	a	If you have a controller, get this game. It's fun to play with a great art style, no idea how they can keep dropping it so low in sales it's such a great game.
273	0	a	Runs crazy slow in 1920x1080 even though I have a laptop with a gtx 860m graphics card, 12gb of ram and an i7 processor. I love the game but the performance makes it unplayable for me. If it was fixed I would whole heartedly love this game!
847	1	a	Disco Just Won't Cut It This Time!!!!!!!!!!
849	1	a	Solid twin shooter with the amazing artist Smiletron providing one of the best chip tunes sound tracks ever. Would buy again just for the music alone.
851	1	a	One of my favorite time killers. Got it in a random bundle years ago and I still come back to it frequently.
853	1	a	This game is amazing!  Sold at a very cheap price too. It's a very nice game to just play when your bored. c:
855	1	a	Awesome twin stick shooter with great visuals that arent too overbearing, solid difficulty and a variety of modes to choose from. Can't wait to see what these guys do with WavesÂ² because this game is one of the best twin stick shooters around.
857	1	a	Simple concept, great soundtrack, really fun to play when you're bored... Unfortunately the volume of music is not always consistent and listening to the voice tell you the explosives are armed every 10 seconds in Bombing Run can get a bit annoying. Otherwise very fun casual little game.   Also it enjoys reminding you of how bad you are at playing it
859	1	a	Really Really Really Fun game. I try my hardest to get the highest score in one of the game modes, but I fail.
861	1	a	Amazing game, worth buying in my opinion. of course if you like colors and some explosions inside battlefield  
863	1	a	Fun as hell, trippy and colorful, kick â™¥â™¥â™¥ music. What more could you ask for?
865	1	a	a fun little bullet-hell for you to enjoy, as always the game starts of simple at first but then evolves into something where every second counts and one wrong step could end that perfect score of yours
867	1	a	Well designed wave based shooter.
869	1	a	This game pisses me off that's why i recommend it for 99 cent its worth it. Just shoot sht and make high scores what more do you want to know that's pretty much the entire point of the game might I add it will p!ss you off to. lol Game enegine is Unreal 3 aswell so should run well on older PCs. INI tweaks might can push little more blinginess outta graphics just dont do allow dx11 it wont start every other tweaks and increased texture res works fine (advanced knowledge of them config files you might want to have else might screw things up i recommend you go to UDK site for unreal 3 enegine learn what does what before you jump balls deep into the ini tweaking)
871	1	a	Incredibly addicting and engaging. Looks and feels fantastic. Easy to pick up and great for small sessions. If you're doing well in Waves, you feel like you're in a trance. It's become my comfortgame.
873	1	a	I have homework due tonight but i have time for one last game..
875	1	a	Pros: Really fun Reminds me of old arcade games Looks nice A bunch of different gamemodes  Cons: It gets repetitive
877	1	a	Twin-Stick shooter AWESOMENESS!!!
879	1	a	This is very like Geometric War but with small differences. Because of thoses it makes a totaly different game and the music is awesome. The acheivements are great too. 1$ and I had alot more fun than with the 25$ piece of c*@p Hard west that I cant even finish the game becaue of a bug.... Well have a good time and enjoye the ride
881	1	a	Good, simple, arcadey fun. I have to make the inevitable comparison to Geometry Wars, which is plays very similarly to. Where that game has more diverse enemies, this one has more diverse game modes. Also, where Geometry Wars's control scheme really was optimized for dual analog sticks, Waves plays just as well with a mouse &amp; keyboard.
883	1	a	Waves has a bit of a learning curveyou wouldn't expect from a twin stick shooter but is a very, very, very addictive game. Does it have a story? No. But it makes up for it with really pretty explosions, an interesting slow-mo mechanic and a killer soundtrack.
885	1	a	  Amazing music you guys can break the bank with this soundtrack alone.
887	1	a	This game is the best. On steam you dont find many games like this game in particular. I love this game because it has a lot of shooting and tons of action. And the more you are in the game, the more intense it gets. I would prefer you to get it now. Because its $0.99 right now. SO GO AND BUY THIS FREAKING AWESOME GAME
889	1	a	A fun twin stick shooter similar to Geometry wars.
891	1	a	I have a soft spot for twin-stick shooters: they're some of the purest arcade style shooters available, and with the simplistic control scheme joined with the even simpler gameplay style, I'm very rarely disappointed with them. Is Waves worth a check out? You betcha.  For anyone that doesn't know, a twin-stick shooter is exactly that: the left stick controls you, the right stick aims where you shoot. Easy peasy. The arcade classic Asteroids can be seen as one of, if not the, first twin stick. So with Waves the premise remains the same: see brightly colored geometric shape, aim at it, and watch a pretty display of particles explode out from it. The more shapes you blow up, the more points you get. Blow up enough shapes in quick succesion, the higher combo you attain. High combo means more points. Points are life.  Waves breaks up the monotony by implementing a slow down mechanic based upon an ever replenshing gauge: use it to get out of hairy situations or to rack up bonus points. Waves also utilizes a bomb system in which you're awarded bombs based upon your score, but only for a short moment. Miss your chance to use it and it's gone.  Waves has a nice selection of gameplay modes, but if there was one issue I had with it, it's that they're all a little short (except for Survival of course.) Each mode has its own score boards, which is cool, and the variety keeps the game from becoming boring.   The visuals are nice, the music is pleasing, and the gameplay is tight. If you like Geometry Wars, or simple arcade shooters in general, this is certainly worth the purchase.
893	1	a	very nice game, coming from Super Hexagon and Race the Sun this is one of the best sparetime fillgames on Steam
895	1	a	8.9/10  I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Geometry Wars. The gameplay and graphics are very similar.  I would think they were made by the same team, but I'm too lazy to fact check that.  The music is great as well, and one of the few games i would consider purchasing the soundtrack for... but i didn't... because I'm a cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥.   Solid twin stick shooter.
897	1	a	This game is pretty addicting
899	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. The graphics are great and the gameplay is very addictive. However, the best part of this game is deffinitely the soundtrack as it is just amazing.   10/10 would definitely recommend picking this game up.
901	1	a	Let's just say that this is the game that I wanted voted for the Love/Hate Relationship award. Trying to go achievement hunting with this game  almost made me cry ;_;  made me extremely furious, but I just LOVE the music and all the shooting. Just. Pure. Shooting. And explosions, and slow motion, but yeah. AMAZING, BUT NOT REALLY
274	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game with plenty of replayability. There's no one set strategy to playing, which makes online play fun and engaging. Most of the players online are speedy and will play through the entire game, even if they're losing.  The addition of achievements has added some of the fun into playing with bots back into the game, even for long time players like me.  Unfortunately, the lastest update has virtually broken the game. Not because they changed the design or moved where things are, but because the client won't manage to stay connected for more than a single game, if you can manage to get the server to stay connected that long.  I can't, in good concious, reccomend this game until a massive patch is pushed through. Pick this game up, with a few map packs, while it's on sale, but have patience.
275	0	a	I cannot unfortunately recommend the latest update of this beloved game.  Put quite simply, the AI has changed from somewhat rational and predictable humanlike AI into completely braindead train-layers who will overlay multiple routes to get from A to B. Further, the layout of the game screen and buttons has changed, making gameplay confusing.   The prior iterations of this game were sublime; this one is a drag.
276	0	a	The last update is a disaster. Instead of normal online game you now get something with 'notifications' that spam your inbox (sound effects notifying your turn were obviously found not useful and are now used when you end your turn), graphics wants to bite your eyes out and whoever did the design forgot to play the game at least once to see how it works (adding new ticket always showed you where the towns you need are, now you can't see it because there's random stuff flashlighted on the map)  Don't fix something that ain't broken?
903	1	a	The PC adaption (and iPad/iPhone versions too, for that matter) of Ticket to Ride is a very faithful recreation of the classic board game, where the only gameplay differences between it and the physical version are fast and accurate scoring and the fact that enraged board-flipping is no longer a possibility. (Not to mention the bonus of the game + DLC being cheaper than their physical counterparts, and is significantly easier to play with people on the other side of the world!) So, for people who have played the board game before, I think this should be a no-brainer.  However, I wrote this review for those who aren't aware of the greatness that is Ticket to Ride and are seeing this from a bystander's point of view. You might be thinking that this is just some boring train game played only by weird people who smell funny, as a diversion from their regular riveting pastime of watching grass grow. However, I can assure you that this is most certainly the opposite of the truth.  Ticket to Ride is, in actual fact, quite a tense game that can quite easily take you from absolute confidence in your position to having all your hopes and dreams shattered, as you realise that you didn't take that vital Los Angeles &gt; Las Vegas track yet due to over-confidence, that you had multiple 20+ point routes hinging on! Not to mention the level of back-stabbing and collaboration that can come into play (especially with the Steam overlay making this oh so easy), that can easily create bitter feuds between two rival rail barons, which can last across a series of games.  Overall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, classic example of a game that's easy to learn, but difficult to master. It's always a good game to play with friends, strangers or alone with bots, especially as each game tends to only go for 45 minutes at most. (Although you can quite easily find that time has flown, as you wind up having rematch after rematch, without noticing the time passing by!)
905	1	a	Outstanding PC adaptation of a classic board game.  Each turn a player takes a couple of train cards or spends those cards in order to place trains on pre-defined routes. Completing some objectives like a continuous route between two particular cities earns the player more points.  So the game is both about strategy of choosing what routes to use and how to achieve that, while also denying your opponents from achieving their targets.  The game is well balanced and the DLC additions while far from necessary certainly add to the longevity of the game if you find yourself enjoying the mechanics. Surprisingly for a game like this, the AI is decent. However in most cases it is not difficult to win if you have even a modicum of strategy.  If you've always wanted to try a board game on PC then this is a good place to start.
907	1	a	Very nice board game to play between 2 and 4 people, also supports cross-platform (windows and android).
278	0	a	This was a good game. However, they have updated it a couple of times and each time the game got worse. The game itself is good, though it would be nice if you could change the diffulculty settings (it's fairly easy). The artstyle was better in previous versions, but the worst part is that the settings don't work anymore (for example the fast speed button is broken). And worst of all is the increasing amount of banners, pop-ups and other commercial in-game activity that cannot be shut down. Verdict: good game, but increasingly annoying interface. Buy on sale for low price.
909	1	a	Ticket to Ride is board game brilliance. For those who love tabletop games the PC version of Ticket to Ride is a must buy. If you've never played a Eurogame, or are looking to get into board games, TtR is one of the best places to start.
911	1	a	One of the best board to PC translations around, and the DLC makes the sometimes... eclectic nature of the game more accessible. Tunnels? Ferries? Dutchmen? What are these random markers? All solved by the included docs. Also, tons of drawings of trains. I do love me some trains.
283	0	a	This pains me to have to not recommend this game. It used to be awesome. I played it for many hundreds of hours on ipad before getting it here. I played this game once here before the updates, and it was great other than not being able to use my ipad account to play here. It's understandable though, so not a huge deal. Just really didn't like having to start over in karma.  I can't even get into a game to play anymore because nobody wants to play with low karma players. I know how to play, I just don't look like it before I even start to play. This is only an issue NOW because before it didn't matter what your karma was, they couldn't kick you out for it. I get why people would want that feature added, so it's great for those who don't have to start from the beginning.  I tried starting my own game. The new game making system was just tacked in there, and there are loads of new options which aren't very clearly explained. The UI is horribly messy. On the old system, you could make a game for 5 people and start it before you get that many people with the push of a button if you changed your mind or didn't want to wait for that many people. You can't do that anymore. You just have to wait for the board to fill up with the specific amount, or go back and change the settings and then wait for people to show up again as doing that removes the game you had already created.  I never got the chance to experience what the online game itself was like after the update though as the game forever said it was waiting for new players. There was no button to start the game. I was just left waiting for something to happen. 10 minutes waiting for something to happen when you have your game seats filled is rediculous. I couldn't even tell them what was going on as the chat wasn't working. It's very broken. I don't know if this is just the mac version of the game that experiences these play glitches, but it wasn't very enjoyable.  So, here's to hoping they fix this once brilliant game. There was no need to retrofit new gameplay options in. If it aint broke, don't fix it.
913	1	a	Perfect adaptation of the board game! Looks and sounds nice, if you know the original (and like it) you won't be disappointed. You can play it offline if you want or with friends or strangers online. It's fun either way. There's even a pass n' play mode added in a recent update. I only wish there were more maps available (e.g. Nordic Countries).  Note: an option for limiting the time one can spend in a round would be useful, because quite often you are forced to wait long seconds for other players.
915	1	a	Played about 3 hours of this game, girlfriend played the other 208.  Lot of free time! 10/10
284	0	a	This is a fun game to play with friends, I have many more hours playing the actual board game.  Draw cards, place trains, complete routes for continental domination.  HOWEVER, the online playerbase is not big... at all. And a fair number of players will only accept you in game if you have a certain rating or higher.  I do enjoy the game itself so I bought the DLC.. have not yet played on any DLC maps. Most players just play on the classic map.  It would be nice if there was a reward or achievement system to make the game a bit more gratifying.. but there is not.  If you have friends that like it and want to play, I sure won't stop you. But for the price of this game, I would say invest elsewere.  5/10
285	0	a	A new Version is out. Sadly, now it's very buggy and feels unpolished.  Furthermore, the DLC prices are very expensive. The new board India costs currently just as much all the other boards together. I can't really understand it, because I bought the complete pack and now it's not complete anymore and I will never pay so much for a single board.  I change this review, when the bugs are fixed. This game needs a Patch for all these little problems. Because, I like this game and the loading times are now extremly improved.  If this game is on sale you can already buy it. :)  But not for the regular price for the actual status! :( There are sound bugs, cursor bugs (invisible mouse), (high score bugs?), crashes and more and still not patched.
286	0	a	Was a good game until recent 'update'. Now it is much slower and more cumbersome with useless graphics and sound. Want the old version back. This is poorly done.
917	1	a	If you love the game, buy this. DLC are ongoing, but they can be found on sale regularly.  Or wait for the rare bundle.
288	0	a	This was a great game, perfect in its simplicity, but as others have said, the latest update is terrible. The mobile version has also stopped working for several of my friends, who purchased the game separate of their PC versions. I thought of doing the same, but I'm glad I didn't. If you're going to charge people for both the PC and mobile version, it's a bit of a jerk move to suddenly change the framework of the game so that it doesn't work for mobile users.
919	1	a	Sometimes I just can't take the death stares of my wife and children as I utterly crush them for the 5000th time at this game. Now I don't have to hear that I'm way to serious about tiny plastic trains for a grown man.
289	0	a	Can not recommend after recent update.  AI will just hoard cards until there is nothing left in the draw pile - not enjoyable anymore.
290	0	a	Didn't like the new version.  The animation finishing a run was annoying.  The ability to bypass the score counting is gone now. Wastes too much time.  I won't be playing much now.
291	0	a	The latest update (11/19/2015) adds animations and sounds that are distracting and reduce my enjoyment of the game and cannot be turned off. The new map has added details that are (at least initially) distracting. I was playing this a lot, but I think I won't be playing it as much now.
292	0	a	At the beginning it was really a cool game, remind me the boards games I got at home. I decide to replay this after a couple of year off...  I did try all the different bot and maps... and i was really frustrating, game feel slower than before, bot were not at all playing objectives, they just build road beginning with those who get the more point till they don't have wagon left. 6 games, none of the bots made an objectives... -_- I like this game, but playing with those bot no way.   If you want this game play online with human being, seems ok but don't buy it to play alone.
293	0	a	Over the last month there has been several server issues effecting most players, there doesn't appear to be anywhere to get support and haven't been given a time line to get this fixed.
921	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a casual train based card game where you have to complete routes to destination cities. This is accomplished by drawing color coded train cards and placing those cards on the map. You score points based on the train length and completion of train routes. Game ends when a player runs out of train cars and the player with the most points wins. Pretty simple gameplay, but there is some strategy underneath it all. If you find yourself struggling to find something else to play, I suppose this can fill the gap.
923	1	a	Excellent version of the board game. Accurate to the rules and play of the board game. Provides a great way to play if you don't have the physical game or want to play with a bunch of people.
925	1	a	One of the better board games for the whole family!
927	1	a	I just recently discovered this wonderful Eurogame during Game Night at a friend's house - and was instantly hooked! The online version is every bit as good as the board game, especially since the solo play allows me to polish my skills and learn the ropes before taking on opponents online.
297	0	a	The game itself is fun, but the connectivity was never amazing, and it now doesn't work on OSX at all after a random update.
298	0	a	In principle I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoys the original board game, as it is a very good digital realization of a very good analog original. Enough has been said about the game mechanics etc. in other posts, and just as most I do enjoy a nice round of planing, scheming and backstabbing against/with other real players.  But there's another aspect which forced me to give a negative rating: Under Ubuntu 14.04 (as well as all other Linuxes according to the TTR steam forum), the DLCs do not work any more after the last update, meaning I cannot play on the additional maps I paid for! The publisher is aware of the problem, yet a solution is not in sight.  As soon as this problem is resolved, I will change my review as the game itself is fine. But as nothing has changed over the last two months, I can't help do feel deceived so far.
299	0	a	The update has ruined the game. The server crashes all of the time! I like the new graphics but am considering not playing for awhile until the bugs are worked out.
929	1	a	I can not recommend this game enough. I loooove the board game version, and I am so happy that there is an online one that I can log in and play for hours. It's fun and almost feels like the real one ( I say almost cause nothing beats the face of a friend when you block them ). If you ever played and enjoyed the board game, you'll love this one too. And you can almost always find someone online to play with, wich is great. But even if you don't you can always practice with the offline version against the cpu. If you are new to the world of ticket to ride, give it a go and you will not regred it. It is really easy to learn and you can have fun for hours. Suddenly you'll find yourself trying to persuade some of your friends to tag along. If you still not sure, go rent from your local library and try it, then you'll definatelly get it. What are you waiting for? Do it...
300	0	a	Buy the board game version instead. This game is built in Java and I don't have to tell you why thats a bad idea. Steam page doesn't mention this either...
301	0	a	Say's it's touch friendly but is terrible on the surface pro 3. Have to play in windowed mode as otherwise it displays only a quarterof the screen! Also can't play online due to an unspecified error, shouldn't have bought the complete pack without trying it oit first. The iPad version of the same game works much better
931	1	a	Played this as a board game. It's fun no matter how played.
302	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a great game, and worked fine for a long time.  Unfortunately a recent update (November 2015) has made everything so much worse, and it's honestly one of the worse updates to a game I've ever seen with tons of bugs. Now there are graphical glitches, buttons don't work, there's multiplayer connectivity problems, the AI is worse, unnecessary route completion animations are present, the end-game score count is slow, and so on. Until these are fixed I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  There was nothing to warrant this update, so I don't understand why the producers would trash a game that was working extremely well. Seems like a waste of time and effort. Don't fix that which isn't broken!
303	0	a	If you liked the Ticket to Ride game for windows,I would not buy this package of all the games.I did and I'm sorry.The game crashes continually,and it does not look the same[and the robots cheat]Very dissatisfied!I would like a refund and my old game back,but they[at steam]don't seem to want to be gotten a hold of.[tried many times,and ways.
933	1	a	The PC version stays true to the formula and offers both single and online play. Online play comes with your standard chat room where you can create games and invite friends (or strangers) to test your mettle. If youâ€™re the anti-social sort, like me, you can play against the AI. There are also other maps available for purchase via DLC in case you get tired of seeing the USA map. Thereâ€™s not much else to say besides that the PC version works well and is easy on the eyes. The electronic version is nice to play for when you donâ€™t have a lot of time to set up and clean up the board game version. If youâ€™re a fan of light strategy games or â€œTicket to Rideâ€ in general, then I highly recommend picking this up.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P_SdBudZC8  
306	0	a	Horrible AI. The computer players seem to care less about completing their routes and more about getting as many trains laid down as possible. Very frustrating when you're working on a couple overlapping transcontinental routes and the AI ends the game before you can complete them.
307	0	a	The latest update of this game is a real let down. It worked wonderfully before. As many folks have indicated, the AI is horrid. Previous AI was more human like. All it does is lay down tracks. I don't think I've seen the AI pick additional destination tickets aside from the first ones it picks. I wish there was a setting for choosing the AI's pattern/thought. Why did they feel the need to update?  As it is, I can't recommend it. The board game itself is great, but I don't enjoy it like I did before the update.
308	0	a	It was better before the update. If there were setting to toggle some of the new 'features' it wouldn't be too bad.
309	0	a	I have played this game for ov er three years and love it. Then someone decided to make this game harder to play and even egt on to it if you have an older v ersion of software . I cannot get on tho the qame today when i click on play . Yesterday I must have lucked out and foun \d the right combinAtion after many tries. I have noticed that when i WAS PLAYINFG NO ONE LIKED THE NEW SET UP' I HAVE NOT WON A GAME ON IT YET BECAUSE I NEV ER KNEW HOW MANY OF THE COPORED TICKETY\S I HAD TO USE. THE ONLY WAY I GOT ON IT THE FIRST DAY WAS BECAUSW\E i HAD HELP FROM AN IT MAN. iT DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY IT SAYS BECVAUSE i HAVE cHROME , SO I HAVE DELETED CHROMWE AND IT STILL SAYS i HAVE CHROME . NOT A HAPPY PLAYER ANYMORE . hARD TO RECOMEND THIS GAME IN THE PRESENT STATE .
310	0	a	After a year of good use, Ticket to Ride has ceased functioning. Support is had to access. I have tried what is suggested in forums and have no way to directly inform Steam or Days of Wonder of my problem.  Steam initiates normal logon, but then cuts to a black screen--no messages.  At Days of Wonder all attempts to 'play' directly similarly lead to a non-even, a white screen invoting me to check out or purchase products.  Both show my account in good standing. How do I access an EFFECTIVE repair. I've spent 90 minutes trying what you a;lready suggest.
935	1	a	Quite good. Works good when you don't have any real people to play the normal boardgame with.
937	1	a	Easy to learn, not hard to master, and as addicting as chocolate crack. Pick it up so we can pounce each other!
312	0	a	It was fun until the latest update...
939	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun game. It involves a little strategy and a little competition. I like playing both the board game and the video game. The video game is nice when I don't have time or space to set up the board game.
941	1	a	Tickt to Ride is a RISK Sim that plays as well and can grow to become just as intense. Get yourself a few friends and grab a boxset of this game and have a load of fun. Games last around 1hr per game and i wouldn't reccomend the add-on packs, they are pricey and unless you have a fetish for different names places it really won't change the game at all. save your pennys and wait for them to go on sale.   A fun game for 2-5 players. and a very easy to use and stylish interface. :)
943	1	a	My group of friends is very into board games, however we live hundreds of miles away from each other. Therefore, Ticket to Ride seemed like a good idea (and it was). I will say that interface-wise, what you see is what you get: it is a true-as-can-be replication of the board game with a little bit of sound. After some initial futzing around, the game client is relatively easy to operate. Joining games can be a little odd, and because the game was designed for mobile devices, clicking can be a bit off at times (CTRL acts as a drag or double click or something). Given these minor bugs, being able to play a board game with friends faraway is a win in my book, even if the controls lag out once in a while. At the end of the day, the game is solid and does what it should. Plus, it has a wistful harmonica melody that will haunt your dreams while adding atmosphere to your game about railroads!  PROS: stays true to it's physical counterpart, online play, no sorting of little plastic trains! CONS: wonky controls, more misclicks than I would like
315	0	a	Used to be a good game. Then they revamped, added more DLC, and added pop-up ads in the game. Are you serious?
945	1	a	A great virtual adaption of the board game with a big mess to clean up. Online works well. I almost always play online with my husband. Single player mode works great too. Ticket to Ride is a great strategy game. The player who scores the most wins... lots of ways to score: completing routes, placing trains on the board, making the longest train, and more. Simple to pick up and get started, but with enough depth and complexity to keep you coming back for more. :)
947	1	a	Great digital version of the traditional board game. Being able to play with friends online, having the scores tallied and seeing highlighted routes makes this game easier to play more frequently.
949	1	a	CONS:  No real trains to handle You can't see the faces of people as you take that one route that all their tickets hinge on No way to change the starting handsize since every few turns is just hoarding train cards anyway No quit button: You can't get off this ride  PROS:  Table is unflippable No downtime compared to the physical game Game does all the maths and calculations for you Highlights the main ticket you're looking at and keeps other tickets in green so you can snake along No quit button: You can't get off this ride  CONCLUSION:  send help i can't get off this ride
951	1	a	A very good digital adaptation of the real board game. Great way to practice for when you want to demolish your friends in real life, and for learning the rules.
953	1	a	Great boardgame which is just as great online.
955	1	a	It is exactly like the board game. In some ways it is better than the board game, it goes a lot faster and it highlights your ticket routes saving a lot of time. I was pleasantly suprised when ALL the versions of the board game were available in this. Lots of fun, although, the game is kind of buggy somtimes.
957	1	a	You can play Solo, or Multiplayer (online, hotseat, or LAN)! Simple but fun game, and well made.
959	1	a	A decently fun and quick, if highly random, game. There is one strategy tip that, once you learn it, kind of ruins the game, but it's a pretty fun family game if you don't know about that strategy. Overall, it's an OK time waster against some bots or whatever.
961	1	a	Great board game, even better PC game. It is impossible to stop after one game.
963	1	a	Digital version of the board games. So uhhh, you know. Play the crap out of this so you'll annihilate your real life friends! Assuming you have any!  Whatev. 5 / 12
965	1	a	Extremely great board game, and even greater digital game. Totally Addictive. Definitley not your grandpa's train game.
967	1	a	I have the actual board game and I can honestly say that, if you've figured out the menus, it plays exactly like the physical game. It's cross platform structure makes it so that you always have someone to play with online, if you buy it on sale it's ridiculously cheap and the music is great! I rate it 7/10, menus should be better.
969	1	a	Curator Review:  The basic premise is simple: Get destination tickets, play trains to connect cities, and count up points at the end! Don't finish a ticket? Too bad! Looks like you are losing points instead.   https://youtu.be/pYC09LBTMmw?list=PLNgi8N_NMkfgtvdIvd-cSHlnkGJM713cH 
971	1	a	Plays just like the board game. If you enjoyed playing this game with family and friends, but have moved or are otherwise prevented from gathering around the physical board game, this is a great way to hang out and relive those days.
973	1	a	Great adaptation for a board game classic!
975	1	a	If you like the game board, you will most probably like this and play it over and over again. Nicely done board game adaptation with beautiful boards. You can choose the map you want to play (but you have to buy every map separately) and the number of players. You can play online with others (ranked, not ranked, private, publi, etc.)
977	1	a	Great casual game to play with friends. Easy to pick up and fun to play. Can't wait till they add more of the board types. If they ever do that is.
979	1	a	Lots of fun. Plays well as an online boardgame and doesn't take long to play but is something you can keep playing and always a little different.
981	1	a	This was an excellent game! I played the board game version for years before I played this game and it's a really fun way to play on the go!
983	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a faithul adaptation of the award-winning german-style board game of the same name. It's very easy to learn and matches last just the right time. The presentation is a bit lacking though and some of the social experience is lost on translation from tabletop to computer screen but still it's one of those games I believe anyone should try. Get the DLC boards too, they add a nice measure of variety.
985	1	a	Being new to board games on PC i wasn't sure what to expect, but the simplicity of the game is great, without prior knowledge of the game it can pretty much be played straight away with minimal referal to the rules and then picked up more in-depth as you go along, enjoyable to play, and the computer bot seems to adjust its tactics which is fun but difficult at times!! overall a fun way to spend a couple of hours
987	1	a	TTR has been one of my favorite games to play for a long time. The steam version is enjoyable and is true to the table top version.
989	1	a	Amazing fun game with friends. Would definately recommend, and would say that you'll get hours of fun out of it!
326	0	a	Help .... Ticket to ride -Europe can not find tutorials in the game ? I have no idea to play with this DLC.
991	1	a	Quite a fun game and what makes it really cool as that you can use the PC version to play against android and apple users.
327	0	a	Way too expensive for what it is and not suited for PC  Buy on iPad and save money
993	1	a	My boyfriend bought me this in order to force me to play with him and in all honestly I didn't think it'd be my type of game at all..boy was I wrong! I absolutely love it..even more so than him now lol.  It's a great online board game, one of the best, if not  the  best.  There's always people online to play against which is definitely a major plus.  It's fun for the odd game when you're bored or if you want to play hours I still find it entertaining.  The DLC add a fair bit of variety to tracks too!   As you can see I've racked up a lot of hours in this and that'll just continue to grow :)  A 10/10 from me.
995	1	a	Ticket to Ride is an adaptation of a popular board game, with the ability to play against AI, or local or online opponents. The board game has a pretty simple rule set that's easy to learn, and it has some good strategic complexity. I haven't been playing it for all that long, but I've definitely enjoyed what I've played so far.  I found the voice acting obnoxious and turned it off immediately. The music grates after a little while, but you can turn that off too. The game controls pretty well and shows a lot of useful information on screen. The menus are a bit clunky, and this actually makes it a little difficult to get in to the online game lobby.  But really, what matters is the gameplay, and Ticket to Ride has great gameplay. I had fun playing against AI and against humans, and there's tons of replay value. This game will definitely be worth it for board game enthusiasts at full price. I'd still recommend it to anyone that can appreciate a strategic, turn-based game. As for the DLC, it allows you to play on different maps, sometimes with different rules. If you like the base game, the expansions will add quite a bit.
997	1	a	All the joy and fun of Ticket To Ride without the hassles of tidying up after every session.
999	1	a	Fun to play with your Girlfriend!
1001	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends or people on the internet!
1003	1	a	Great as a board game, fun on the PC too. Just wish it had some better graphic settings for high resolution... and if you could slow the gameplay down to see what your opponents are drawing. Sometimes it can go too fast.
1005	1	a	love this game it super fun !
1007	1	a	All aboard!  Ticket to ride began as an award winning board game made by Days of Wonder along with, Shadows over Camelot, Memoirs, Mystery Express, SmallWorld 1&amp;2, and other titles. It is a casual turn-based strategy game, based upon the board game with the same name, and it is one of the best adaptations thus far.   Game play:  is just about identical to the board game. You have two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo such as black or pink, and destination cards which feature two city destinations, like Los Angeles and New York. Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them.   Each of the players are also dealt six train cards and with that, the game begins. Each player takes turns in either drawing two face down cards from the top of the deck, two trains from the lineup (Not including rainbow carts as they account for your two), or place trains on the map and claim routes to your complete your destination cards and gain points. You also lose points for each route you don't complete, same per the board game.  2 to 5 players can face off, either as a single player game vs. the AI or online against human opponents. AI bots can also be added to online games to bolster the number of players.   Graphics:  reflects the charming old feel of the board game quite true to form and really brings out the atmosphere of it as a whole. The maps in which you can play on are always really well defined, easy to read, see were you were at and where you were going. I do however feel that your trains and your opponents trains on the map could have been slightly better defined to make them stand out more.    Audio:  also holds well to the atmosphere and feel of the game, but after a while the same piano music track grates on your nerves and you tend to find yourself diving into the settings to shut it up and put some of your own music on.  This is where I delve into the biggest gripes I have with Ticket to Ride...   Gripes and Cons:  The layout of the menus are appalling. It honestly feels like they have taken a horrible old 90's layout and stuffed it in here. You have annoying and un-skippable voice acting as you go into every single menu and every cardboard cut-out of a character in the menus have something to say, which is the same infuriating audio each time you even so much put your cursor near them. This drove me insane.   Also, playing online with friends is made to be so obtuse, unclear and can be quite difficult to actually set up a game, because rather than being integrated with the steam interface, is goes through a backwards setup of making a profile on the Days of Wonder page to make your name easier to find, add the other person who has gone through the same process and try to let it ''find friends'' or if by some chance you can locate them yourself, adding them is just as tedious. This may just be me nitpicking, but it was something that bothered me intensely.   Final Conclusion:  Regardless of it's flaws, it is by far the best adaptation of the board game. Whether you have played it physically or not, it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a bit of strategy and board game adaptations.
1009	1	a	Best India game on STEAM.
1011	1	a	I bought this game two years ago and it was sitting in my pile of games to play. A recent update saw me click on it to see what it was about. That was two days ago. I am really enjoying this game. It doesn't tale long to pick up the game play although I've got to admit I was still a bit lost after the tutorial game. The game is quite challenging against multiple computer players. I've only tried the solo game as I've yet to play online, I will give this a go once I feel a bit more competent. I've player the Asia, Europe and American maps. I keep coming back to the American map for the qucik games as I found the Asian map confusing with lines disappearing and then being replaced. The Europe map is quite good and more difficult than the American maps with the need for tunnels and ferries.  The current update has a few issues on the Linux version . Detailed below which I hope get fixed soon and will update this review accordingly.  1) DLC maps are not recognised. You need to start the game on a windows computer and then they appear in the Linux version. 2) Steam Achievements are not working at all for me. I can ony get them when playing on a Windows computer. But even on the Windows computer quite often achievements are not being passed to steam. They appear in game but not on steam. A recent example for me was the pressure gauge 200 achievement which didn't show after scoring over 200 points. 3) Crashes often. The game will quite often simply quit mid-game. This is not as bad as it seems as the game loads quickly and you can carry on from where you left off. Also when quitting a game to go to the main menu the game will sometimes simply quit the game.  Overall the game is a highly enjoyable game and highly recommended despite the few teething problems with this update, which appears to have been quite a large update to the game.    
1013	1	a	This is a fast learning game and can be played in a short amount of time. 
1015	1	a	Another digital variant of greatest tabletop game. Very colourful, plays smooth, and well supported by developer. Must buy..NOW.
1017	1	a	Another digital variant of greatest tabletop game. Very colourful, plays smooth, and well supported by developer. Must buy..NOW.
1019	1	a	If you love the board game you will love this! Fun and fast, this game will help feed that addiction. Such a simple concept that can give you hours of fun
1021	1	a	There's really no way you can go wrong with Ticket to Ride.  Firstly, the game is brilliant in it's simplicity. There's only three types of moves you can make (alright, a couple others in additional maps, but the point is pretty much the same) and yet it's endlessly fun to play. It's a brilliant adaptation of the board game that, for once, does the original justice.   Multiplayer adds great depth and infinite replayability. While the lobby and game set up could use some polishing, it doesn't /need/ it. They work! Plus, you can use the pass-and-play to practice against yourself from as many players as you add to the game. You can play bots. Still so much replayability, just as always the AI will never live up to the fun of playing other people, most likely. I found something oddly dulling about it, even before I tried multiplayer, and I'm usually not a multiplayer person.  This is one board game you do not want to pass up, and this rendition of it is just as worthwhile, plus cheaper and easier to get a game going!  
332	0	a	Broken on Mac with latest release. Another great Days Of Wonder release.  Exception Type: EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: dyld: launch, loading dependent libraries  Dyld Error Message:  Symbol not found: _kSecAttrAccessible 
1023	1	a	A great way to get the board game experience when you are forever alone. My only complaint is making games for your friends is kind of convoluted. Still a classic
1025	1	a	It's a pretty functional port of the board game. Definitely get it if you see it on sale and enjoy the board game or want to try it.
1027	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun, easy-to-learn, fast-playing board game where players compete for points, which they primarily earn by connecting cities via railroad. The game is about equal parts luck and skill. I had not previously played the board game, but I have played a very similar game, which was probably its pirmary inspiration: Empire Builder. The game is much simpler than Empire Builder and its variants, and the maps are smaller, so games tend to finish a lot faster.
1029	1	a	Not much to say, it's the board game but then on your computer
1031	1	a	Love this game. It's easy to find city destination on PC version.
334	0	a	Can't get any of the achievements without the DLC :(
1033	1	a	Who knew a game about trains could be so entertaining? Having clocked nearly 30 hours, I have to say that this is a must for any board game enthusuast.   My only critique would be that the Asian map has some of the most grating sound effects that I have ever heard in a game - enough to make me avoid the map as often as I can.
1035	1	a	I LIKE TRAINS!
1037	1	a	Very fun digital board game.At first it might seem a bit crazy when you just look at it,but playing the game is quite simple.Become quite easy to beat the A.I. but thats about its only weakness. Playing against human players is where this game shines if you want to enjoy that board game experience. TBH this the sorta game that if tweaked a bit could make for a fantastic learning game for kids since it could teach colors,numbers and shapes. The game can be fun for a very short period of time or for at least a 30min play session. Multiplayer seems to be always active when I went online (a day before this review) there were at least 10-15 games up and I was on during early morning on a weekday.  Did not go into the details of the gameplay mechanics because the store page and trailer explains it all.If you want a simple game to enjoy for 5-30min solo or 10-30min multiplayer try the game out its a wonderful game.If you are looking for a more complicated board game you might want to skip this. This game is a great one if you have kids though I think they would enjoy it. I might not of clocked a lot of hours into this,but I played it enough to enjoy my time with it so it gets my thumbs if for casual + board game play.
336	0	a	I love Ticket to Ride as a board game, and I enjoy the iPhone app, but this is a terrible PC port.  The settings screen is tricky to find, and even after clicking on it, it takes a while to load and the buttons aren't labeled. There are icons with no indication what changes will be made by clicking on the icon. And the changes can't be made in game. For example, I wish I could've found a way to speed up the animations, but I was unable to do so. The game moves at a snail's pace.   As I was trying to get to the settings sceen to look for the options, an annoying voice kept talking to me about the settings. Every time you switch which map you're considering using, a new voice starts up. There must be a way to disable these in the settings, but again, since nothing was labeled, I don't know where it is.   This is a good game, but a terrible PC port.
1039	1	a	This game is extremely fun with friends, absolutley give it a try!
1041	1	a	I could play this game all day!
1043	1	a	This is great as a casual game
1045	1	a	If you like board game, then try this game. it's more fun if you play with your friend.
1047	1	a	trains are cool and fast in this game you make railroads connect the country  a haiku for you.
1049	1	a	If you have every played the board game then you will know how fun this game really is. This game is very well done with its style of play. When you win a game it is very satisfying and gives you the sense of a job well done. It is alot of fun to play online with others. You can get some really intense games in. The singleplayer is also challenging with the computer AI. You can choose to play up with 5 people real people or have just the AI play with you. Ether way its a great time. I have really enjoyed this game and I know you will too if you have ever played the board game.
1051	1	a	Oh, I really enjoy playing this game! I originally played it in board format with my family, but the online version is sooooooo much better as you save so much time not having to set up and put back a million pieces! Also--the online version comes with many different versions (USA, Europe, Asia). Thanks for the online version!!!!
1053	1	a	If you love the tabletop, you will love the pc version. This is probably the most accurate representation of a board game on pc that I have ever seen. Great game!
1055	1	a	A great way to get your table top experience without actually needing flesh and blood friends.
1057	1	a	Based on the brilliant board game. Ticket to ride is a strategic game that puts you in the shoes of a railway tycoon.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4SnHt5A2mk 
1059	1	a	Good old Ticket to ride, haven't played it much on steam since i played it on the 360 alot.
1061	1	a	Never tired of this game: always fun
1063	1	a	I love this game!
1065	1	a	She's got a ticket to ride! She's got a ticket to riiii--iii---iiide! She's got a ticket to ride! But she don't have enough green colored wagons to finish her line!
1067	1	a	THIS IS SOO FLIPEN FUN! JUST PLAY IT OR YOU WILL SUFFER!
337	0	a	Cannot get it to run on Mac Maverick or Yosemite.
1069	1	a	Sheldon Cooper loves trains. I love trains. Everybody loves trains!
1071	1	a	This is a faithful, well-programmed, easy to play version of the amazing board game. You can play with multiple people on the computer, AI opponents, and even human players over the internet.   This version has a TON of maps to play as well. US, US Big Cities, US 1919 (or something like that), Europe, Legendary Asia, Swiss, and I think one other.The only one that I've noticed isn't there is the German one with the travelers. Otherwise, this board game is the whole package.  If you're a fan of this board game, or even board games in general, pick it up. I'm more than happy with my purchase.
1073	1	a	Great implementation of the board game! Very nice and user friendly. Wish it had all the newer maps (only has the classic ones with their variants (US, Europe, Switzerland, and Asia)).
1075	1	a	A very fun little game, based on the board game of the same name. A little pricey, especially if you buy the DLC too, but a great deal on sale. 
1077	1	a	Do not play this game with a sneaky, mischievous mother like mine. Instead of completing her route, she blocked all mine and won with that strategy of hers.  In general, this is a game based on a really good casual board game. It is extremely simple to understand all the rules and even a rookie can win a match in this game.  Usually a player's destination tickets are hidden to other players in the actual board game but if you play the hot seat mode on one computer (I believe it is called Pass and Play), you can be aware of the routes others are trying to make which can slightly decrease the quality and the element of surprise of the game (at the beginning of a game, always block someone who has the Vancouver-Montreal card!)  ...what dafuq Steam, no rating?! Well I give this game 8.5/10 with a seal of approval from the Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good.
1079	1	a	Really fun game~~~~
338	0	a	Stupid game, doesn't follow it's own game logic. Hard to play the game that way!
1081	1	a	Good chillout game :D prefer the board game tho
1083	1	a	Really great way to play an awesome game that has a lot of pieces. It's pretty seemless and I enjoy playing it online as well as by myself. Smallworld 2 is also very good; but I would recommend starting here.
346	0	a	i played with my friend, had no idea whats going on, and i still won! wouldnt play again.
347	0	a	it's really really bad.
1085	1	a	The best game ever made.
1087	1	a	look i just came to build some trains but everybody is some kind of â™¥â™¥â™¥.
348	0	a	I've played this game as a parlor game, it was great! But the PC-Version isn't in a playable state... I've tryed everything but I can't click on anything in the game. Not by using the Mouse or any key on the keyboard. I haven't ever bought a game on Steam that is that buggy and unplayable.  I recommend to safe the money and instead buying the original parlor game!
349	0	a	The Steam version of Ticket to Ride is different from the Days of Wonder version of it. I cannot pick up extra destination ticket cards. For me the maximum is 4 of them. Elise, the other player, can pick up much more. Sometimes Elise pick up 7 destination ticket cards. I don't know what is happening. Can someone explain me?
350	0	a	Rubbish! Uninstalled.
1089	1	a	How many times can a man listen to 'When the Saints Go Marching In'?
351	0	a	Ticket to Ride is a competent enough adaptation of the classic board game. Game play is quick and smooth, as is to be expected. The style of the game is fair, if a bit cluttered. However this is all based on the player being able to get past the god-awful menus. Every menu has voice overs describing what options are available. Often each menu has but two or three options. Switching maps, more voices overs describing each map, often with horribly caricature ethnic voices. There is simply no way to turn the voice overs off and has been off putting enough that I've only been able to stomach playing two games. A pity as I really wanted to purchase gift copies for family and friends for online play.
352	0	a	I very highly suggest you stay away from this title. Discovered game-breaking bugs - the worst of which literally made the game unplayable. Just buy the table-top version.
353	0	a	This is an absolutely awful implementation of the game.
1091	1	a	Great fun. Never played the board game, so can't say how faithful it is, but can't see many ways it could be unfaithful. The AI isn't completely brain-dead.
1093	1	a	Love this game, but I can't log into the online features! Please fix this!
1095	1	a	Wonderful game. Love the ability to play online with cross-platform (Android, iOS) opponents. Fun game that is not too stressful either, The expansion packs add nice twists and extend the game with different rules, more locations, etc.
1097	1	a	Amazing turn-based strategy and luck-of-the-draw train building game. So amazing to see the entire collection of expansions digitized and available on Steam. Just be forewarned that there are trolls in the online game who will stall or intentionally block routes even when you specify it's not allowed.
1099	1	a	Fantastic board game. Translates well to PC play. Got the complete pack for $8 during the winter sale and it's well worth the price.
1101	1	a	I was recently introduced to the board game. The computer version is even better because it is much cheaper than the board game, there is almost no setup/clean up, and you can play with random people (or friends) at times when you have a free 30-60 mins. Great translation from physical to digital!
1103	1	a	A very addictive little boardgame, one of those that you reinstall now and then when you fancy something simple but fun, like monopoly or solitare. I feel they are kinda milking it with all the downloadable maps though, but it's not as if you *have* to buy them.
1105	1	a	One of the best boardgames out tehre. Easy for people to pick up. ...Honestly a better experience on a tablet or with the physical board/peices.
1107	1	a	Awesome game. The thing that annoys me about the board game is the pace and this satisfies my cravings without the waiting. It plays super fast and I can knock out a 3 person computer vs game in under 10 minutes. The only annoying thing is that theres no tutorial for the expansions so I had to look up the rules and try to figure it out from that.
1109	1	a	Thanks to Will Wheaton's 'Tabletop' I found out about this game about a month before it was available online. It looked like fun but I was a bit skeptical at first. Turns out this little thing is oodles of fun and then some! All the twists and turns, risking taking on new destinations or playing it safe and just trying for the longest route. It's a great game to play with friends, even more so, I think, onlne, because you can scream at the screen, make faces, and nobody will really know how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your hand is or if you're plotting to block somebody's way :)
1111	1	a	A great board game and transfers well digitally.
1113	1	a	Best online boardgame. Small World is a good option too, they are made from the same developer
1115	1	a	I love the Europe map. It's the first one I played in real life and still gets played to this day!
1117	1	a	Pure awesome
1119	1	a	trains with friends, great fun!
1121	1	a	A great simple digital version of the board game. Really great casual play, not too complicated, and not really cutthroat. You're trying to build train lines and connect cities. Slow but fun--my one complaint about the game in general is that you can't trade wagon cards with other players. It would open things up a lot and add a good level of interaction to the whole thing.
1123	1	a	A solid implementation of the awesome boardgame. I prefer to mobile iterations, specifically the tablet, but this one has everything you need to enjoy the game, and is still much easier to navigate and play than the console versions.
1125	1	a	True to the physical game.
1127	1	a	Great game of strategy. 10/10.
1129	1	a	CHOO CHOO IM GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL OH NO I DREW THE WRONG CARDS ITS ALL OVER
1131	1	a	Very fun game and a faithful recreation of the board game. Easy to pick up and very enjoyable, the only downside to this is that it desparately needs more maps, or at least support for a modding community.
1133	1	a	I love days of wonder every board game I own from them is amazing. All together I own 7 different games, ticket to ride is the best with different maps and ways to reach each city. I just got the 10th year one on table top hope they bring it to pc soon.
1135	1	a	A faithful recreation of the board game, and also on tablet too. Great fun
1137	1	a	Great strategy game! Very addiciting, even against the A.I.
1139	1	a	Great adaptation of a board game to the screen.
1141	1	a	If you love the board game, you should buy this. If you haven't played the board game, give it a try.
1143	1	a	Everybody likes trains, and when I beat the computer nobody feels bad, mostly.
1145	1	a	Reincarnation of the massively fun tabletop. This game was never going to be as fun as its equivalent, but if youre like me it will still keep you hooked for hours at a time. If youre not like me, youll still enjoy the odd game now and then and still feel you got your moneys worth.
1147	1	a	Alright, so there's a reason that the tabletop version of this game won Spiel des Jahres, and the steam version makes it even better. And cheaper!   Buy the European map as well for god's sake, the USA one is quite boring and doesn't have stations.
1149	1	a	A classic game converted into an electronic version. What more could you ask for? The game occasionally chugs (pun intended) but is true to the original. I've played many rounds of just the base game and will keep going back for more.
1151	1	a	As good as the actual board game!
1153	1	a	Really like this game. My only request would be that the option to make the bots more realistic be included. When I have to play off line the bots are annoying.
1155	1	a	it's good
1157	1	a	This game is awesome!
1159	1	a	I am totally addicted to this game, I just can't stop after one game! I used to play against the computer but lately I'm using the online option to play against other players. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, the purpose is to have fun while building routes between cities and trying as many maps as possible, They are all nice and unique. What I dislike is that there are players who are blocking others and don't know how to play for fun; all they're interested is to win no matter what and ruin the mood of others ... a block or report option for such cases would be nice ;) It's a bit expensive with all the extensions but it was on sale when I purchased it so I'm not complaining.
1161	1	a	Ticket to Ride is significantly more fun to play online than as a physical board game easily ruined by somebody slamming the table. About the only downside to this port, other than the glitchy Achievement pseudo-implementation, is having to play through the tutorial and having moves suggested that I feel are less than optimal, purely for the sake of showing you how to play it. Maybe the interface is a bit bogged down trying to tell how to play which map, but otherwise super fun once you learn where everything is.
1163	1	a	Love it, great adaptation of the board game and a lot of fun to play with the wife.  Online play could use a few feature enhancements, like steam 'join game' integration but it works well enough to make password-protected games and join those.
1165	1	a	If you can't get any friends together to play the board game, or don't actually have any real life friends, this PC version is an exact replica. The AI is tough, too.
1167	1	a	Plays well, and I like how it uses the ELO rating system (although I haven't played online yet). Only disappointment is the lack of some expansions/maps from the board game.
1169	1	a	I love the board game. This play faster and now I can play with someone when my wife can't.
1171	1	a	Very good game; I started playing the physical board game, the digital version is just as good. Cheaper than physical game, and more maps to play with. Games are ~20+ minutes, perfection.
1173	1	a	Very fun game with friends.
1175	1	a	I love board games. I have a large collection but the problem is I don't normally have anyone to play them with me. Love that i can hop on and play against the computer. Online needs some work.
1177	1	a	This game is easy to learn! I play it when I know my game time will be interupted by other things because it will wait for me.
1179	1	a	Faithful translation of the original board game. The menu needs some polish, especially for getting to online games, but the gameplay itself is great. Recommended for fans of the original, especially if you have friends to play against online.  In the event that you experience a JVM error when you run the program you can fix it by doing the following:  1. go to the actual install location .../steam/steamapps/common/ticket to ride 2. right click the ticket to ride application or exe file, select properties 3. under compatibility tab, check ' Run this program as an administrator' , then apply
1181	1	a	If you enjoyed the classic board game then this is a servicable digital version. There are some issues I wish would have been addressed. Some minor bugs and lack of polish... As of this writing, it's been several months since the achivements were added to the game, and they all remain frustratingly unobtainable. In any case, the game mechanic is sound and so far there's been no game breaking issues with it. The online lobby nearly always has a few games going and matchmaking is surprisingly quick.  if you enjoy board games and want to jump into a quick match with strangers, then you could do worse than Ticket to Ride.
1183	1	a	Simple game, play with friends, have fun.
1185	1	a	What Make me like it????????????The trains because i think I moved to a place in US by train! LOL
1187	1	a	Stays in the favorites section of my library and I keep going back to it in favor of the daunting backlog.
1189	1	a	I love this game, had it on the Xbox 360 too. Never played the orignal board game. A good strategic game where it can be frustrating when another player buys your route or likewise fun when you buy someone elses route you know they need.
1191	1	a	A good port of the board game. Exactly the same as the mobile version. Acheivments dont work for me :(
1193	1	a	Very fun and challenging and a pretty good AI. It beats me more often than I beat it. I bet multiplayer is a blast but never have tried it. :)
1195	1	a	Got complete edition on sale, with DLCs it provides variety of maps with slight differences in gameplay. Good and understandable rules (as an absolute beginner to TtR I got them on first try), quick and straight gameplay. Solo (never lost to AI in tens of matches, though) as well as on-line mode.
1197	1	a	This is a fun game, but it is inferior to the iPad version, which I also own. The Mac version does not have the ability to choose different computer players (i.e. different difficulty levels). Also, there don't seem to be any built-in game achievements. The Steam application has a clickable 'view all achievements' link, but it leads to a page with only one item.
1199	1	a	It's great, and I never get to go first IRL because Cornwall is not a country.
1201	1	a	Love it.
1203	1	a	I might like this game too much. I only wish that all of the maps available for the table top version were also available digitally!
1205	1	a	I purchased the Complete Pack for me and my wife. We have Board game with the USA, Swiss &amp; India maps (with the 1910 expansion) and love them. The online version, to me, is a lot faster than the board game and you can play with other and/or AI. The maps are diverse, not only in their geographic location, but also gameplay. We played the Asia map last night, for the first time, and it is very different than the other maps we have played.
1207	1	a	A fairly faithful recreation of the boardgame. Probably more fun to play with friends than random people online or vs AI, though AI helps get you acclimated to the game if you've either never played it before or haven't played it in a while.
1209	1	a	Great digital adaptation of a great board game.
1211	1	a	I have played the IOS and Android versions. The Europe/Swiss/Asian map is more fun to play.  A really good adatation of the the board game.  One slightly bad thing is that on Andriod, it i hard to review the scoreing.
1213	1	a	Become a railroad magnate and learn to hate all of your friends for blocking your routes.  10 out of 10  Would screw over each and every one of my friends again.
1215	1	a	A pretty good recreation of the board game if you imagine the ruthlessly and relentlessly cheating AI are your family and that you're too nice to call them out.
1217	1	a	just like board game, though AI is not very difficult :P but still fun
1219	1	a	Board game without the tons and tons of parts. Awesome! Also, great game in general. Get it.
1221	1	a	Great game to play solo or online. I like that is doesn't take a long time and has plenty of expansion.
1223	1	a	Fun game though it is hindered by a ton of bugs and terrible AI.
1225	1	a	I'll update my review to reflect the new version:  A lot of negative reviews have been given because of the new version. This is understandable, since they published the 2.0 version too early and too buggy (basically an 'Early access' version). However, many of the bugs mentioned in the reviews have since been fixed, and the dev team seems quite active in improving the game and even adding new features. It's still not bug free, but I'm confident it will be in the near future. For those who don't want to wait for it, it's easy to downgrade to the old 1.6 version.  Old review: (still accurate for the most part)  Great and accurate translation of the board game to PC. And a great game whether or not you have played the board game. It's easy to learn, but hard to master. A big warning though: this is not a single player game. There is the option to play AI players, but those are mostly there for you to get to ropes. Once you understand what the game is about, you will win them every time. So this game is meant to be played against human players, whether those be your friends or fellow unknown gamers. If you create an open game, it will take 1-2 minutes for other players to join in, and then you can start. A game lasts for 10-30 minutes, depending on the number of players and how fast they play, however, it has to be played back-to-back, no saving and preferably no quitting. Ticket to Ride suits both those who want a little casual play every now and then, and those who like competitive gaming.  Some say it's simple, but I say even just the base game is complex. 2, 3, 4 and 5 player games all require different strategies. And apart from strategy, what is most required is adaptation. If your strategy is rigid, you will lose. You have to adapt it every turn.  In some way, I think this is a game where Chess meets Texas Hold'em. You have to anticipate the other players moves, you have to estimate the odds and you have to bluff and try not to give signs about where you are going. And you get better the more you play, until you reach a plateau. And then you realize something about your playing style, adjust and keep rising in the ranks. The game has a SELO ranking system, much like the one used by competitive Chess players. So you will see how you progress. You will know approximately how good your opponents are, whether or not you actually know them.   There are two distinguished playing styles. Cutthroat or friendly. Usually players accept that whatever you do, in the scope of the rules, and win, is OK. Some players however don't like blocking and screwing/getting screwed. These players will mark their games with words suchs as Fun, Fair or No blocking. Join these games if you want a friendly game. And don't if you're going to do whatever it takes to win.
1227	1	a	Ticket to Ride is a fun and great adaption of the Board game where you are a railroad tycoon, racing to connect the country with your own railroad company before your opponents do the same. You can play solo against suprisingly skilled bots or online against friends. The rules are simple and easy to get the hang off. The graphics are functional and simple although the menus are a bit clunky. The random draw of tickets and carriage cards means luck does play a part (especially when you need that last carriage or locomotive to finish a route!) but it means each game is different and the various maps available each provide their own quite different challenges. Fortunately the game keeps track of all the scoring (one of the more difficult tasks in the board game). Make sure you get all of the Maps in the bundle and you will have endless entertainment with a game that is ideal as a time filler in between other tasks or games or perfect for honing skills in-between tabletop sessions! Excellent value for money.
1229	1	a	An excellent adaptation of the board game. For that it gets a thumbs up. That said.. it is not a good board game. It is more like train solitaire.
1231	1	a	!!Ticket to Ride!!  Well what is there to say about this game? This game is a digital version of the classic board game with the same name. All that you have to do in this game is to build train tracs by collecting 'cart-cards' of a specific colour to build a train of the tracs. For example, if i want to build a train between Copenhagen and Stockholm and there is 3 squares with a purple colour you need 3 purple cards to build on it.  To win you need the most points in the game, 1 cart=1 point 2 carts=2 points 3 carts=4 points 4 carts=7 points 5 carts=10 points 6 carts=15 points.  But you can also get points by completing routes like Copenhagen to Rome. There's two kinds of routes, short distance (normaly worth 5-10 points) and long distance (worth up to 21 points). In the end you can also get bonus points by either building the longest route, completing the most routes or by doing both.  I've been playing the table version of this game some times and i've found myself very amused by it. Then we were playing it with 4-5 people and it was pretty hard to get to where you wanted without getting blocked by some one else, sometimes the others wanted to block your route just to keep you from completing it and getting those extra points. The same things can happen in the digital version.  The digital version has alot of different game types,  Solo with AI's Local (so you can play with other pc's on you'r network Online (so you can play with your friends) Pass and play (a group can play on the same pc by passing it around)  Note that this just like monopoly can destroy relationships and friendships easy. But if they are broken by a game then mayby it wasn't so good to begin with. And hey now you can't throw the board when you'r â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and loosing.... now you can throw you'r expensive PC and since when isn't that a better option?  I started playing this game at a friend and it was so good and fun that I had to buy it so i can play it by myself with bots to train (get it, like train on a track... yea i know my jokes suck..... let's say my jokes started to de-rail! haha i'm so lonley)  The bots in this game is hard to beat in the beginning but you can quickly learn to beat them by starting with one bot and then adding more when you feel ready.  This is a great game to have when you don't have any internet connection avaible. One of the reasons why i bought it was so i would be able to play it while riding the train, taking the buss and feel less lonley since i've got more options than a train.  I've been playing this on my PC for a couple of hours and i find it realy fun and it's real easy to kill time with this game.  I would give this game an 9/10 since i find it easy to learn but still hard to master, fun to play and it's a game that i will be coming back to play alot.  This might not be the best review but i hope you find it helpfull!
1233	1	a	I have always been a massive board game fan, and Ticket To Ride is simple but fun to play. Now it is so easy for me to play with friends even if they are on the other side of the world. So much like the board game, you can play agressively or not. The only issue I have is that for some reason it crashes every time I try to load the tutorial. Have fun playing.
1235	1	a	Good game - plays like the actual board game!
1237	1	a	In the words of a friend, it's like Mario Party with trains.  MARIO PARTY. WITH TRAINS.
1239	1	a	Very nice adaptation of the board game and its various expansions.
1241	1	a	Works great for me on Windows 10, with all DLC. I loved the game on Xbox 360, but it only had the 1910 and Europe editions, and no discounts on DLC. Steam has all the DLC, and the package price was good. I was hesitant to at first because of all the negative reviews about the cross-platform consistent interface, crashes, and DLC recognition issues. But I gave in and bought the base game first, and it worked great (on my Alienware Alpha with Windows 10). Then I bought the complete DLC pack, which installed on its own, and was recognized just fine when I checked. The shop doesn't offer to sell me them, and they all can be selected and will allow the button to say 'Play'.  The new interface works good for me (on my 47' TV). I was very used to the Xbox 360 version, which I am guessing was the same as the old interface people refer to on Steam. But I did find the interface to work well, intuitively, and more quickly. Anyone who knows how to play should be just fine. In fact, the play flows faster than the Xbox 360 version, which was a surprise to me because I expected the worst after all the negative comments about the new UI. The text might be a little small in some cases if viewing on a small screen, but it is the same on tablets and is perfectly fine on a large TV. The words don't really matter anyway, you can get the gist from the large graphics and colors.  I only wish it had controller support. The mouse works fine and intuitively. I had just expected it to work with a controller like the Xbox 360 version. It would be easier for multiple local players if each have their own controller (like the 360). But it works just fine. I ended up getting a 2nd copy for someone else to play with me via Online, and that solved that problem :) .
1243	1	a	As a fan of the board game, I knew what to expect from this version. I already have it on tablet format for casual play, but picked this version up in a Humble Bundle earlier this year. Suffice to say, the game plays well, although some of the fun of the physical board game is lost.  Ticket To Ride is one of those board games that has a perfect blanace of skill and luck, making it easy to pick up the mechanics of for newcomers, and full of tactical play style for dab hands. Do you play to complete your destinations, or to sabotage others from achieving theirs? The choice is yours. The varied expansions take the basic game and add new elements, and maps, to offer a different experience. When played against other human opponents, games can be unpredictable, and immense fun.  As a substitute to the board game, for casual play when no friends around to play with, the game does the trick. The interface is clear and well laid out, and the rules are easy to access. Whilst a physical copy will always be enjoyed more, this digital version is ideal for diversions when sat in front of the keyboard.
1245	1	a	Great casual game. Feel like you're playing the board game version. Love it.
357	0	a	Just played a few hours because i was curious how this game would be on the computer instead of the board game, the rules are same and the tutorial is easy to pickup but....  the bad: the game is full of advertisement for other/new games. the complete settingsscreen isnt working, i can't login change colours nor sound settings etc. because there isnt any progress saved and i have to change my username every game, the game feels very unfinnished.  I guess it could have been a good game when everything is working properly, this game will go into the bin for me I'll stick to the real boardgame.
1247	1	a	Imperfect but adequate translation of a great board game.  The board game is so clever and fun that this digital version is okay too, even though it's awkwardly designed. The menus and navigation start out clumsy, but once you actually get to the game board, you can figure out the slightly odd layout and get on with the game. The core game itself is an addictive strategy game, and it's definitely worth navigating the quirks of the digital version to play it.
1249	1	a	Just like the board game but without all the hassle of tidying up afterwards.
1251	1	a	Who wants to play ticket to ride?
1253	1	a	Excellent game! I really enjoy playing on PC and the board game. I wish the visuals were a bit better on PC though.
1255	1	a	Fun game. Somewhat frustrating when things don't work out, but that's board games for you.  The interface is good, it does justice to the original board game. The AI could be improved a bit, they tend towards more obnoxious strategies (like the poker player who goes all-in on almost every hand kind of obnoxious), but again that's computerized board games for you.
1257	1	a	A geat table top game that never gets old and provides more fun with the more players you have.
1259	1	a	Much faster than the board game, very good for short breakes.
1261	1	a	Faithful to the original. Improved my skills when playing with my friends as an added bonus.
1263	1	a	Well, if you've ever played the board game, then you will certainly enjoy this game. This game is a nice relaxing way to pass time. Even though you don't need to be an expert to do well, the more you play, the better your strategy will become.
1265	1	a	A really decent version of the classic board game.  My only real problem is that sometimes the ticket cards don't activate when clicked.  4/5
1267	1	a	one of the most fun board games that has translated well to the digital screen, highly recommend
1269	1	a	If you like Ticket to Ride the board game, then you won't be disappointed with this computer version because it's exactly like the board game. However, there are two issues that I have with this game. First:  Pros Exactly the same as the board game Single player mode Multiplayer mode Fun sounds No annoying narrator telling you the same thing over and over DLC giving you access to more boards  Cons Some of the achievements are impossible to obtain Many of the achievements are hinged on buying the DLC  At the time of this review, this game was selling for $9.99. Well worth it in my opinion. If you want all of the boards, you will get a discount if you buy all of the DLC at the same time.
1271	1	a	very good transfer from board game onto PC
1273	1	a	This boardgame is wo awesome. Simple but fun and competative! For the low pirce the Complete pack has this is a given buy. Every single boardgame copy will set you back about $30/25â‚¬. Here you gett all of them. With that said, you should pick up the original Tabletop game also ;)
1275	1	a	I'm a fan of the board game and this is a good port.
1277	1	a	Brilliant game. The games are fast paced and tactical, you hae to make risks to win but if it all goes wrong it won't be long until the next game. Nice simple concept with great execution of the game itself. If you want to try a fast paced tactical board game then go for it. Not tried online multiplayer but solo and 'pass about' multiplayer are great.
1279	1	a	I must say i shouldn't have bought this particular game, as i didn't like the tabletop game either... but it is a very well designed game which will fully satisfy Ticket to Ride lovers and will be a nice experience for anyone who wants to have some fun alone or with friends. It offers a multiplayer possibility that will eventually kill the tabletop game itself, and it is MUCH easier to get different maps with the DLCs (buying them in real life was a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥)  only problem may be the fact that some rules are not clearly explained so i strongly recommend reading the whole rulebook before playing
1281	1	a	Highly recommend to the strategy game peeps!
1283	1	a	This game might look like just trains, but it actually is fun. And addicting, money well spent.
1285	1	a	Faithful port of a very good boardgame. Nice for online play, or just for the Zen of solitaire.
1287	1	a	Amazing game. So easy to learn, but very hard to win (on higher difficulties, or against humans)!
1289	1	a	It's not a train sim damn it! It's a board game and everyone should buy it.
1291	1	a	This is a very nice representation of the board game that I love. Great aesthetics, great music and fun gameplay offline and online. I'd highly recommend if you're into board games
1293	1	a	TchoooTchoooo
1295	1	a	Awesome buy to get on sale. Sad that they do not include all the maps, but it is a faithful rendition of the good old fashioned board games.
1297	1	a	LOVE this game, if you are a fan of Empire Buildier and the other train games, this is the closest game I've found online to those board games. :)
1299	1	a	Great game etc etc.... but come on, where are the new maps? It's absurd that only three new maps (not including the USA tweaks) have been released. What about India? Marklin? Netherlands? Nordic Countries? TEAM Asia? Europe 1912 variants? Africa? Pull your finger out, Days of Wonder.
1301	1	a	Fun and relaxing game with just enough strategy to make playing another human a challenge, especially when they actively block routes they perceive you are working towards.
1303	1	a	An extremely accurate version of the real thing, Ticket to Ride in general is such an easy game to learn and a fantastic game to (try to) master. There are a few kinks that do, at times, prevent you from getting right into games, usually to do with the log-in system, but they never occur during gameplay and are often resolved with restarting Steam. A nuisance, I admit, that I hope Days of Wonder can resolve somehow.  If you're up for learning a board game that's been very well presented, give this a go. My advice? Get the DLC's (at least Ticket to Ride: Europe) and find a friend or a few to play this with. Yes, you CAN jump into random games, but if you're on voice-chat with a few friends in your own game, the reactions are wonderful if you manage to block your opponent. The DLC's offer more variety and a few nifty gameplay additions, whether it's Europe with stations and mountain-routes, or the different styles of tickets offered by different versions.  Currently my favourite board game adapted for PC... though that's likely 'cause there aren't many others available, and certainly not many more that offer as satisfying a board-gaming experience as this one. Enjoy!
1305	1	a	Great board game and PC game. Only rival to Catan out there imo
1307	1	a	A board game on pc of course is not like the real game, but this one manages to be close enough. A lot faster and very easy to find oponents and play with 2,3,4,5 players. But still not as good as the real board game
1309	1	a	More board games should be adapted to online play. When you consider the time and frustration involved with actually getting over to a friends' house to play I think we'll see more online board game nights.
1311	1	a	Great board game. The IRL version can get mess I am sure so its nice to have a PC copy when you don't feel like setting up a game for 30 minutes.
1313	1	a	Love playing this game with my husband, nice and casual, yet still challenging.
1315	1	a	Ticket To Ride is one of the most enjoyable board games I've played in a long time!
1317	1	a	thats not duluth
1319	1	a	Great adaptation of the board game, with out the hassle of setup and tear down. Moves quickly!
1321	1	a	This game is a lot of fun and easy to play. :D
1323	1	a	If you like board games or just plain FUN games - then I highly recommend Ticket to Ride!It's fun but not complicated and the pace is nice and smooth.
1325	1	a	a fantastic adaptation of the amazing board game. recommend buying
1327	1	a	This is a great conversion of the board game to pc. It has a clean interface and follows the rules exactly and plays quickly. The instructions aren't the best as there is no tutorial but if you know the board game you can jump right in. Unfortunately the AI isn't that smart. They will mainly keep destiantion tickets if they think they can complete them rather than plot out a real strategy. It's basically like playing against a beginner player vs an advanced player in real life. Also how exciting can a board game on the pc be? It gets dull a little quickly, board games are in essence a face to face social experience. But Ticket to Ride does the best it can with what it has.
1329	1	a	If you like board games in real life then get this one. Ticket To Ride is a very simple game to learn, but is a challenge against the online players. Ticket to ride is one of the top games wich can hold up with games like Carcasonne, Setlers of Catan, Rio Grande etc. Get your creditcard ready and buy the game, i mean the bundle. All versions for a cheap price.
1331	1	a	An excellent game, great translation on the PC.
1333	1	a	cant play the game, been getting error message for days now, tryed everything that they tell you to do and nouthing works, this sucks, buy the game and all the extras that go with it and cant do any of them. I love the game and want to play, please help me if you can
1335	1	a	Fun game with loads of strategy in multiplayer. What makes this game so great is the fact that you can play 3 to 4 games in the same amount of time it takes to play one on the actual boardgame.
1337	1	a	When it comes to pretty cool quick boardgames, this one is it.
1339	1	a	very good board game adaptation, and there are quite a few people playing at any time so you can get into a game fairly fast (like in a minute). Overall highly recommended.
1341	1	a	Really interesting and addicting strategy game. A lot of fun duting the playing process, thinking of how to reach the best result is required. Different maps, achievements are available.  I found Ticket To Ride a very entertaining game, it could easily be played in the family.
1343	1	a	This is a fun little game. Easy to learn. Quick to play. If you like good board game simulations, Ticket to Ride is one of the most faithful to it's origins. Be careful with the tutorial videos. They seem to lock up a lot, but other than that, I have had no problems with the game whatsoever. I love having it available when I only have 20-30 minutes to kill. I can play this and enjoy it.
1345	1	a	I got the TTR Europe and USA 1910 DLC as a part of a Humble Bundle, which included copies of the game on Android in addition to Steam.  If you've played the board game, there are absolutely no surprises here. As a game, it is well designed, but fairly dependent on random chance e.g. your missions, the colors of trains you get (there should be a rule where you have to brag every time you draw two locomotives). Regardless, it's an entertaining game, but it will most definitely ruin friendships if you play with people you know. The game for PC and Mac have pass-and-play local multiplayer, but it's a little iffy, since your hand of cards is supposed to be hidden.  The electronic edition is nice, because you don't have to keep track of pieces and points by hand, and you don't have to clean up or set up either. Additionally, you can play with other people online, making getting stressed out by board games even easier. However, I think that half the fun of playing a board game is having a physical copy. With the electronic version, you miss out on nervously fumbling around while placing down cars, accidentally knocking over other people's cars, proclaiming your masculinity by taking a route with eight locomotives, trying to figure out where the hell your cities are, trying to figure out where the hell your friends' cities are, pleading for mercy from your friends, yelling at your friends, getting yelled at by your friends, putting your friends in headlocks for blocking your long mission, and overturning the board in rage.  Don't have any friends? I'd pass on this game then.
1347	1	a	Nice game, although I like the board game better.
1349	1	a	This is the best board-game-to-video-game translation I've seen. If you like casual board games, get it. The in-game text chat is nice for chatter and smack talk during the game (although voice chat would have been nice, but you can of course set that up via Steam or Skype or whatever if you want). The different maps keep it interesting. And Ticket to Ride is a proven, fun game that's not so trivial that gamers won't enjoy it but not so hardcore that those new to or very casual about gaming can't get into it.
1351	1	a	If you are a fan of the board game Ticket to Ride but are looking for a pick-up-and-play version, this is a great game. The mechanics are simple but require strategic thinking and games generally last less than 30 mins. As a bonus, you can play online or vs the AI in case you're looking to learn the ropes. Recommended.
1353	1	a	This is a fantastic conversion of the board game &amp; is almost as good as playing it in person (or better if your board game group has dispersed around the country like mine has)  As a bonus, this game includes cross-platform online multi-player. The steam version can play against the DRM-free version, the Android version and the IOS (iPad) version.
1355	1	a	Great implementation of the board game! This is a game I wholeheartedly encourage everybody to play. You can learn to play it in five minutes, fantastic family game.
1357	1	a	Extremelly fun and addictive, would recomend to all those into board games. The online option sometimes has a few issues but to fix those it only takes a quick game restart.
1359	1	a	Really fun &amp; addicting game. Would recommend to anyone.
1361	1	a	really fun game and easy to understand, hours of fun !
1363	1	a	Based on the tabletop boardgame of the same name, Ticket To Ride is a really fun and casual game that is easy to learn and can be played in 20-30 minutes. The starting board is pretty easy and not too hard to win if you're cautious and reasonable. Other boards add new rules and quirks that help keep things from getting stale. It's a very enjoyable game that you can break out when you have a little time and want to play something, but don't have enough time for something more involved. My only issue, and it's a minor one, is that there are no achievements which would encourage different strategies and oft-unseen routes being used.
1365	1	a	This game is amazing. There needs to be more games on here like this for all systems.
1367	1	a	Just like the physical game but plays much faster.
1369	1	a	This is a pretty fun and competitive game. I definitely recommend it!
1371	1	a	A near-perfect translation of the board game! Definitely recommended.
1373	1	a	600 hours in and it's still amazing. Great if you love the board game.
1375	1	a	Ticket to Ride is an easy game to understand, but impossible to master. You could play this game for centuries and you still would never be able to win every game. It's a game of luck and skill combined in perfect unison. Whether you're a fan of board games, strategy games, or trains, you will enjoy this game. I guarentee that anyone at any age can sit down and enjoy this game.
1377	1	a	The strategy is simple, the tension is palpable, and the victory is refreshing. It is the board game in an exact duplicate without error. And no more knocking the pieces around. I play this more than any game on Steam.
1379	1	a	Pros : * 80% strategy + 20% luck = 100% FUN * easy to learn, hard to master * one of the most popular boardgame * if you bought on steam, you can also play on their website for online gaming (same game, just little more simple UI)  Cons :  * Doesn't have Hot-Seat Feature (although there is hot-seat feature in iTunes Mac / iPad Version) * Poor UI in Game Setting (no Hint, just a picture that's is so small) * need little improvement on Lobby Online Game (like join game from our buddy list)  Score : 7/10
1381	1	a	Supports cross-platform play between Steam and iPad
1383	1	a	Pretty snazzy version of the board game. Only beef with it is no local multiplayer, but given the hiding-your-hand mechanic I can see why not. The map DLC is also still cheaper than buying actual tabletop Ticket to Ride expansions, so unless you would be making your own new boards (which I don't think can happen in this version) you're still probably saving a bit of scratch.  I like the pink train the best. Matches my skin tone better'n any other.
1385	1	a	The good news is that it's literally an electronic version of the board game. Everything works how it should, for the most part. The tutorial is fairly well done and a decent way to teach people how to play the game if you're sick of explaining it, and the AI is passable but not great if you just want to play casually by yourself. More importantly, it supports cross-platform multiplayer between the PC, Mac, web, and iPad versions. It does NOT support playing with the Pocket (read: iPhone) version, which for some reason is the only one which allows asynchronous play, which is kind of lame. It also has no hotseat mode. By far the specialest thing about it is that it installs its own private (probably non-updated) JVM, which is kind of counter to one of the main points of using something like Java in the first place. It's otherwise functional, even if there are a few weird design decisions.
1387	1	a	This is a perfect copy of the board game and it is easier to play since the scores are automatically calculated. If you are a fan of the original board game then you should buy this.
1389	1	a	Ticket to Ride Is simply a PC version of the famous board game of the same name. It has all of the features you would expect of this kind of game, and the multiplayer is filled with friendly players. Good fun.
1391	1	a	Ah, the good old days when I played this as a board game, with actual people.  Anyway, great board game turned decent PC game. Bit pricey for what it is, but still.
1393	1	a	Absolutely love this game, I would recommend this game to everyone. I first got my wife addicted to it, then we bought the actual boardgame (US map) and everyone we would play with ended up absolutely loving it. This game is a must, but if you have others to play with, I prefer the physical board game. 10/10
1395	1	a	The manliest game in existence, made for horrible horrible people
1397	1	a	Pretty fun game, all in all. Nothing much to say really. Based off the board game, rules are pretty simple, and the gameplay itself is fluid and fun. There are...a couple major issues however that may make playing the game a major turn-off for some.  The Good:  +Like I said, gameplay. Simple, board game like, timer to keep you going, etc. If you've played the board game, you'll know what to expect.  +Multiplayer. God, you would wish that this would just be a given, but given the glitches the game has, it's a major plus that it works somewhat properly. So, yea. Nice that it doesn't crash and I can play with my friends. +Music/Speech/Sounds. Nothing to call home about, but they're pretty nice.  The Bad: -Oh god, the interface. So bad. So, so bad. For starters, the conductor will not turn off his initial speech after you've gone through the first menu. It'll repeat, every single time. You can turn that annoying factor off somewhere deep, deep in the settings, but until them, prepare to suffer. -Doesn't always install correctly. So, I got this off of Humble Bundle and am very glad that we had another place to download it from because the Steam version doesn't always install correctly. And, actually, the HB website version required some fixing as well. My friend had to go through some steps before she could get it to work, but, mine worked fine. So, it's a grab bag.  -Confusing set-up. The settings aren't really intuitive. So, making a game, changing something, or doing something isn't really easy and doesn't come with a solid explanation. Shame.  Overall: If you get the game to work, its fun. Nothing really fancy, a very lightweight board game port that passes the time and once you get everything all sorted out is quite fun. If you have the glitches however, good luck.
1399	1	a	It could have been much better but it really is fun and addictive.
1401	1	a	It's a board game: the videogame.  If you don't know the board game, then it's a nice casual game. Very much the kind of game you'd play once now and again as a break, because it doesn't require much thinking but still stays fun.  If you do, then it's that. Exactly that, no extra features or whatever, but slightly faster.
1403	1	a	Just like the boardgame, meaning a very good game. Easy to learn, hard to master.
1405	1	a	This is the computer version of the classic board game Ticket to Ride. Ticket to Ride is known in the board game community as a classic. This version is just as good as the board game, and it has online! I recommend for anyone who enjoys a relaxing board game. Matches can get particularly competitve at times!
1407	1	a	I like that the game is strategic but has an element of chance.
1409	1	a	great port of the board game. love this for playing with my friends :)
1411	1	a	I coud play this game for hours and I love the co-op features!
1413	1	a	If you've played TTR the board game then you'll like this. You don't have to clean up after each game since it's digital. I got it when it was on sale and got most of the expansions for $5.00 bucks. Well worth it in my opinion.
1415	1	a	It isa board game. The games go quickly so I can kill some time withou getting to invested in a session.
1417	1	a	Extremely Addictive! You have been warned!
1419	1	a	Very easy to pick up, not quite as good as say Empire Builder or Rail Baron, but plays much faster, and the AI is good enough to pose a challenge each game.
1421	1	a	Pretty fun game.   I figured 'eh, i'll try one game.' Surprisingly, it pulled me back in for 2 more.   Surprisingly enjoyable.
1423	1	a	Some technical issues aside, this is a fun game and the online play seals the deal!
1425	1	a	Five minutes to learn, ten minutes to understand, but a lifetime of playing' game
1427	1	a	I love this game. I enjoy playing against the computers and online with friends. One of my favorite games to play.
1429	1	a	Simple concept yet so addicting. Love it!
1431	1	a	This is good - like the board game
1433	1	a	A lot of fun and a very faithful re-creation of the board game.
1435	1	a	A somewhat clunky interface isn't enough to ruin this implementation of the tabletop board game. Much quicker than the physical version to get a game up and running. Really good for a quick fix.
1437	1	a	Absolutely love this game and awesome implementation of the game on PC.
1439	1	a	THE BEST GAME! Play it with your mom! Play it with your friends! Play it with your mom's friends!  Really, you should probably play this. The interface is, well, not the best, but it's a pretty good take on the board game. The Ai doesn't work very well -- they have these weird behaviors that cause them to not finish tickets, or to just keep taking trains without stopping -- but the game is functional, the sound effects and music are entertaining. I consider this a good port.
1441	1	a	Ticket to Ride for the PC is just like the board game. This is a great fun game to play with friends.
1443	1	a	You'll get to play Ticket to Ride anytime you want!  Nobody will play with you over a board again becasue you'll woop them good.  11/10 - would crush friends moral again
1445	1	a	It made me want to buy a physical copy, so it fulfilled its purpose. Fun.
1447	1	a	Great little turn based game. Well thought out and implemented.
1449	1	a	My girlfriend and I played this game in it's board version with friends and decided to buy it ourselves because we liked it so much. We play it a lot and bought some of the expansions as well.  Liking it so much I also bought the Steam version one day when it was on sale just to see what it was. I played it a little in single player vs a computer, it was fun but I forgot about the game after a while.  When we were on a holiday together and she (okay it was not her, it was me..), forgot to pack Ticket to Ride the board game I remembered having the game on Steam. Since I brought my Windows hybrid tablet that could run steam I installed it, took the keyboard dock off and played the game with the touch screen together passing the tablet every time. Although it is different than having to fiddle with the trains etc. since it is all there on the screen it was a lot of fun! Passing the tablet every time was a bit of a hassle but we had the same fun blocking each others routers etc. We laughed and had the same competition we would normally have had with the board game. The downside is that you can not see the playing board all the time so it is a bit harder to think ahead.  All in all I loved having this installed on my tablet. It's convenient to take with you compared to the box with the game if you are low on space for a trip. Still I prefer the board game whenever I can with more players or when I do have the space to take the full board game with me. I just love to have this as a backup and for a fast game of (single player) Ticket to Ride.
1451	1	a	Do you like the board game? Do you want to be able to play it when there is on one else around to play against? If you answered yes to both of these then buy this game. As to whether I would recommend this to someone who is not familiar with the game, that is a more difficult question. I do think it is a good game but it is very much a computerised board game so it does not have the fast paced action you would get from a normal video game. I would play the board game first as I think it would be easier to learn the rules that way. Then if you like it buy this as well.
1453	1	a	really great, and fun. its the board game brought online perfectly
1455	1	a	Fun game. Plays just like the boardgame.
1457	1	a	A famous board game came to live, try this and play with your friends online!
1459	1	a	A good port to one of my favorite board games.
1461	1	a	A great adaptation of a fun board game to computer, and which comes with the added benefit of being decent fun when you don't have anyone to play it with.  Most of the pluses of course come from the well designed nature of the underlying board game it is based off. Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.  From this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?
1463	1	a	Recently introduced myself to this in board game form, then on my android, and now on Steam. Thoroughly addictive, easy to play and completely enjoyable.
1465	1	a	The game Ticket to Ride is simple to play for addictive as you try to complete rail routes across the USA. The game length is ideal too as it will take approximately 20 minutes to play a single game.
1467	1	a	Its a digital version of the board game.  If you like the board game, you will like this. Has all of the variations of the board game available as DLC too. And on one system you can play via a hot seat game mode.   All in all great adaptation of a great game.
1469	1	a	Love the game. Although there's a lot of room for improvement. Perhaps other locations, other option, and of course for the Achievements to actually be unlocked D:
1471	1	a	My favourite boardgame on pc, I already know the rules and have more expansions than available as dlc. Love this game and also fun to play online against others, The best map (dlc) available at this time is Switzerland and cant wait till they going to release the India, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Pensylvania Maps
1473	1	a	If you like the actual board game, but wanna be a master so u can screw them all over quickly and efficiently get this game. much fun. - 11/10
1475	1	a	If you like the boardgame this is a no-brainer buy
1477	1	a	Love the boardgame, and the virtual game is just as fun. I think the AI is a bit too easy, but I might have it set too low. I haven't been able to get a networked game to run, so I can't comment on that. It's worth getting the extra maps, I think. Fun little quick game!
1479	1	a	Addictive!!!
1481	1	a	Original and captivating game. Just as much fun and as addictive as the table top version, only here you don't have to constantly bug your friends to play!
1483	1	a	Hello All, Anyone up for a game of trains.
358	0	a	While the game itself is quite nice and a faithful adaptation of the board game, the pricing policy for the additional maps is an outrage. For the price of two simple additional maps I could get all of 'The Witcher', for instance. All sense of proportion has been lost here. Go buy Mini Metro instead!
1485	1	a	A Very fun and wonderful game. I can melt away hours playing this across multiple platforms as well as the original board game. This version is really good. It responds well, it's pretty and fun playing with friends in online multiplayer. If you enjoy board game style games then do yourself a favor an get this. The DLC just adds more fun to it.
1487	1	a	I almost didn't buy this because of the negative reviews saying a recent update ruined it. The game went on sale so I took a chance on it anyway and I'm really glad I did. I find it just as much fun as playing the physical board game with friends. The AI is plenty challenging enough for me.  The game has crashed a few times, but when I re-open it, it brings me right back to the turn where it crashed so this is no big deal. I have not tried online play, but solo play and pass &amp; play (local multiplayer) work well enough for me.  9/8/16 Edit: Game has not crashed in a long time. I can usually (but not always) beat the AI. This is still fun.
1489	1	a	Game is extremely fun &amp; addictive.
1491	1	a	This is a fun little game, based on the fun board game of the same name. In a nutshell, you build train routes. This isn't the kind of game I'll sit with at my desktop and play for hours and hours, but it's great for travel and casual co-op situations. The game supports a tablet mode (which worked on my Windows tablet) and pass-and-play (play a turn, pass device to other player, they play a turn, etc).  I can really see myself getting through a... well... train ride, with this train game.  Overall, I wouldn't pay full price for this game, but rather wait for a 75% off sale. Once it's in and around the $3 mark, I'd say it's well worth it, but obviously you should value it based on how much you plan to play it.  Do be wary of the other reviews warning about shoddy AI though. I wasn't good enough at the game to present too much of a challenge for the bots, but their behaviour did seem to be very similar in every match I played. I'll update this review after I ride a few trains.
1493	1	a	this is an awsome game
1495	1	a	My husband introduced this game to me sometime last year and it has kept us interested since then. The game looks exactly like the board game equivalent: graphics, ambiance and style. Only problem we ran into is that sometimes when one of us try adding the other to the multiplayer game via invite, for some reason, it doesn't recognize the invitation and we have to invite the other person again.   The choo choo sound can get on one's nerves after the 1000th time. Fortunately, you can customize the settings so it doesn't get annoying.   One other thing I wish we could do is pick the avatar and stick with it regardless of who or what we're playing against. Maybe even allow us to change the colour of that avatar.
1497	1	a	This is a fun table top type game. SImple and quick playing, but very catchy. Interesting variables with the gameplay styles of different maps. I only wish there was one map that has all the bonus cards active.
1499	1	a	As much as I love the boardgame, the PC game implementation is really bad. The graphics are ugly, the installation process is bad and the music.... THE MUSIC... is extremely unnerving. But overall still worth playing ;)
1501	1	a	The only game Iâ€™m terrified of playing with my wife. She does not like to lose this.
1503	1	a	good game when you do not have a lot of time for gaming
1505	1	a	Just like to board game I enjoyed this release. A good game all round.  Rated 5/5 
1507	1	a	played this with my friends and drew all of the map cards.        prankd
1509	1	a	This is FUN FUN FUN! Just need one more round. I got this on my mobile devices as well.
1511	1	a	An excellent adaptation of the board game.
1513	1	a	A good little fun game. Worth a pick up.
1515	1	a	not a fan of the update, but this game is okay. can't afford the boardgame, so I'm happy with the digital version which is waaay cheaper (only 10% of the boardgame price)
1517	1	a	I love this adaptation. Well, I love the original board game itself too, but I'm finding that many board game adapations are being developed a little sloppily. It's good to see that in Ticket to Ride they took care of all the details.
1519	1	a	I've played way too much of this 10/10
359	0	a	Fun game... but the online version crashes continuously... the scoring is erratic... the destination cards are NOT randomly dealt - you'll see the same combinations of choices over and over again. KICKS YOU OFF the game constantly... just a really poor online game - like 1990s technology!! 
1521	1	a	So much fun, especially now that most of the bugs have been ironed out. Can't wait to get the UK map when it comes out.
360	0	a	This is a very faithful recreation of the Boardgame. I would, however much rather play the boardgame or at least the tablet version with pass and play. It turns out that TTR isn't really all that captivating without other people around.
1523	1	a	One of those casual games that you can keep playing. You can also play it online. Definitely worth the money.
1525	1	a	Just like the board game Pros:  - faster setup - faster turns (no waiting for that one person that must visit the facilities the moment before their turn begins) - faster restart after awful start - faster cleanup after the game done  Cons: - No opportunity to gloat if playing against AI - No table-flipping option when your opponent steals your section of track right at the end of the game  Summary: Like Ticket to Ride? Buy this game.
361	0	a	This game does not work. No amount of installing/reinstalling both windows files and game files has helped.   DO NOT BUY.
1527	1	a	As good as the actual board game.
1529	1	a	  Like the board game, that is to say fun! You can also play online for a random challange or against that friend who lives far away.
1531	1	a	Love this - made my Mom rage quit!
1533	1	a	Outstanding Game. Allows you to play solo against multiple computer players or go online and group. Solo game play keeps you second guessing the computer all the time. If you should ever get tired of the US map there are additional map packs to pick up.  Play with friends and rack up the achievements
1535	1	a	A great game my family and I love to play. I watched the Ticket to Ride episode on Table Top with Wil Wheaton, and while the rules don't seem to have a steep learn curve it is great to have the game figure it all out for you.  I also love the multiplayer option and wish some of the other family board games sold on Steam had it. It makes the game so much more enjoyable over the hot-seat option.
1537	1	a	If you like this classic board game, you won't be disappointed. Works great on Windows (both 7 and 10), has got all the features. The music is nice so are the sound effects, they can be set up via menu. The graphics are minimal and well implemented. It's fun, fun and again fun. 
1539	1	a	This is a game.
1541	1	a	Fun game, have the board game and picked up the PC version on sale. Lots of fun to play with friends. Doesnt get old with even the standard map, every game is different.
1543	1	a	A great board game faithfully brought online. Very simple to play, yet enough depth to keep me coming back for more. Games only take 10-15 minutes. The AI isn't too bad, but the real joy lies in playing multiplayer against other humans.
1545	1	a	Very fun and replayable. This board game can either be played against AI or against other players. The addition of achievements gives you something else to aim for to try something new in your strategies. The games are always different and I enjoy this game so much i bought the physical copy to play at my house with friends and family.
1547	1	a	If you're a fan of the board game then this is for you! If you've never heard of the board game... then guess what! This is for you! Its a fantastic adaptation of a fantastic game and I honestly can't say enough good things about it!
1549	1	a	It's pretty good represantation of the board game
1551	1	a	It's fun game for an hour a day :) Purchase a bundle on sale.
1553	1	a	Despite the hype and negative comments I bought the game as an amusement when I was board and needed something quick and light hearted. is it perfect no, but I find it fun to play and for a few bucks compaired to the boxed version it gives me what I need.   It has been fine on my Windows 10 machine....
362	0	a	Medioce port of the superb board game.  Fails to follow standard WIMP environment conventions - many interface items are clumsy and counter-intuitive.   Net coding is poor - takes way way too long in early rounds when players are mostly just double clicking for cards.  Chat box dissapeared after a couple games with no explanation or apparent way to restore it.  Default player name was taken from email string - for many this is a real name - as a developer you should ALWAYS be getting consent for this first.  Willy nilly decided I was under 13 years of age and need to submit a fax with parental pernission to access - LOL GET REAL - I was 13 a LONG time ago - can't fathom what their thinking was.  Core mechanics are consistent with the board game but there is no improvement either - the same double lane board is shown even when 2-3 player games exclude them - why?  6/10
363	0	a	Removed support for my friends platform so I am unable to play with them. Very annoying.
364	0	a	'Pay to play' requires constant purchase of in-game currency in order to continue playing on any but the free maps.
365	0	a	Would I recommend this game? Yes IF it was the actual board game. Because you pay once and you can play everyday forever. This digital version is great because it has most of the expansions included, easy to play BUT after a short period you have to start paying actual money to play - continually. That's just plain stupid. IF this game where a one time pay and you own it for life, like say 19.99 (which I think is fair) I'd buy it in a heart beat. But this game ending up being a pay-to-play is really the only reason it's got a bad rap. Do yourself a favor and try this digital version to see if you like the general overall play and game mechanics. THEN when you run out of your gift coins...DELETE and buy the actual board game!!
366	0	a	A free to play game that literally cost money to play? No thanks.
367	0	a	Memoir'44 Is a fantastic board game.    Memoir'44 Online is the digital version fo the board game. Its F2P model however lets it down in a huge way. Having to pay per scenario instead of paying up front for a NICHE genre of video games is just silly.
368	0	a	Love the game. Own a copy myself. But I aint gonna pay money in order to get maps that I gotta pay for again. It's why I don't play that many free to play games in the first place. Money eaters.
369	0	a	Same as all the others... love it and I'd buy it if it were a one time purchase. No way I'm going to keep paying over and over.
370	0	a	Terrible game!  F2P that requires gold to be purchased constantly.  Make the game cost $10 and I would buy it. I refuse to throw money into a game where each match costs 2-4 gold bars PER match.
371	0	a	The board game is a good game, and the way it is implemented here generally works.  I give this software product a negative review for non-'game' reasons: the particular F2P model involved is ridiculous, and the game does not appear to handle network disconnects in a clearly explained or reliable way.   
372	0	a	Love the board game and I have most of its expansiond, but I can't recommend boardgames that are based on pay to play.
373	0	a	Not really free to play.
374	0	a	1.5 out of 6 stars.  In short, sorry to say this but I don't reccomend it. To sum it up:  1) The outcome of the battle tends to depend far too much on luck with dice rather than tactics, using terrain etc. The game tends at times to eb so random as to seem a glorified game of craps with toy soldiers in the background.  2) Units are generic, you get almost no ww2 'chrome' in this game. Maries and Japanese infantry are the only exceptions that stand out. 3) The business model is costly and player-unfriendly. Its not so much a F2P game, It feels more like a free extended demo.  IN DETAIL:  I played this with a friend - we are both old time wargamers (Advanced Third Reich, Squad Leader, Steel Panthers). We came to this expecting a beer&amp;pretzels sort of 'Baby's first Squad Leader' game. I don't mean it in a derogatory manner - in my opinion there is nothing wrong in making a simple or fast-play game on a popular topic, in this case tactical WW2 combat.  Memoir 44 failed to deliver though. Yes, it is simple and fast. However it also lacks historical 'chrome' and all the unit types feel far too generic (german tanks in Normandy have same stats as allied tanks etc).  The worst thing about it is that it is VERY random in combat outcomes. 9 out of 10 games both me and my friend walked away with the mutual conclusion that it was luck that was the decisive factor. In this game, your decisions, combat errors or tactical mistakes feel to have very little impact on the outcome - luck means much more.   We've had situations when infantry charged madly into the open field and shot to pieces an opposing infantry squad (same stats) that was defending a bunker. And no, this was not a point-blank assault on the bunker, we were shooting from many hexes away. I'm ok with such situations happening 'once in a blue moon', but in memoir 44 this happens all the time. Much more so than in most ww2 combat games we've seen - here everything depends on how the dice rolls - terrain and equipment don't seem to matter all that much. For me this is an absolute joykill.   Let's get one last thing straight - calling this F2P is somewhat an exaggeration. The free part is more of an extended demo - you have a limited amount of gold that allows you to play the game a limited amount of times except for several small free scenarios. After you run out of gold, you will need to pay money for each scenario you play - multiplayer, single player, doesn't matter each time you will have to pay. This does become a probem as each scenario is small and these play fast. IMHO this is not a fun business model for me as a player.
375	0	a	The game is fantastic, so adictive but its a pay to play game, I would pay 30 euros for it one time, but not 5 euros and 5 euros and 5 euros, pay once not endless!!!!!!.
376	0	a	really fun, really great game. not recommended only because you are basically paying a subscription to play it. not worth it for that.
377	0	a	Memoir 44 the boardgame (+ copious expansions) is great. Memoir 44 online is a pretty good implementation -- it's faster to set up, though it lacks the physical fun of rolling dice.  But you have to pay continually to play, which is a massive rip off. So why bother?
378	0	a	Just sell me the game for say $20, keep the pay to play crap out of it. Very good in board game form which is worth buying, keep away from this 'free' to pay.
379	0	a	The game itself is good and addictive. This is very nice version of the board game. I cannot recommend the game, because of the 'pay to play' system. Too bad, really.
380	0	a	I have the real board game with all the extensions. The legit game is way better and I feel like the dice rolls are unfair and usually favor one side. Just get the board game.
381	0	a	First and foremost, this is a great implementation of the original board game. The execution of the game's rules along with a clean user interface and having absolutely no set-up time makes it desirable.  However, the pay-to-play model that they employ is a travesty. If it were a one-time purchase, I would buy in a heartbeat because of the potential to reach a larger player base. Unfortunately, as it is, I would only suggest playing the free scenarios, using the limited free plays they offer and, if you really enjoy it, purchase the actual board game. It's just too bad the publisher had to be greedy on this one!
382	0	a	You have to keep buying gold to play, the game looks like a Windows 3.1 game from the early 90s, and the game is VERY random and simplistic. Battlelore is based on the same system, but it's a much better game.
1555	1	a	A lot of fun to play. Shame about the pay to play mechanic once you run out of complimentary tokens. WIsh you could buy the game, I certainly would. The devs could price it at $20 and it would be worth it.
386	0	a	I enjoyed the free maps and the game and even considered buying gold to play the other maps. But sadly i realized that even if you spend the gold on a map you must buy it again each time you want to play that map. As many of the other people that have reviewed this game, I must say it to, Just buy the board game it will save you more money then spending it on this. 4/10 Rating
387	0	a	Great board game. Horrible business model for this iteration of the game. Unless they change this shady practice/trend in a future update ,don't bother purchasing.
1557	1	a	Man, I feel for the developers of this game. Steam kids are idiots, especially the f2p grazers.  No, this game is not entirely free. You'll find no game ever really is, since someone has to pay the developers. Instead, it's a demo (as the text explains) in which you have full access to all factions and maps for hours of playtime. The devs tried a new payment model, where you don't pay for the game or DLC, but pay-as-you-go instead. A round of play (20 mins) costs around 2 or 3 gold and you get 125 gold for EUR 5 or 1.000 gold for EUR 30 (which also includes the scenario maker, btw). That's over 300 games worth of gold and you never have to pay for DLC. That's actually pretty fair, in my book.    So what about the game itself? It's a pretty faithful remake of the board game. I would not have minded a less cartooney and more lifelike approach, especially since the board game does feature 3D models. Different scenarios come with different rules (the Russian chain of command rule drives me insane, for one) but despite that, it's really easy to pick up. You'll be playing inside 5 minutes after watching the tutorial vid.  The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed. It has a tendency to overextend and get its units into trouble. This is offset by it seemingly getting better command cards, which feels ho-hum. However, it's not overly obvious and the balance is actually pretty good.  If you're in for a really basic beer&amp;pretzels wargame, they don't come more basic than this. Expect around 6-8 hours of free play in the -otherwise unrestricted- demo. After that, you pay EUR 5 for every 10 hours of playtime max, probably a lot less. That's pretty decent in my book.
388	0	a	Pay for literally every battle. Great but im not paying that .
389	0	a	I gave it a a down because of their pay to play but their UI and everytjing else is great. It was a great demo for the board game ! first 2 missions are free so give it a try and if liked it go for the board game it comes out cheaper than purchasing in game coins.
1559	1	a	Good game, but it stops working properly if you share it with family members, and both family members have it installed. It then sees the game as only other members game and doesn't let you play it together anymore. It's not possible to 're-buy' it or re-install it, it just stops working.
1561	1	a	Very good online game, but free 50 Gold is not enough
1563	1	a	I have the physical game, this is good digital replacement for when no one is around to battle. Board game is great also, highly recommended.
1565	1	a	I have the boardgame version of this game, and it's really fun to play but when you don't have anyone to play with it's great to play against your computer.
1567	1	a	its fun and free
392	0	a	each time I play this ww2 simulation game i play very good tactics but I continuously have horrible dice luck. Dice rolling is 90% of this game, if you are looking for a strategy game don't play this game, If you are looking for a random â™¥â™¥â™¥ gambling game set in a WW2 environment, play this game you will have fun =)
1569	1	a	I give it 5/10. Five solid points for being a good PC implementation of the board game rules. It fails to earn the remaing 5 points because:  1) It isn't much to look at (it needs a serious graphics overhaul in both the interface and in-game), 2) I experienced some serious video bugs in the lobby, and 3) There's no way I'm going to pay to continue playing something aesthetically unappealing and buggy.  The PC implementation would do much better if developed and executed by a game software company, *not* Days of Wonder.
395	0	a	Board game turned video game. Waste of time basically, since you can only play a couple map configurations without paying cash. That how they GET YA!  Skip it!!!  4/12
396	0	a	Horrible. AI will have a 99% chance of winning, and it costs in game credits to play. So it pretty much is useless.
397	0	a	Pay to win, need i say more!
398	0	a	Don't play this game. The dice always are in favor of the AI if you play solo You will lose without any reasonable chance.
399	0	a	Third persion looking game like chess it's kinda borring for me....  player told me that's tactic game...
1571	1	a	Command &amp; Conquer X Chess placed in real life WW2 battlefield situations. Awesome.
1573	1	a	This game sucks 
1575	1	a	Oh yeah! Hit me up.. A great translation of a marvelous table top game!!!
1577	1	a	Oh yeah! Hit me up.. A great translation of a marvelous table top game!!!
400	0	a	I played this Steam version to determine whether or not I should get the board game, given all the praise surrounding it. Long story short, I am glad that this version was free because this game is just terrible. It's joyless, nonsensical, and void of any real decision making. It, like Twilight Struggle, is simply 'Here are your cards... base your strategy around them!' That is not fun by any stretch of the imagination.
1579	1	a	Free - ish. At least you get to try it out a bit for genuine free, but need to cough up if you want to play properly. Fair enough I guess, sort of demo model in a way. Game itself is good, and compared to the price of actual board games, bargain even when have to pay.
1581	1	a	It's a nice I like.
1583	1	a	This game sucks 
1585	1	a	AI is a filthy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheater, 10/10, would get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ with 3 tank rolls on the first turn.
1587	1	a	Memoir '44 is a very fun board game. This is the video game version of the real board game, and it is very fun. The problem is it charges you coins every time you play. The game is free and it gives you free coins to start out with, so you can play quite a few games before you run out. However, when you run out of coins, you have to pay money to continue playing. That really sucks.  I would recommend this game if you are interested in the board game, or if you just want to kill some time playing a board game about WWII. Just know that, eventually, the game will want you to pay to keep playing it. I'm not about to do that, so I guess I am done with this game.
1589	1	a	Fun turn base strategy game you can play yourself, but is best played against friends. Causual and fun.
1591	1	a	Good. Like the board game. And free. Can usually find a match online.
404	0	a	What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ am I playing?
1593	1	a	what have i done
405	0	a	Cannot control all of my units. ***Units do not defend*** - units do not exchange fire during combat. Cards usually only allow you to control a couple units at a time and usually only on left, center or right...!??! So big problem is if you have more than one objective (and enemy may not have the same problem) while you move towards one objective, enemy has at your other units Without incurring damage! Your order, movement and combat choices are (very) restricted by the cards.  In a nutshell: much more luck than skill involved :P  Maybe it's just me. I don't like it.  However, this is a polished functional game - so still a nice free game.  Try it, see if you like it :)
406	0	a	found the tutorial tedious, couldn't sit through it to learn how to properply play. Has a steep learning curve for the ADD gamer IMO. Would pass unless you like things like collecting stamps, sodoku and sitting through Ken Burns documentaries.
407	0	a	Can't earn any achievements when playing solo.
1595	1	a	Game got me hooked enough to buy board game. Board game takes a good 15 minutes to set it up. Stopped playing board game and stick with this for good.
1597	1	a	A free board game with explosive effects. That's about it.
1599	1	a	the actual board game is better.
1601	1	a	This is a great board game and a great PC game too. Nice job.
411	0	a	i fell asleep watching the promo vid...........................................................................
1603	1	a	
1605	1	a	Check this out. It is totally cool once you get over the toy soldier look. Easier to set up through Steam, if you've got it.
1607	1	a	WOW. I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME. AND I PROBABLY NEVER WILL 
1609	1	a	Fun game, a little too random for some maybe.
1611	1	a	'you will be offered the opportunity to purchase' Suck my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1613	1	a	A great implementation of the Memoir '44 boardgame; great tactical wargaming and controls. Lots of fun and a good community of players. Two drawbacks: 1) I'm in two minds about how frustrating the touch move implementation for some actions can be. 2) The pay to play model is a bit limiting and although I'm planning to buy some credits beyond the free allocation some form of monthly stipend or one or two more free maps would be nice.
1615	1	a	very addddictiv !  nice stuff for sure...
1617	1	a	this isnt a freeto play game after about 25 games you got to start paying for it and a game last 5 to 15 minuets if you play badly
1619	1	a	A great PC tabletop war game.
1621	1	a	Re-write history to stop Fegelein from taking over the Reich.
1623	1	a	If you like Memoir '44 the board game, and Days of Wonder as a publisher, then you will have no complaints about this PC adaptation - unless you hate the freemium model. Honestly the only complaint I have about this game is that you have to pay to play once you burn through the initial coins you receive for signing up, unless you merely play on the 2-3 free maps. I know it takes money to run servers/develop games, but still.
1625	1	a	Check this out. It is totally cool once you get over the toy soldier look. Easier to set up through Steam, if you've got it.
1627	1	a	Great match-three game with pretty graphics and a nice story. The end is hellishly difficult though. Valdis Story, the next game from Endless Fluff Games is also awesome (metroidvania).
1629	1	a	First impression: If you liked Puzzle Quest, but thought it was too slow, Legend of Fae is for you.  EDIT:  Second impression: First impression still holds. However, unlike Puzzle Quest, Legend of Fae is...well, easy. I seem to be done with the tutorial parts and have entered the actual meat of the game. You're given an option between two difficulties, easy and hard. I picked hard. Thus far, everything has been an absolute pushover. Each level has an 'expert' bonus target for completing it in a certain time and with a certain score, and I've been able to amply reach both goals on every level, often doubling the score and halving the time.  Not to say it hasn't been fun. It has. I'm just also waiting for my HP bar to dip below 90%, so that I actually need to heal myself.  EDIT:  Third impression: First impression still holds.  The game's difficulty has started noticably ramping up. It's still nowhere near 'too hard', though I have begun to miss score and/or time goals by smallish margins. Perhaps I spoke too soon on the too easy part.  There's also a bonus boss I unlocked a while back. I've tried it a few times, but it utterly destroys me every time.
1631	1	a	Simple in its concept but quite addictive. This can remind of bejeweled or any games using the same gameplay, but with more options. You also have to fight monsters using the attacks you gain by putting elements together (a line or goup of 3 or more tiles). Perfect for when you have just a short period of time to play (Most of the chapters are between 8 and 12 minutes). Cute graphics and story. Easy to understand and play. I have played about 20 chapters so far and intend to finish the game.   You get to travel with 4 elemental spirits that will help you fight along the way. For each chapter you complete, you gain a puzzle piece which you can use to buy upgrades for the spirits/elementals that fights with you. This gives you options to help you win the further chapters and fight more ennemies. You're also free to upgrade the spirits you want (there is no obligation so you can upgrade only one of them if you want).  There are some records to beat and level of difficulty as well, which is interesting.
1633	1	a	For the most part, I like this game. I thought it was original in its design. It has rpg, puzzle, and strategy game elements at the very least. The story and battle mechanics are very interesting. At first, you think the game is going to be easy, but it can also surprise you at how challenging it can get. It definitely makes you think on your feet and try to plan ahead.   Probably, the one thing that I did not like about the game is that whenever an enemy casts a spell, it interrupts what you are doing to tell you about it. I understand it is to help draw your awareness, but usually I am concentrating on what I need to do next and it is very jarring to be suddenly pulled away from what I'm doing. Enemys cast a variety of spells, such as barriers and holds on your abilities. I do not need to be pulled away every, single time. However, in light of the whole, this is just a small annoyence. Overall, the game is very fun and interesting.
1635	1	a	this is a super cute game and concept, i quite like this. similar to bejeweled, but not the same, with a cute little story and elements to factor in!  Definitely more catered towards people who like playing Bejeweled, or doing the same thing over and over throughout a game, I liked this game a lot. Fight enemies, with your little sprite friends, fire, water, earth, air, and use their strengths/weaknesses to your advantage. The art in this game is beautiful, and the story as well.
1637	1	a	A match-3 game with RPG elements. Matching up the colors has the corresponding element use an attack, heal, etc. Sounds simple enough and it is, but the game has a good difficulty curve and a few interesting gameplay mechanics.   On the downside, the wind elemental seems a bit too important since he's the only character than can knock flying enemies to the ground, and it's necessary to do so to damage them. Felt like at least one of the other characters should have been able to do something similar. Makes the tactical aspect of fighting a bit repetitive since there are a lot of flying enemies in the game. If you ever find yourself wanting to do so, the game does let you respec your level-ups easily enough. The last boss is also stupid hard and I was one or two attempts from searching for a youtube clip of the ending. It's just an incredibly frustrating, long fight.  I don't play match-3 anything, so take this review of a match-3 game with a grain of salt. Picked it up on a whim and because the main character wears a leg brace and that seemed interesting enough. A solid, little puzzler, though the story/character aspects are extremely generic and disposable.
414	0	a	The good news is that the light RPG elements are actually pretty entertaining and kept me playing for a few hours. There isn't a ton of depth to them, but they're thought out well enough to give some focus and direction to what you're doing on the puzzle side of the game and break it up a bit. The story is nothing to write home about, but it moves the game along.  I might've kept playing it on and off despite some annoyances (e.g. fighting multiple enemies at once that spam status effects effectively forcing you down an upgrade path that gives you an easy way to clear things like blind/poison), but my inability to see what was going on really started to get in the way after a while. This is one of the few games where my partial color blindness has been a significant problem (especially with the blue/purple gems), and it could've been avoided without even adding a color blind mode. Just making the different gems different shapes would've made an enormous difference. It also really, really doesn't help that things like the poison symbol cover up most of the colored area of the gems, which makes it a lot harder at a glance to tell what you need to match them with to clear them.
1639	1	a	Yeehaw, excellent game. It's like Puzzle Quest (yes, again) or Henry Hatsworth. You basically 'control' a girl. You do this by moving and combining orbs. Purple orbs move the girl, red orbs do fire attacks, yellow - wind, green - earth, blue - water. And then you have clear orbs to rid yourself of poison or blindness. There are also spells to protect yourself and there's a meter that builds up while you create combos as well. And... you can collect gears and gems. Gears to upgrade your spells and gems to complete the book you're carrying. It's pretty complex for an 'orb matching' game. If you couldn't already tell; I like it. Worth the money ? Hell yeah.  [Rating: 73/100]
1641	1	a	It took me 14 hours over two(?) days to finish the game on the basic difficulty level. I did that while having a headache on two occasions and one session lasting until 3am.  As you might guess, I liked it a lot. Then again, I bought it at 75% discount or comparable. If you see such an offer and like match-3 games, give it a shot. If it's got a demo, give that a shot right now.
415	0	a	This game looks cute and beautiful, and seems to be a nice match-3 game mingled with RPG element. However, if you are looking for a game like the Puzzle Quest series, you won't find anything that can even see the dust at the tail of PQ; you should get 10,000,000/you must build a boat instead, which are much better than the Legened of Fae. For the first several levels, the game may be interesting, but after that, the combat becomes quickly repetitive and the story progresses very slowly. The seemingly level-up system does not work well, as it does not give you the feeling of becoming stronger and more versatile in battles (the effects of the combo spells and summons are not worth the efforts for casting them). In addition, most monsters in later stages have special abilities, which makes the circumstances in combat chaotic. The music is just so so; the sound effect is alright at first, but after a handful of battles this rapidly become old and annoying due to the lackness of variation.
1643	1	a	Plays like a much smarter puzzle quest/puzzle league combined with a combat system relying on classic rock-paper-cisor color vulnerability system.  Overall very pleasant. Artistic value is pretty high, interface easy and functional. Not as polished as Valdis, but any further comparison would be unfair I think.  If you like the classic lining up of color orbs by horizontal swap games, this is one of the strongest I've seen.
1645	1	a	saw this pop up while searching and watched the little trailer..very interesting. so, i went online and got the demo. got to level 5 and made myself stop..happy to now have bought full game. story is good and easy to follow, graphics are cute and its a good take on matching games that always get spat out of everywhere now. sick of these re-hahses of bejeweled and angry birds and mario but its used here with a storyline and adventure,making a enjoyable,unique game. can just relax and play, with enemies to fight and progress made. also has some challenge and strategy to ensure success and move on, even has upgrade system. nice mix, good casual game, needs more recognition. if youre unsure, just go get the demo. youll enjoy it :)
1647	1	a	This game is addicting. It gets really tough towards the end though. Probably not very helpful review, but you get what you see from the trailer and that's important for me. :)
423	0	a	A lot like puzzle quest, in that it's bejeweled with some extra â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tacked on to make it even more addicting. The kind of game you resent for not being really very good, but still you find yourself playing for hours.
424	0	a	The game is inherently not bad, but the formula is executed in a boring and not very exciting way. I would expect a bit more hence I cannot recommend, but if you like a slower interpretation of 'match 3' games this one will be ok for you.
1649	1	a	Sea Cross Island was a quiet haven just off the mainland, but recently strange things have been happening! Mysterious creatures known as Fae have started appearing and are wreaking havoc. A young girl named Claudia, is thrust into adventure as she searches for her missing uncle amongst the chaos. It's a dangerous journey but she's not without friends. Four elementals are drawn to her aid as Claudia finds out that sheâ€™s actually a sorceress! Embark on a journey to discover the secret behind the mysterious Faery Gates.
1651	1	a	Really fun game I enjoy the puzzle/ fighting style.
1653	1	a	A pretty good little indie game. It's a puzzle RPG with real-time combat. If Bejeweled and Puzzle Quest had a baby this would be it.   The story is okay but the writing itself is a little rough. It also takes a bit to get off the ground and by the end of the game I was very ready for it to end.  The real meat of the game is its surprisingly deep gameplay. The difficulty takes a while to ramp up but becomes a real challenge by the end. If you do play it then do so on HARD because otherwise it robs you of the real ending. By that time you will definitely not want to play through again.
1655	1	a	This is a really addictive match 3 game with a lot of depth, challenge and interesting story that kept me tied up in a classic 'just one more stage' cycle. When you think you've got a good handle on the gameplay and it starts to get easy, they throw in a new gameplay element or enemy type that really changes the dynamic and steps up the difficulty nicely. If you're a fan of the genre, be warned it can get really tough and hectic later on.  Beyond the nice story and gorgeous art, the world itself also has a lot of thought put into and you'll find yourself wanting to learn more about it and its denizens. My only problem with the game is how tough it can be to unlock the bonus lore since it requires you to keep an eye on the action above while you hunt for matches below. I'd rather have had upgrades work like that with book pages unlocked through performance, but six of one, half dozen of the other, I suppose.
1657	1	a	Charming visuals, surprisingly fast paced battle, all under the guise of a match-three puzzle game. Making it through each stage gives points to level up the special things that happen when you destroy gems, and there is actually a story to follow along with as well. Considering the dearth of reviews this has is sad, because there is a sweet and interesting game to be played here, and anyone who enjoys a good story and some fast thinking puzzle game action should grab this up.
1659	1	a	This game is fun. Match up and break rows/columns of jewels to do pretty much anything.
1661	1	a	This charming puzzle game works much like the Puzzle Quest series of games, which in turn were derived from Bejeweled. But as you match gems actions are carried out about you in real time as the characters story moves on fighting monsters, gathering mana, finding items, etc. Plus the art style really touched me.
1663	1	a	A cute little puzzle game similar to Puzzle Fighter, for those of you who have played such titles. Legend of Fae includes a fantastic story, fun characters, and colorful art. A good game for those looking for down time, but don't want to get to wrapped up in mechanics.
1665	1	a	This is bejeweled meets Final Fantasy style, semi turn-based combat. It starts off casual enough, but a few levels later the surprisingly deep and innovative combat system begins to shine. Add the delightful graphics and animation into the mix, this game is well worth the price.
1667	1	a	If you like Bejeweled-esque games, and elemental matchup games (water beats fire, but is beaten by air...), this game might be for you! My only reservations in recommending it are the bizarrely sharp difficulty jump from level 49 to level 50, and the really, really poor copyediting. If you're willing to overlook a lot of grammar and spelling errors, though, this game is definitely worth a try!
1669	1	a	A fun 2D puzzle game with a combat element. Great art!
1671	1	a	Great combination of puzzle and RPG. Mixing matching mechanics with spells this game have enough variety to keep you interested for many hours-that you will need to complete the game because is quite long for casual genre. The plot is also very nice, if you like classic fairy tales. Recommended if you want to play something different but not so dense. Donâ€™t miss it on sale.
1673	1	a	I enjoyed Legend of Fae immensely. It caught me by surprise with its fun, unique and clever game mechanics and kept me hooked right until the end. The varied spells and enemies kept combat interesting and exciting, and the story was intriguing enough to catch my interest. Swapping back and forth between puzzle and attack mode in battle can be a little tiring, but it's a small complaint considering how enjoyable the rest of the game is.
1675	1	a	For all that it just looks like another Bejeweled clone, the art and music is gorgeous and the plot both sweet and depressing. It was set up quite nicely for a sequel. I'll be buying that sequel it when it comes out!
1677	1	a	Great indie game with a touching story. Gameplay may not be for everyone, but highly recommended.
1679	1	a	This is a review for both 'Clockwork Man' and 'Clockwork Man: The Hidden World' since I played them back to back and they share the same lead character. Actually, I've played both these games many times on a different PC before I got into Steam. So my playtimes you see for each will probably be less than a normal playthrough since I can whiz through the games by now. We'll start with game #1:  Pros:  - Nice graphics and good character designs. The main girl, Miranda (YAY, she has my name!), is quite lovely.  - The voice acting is also good, for the most part. I really like who they chose for Miranda. Some of the others can be a bit cheesy but it is amusing rather than irritating.  - Interesting story.  - Both games have a very neat hidden object feature. Scrolling and zooming. Not every scene but many allow you to move around the area. Some items are sneakily hidden behind others but just one click to the left or right will reveal them.  - Both games also have an interesting hint system. You travel around with a little robot man and he'll help you locate those tough to find objects. He starts out with the ability to just tell you where a random something is. Then a little into the story, he learns how to give you an item's silhouette (which is the hint I prefer if I'm stuck). Further in the story, he gets other abilities. Like briefly highlighting each metal object on your HO list.  - In both games, the music isn't spectacular but it's pleasant to listen to. Actually, in #2 there are a couple places with very lovely melodies.  - When you beat each game, Freeplay opens up. This gives you random hidden object areas. Good for if you're in that 'I have a craving to find stuff' mood.  Cons:  - Neither game is connected to Steam while you're playing. So you won't be able to chat with friends or take steam screenshots.  - Unfortunately, both games have issues when it comes to clicking on items. You'll find you need to be very precise and occasionally you'll need to click more than once or try clicking on a different part of the object. It doesn't happen TOO often or else I wouldn't be able to recommend these games.  - Both games are short. Boo.   Now I'll list the differences in Clockwork Man: The Hidden World:   - The length is longer. Because of the higher difficulty, possibly much longer.  - This game has a journal where Miranda records her adventures and anything of note. You WILL need to use this journal to solve quite a few puzzles.  - There are many more puzzles in #2 and some of them are downright devious. There are no skip options either. Also, it's easy to miss things that you need in some scenes so you might get stuck for awhile. I love this game but it IS a bit aggravating sometimes. Those who enjoy a challenge will have fun. :D  - The story has no tie-ins with the first game. The Hidden World's plot is much more involved than #1 and, in my opinion, fascinating.  - The voice acting, again in my opinion, is better than the first game. (Miranda is still the same, which is good!)  - Maybe it's my imagination but it seems the graphics are better in #2, though I'm pretty sure they used the same game engine.   - When you finish the game, you can rewatch any of the cutscenes.    So in closing, I really enjoy both these games so I'm definitely recommending them to hidden object and puzzle fans. But, because of their short length, you should wait and grab them when they're on sale.   Important Note! The games might not load up for you, which is an issue I had. Right click on the Clockwork Man title, click on Properties, click on Local Files, click on Browse Local Files (which will bring up your program files for the games), right click on the Clockwork Man title again, click on Troubleshoot Compatibility, and finally click on Try recommended settings. I did that for each game and then they worked just fine.
1681	1	a	One of the more interesting hidden objects games out there. With nice graphics that don't make your eyes bleed from all the staring ;)
1683	1	a	As far as HOG games go, this one is alright.  I was pleasantly surprised with the â€œzoomable and/or scrollable screenâ€ that you can get in some scenes, I thought it was something I don't find very often in this game type, it definitely makes the game a bit more challenging, and the scenes really are cram packed so it takes a good looking around. There are some HOG games you just glance at the list, glance at the scene and find things straight away because itâ€™s been poorly edited into the picture or is just plain obvious, this definitely isn't like that, the scenes look decent. Only fault in that department I would say is when you scroll along, edited items skip and jitter a bit so itâ€™s easier to find objects put into the photo. The music is alright; itâ€™s not repetitive and mind numbing like some soundtracks i have heard alongside a game like this. also, all different HOG games have different waysâ€¦ or â€œexcusesâ€ rather as to why you are searching around in a cluttered room â€œcleaning upâ€, and this game really is quite cheesy with that, a popular one as most fans of this genre would know is that you are doing â€œdetective workâ€, in this, you quite literally are just everyoneâ€™s â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, â€œI'm a lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hotel owner, clean up for me will yaâ€ kind of thing, I found that a bit of 'utter cheese' to be honest. Alongside that the story is really short, at first it took me a while to get into it, I wasnâ€™t too bothered, then it started picking up, I became interested in what was going on and it just ended. Although it did end on a â€œto be continuedâ€¦â€ it wasnâ€™t all that satisfying in terms of length and storyline. I would say itâ€™s decent, it may be worth a go if you are bored and missing the genre which was the case for me when I started it. Unless you are planning to play the next one straight after it, (which I havenâ€™t played yet) just be prepared for a short game.
1685	1	a	This was an interesting hidden object game. As opposed to the usual one-screen puzzles in other HOGs, this has huge side-scrolling, vertical scrolling, and zoom-able puzzles that contain hundreds of potential objects, of which you need to find 15-20, many of them tiny or partially-obscured. It is especially difficult considering there is no delineation between the foreground and the background, so clickable items can potentially be on any pixel of the screen.  Being a Victorian-set, European-produced game, I also found the items weren't always labelled with word choices I recognized. I ended up having to use the in-game hints for a handful of French, Italian, and archaic historical terms. However, there is no penalty for using the hint system, and the game features several levels of hints, with the 'I need a slight nudge' level recharging faster than the 'just find this thing for me because I give up' level.  The plot feels almost like a maguffin to get you to solve puzzles, and I don't know if it quite resolves itself satisfactorily. Also, even though the protagonist is supposed to be a 'strong female character,' it doesn't really feel like she's a hero because she spends the majority of the game being bossed around, patronized, and tricked by other characters, and having to clean up after their messes. On a related note, there is a recurring plot-point of 'hidden object puzzles only exist because all of our characters are either slobs or victims of disaster.' All of the hidden object scenes look like they just dumped a random assortment of junk all over the landscape, with no real rhyme or reason to the layout, and no location-specific theme (except for one gimmick level that was hilarious).  All that being said, the art was beautiful, the few mini-games and point-and-click sections were intuitive enough, the voice acting was hilariously over-the-top, and the music was cinematic-quality. It also does a pretty good job of maintaining a steampunk atmosphere throughout the game. Additionally, unlike other HOGs, this has almost no backtracking. You simply either automatically advance to the next area, or you click on the map to jump to a puzzle of your choice from the available options.  For a casual time-waster game with no achievements to worry about, it is worth a chance if you pick it up on sale. While the hidden object scenes are definitely challenging compared to other HOGs I've played, I appreciate the scope of what they tried to accomplish with the scrolling views.  Overall, I would give this game a 5.5/10
1687	1	a	Just finished The Clockwork-man. Just under two hours total gameplay, fairly easy if you are fluent in english, a bit harder if you are not. I would say that this suits children aged 6-12 who are fluent in english.  The gameplay consists of levels where you have to point and click on objects to collect or use in the level. When I say level, it is a scene, either a 'picture' or a zoomable picture, and you have a list of objects to find, for instance a vase, 7 gears,3 bracelets, a clay ink pot and so on. There is not really any system to what you need. The coffegrinder you see in one scene does nothing, but two scenes later you have to pick it up. Had some troubles, what is a chamoise, and what does an magnifying glass look like (not a handle with a round glass disk at least), but was able to reason most of these out, and the game also has a help-function in you mechanic friend.  All in all, I'll recommend this to children I think, the difficulty mainly lies in clicking in the right spot. There is no time, the help function is too powerful, as it details more and more as you click for help, and the story is not very deep and is without any big twists.
1689	1	a	The Clockwork Man is an engaging and beautiful steam-punk puzzle game. Great for casual and serious gamers alike.
1691	1	a	My wife and I play this game together, she loves it and I love it because I found a game I can play with my wife. So recomened for a couples game.
1693	1	a	If you like the genre, this is one of the better ones. However, it's very short.
1695	1	a	This was a fun game with good graphics. I really enjoy the Steampunk genre, but this game barely fit into that category. The story was pretty miserable and irrelevant. If you enjoy I-spy search and finds then this game is worth a try. The game is only a total of about 3 hours long but you can replay with different I-spy puzzles. It was $6 when I bought it, but that was too high a price for what you get. If it is between $2-$3 then consider checking it out!
1697	1	a	A hidden-picture game with a bit of a plot. Pretty light, mostly-filler plot, but plot none the less. It's super-quick--I think I finished it in two whole hours--and is mostly good as a time waster. But it does have lovely pictures.
1699	1	a	Beautiful but very short Hidden Object game in a steampunk setting.
1701	1	a	If you like the genre, this is one of the better ones. However, it's very short.
426	0	a	The difficulty level of the Hidden Object parts are LEGENDARY only for the bravest of brave to attempt. The images on the store page for this game look widescreen, but clicking the video shows the game is 4:3. This is normally not a big deal in puzzle games, but in this game its a HUGE deal due to how tiny the objects that need to be found. Playing on a widescreen you may literally need a magnifying glass to find objects, doesnt help that some areas have multiple areas with no indicator as to which scenes contain what objects. Even worse is that some objects are literally a few pixels in size due to its older ratio where that might not have been a problem for widescreen users combined with many objects being very low resolution this game will pose obstacle of herculean proportions. Items also spawn randomly, so go ahead and stare all day for a missing item, it may not even be on the screen, or it may have spawned behind another object since its random. This leads to reloading the game alot to reset objects to random positions hoping the objects spawn in an area that is visibly clickable. Even completely visible objects are hard to click due to them having such a teeny tiny clickable area that may have you clicking all over even though you feel your clicking right on the object itself.   The puzzles are at just the right difficulty not to impossible but challenging enough that finishing them feels rewarding. Oddly though many of these cant be skipped, there is no guide in the game like other games to help you so players may end up stuck unable to ever continue the game. Worse is that with some puzzles the pieces may be missing. Meaning the pieces spawned off screen, so you may need to reload the game many times to finish a puzzle to reset the locations of pieces.  The story is awesome with very good voice acting, this saves the game from being a total disaster, but the gameplay elements are so buggy their almost broken making it a very tedious and exhausting gameplay experience. Pretty sure the game like the title screen hasnt been updated since 2012 so guessing what bugs are there will be there forever sadly.  Rating: 2/10 Value: $0.99
427	0	a	The things to be found are tiny. Very frustrating and makes you wonder throughout the game exactly what you're doing with your life. Very simple and short story. Very casual casual game.
428	0	a	A good idea, but far too buggy and far too short. The writing was not the best, either. I'd give this a solid C.
429	0	a	The gameplay is ok, and the art has some nice late-90s CD-ROM puzzle game aesthetics. Unfortunately, there's very little game to play. I'd swear the cut scenes are a full half of the game, and they're horrible. The template is: 'bwahaha, foolish girl, I tricked you into cleaning my [space]!' 'Oh how dare you, you churl!' 'Relent, miss! Out of guilt I will actually do what was requested of me.'  But seriously, almost every scene is your character being tricked into cleaning up after people. And you're the only female character. You play a girl who goes around cleaning up after men. It's actually the whole story.
430	0	a	Valve, please. Just give us one more option besides a 'yes' or a 'no'. A half-hearted 'mneh' or a a shrug icon or even a thumb pointing sideways.  Because that's how I feel about The Clockwork Man. Not angry or frustrated enough to condemn this hidden object game, but not impressed enough to turn my thumbs upwards either.  There're certainly some aspects to praise about the game. It comes with a fairly unique hint system, built into the game's clockwork sidekick. It uses charges to help the player find more difficult objects, and recharges slowly over time so it doesn't make the game too easy all at once. The art is nice at least, and the game is mildly spiced up with other kinds of puzzles in-between hidden-object-finding sessions.  On the other hand, there just isn't much else to the game. I finished in about two hours, with some help from the hint system. The puzzles are nice, but they're also obvious (and overdone) to the seasoned puzzler. Upon completion, The Clockwork Man offers a freeplay mode, but those are for Hidden Object maps that you've already played by then.  The biggest disappointment had to be the setting. It promised an alternate-history steampowered Victorian world, and it delivered that in the first few moments. But then you're sent to an under-developed tropical island where little to none of that ever comes into play. Your 'global' adventure only consists of a few moments in your Victorian home and the rest of it on a single generic tropical mystery-island. The only steampowered clockwork wonders you'll experience are your sidekick Sprocket and   what you discover during the short finale  .  Hidden Object game enthusiasts will like this more, but they'd be better off with The Clockwork Man Bundle, which consists of this game and its sequel (which appears to at least have more Victorian steampunk elements). For everyone else though, whatever the second game is like, I can definitely say that The Clockwork Man is underwhelming and not worth a full-price purchase.
431	0	a	 Charming HO game, but ultimately frustrating
432	0	a	Primarily a hidden object game that includes a few other minor puzzles, such as placing items into your inventory, combining them and then using them on the environment.   The art is nice but set at a smaller box resolution, the Steam overlay doesn't work and the story and voice acting are rather dull. That leaves you with the meat of the game, finding objects! The environments are nicely drawn and you have a list of 10-20 objects or so to find in each scene. A robot ally can spot items for you at the expense of some of his slowly replenishing energy--the game's form of hints.   Objects you need to find are repeated quite often considering the game is only about two hours long. There's a free mode after finishing the game where you can spot to your heart's delight, and playing the game again is supposed to shift the scenes. I don't know why anyone would want to because it's a bore.
433	0	a	While Clockwork Man has an interesting premise and pretty visuals, it's far too short to recommend it. My play time is inflated from accidentally leaving the game running and spending some time on the unlimited HOG mode. Maybe if you really love hidden object games and get it on sale with the other Clockwork Man game, I could say 'go for it', but don't expect much out of it. The scrolling/zooming function isn't really as big of a deal as one would hope, and the story is not particularly good (although it's hilarious how everywhere Miranda goes, people ask her to clean up a big mess) and it ends on a cliffhanger that isn't resolved in the sequel!   And why are all the men in this game so fat???
434	0	a	Pixel hunting (to the point or thinking you've cliked on something, that wasn't it apparently, get to the point of using the bot for hints and yes that was it but apparently you didn't click in the right spot..), no intelligent support for widescreen, crashed on me during the final cutscene (and reset my save so I am NOT doing it all again to see if I missed anything)..  The scrolling and the zoom-in are a false good idea.. more annoying than nice, since foreground objects will move over the background stuff and hide it.  Graphics are nice as a whole, story is ok.. but can't recommend this one. Much better stuff and more fun to be had elsewhere on steam, indenpendently of price.
435	0	a	The game is too short and the story is totally dull. The hidden object scenes are ok, but the rest of the game is fogettable. Don't bother with this one, you can play The Clockwork Man: The Hidden World though - it's much much better.
436	0	a	Not a horrible game, but disappointing at how little game time there actually is.
437	0	a	The video game equivalent of highlights for kids.
438	0	a	Very short to play and not too much story. Not recomended unless very very cheap.
439	0	a	Find the object game. Massive shortage on actual puzzles, half of which I had to skip due to bugs.   Dull but (thankfully) short.
440	0	a	The story is intreaging and all, but the screen is small and I can hardly decipher anything from my usual distance from the screen. Like another HO game I have to stick my face to the screen to be able to see clearly. It's very tiring. I got irritated many times playing it. I wouldn't really recommend it.
441	0	a	It's a nice game, but there's hardly any game time... I mean, I accidentally left it running for a day, so it recorded as 9 hours, but I think it's closer to 1,5-2 hours of gameplay. Bit disappointing, especially for the price. Looks good though and it's a good game, so get it on sale!
442	0	a	Initailly thought this would be a Burton-esque steampunk P&amp;C adventure but despite the grand music, it turned out that The Clockwork Man actually is mostly a hidden object game with the occasional puzzle. Unfortunately the setting of the adventure, New Coventry, is much like its real-world equivalent and full of people with messy, run-down houses so the hidden object bits are frequent and rather tedious. However, unlike the world in the game, attractive women don't tend to run around enthusing about how much they like to clear places up.  Backgrounds were well drawn, though the designers elected to do the trick found on a zillion visual novels and show interactions between characters by sweeping them in from the sides. It's kinda cheap looking. Music was good, though didn't loop well and tended to be a bit jarring when it did. Story was overblown, though on the plus side   the annoying little R2D2 thing ended up dead.   Yay!  The game takes about 2-3 hours to complete. At about Â£2 an hour (that's about $10,000 for those in the colonies), it may not seem like wonderful value. Artifex Mundi tend to do this sort of thing better.
443	0	a	You go from one hidden object scene to the next, not much game play in between. This is a very short game, I only made it to 3 hours by letting it run while doing other things. For my taste the main character is rather annoying and not the smarted cookie out there. Also, some of the item to search for are multiple times in the scene, so that you don't only have to find e.g. a lipstick, but the right one. For a true HOG fan, this is ok, but for anyone new to the genre, there are better games out there.
444	0	a	Meh.  The puzzles are okay, the plot is shallow, and the character art is dreadful. Miranda is okay, but everyone else looks like stiff mannequins with dead eyes. But the hidden object gameplay, that mostly consists of forcing miranda to clean other peoples messy houses (they leave like mangoes and butter knives everywhere) can be pretty relaxing, since it's mostly your eyes working. I would probably recommend it if they spent some more time making a more interesting story. This one ends suddenly just when you start to get somewhere and its buh-bye.
445	0	a	One of the puzzles was broken, it lacks other gameplay elements that you usually find in other hidden object games. In this game there is dialog then you have a hidden object puzzle, pretty much all the way through the game, only a few other puzzles

1703	1	a	This is a review for both 'Clockwork Man' and 'Clockwork Man: The Hidden World' since I played them back to back and they share the same lead character. Actually, I've played both these games many times on a different PC before I got into Steam. So my playtimes you see for each will probably be less than a normal playthrough since I can whiz through the games by now. We'll start with game #1:  Pros:  - Nice graphics and good character designs. The main girl, Miranda (YAY, she has my name!), is quite lovely.  - The voice acting is also good, for the most part. I really like who they chose for Miranda. Some of the others can be a bit cheesy but it is amusing rather than irritating.  - Interesting story.  - Both games have a very neat hidden object feature. Scrolling and zooming. Not every scene but many allow you to move around the area. Some items are sneakily hidden behind others but just one click to the left or right will reveal them.  - Both games also have an interesting hint system. You travel around with a little robot man and he'll help you locate those tough to find objects. He starts out with the ability to just tell you where a random something is. Then a little into the story, he learns how to give you an item's silhouette (which is the hint I prefer if I'm stuck). Further in the story, he gets other abilities. Like briefly highlighting each metal object on your HO list.  - In both games, the music isn't spectacular but it's pleasant to listen to. Actually, in #2 there are a couple places with very lovely melodies.  - When you beat each game, Freeplay opens up. This gives you random hidden object areas. Good for if you're in that 'I have a craving to find stuff' mood.  Cons:  - Neither game is connected to Steam while you're playing. So you won't be able to chat with friends or take steam screenshots.  - Unfortunately, both games have issues when it comes to clicking on items. You'll find you need to be very precise and occasionally you'll need to click more than once or try clicking on a different part of the object. It doesn't happen TOO often or else I wouldn't be able to recommend these games.  - Both games are short. Boo.   Now I'll list the differences in Clockwork Man: The Hidden World:   - The length is longer. Because of the higher difficulty, possibly much longer.  - This game has a journal where Miranda records her adventures and anything of note. You WILL need to use this journal to solve quite a few puzzles.  - There are many more puzzles in #2 and some of them are downright devious. There are no skip options either. Also, it's easy to miss things that you need in some scenes so you might get stuck for awhile. I love this game but it IS a bit aggravating sometimes. Those who enjoy a challenge will have fun. :D  - The story has no tie-ins with the first game. The Hidden World's plot is much more involved than #1 and, in my opinion, fascinating.  - The voice acting, again in my opinion, is better than the first game. (Miranda is still the same, which is good!)  - Maybe it's my imagination but it seems the graphics are better in #2, though I'm pretty sure they used the same game engine.   - When you finish the game, you can rewatch any of the cutscenes.    So in closing, I really enjoy both these games so I'm definitely recommending them to hidden object and puzzle fans. But, because of their short length, you should wait and grab them when they're on sale.   Important Note! The games might not load up for you, which is an issue I had. Right click on the Clockwork Man title, click on Properties, click on Local Files, click on Browse Local Files (which will bring up your program files for the games), right click on the Clockwork Man title again, click on Troubleshoot Compatibility, and finally click on Try recommended settings. I did that for each game and then they worked just fine.
447	0	a	The hidden world is a good name, this puzzle game should be hidden so it never sees the light of day. Like the last game, this game suffers from low resolution objects, objects that are a few pixels in size, and objects where clicking right on them may be a futile effort. Playing this game is similar to being locked out of your house while drunk take all your keys off your keyring throwing them wildly about then attempting to find and pick up your door key with your elbows.  The voice acting is very good, but the story isnt enough to keep anyone playing, in fact this game is good at putting you to sleep. Puzzles due to the low resolution, and being finicky, are just so tiring to complete making the game experience feel labored without satisfaction. There is no way to skip puzzles or solutions, or hints, or a guide in this game which can lead players stuck unable to finish the game.   Rating: 1/10 Value: $0.50
1705	1	a	What a lovely game!  A prematurely silver 21-year-old engineer named Miranada repeatedly and politely puts down any sexism against her from the male characters with her competence and confidence.  There's an adorable robot.  There's an adorable squirrel. The interactions with the squirrel made me nostalgic for the Ken and Roberta Williams days of the old Sierra King's Quest games. Very clever; great attention to detail.  The art is beautiful.  The puzzles are interesting and engaging.  For a Hidden Object Game, the plot is absolutely spectacular and the characters are rich and entertaining.  Great casual, low stress game for next time you're stuck in bed sick for the day.
1707	1	a	A fairly typical 'find the hidden object' game. The plot of this sequal is better than the first game and you miss nothing by skipping directly. On Linux, I found both games to suffer severely with graphical glitches, poor performance and misuse of widescreen resolutions, to the impact of showing what should be off screen graphics in the letterboxing used to pad the 4:3 ratio scenes on my widescreen display. Overall, enjoyable but does little to separate itself from the plethora of similar games on the market.
1709	1	a	It's an okay game, but I finished it quickly.
1711	1	a	Quality hidden objects combined with a handful of interesting puzzles and a decent story. The voice overs are a mixed bag ranging from good to super annoying and the ending felt abrupt. Its a fairly short game, maybe 20 scenes but the hybrid of hidden object with puzzles I haven't solved 500 times before was nice and the scenes were all top quality and visually pleasing. The game offers 'scrolling' and 'zooming' scenes that let you pan around to find the required objects which I thought was a nice change.  Definitely worth a sale purchase if you enjoy the genre. Looking forward to playing the others and I hope there will be more.
1713	1	a	Essentially the same game as the first but in a different location. Simple puzzle-sovling and hidden objects gameplay.
1715	1	a	Even better (and longer) than the first one. The plot gets a little silly in the latter half, but the puzzles are unique and fresh.
1717	1	a	Same as the first part, this is of the nicer and more interesting hidden objects games out there.
457	0	a	It's better than the first game, but that's not saying much. The first one was absolutely terrible, while this one is merely awful.  The hidden object scenes very inconsistent in difficulty. Most of the objects are glaringly obvious but there's often one or two that are tiny and blend with the background, making them almost impossible to see. This is only made worse by the low resolution. The difficulty progression is also way off; many of the early scenes are far more difficult than ones later in the game. The items in the scenes are quite boring and the player is often required to find multiples of the same object. Some objects are mislabelled, quite badly so in some cases.  The puzzles are for the most part pathetically easy, although, again, some are much harder. And again, this seems to have nothing to do with progression through the game; some are just randomly hard for no apparent reason. Some puzzles lack context, meaning that the only way to solve them is to randomly try things until something works or just wait for the hint bar to charge.  The story is fairly bad, although well acted, and the ending is just rubbish. Perhaps the most annoying thing about it is that it has nothing to do with the story of the first game and in no way addresses the cliffhanger ending from the first. I thought that perhaps it would tie in later on, but nope, it's like the devs just forgot the first game exists. Which in all honesty I can't blame them for since the first game is so atrocious.  Apart from the gameplay itself there are numerous other problems with this game. There are instances where puzzle elements appear almost completely off screen; and by almost completely I mean that only a single pixel is visible. Some objects in the hidden object scenes are behind parts of the interface and so are not visible at all. The click detection is frequently so picky that it refuses to acknowledge that the player has clicked on an object unless the exact couple of pixels that it is happy with are clicked, leading to a great deal of wasted time looking for objects I had already found and clicked on a few times. Also the sound is somewhat bugged. I found numerous instances where lines of dialogue did not play, and at one point the ambient sound in one scene got stuck in a loop and continued to play in every other scene after that.  Having played many HOGs I feel I have a good basis for comparison and I would have to say that this one is not worth it. Not even if it were free. There are many other HOGs that are far better and much more deserving of your time.
1719	1	a	it plays welll and you can finish it in an hour.
1721	1	a	Nice game, like the predecessor. Has some more puzzles to it and a nice story again. Dont expect to much from it, the puzzles are quite easy but very much fun to do. Like it...
458	0	a	Managed to make it through the first episode :o( because had to have that to install this one. Not bothering to complete this game too frustrating. Again I am looking for tiny objects and the hint/help button doesn't work just makes a noise with no results it just goes to reload for the next time. Don't bother with next time the other indicator says they is no help for this location. Have to go online to use a walkthrough if I want to complete it. Too many object searches with not actual travelling through cities, buildings with hallways etc. just leaping from single places and rooms over maps with no roads or paths, adventure lost. Into the my krap file it goes.
1723	1	a	A fun hidden object game if you want to play one with a story interlinked. It is short, but nicely made for a intermediate gamer!
1725	1	a	Excellent story but a very shaky flash implementation that really detracts from the experience. Many crashes that required a hard reset to recover from. To be honest I would not have purchased it if it was clear to me that it was written in flash, so I guess I see why they didn't tell me...  Worth playing but just be aware. 
459	0	a	Clock Work Man (Hidden) I have asked three times for help in the puzzle and nothing. I have restarted three times and still puzzle is not working. Too many hours and a dead end. Now I can't find the refund button, so I'm just going to throw the money away and delete it.
460	0	a	damn thing wont start!!!!!!!
461	0	a	The ending credits are longer than the game itself. 3/10
1727	1	a	Snuggle Truck is life.   10/10
1729	1	a	Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.  The basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.  If getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.  Snuggle Truck is okay.
1731	1	a	Pretty fun, wish I had more time to really delve into it, though.
1733	1	a	Fun game, smooth gameplay made me really enjoy it. just 'WASD' , delivering the 'animals' to zoo as quickly as possible.   7/10 
1735	1	a	You and your group of stuffed homies drive off in the best epic action adventure RPG racing game of the year. This game is an emotional joyride as the superb character development keeps you on your seat begging for more. Travel the world on your certified kappa truck as you go through this ultimate adventure one jump at a time.
1737	1	a	Just bought the game for the Brony Mode XD I like the game ;)
1739	1	a	The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldnâ€™t call this one a â€œthrill ride,â€ but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when youâ€™ve got three minutes to spare.  Itâ€™s hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that itâ€™s highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you donâ€™t do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truckâ€™s trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned.   Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the 'zoo': thereâ€™s an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: thereâ€™s a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.  Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.  Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But thereâ€™s a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know whatâ€™s around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.  To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so itâ€™s not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since thereâ€™s so many in each tier.  Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.  While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if youâ€™re in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.
1741	1	a	Great game, very funny, Very good music. I really loved it. Thanks!
1743	1	a	'Cause Brony mode :D
1745	1	a	Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.  Firstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as 'video games.'  With that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.  This soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking 'hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck.'  That's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.  The audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.  With everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.
1747	1	a	picked this up for my duaghter who is 6yr's old she loved it, i call it the 'lol wagon' simple fun physics gameplay.
1749	1	a	the graphics and physics need some improving. However the gameplay itself is very enjoyable. The artstyle is weird and charming.
1751	1	a	It was supposed to be called 'Smuggle Truck' and have you smuggle Mexicans across the border (or so I've been told), so that fact alone made me buy this.
1753	1	a	I could NOT resist! Bringing cuteness into physics, and a somewhat reminder of Line Rider, the ability to create your own tracks - I had to buy it! It's yet another incredible indie game, and well worth the price. Get it!
1755	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â™¥â™¥â™¥, 5 stars!
1757	1	a	Snuggle Truck is actually quite charming and challanging. It's a bit of a surprise really. Speed runs, keeping all of the stuffed animals in the damn truck with bad shocks... It's adictive as well.  It was bought for me as a joke but the jokes on them! I really enjoy it. I like to put some hardcore rap on when I play my Muthaâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in Snuggletruckin. 
1759	1	a	I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.  This is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.  The experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.
1761	1	a	If you like games with cute graphics, catchy music and simple fun gameplay you could do much worse than this.   With only accelerate, decelerate and tilt as your controls, the objective is to take your truck through an obstacle course without allowing your cuddly toys to fall out.   I really like it. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes and then put down, and the upbeat music puts a nice big grin on my face.   What more can you ask for?
1763	1	a	This is one cute casual game. Easy to learn, hard to master. Levels are short, but they give a blast of fun.
1765	1	a	Most addicting game even better than Dota 2 but you dont have to hate russians.
1767	1	a	Its like the perfect game for a â™¥â™¥â™¥, 5 stars!
1769	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game on Steam that was previously a flash game called 'Smuggle Truck', a game commenting on the trials of immigration to the United States from Mexico. This is a narrative thread with satirization that works quite well.  Snuggle Truck is about transporting stuffed animals to the zoo, which makes for incredibly confusing commentary. First of all, where are the stuffed animals trying to escape from? Are they escaping from the bedrooms of a particularly stultifying suburb? Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?  No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo? What is to be gained from this action, especially when there are real animals to look at and already existing stuffed fascimiles to buy fresh from the gift shop at manufacturer suggested retail prices? THIS GAME MAKES NO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ SENSE AND THE MESSAGE IT OFFERS TO THE PLAYER IS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CLOWNSHOES.  It is a solid physics flash game and it'll entertain you for twenty minutes before it starts to get boring. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.
1771	1	a	Greatest.. game.. EVER
1773	1	a	Snuggle Truck is without a doubt the most hardcore game in existence. Think Dark Souls, but without equipment and progression, but you die a little inside every time you lose a level.  10/10
1775	1	a	This shaz is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bees knees yo. I'm snugglin my truck all the way to the godamn bank homie, shieeeeet.
1777	1	a	I like casually playing this game. Not sure why, perhaps just because of the racing and physics combination. It does get a bit boring after a while though. But that's after you've already had your share of the fun of course.

1779	1	a	This game is stupid and I love it.
1781	1	a	I bought this because the words snuggle and truck were in the title and next to each other.
1783	1	a	A masturpecy in vidyagayms. A monolith of what humanitee reprezents. YES/10 wuld by many copies, kinda scary tho
1785	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that entertains sometimes!
1787	1	a	very nice game cute and funny and all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that entertains sometimes!
1789	1	a	Adorable side-scrolling obstacle course driving game, in which a truckload of cuddly toys must not fall out as you fly over ramps, TNT, and moose! Levels range from the simple to the incredibly hard.
1791	1	a	I have felt every possible human emotion while playing Snuggle Truck.
1793	1	a	Ok, Snuggle Truck (and Smuggle Truck) are pretty fun little games. Sometimes I like to relax with a casual game like this for a few minutes, I picked this up months ago.  But just now they added 'Brony Mode'... They snuck bronies into my Steam game collection. My Steam list is tainted forever now. Jerks.
1795	1	a	hilarious game similar to happy wheels except you deliver stuffed animals.... the ones that dont fall out of your truck anyway
1797	1	a	Sexiest Truck I ever seen in my life
1799	1	a	Would snuggle again - 10/10
1801	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different. That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do. None the less.  The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck. There isn't really much more to it than that. It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish. It gets boring if you play too much of it at once. I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.  Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border. See, learning can be fun!
1803	1	a	  Yay, smuggle truck! Better than expected! Of course, it remidns me the Hill Climb Racing. Hard and extreme levels are fun. Remember, small rocks are evil.
1805	1	a	You can do wheelies with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pickup truck.
1807	1	a	Don't mock Snuggle Truck.
1809	1	a	GOTY all years, marvelous gameplay, stylish graphics, great replayability, fantastic sound, insanely creative, an absolute must if you call yourself a hardcore gamer. BUY NOW!!
1811	1	a	buy this game right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing now
1813	1	a	One of the best games evahr!

1819	1	a	Its very good gaem plz buy
1821	1	a	Buy this game for the fuzzies.
1823	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a game that I recommend because: - is only 4 euro - is a method to banish boredom - is a simply game - have trading cards  Enjoy!
1825	1	a	Pricetag completely justified.
1827	1	a	This game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing amazing. It has an indepth story line, amazing graphics, well done sound effects, and an immersive feel. This game is probably the greatest thing that has come to the gaming world since Duke Nukem: Forever. And the price is reasonable, I only had to put one mortgage on my house! Everyone should own this game.
1829	1	a	Brony Mode activated!
1831	1	a	I click on the Tab 'MORE' and all was for FREE :D
1833	1	a	But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it was 99 cents.
1835	1	a	Can I get a toot toot  Can I get a beep beep  Runnin' her hands through my 'fro  Bouncin' on 24's While they say on the radio  This is the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen  Mama rollin' that body  Got every man in her wishin'  Sippin' on coke and rum  I'm like so what I'm drunk  It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun  This is the remix to ignition  Hot and fresh out the kitchen  Mama rollin' that body  Got every man in her wishin'  Sippin' on coke and rum  I'm like so what I'm drunk  It's the freakin' weekend baby  I'm about to have me some fun  Girl we off in this jeep  Foggin' windows up Blastin' the radio  In the back of my truck  Bouncin' up and down  Stroke it round and round  To the remix We just thuggin' it out  Ooops sorry I confused Snuggle Truck with R Kelly's Ignition Remix because that's literally how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWESOME this game is.  
1837	1	a	I dont know how it got this game...  I.... well it have a car and animals...   10/10 5 year olds would play
1839	1	a	I said how it's unjolly when people sell me Unity games without warning, ye? I did.
1841	1	a	I made this.
1843	1	a	Got this game in a indiegala bundle for 2 dollars with other 9 games. Not regreted it ever since.
1845	1	a	I want to snuggle inside truck.
1847	1	a	This title screams 'started life as a mobile game.'  It's mindless fun and probably worth picking up on sale and you want that kind of experience on your desktop. The graphics, music and level design are all competent. My main complaints would be the inability to distinguish obstacles from harmless background art and the 'baby fuzzy' mechanic is a little undercooked. I don't see myself going crazy unlocking all the medals but if you're a relentless completionist there's a lot of reasons to go back and replay levels. But if you just want to play all the levels it's certainly within your grasp, nothing about the game is frustratingly impossible and the learning curve is reasonable.
1849	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
1851	1	a	This game is way more entertaining than it should be! :)
1853	1	a	The level editor adds a lot to this already cool little game.

1859	1	a	Funny jump and run, with all the little twists one would expect. :)
1861	1	a	10/10 Will play again. 
1863	1	a	The best thing in this game is clearly the pony mode.
1865	1	a	A delightfully fun physics-based game. Don't let the name fool you; while it may seem like a game for children, it can get ridiculously difficult at times. This game can certainly entertain you or a group of friends, no matter the age.
1867	1	a	Race across a bumpy landscape without losing your passengers. A fairly simple game that can be a lot of fun. There are different skins for your truck &amp; a few different types of passengers.  You can create, upload &amp; download levels. Supports other Operating Systems too.
1869	1	a	Literally the first level and they drop the see me rollin' bomb. They got balls, I'll tell you that.
1871	1	a	just buy it, dont ask why just buy it
1873	1	a	More entertaining and challenging than you might expect going in.
1875	1	a	I like it :) It's fun, has its own 'persona'. I like snuggling.  If you're hesitating, wait for a discount. It's true that 5â‚¬ is a bit too much for that casual game. Watchout it seems that there is no steam-cloud saving in that game or i did something wrong. Whatever I lost my saves.  Runs smooth on linux and xbox 360 usb controller. No issue at all.
1877	1	a	Real fun! Slightly less than its brother Smuggle Truck, but still really fun!
1879	1	a	gameplay is fun, good casual game if u need a break from a more difficult game.
1881	1	a	9/10 Addictive iOS gameplay
1883	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1885	1	a	Extremely simple concept and controls which provide more silly fun than imaginable. Great for both adults and children, even extra emotionally sensitive types who might otherwise cringe and be disturbed by cute animals flying outta the back of a truck that's hurtling over all sort of wonderful hazards. Yes, they get run over. Yep, the truck can roll-over and land on the whole lot, but they're drawn to look like inert stuffed critters thereby making the whole deal grandly hilarious instead of traumatic.  Get from start to finish. Keep as many critters in the truck as you can. Catch a few falling extra if possible. Do it all as quick as you can for trophies. Each level has 5 trophies to be earned and many will be maddeningly difficult to obtain. As a bonus you can even come up with your own diabolical levels in the editor. What fun!   I highly recommend this game. Wait for a good sale for extra appeal!
1887	1	a	BUY IT!!!!!!!! SNUGGLE TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1889	1	a	It be funtastic!! The soundtrack is cool too.
1891	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
1893	1	a	to snuggle the truck: one must be complete in mind, and truck in spirit
1895	1	a	Surprisingly fun little physics game. Not sure what else to call it... Worth the buy if the premise appeals to you at all since the execution is really well done.
1897	1	a	It's adorable, it's challenging, and you will feel terrible each and every time you lose a poor little fuzzy to your terrible driving skills.
1899	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game, much like Trials. You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.  The truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).  If Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.
1901	1	a	this game is not as bad as you think this game is fun  worth it
1903	1	a	A total laugh for 5 minutes of spare time, which often turns into much more. My kids also love it!
1905	1	a	Snuggle Truck, life or video game? Once you play this game it WILL become your life. It is an obsession you will be unable to fufill because Snuggle Truck is life and thus unless it is your life you will be unable to fufill the desire that is Snuggle Truck.
1907	1	a	Snuggle Truck is a straightforward but fun physics puzzler. You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.  The risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.  I'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.
1909	1	a	This game is a blast. Adults and kids alike will enjoy it.
462	0	a	The concept is fun and addictive at the start, but in all it doesn't feel like anything more than a Flash game; the only thing it's missing is a Newgrounds logo. It's a well-made game, but most of the levels are just user-made garbage with lots of unfair traps and the physics can be wonky at times. I also got the occasional crash.  Buy this on sale only; it's worth about 3 bucks in my opinion. It's got a good amount of content and the concept is entertaining, but in spirit it feels like any other Box2D Flash game that has been flooding the Internet for free since 2006,
463	0	a	It's not that Snuggle Truck is  bad  per say, it's just...not very good.  Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.  I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.
464	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:  Pros:   â™¦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game) â™¦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level) â™¦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you donâ€™t like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably wonâ€™t find this as fun as I did) â™¦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game) â™¦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus) â™¦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level) â™¦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game) â™¦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game) â™¦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons youâ€™ll get your $5 worth)   Cons:  â™¦ No Steam Cloud Storage (Iâ€™ve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I shouldâ€™ve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesnâ€™t make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldnâ€™t be on Steam) â™¦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a â€œ+moreâ€ menu. The â€œ+more+ menu doesnâ€™t lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once youâ€™ve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didnâ€™t mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the â€œ+moreâ€ menu) â™¦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels donâ€™t always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesnâ€™t explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)  â™¦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you canâ€™t actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why itâ€™s even called DLC) â™¦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You canâ€™t close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing) â™¦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work) â™¦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable) â™¦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you canâ€™t actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing) â™¦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesnâ€™t act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesnâ€™t function properly) â™¦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they donâ€™t function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is â€œTestâ€ which shouldnâ€™t be the case)  Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I canâ€™t recommend this game. I canâ€™t recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.
465	0	a	I can't really say Snuggle Truck is worth playing on anything apart from a mobile device. There is no point to this game being on PC since it would be perfect on IOS.   The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of 'snugglies' in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.  The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it).   User created levels will add replayability here, but don't waste your time playing.
466	0	a	i like the idea of this game, especially as smuggle truck where youâ€™re transporting immigrants across the border. unfortunately the steam version is only stuffed animals to â€œda zoo,â€ is very noticeably buggy, and i donâ€™t enjoy the levels that much either. luckily i got it through humble bundle for android 2, so i can install smuggle truck on android where itâ€™s less buggy. if youâ€™re like me, you may as well run the steam version long enough to get the cards and actually play it on android.
467	0	a	Once upon a time I played a flash game where you drove a motorcyle over ugly blocky terrain and did tricks and stuff to get through increasingly difficult levels.  This game isn't half as engaging as that flash game was, so I got bored of it pretty quickly. The levels I played were all just straight drives from left to right with slightly modified landscape. Boring.
468	0	a	In this game you're the proprietor of a white van with tinted windows. Your goal is to drive around the town and recruit various children who are loitering around the school after hours to help find your lost puppy. When you pick a child up it is then your duty to brutally and savagely anally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them. This is the 'snuggle' part of the game. You then must drive down a secluded road miles away from their home and dump them off in the middle of the woods.
469	0	a	Just another port from a free mobile game. Way too simple to enjoy for longer than 20 minutes. It used to have an offensive gimmick when it was called Smuggle Truck, and you were smuggling Mexicans. Now it's even worse.
470	0	a	Rubbish!  Hill Climb Racing Fail!  Android games are better than this.
471	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this casual piece of manure, belongs on phones and nowhere else.  Ok, it's not that bad but seriously who would seriously spend money on this?
472	0	a	Go buy yourself a hot coffee, then, remove lid and put it in your car. Now, drive a bumpy road somewhere with jumps and watch your coffee being spilled all around. That's what this game is.

474	0	a	Games like this has been done multiple times before this one. Snuggle truck is one of the worst ones though. It doesn't add anything new to the 'genre' and the level design is horrible. It feels like something that was done as a school project in 2 days.
475	0	a	Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of 'Snuggies' as fast as possible to the zoo. On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.  Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from 'Smuggle Truck' to 'Snuggle Truck'. Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.   Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend 'Smuggle Truck' instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.
476	0	a	A simple racing/physics game.  Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.  The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.  Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.
477	0	a	Pretty much a phone game to it's core, barely done any improvements on PC version if any at all. Resolution is upscaled pretty badly and the meniu is just eye mauling. However it's pretty good for little kids, it's a mobile game, but it's still blows mobile version on 24 inch monitor in their mind.   Either way would not recommend spending more than 1$ on this.
478	0	a	The camera is too zoomed in, you never know what obstacle is ahead of you, which means you either have to repeat the levels over and over to get a good result or you need stupidly good reaction times.
479	0	a	Has a brony mode. Buy it only if you don't want to be on my freinds list.
480	0	a	While fun, not very fit for a PC game, buy it on mobile instead.
481	0	a	I bought this game because i wanted more steam games and it was like four bucks. I don't know why i did it. Should've stopped me.
482	0	a	Too childish. I can't play such a game. Maybe if you want this for kids, it might do.
483	0	a	Basically, a 4$ flash game. A good one, but still not worth the price (cause of lenght and gameplay).  SCORE: 40/100

485	0	a	Snuggle Truck is like one of those Trials flash games made by some bozo. It seems like it should be fun in a Trials kind of way, but the physics are absolutely not up to it and the truck just kind of clunks around the terrain in the introductory levels before you uninstall it.
486	0	a	Snuggle Truck is physics-based vehicle game where you need to keep you cargo in your truck. It's ported from mobile platforms. These kind of games used to be flash games on the pc and you probably have a flash game somewhere on the internet that is the same. But the absolute worst thing about this game is that it has a brony mode.
487	0	a	'It's like Trials with animals' -IGN    Neh, 1/10

491	0	a	Nothing to look here...
492	0	a	This is a $5 version of Happy Wheels. It's not even worth the $5 either. It's not a bad game, because it's stealing for Happy Wheels, but it's not a good game because your losing $5 for something that you can get that's better for free.
493	0	a	A game about balancing the contents of your truck as you go over terrain on a 2D plane. It's simple and difficult. But it couldn't hold my attention. It felt like I was playing an old flash game from the 90s. Something that you'd play around with on a lunch period at school.   They also try to push the stuffed animal thing a bit to far like it's some hilarious joke and I just wasn't on board.
494	0	a	A simplistic mobile game with awful controls.   PROS: -Graphics are amusing  CONS: -Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...) -Mobile game -Awkward, exaggerated physics  The game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck.   Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The 'Easy' levels were enough for me.
495	0	a	Great music, great visuals, but more frustrating than it is fun.
496	0	a	A game with Bronies in mind. Amusing for 5 minutes and that's about.
497	0	a	IT SUCKS DONKEY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ NOT WORTH THE 5.49. MY FRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME AND I REGRET IT. I HATE THIS GAME! 
498	0	a	There's really not much to say for Snuggle Truck... It's an okay mobile game but there are plenty of other games (both casual and hardcore) where your time would be better spent.
499	0	a	Do i even need to say anything about this one ?
500	0	a	Extremely amusing little game, but far too little content even for just $5. Fun lasted for about 30 minutes. There's only so many times you can drive along various bumpy trails and watch stuffed animals fly around before the comedy in it dies out.
501	0	a	It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.  Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.  (Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over. I won't hold that against the game, but it was still very frustrating)
1911	1	a	Very well built physics based game. Good strong deep intellectual story line Great complex characters. I'll never forget the final boss fight.. nearly put me to tears. Highly skill based. I would not be surprised if this game was considered for MLG. Not for everyone however. The competitive edge will turn some casuals away. 10/10
1913	1	a	This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!  UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything.   Pros: Kinda fun at times  Cons: Too easy Broken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join) Framerate drops  Just no  UPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!
1915	1	a	So much fun if you have only a few mins to play and just want to goof about
1917	1	a	Good game when U have friends, but if U are alone it is boring
1919	1	a	Bought this came because I needed to make a purchase in order to get me some of those sweet cs:go skins. And let me tell you, I was not dissapointed. This is the cheapest game on steam at the moment, yet it's still fun, I dont know why. I'd recommend for kids, or casual gamers.   The sounds are awesome. Controls are a bit icky, but you get used to them. Gamemodes are fun. AND AWESOME PRICE.
1921	1	a	Great horror game.NSFW. Is very scary. Up there with Gubble. For more reviews, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you
1923	1	a	If you haven't tried this, I pity you. 10/10
1925	1	a	Quite addicting.
1927	1	a	not bad but not best i see so much greater F2P games and that game for money?I dont know why but I dont have problem funny,amazing but its not have story ou other gamemodes so its not for me 
1929	1	a	This game changed my life for ever. A stunning mix of gameplay and storytelling. One of the most underated games on Steam. 10/10
1931	1	a	This game taught me how to jump like professional.
1933	1	a	for the 19c VERY GOOOD
1935	1	a	10/10 would play again
1937	1	a	It's not that bad....for $0.29. No, but this game is actually kind of fun. The controls take a bit to get used to and the levels ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly. I would recommend a controller, but the keyboard and mouse options are fine since the control scheme is pretty basic.
508	0	a	Unless you enjoy talking balls that make engine sounds and jump around in a small arena, I would not get this game. I only paid $0.29 for it, but I just don't like it. I closed the game after 5 minutes and never played it again.
1939	1	a	10/10 would play again
1941	1	a	great game for having fun with friends
1943	1	a	10/10 would bang (into the AI, because they help each other to win just to spite my obviously superior skills.).  Also made me fail my A levels.
510	0	a	please dont buy this game, there are troll reviews etc and i knew they were fake but at 14p i bought it anyway. the money wasted isnt what bothers me... it is 6 mins of my life
511	0	a	I don't believe that this game was worth the quarter I paid for it.
1945	1	a	dont waste your money even though its only 29 cents. dumbass game.
1947	1	a	Possitives - Great multiplayer - Czech game ;-) - It takes only 56 MB on your HDD Negatives - Maps those you can play 2 times and after it they comes annoying as f*ck - My friend canÂ´t connect to multiplayer :/  It suck as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ !!! But itÂ´s so great ^-^
1949	1	a	This game is a true work of art. You know you're getting quality when the person running the server sets your framerate. 9/10 because there is no 10 pack available
513	0	a	It's a cute game to play on free time, but it's more fun to play with friends but many people are reluctant to buy it also online servers are very RARE almost no one playes it, it'd be fun with more people but on your own it gets a bit too repetitive
514	0	a	Probably the worst game I've bought. I was glad to have gotten it for only $0.50 on sale. Right now I can run crysis 2 on high with DX11 on at full fps but this game lags like a benchmark running on a potato. I'm not the only person to complain about this. Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.
1951	1	a	Baby sitting tool !
1953	1	a	This changed me
1955	1	a	This game learn me how to jump like a professional :D
1957	1	a	Awesome game, the memories, the feels. 10/10

1961	1	a	This game is pure magic from the moment you strap on your codpiece to the moment you blow up the moon 
1963	1	a	this game is so good it cured my ebola!!!!
1965	1	a	My buddy and I couldn't connect our gumboys together. This is insanity! Don't buy this game, don't gift, and do not buy 5 other copies. I'm bad and I should feel bad.
519	0	a	'Game of the Year 2006!' - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game  twice , I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a 'game'.
1967	1	a	Obviously you must realise the art work that lies deep inside the game. It's deep inside the subconscious of a young child in pre industrial America where you are forced to thrive off of others in a anarchy like goverment, yet being deep in the past the gumboys predict the future with movements and smiles. What lies in the cores of gumboys is something that is deep and dark that is covered up with looks of pleasuring happiness...you must find this out on your own. Only you can learn the secret art of the gumboy. Find it...  
522	0	a	if you like this you're either a baby or an iphone gamer
1969	1	a	Fun gane, I love the pace it has, too bad there ain't not any players online!!! try it !!!!!!!
1971	1	a	Very fun game. Its fun. Cool sounds! +

1975	1	a	cumboy tournament
1977	1	a	This was an epic game Gumboy Tournament is a semi-follow up to 2006's 2D side-scroller Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. What's unique about Gumboy Tournament is that it's not a linear, move-from-the-left-of-the-screen-to-the-right-of-the-screen platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros. The game's levels are closed-off arenas, and the view usually allows you to see most of the level,
1979	1	a	i like because its a tourtament game.
1981	1	a	Pretty awesome game! Never knew!
527	0	a	imagine getting gangrene on your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ then having to cut it off with a dull filet knife  that is getting this game to work on multiplayer

1987	1	a	Best game ive ever played in my life

529	0	a	it makes sticky noises when you roll around. stay away from this game.

1991	1	a	The worst game I will build a wall to keep it out.
532	0	a	wow coudlnt play with friends 0/10
533	0	a	I remember playing it outside of Steam, it was great. Too bad it's Steam version has extremely low framerate for some reason which is important for such a fast-paced game. There is no way to solve this problem.
1993	1	a	Get it while its on sale, it worth 0,19 â‚¬!
537	0	a	This game sucks so bad, that makes Bad Rats look like Titanfall (but no seriously, Bad Rats was really fun, that i made 3 hours from the first launch, even i unlocked an achievement).  I am sorry for the people who bought it for full price. Atleast i spend 20 cents for this.
538	0	a	Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can 'appreciate' an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.
539	0	a	i didn't think i would ever regret spending 29 cents on a game but frickin crap.

543	0	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balls dont buy

545	0	a	this game gave me a near death experience, god help me, my joints are hurting, call for help.
546	0	a	I would definetly recommend this deep storyline and charecter set to my 6 inch â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
547	0	a	no..Just NO
548	0	a	Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.
549	0	a	Pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

2019	1	a	I know this is a kids game, but you bring over your friends and you pull out the whiskey, this game becomes goty.
2021	1	a	â€œLike Club Penguin with guns.â€ 10/10
2023	1	a	More intense than Titanfall
2025	1	a	THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU WOULD PURCHASE THIS INDIE PACK FORGET ABOUT YOUR 'SKILL' IN TRIBES AIRSHOTS, COD 360 NOSCOPES AND TF2 ROCKETJUMPING AND TRY TO AIRSHOT A PENGUIN WITH A SNOWBALL 2 TIMES IN A ROW WHILE AIRSTRAFING TO STAY ALIVE AND NOT GET EATEN BY A SHARK YOURSELF AND TRYING NOT TO HIT YOUR TEAMMATES  10/10
2027	1	a	Being Penguins split up in up to four groups, throwing snowballs and Fish at each other trying to push the other Penguins off the island, is what this arena battle game is about. If you like cute looking games, Winter and Penguins, this game is made for you. And it's fun!  You get to play on different stages, some more unique than others. One stage even have environmental changes like the latest Battlefield games, and the game's graphics are on the same level as the latest Call of Duty games. Penguin's Arena got powerups, making you invinsible for seconds, making you stick to the ground, throwing Fish dynamite and throwing Fish, that can be thrown faster than the default snowballs.  You can customize your Penguins as you like them, giving them a silly hat and pretty clothing to wear. It's really cute. Who doesn't want a Penguin with Bunny ears wearing a ballerina skirt? Right, no one!  I have fun playing this game. But sadly it's currently bundled with other games, making it pretty expensive to buy. But if you see it cheap, that's the way you want to get this game.
2029	1	a	high intensity combat perfect for competitive play
2031	1	a	Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a penguin themed first-person shooter intended for children, developed by  Frogames  [www.frogames.com]  in December 2008. It's a multiplayer game where players try to knock each other off of an iceberg and into the water. There are four different game modes and each map contains five different temporary weapons or powerups that give the player an advantage. The maps are all very small, thus the rounds are really quick and furious.  The online multiplayer of this game is practically dead and the artificial intelligence is not very good, often the opponent just falls off the cliff by himself or he just won't let go and the round goes on forever. If you want to buy this game, I would recommend you to get some friends to play it with you, if you play alone you probably won't have much fun. Also the game is pretty repetitive due to the similarity of the maps and the game modes, so it might get boring after a few rounds.  Still it's overall a fun game with cute graphics. It's nothing special, but it has a basic and easily understandable gameplay and the powerups enhance the fun. There's even a map editor, which I really like. You can download it  here  [www.frogames.com]  or download custom maps created by other users  here  [www.frogames.com] . Even though the game was released five years ago, the developers recently announced an upcoming update, so let's see what the future holds.  Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is great if you want a short-term fun game to play with friends and nothing too serious. Also it's a nice alternative for children to the many violent first-person shooters. The game is only available in a bundle, which is in my opinion not worth the price if you'll only buy it for this game, but if you can get it on sale it's worth a shot.
2033	1	a	It's like skyrim with penguins
2035	1	a	No lag Balanced No crashes  It does everything right that call of duty does wrong.  cod = fish penguins eat fish. Penguins &gt; cod  It's so obvious.
2037	1	a	My sister saw me playing this and asked me if I was playing (in her words) 'a terrorist version of Club Penguin.'  If that is not an apt description of this game, I don't know what is.  --------  Pros:  - achievements (moderately easy to 100% this game)  - trading cards  - fun gameplay  - fun, upbeat soundtrack  - you can customize your penguin  Cons:  - I really can't think of any, other than the fact that you can't change your tribe's color (it's always blue).  ----  I award this game 10/10
2039	1	a	You can punch Penguins in the face, with fish! AWESOME 9/10 (1 point minus because of the fish bombs .. that's violent man )
2041	1	a	Club Penguin: Advanced Warfare
2043	1	a	 This is not a review, it is a philosophical question about current state of this game.    Why in the name of the Lord, no one plays this game!?   I had som much fun in single player, against PC, and i can vividly imagine how my hormones of happiness would increase even more with knowledge that my snowballs hitting real players to their beaks. I know, i know, it was released in 2008, but come on, game like this should survive five, ten, twenty years or even mankind as we know it.  I was a little bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, when i found out about achievements, that you have to update into them; Dut DAMN! this is so much fun.
2045	1	a	This game is simple and to the point, you're a penguin throwing snowballs at other penguins in the attempt to knock them off the ice. While simple, it's quite fun and I could imagine kids would find some enjoyment in playing it. I bought it with 4 other games in a pack for Â£1.09, I can't really fault it at that price.
2047	1	a	This is one of the best open-world survival-horror FPS that I've ever had the incredible fortune of being gifted over steam by a creepy old dude with an eyepatch. Be prepared to experience dynamic combat in the frigid antarctic, and team up with your friends in revolutionary cooperative penguin gameplay.   Would recommend if held at gunpoint Banana Pudding/10
2049	1	a	i actually found this game fun, not something i would play often but its a guilty pleasure for me.  10/10 its like fallout 3 but with penguins
2051	1	a	Penguin genocide and more maps than Gears 4.  10/10
2053	1	a	Better than Five Nights at Freddy's.
2055	1	a	+ Hardcore first/third (you get both!) person shooter + Survival game where there's only you and other survivors left and you have to fight with them for fish and black gold + Hardcore skills needed to strafe and crunch from enemy snowballs + You can get your girlfriend into FPS because of this. At first, she'll love penguins and snowballs, and then you will miss the moment when penguins and snowballs will give way to monsters and rockets! Everyone starts somewhere! + Awesome avatar for your steam profile + Incredible levitating skills. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A PENGUIN CAN ACTUALLY FLY!!! BUY IT FOR YOUR PENGUIN NOW AND MAKE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE!!  - No RPG elements, you don't get new hats and bunny ears for drowning thousands of other penguins - Penguin racism - No play-for-orca mode
2057	1	a	For only $6, you can have an epic snowball fight on an iceberg with penguins. Do I need to say more?  Pros:  -Wonderful penguin models  -Wonderful gameplay -Wonderful animation -Wonderful environment  Cons:  -Its too awesome 
2059	1	a	Very simple game, but is quite a laugh for a short while. Think TF2 with penguins and no killing.
2061	1	a	I love this game. I live streamed this on twitch and got a few more people to buy it! very good since it was made in 2008. Keep up the good work!   10/10
2063	1	a	you can do 360s and drink mt dew 64-69 would throw snow ball agin and if you think this is funny you should go to ace get a 10 foot rope and a small stole and some notebook paper i was 3 when i wrote this
2065	1	a	A First Person Shooter where the characters are in fact penguins and you shoot snowballs. Penguins Arena starts from an original idea and delivers an appreciable little game. It's something you should consider buying during a sale.
2067	1	a	The most hardcore penguin game i have played
2069	1	a	This game is quite competitive, I would like to see a new game or like version 2 of it with more maps and mods.
2071	1	a	Cute first-person ish shooter game of sorts that is best played with a group of friends.
2073	1	a	At first when I played this, I was a bit worried that I had wasted my money.  I WAS HORRIBLY MISTAKEN. This game is a GREAT game for when you are bored, or just looking for A COMPLETELY AMAZING TIME. I would highly reccommend this to anyone out there looking to play the next game of the year 2016.  Great concept, great controls, I WANT MORE!
2075	1	a	5min of this game         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  5min of Penguins Arena: Sedna's World - highlights&nbsp;
2077	1	a	Snowball fights without getting cold!
2079	1	a	Greatest game of our time
2081	1	a	It's like Super Smash Bros Dodgeball
2083	1	a	i don't know why but playing this makes me happy... reminds me of my good old ubuntu (linux) pc i had when i was a kid where there were hundreds of small fun games to download! -gameplay is simple and fun (even a 5 year old can understand how to play) -good diversity of maps and weapons -amazing soundtrack -even more awesome if you have friends to play with  -lacks online players (multiplayer is dead)
2085	1	a	This game has the strategic depth of League of Legends and Starcraft combined, with the fast-paced first-person action of Quake. This game should be played in tournaments and have live broadcasts and streams, not any of those other games.  It also reminds me of Bomberman for some reason. And Club Penguin, for the obvious resemblence to Club Penguin. I give this game a 9.8 out of 10.  I took a 0.1 off the score because it could use more customization options for your penguin. I want him to have a neon green afro, but the stupid developers didn't even bother to think that players would want that. They totally missed out on pleasing the neon green afro demographic. Maybe that's why this game isn't so popular. But it should be, because you can use clown fish as a projectile weapon. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, Quake railgun; you're outclassed as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ now.  I took another 0.1 off the score because the story sucks. Yeah, I know. The subtitle 'Sedna's World' is totally unnecessary. Sedna is just this penguin god that is in the intro video. The intro video that you can only see if you manually click to watch it from the main menu. And it's only like 20 seconds long, and not compelling in any way.  And it's just, like, the icebergs dried up from pollution and heat and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and the penguins didn't know what to do. And then Sedna the penguin god shows up and tells them some cryptic â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with a grammar error at the end, saying really vague stuff that can be interpretted into anything. So the penguins interpretted it and apparently came to an actual conclusion. The caption afterward is like 'The penguins reflected on Sedna's words. They knew what to do now...'. Which is apparently kill the penguins that are a different color than you. Yup. Penguin racism. And they kill each other by throwing snow balls at the other penguins so hard that they fall off the iceberg. And they drown, I guess, because they get deaded when that happens. So that is the extended lore of Penguins Arena. As if a competitive multiplayer game about penguins knocking each other off icerbergs using snowballs needed any kind of backstory. Well, Penguins Arena gave it a shot. They missed that shot, but they gave it a shot. They tried. For 20-ish seconds, they tried. And that is admirable. Nonetheless, I, as an occasional professional amateur reviewer, feel that I must be objective about my critique and take 0.1 points off the score.  Penguins Arena, folks. A near-perfect game. Here's hoping for Penguins Arena 2: The Arctic Civil War: Rebellion: Resurrection Revelations: Judgment Day: The Return of Jafar.
2087	1	a	Just to let you know, this game was pretty simple, was pretty funny and was pretty popular. Was especially good when there were people online...
2089	1	a	Games are meant to have fun, and what did I get from this game!? Fun, I got fun, not instantly though. I played this game for a good 1 hour and I immediately regretted it, so in order to redeem my gaming fun. I decided to play Call of Duty, the all superior game that beats everything, so I was playing then I realised every kill I was getting was a 360 no-scope cross map with no hitmarkers at all. Then  I realised that this game taught me how to be Faze in almost every fps game I've ever played. Now though, it's even  affected my life, whenever I pick up food from my cafeteria at school, I have to do a 360 which spills my food all the time. It's uncontrollable, I can't sleep without 360-ing continuosly in my bed. This game ruined me. I can't hug friends/family. Noone loves me anymore. I can't pay attention to school. I can't love.  Otherwise it's a great game  10/10 - Faze SpongeCake
2091	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. Gripping story, fast paced action, and it will thrust you into battle constantly. I'd rate 8/8. Truly gr8.
2093	1	a	10/10 would suck â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for this game anyday
2095	1	a	Absolutely fantastic game. Gripping story, fast paced action, and it will thrust you into battle constantly. I'd rate 8/8. Truly gr8.
2097	1	a	Wish it could be better. A fun,well made game,but due to some non implemented features,it could be just better. Still,its a good one to try out.
2099	1	a	omfg this game...... this is the best game i ever had ':O its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheap totaly worth it    BUY IT NOW! ;O (but i have to say: 'you can get a indie pack with more then 5 games voor the same price and it also haves this game wtf) i am so smart :3
2101	1	a	It's like engie mge but slightly more autistic  11/10 goty
2103	1	a	GOTY  Is literally my spirit animal
2105	1	a	What else can you say about this ground breaking game better then any other shooter that ive played even check my hours. Truley the Qauke smash experience  2 good worth the pruchase
2107	1	a	This game is literally how you 1v1 on club penguin properly by making the dankest airshots, and throw scrubs off the cliff with any possible method, so they can become shark food before they do the same thing to you.  Fastest way to win is to use bombs agressivly.  Teammates don't really matter that much except for the extra lives.
2109	1	a	Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is an action packed first person shooter that deals tastefully with a lot of complex social issues, namely climate change. Don't let the deep mechanics and thrilling combat system distract you from the intelligence of this masterpiece; this game's maticulous crafting and stunning beauty, evident in its mesemerising map design and sound design, makes the roof of the Sistine chapel look like one of Ringo Starr's MS Paint drawings. This game was also far ahead of its time, and despite its age it has grown with grace and is still as relevant and impressive as it was when it was first released. For these reasons, I heartily recommend Penguins Arena: Sedna's World as it is unarguably one of the best games to be released this decade.
2111	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied.
2113	1	a	best 8 minutes of my life
2115	1	a	The FPS experience in this game greatly surpasses any modern shooter you would play today. Incredible gameplay mechanics with interactive glacier melting enviornment. If you are looking for the ultimate FPS, this is it.
2117	1	a	For a Very small and Basic indie game party game it's decent. I wouldn't say it good but as I was playing it just a little to get the trading cards somehow i got lost track of time and played for nearly 3 hours straight. So if this piece is cheap and on special get it link it with a few friend and play for a while.   This game does need go to a beta mode to get the steam achievement and it's probably one of the easiest game to get 100%. I was able to get it today when I just playing it for the card drop.  6/10
2119	1	a	There's not much to say about this game. It's basically a more casual version of the 3D Worms games, only with penguins instead of worms, where the objective is to throw your opponents out of the stage by throwing snowballs at them. It allows up to four teams, and there's a few different power ups scattered through the maps.  It also offers different gamemodes; a team deathmatch mode, where the last team standing wins, a duel mode, where each team has a set number of 'lives' and a single member, an unlimited mode, and a custom map mode, which is just like team deathmatch.  As I mentioned above, it's similar to Worms, not only in the gameplay, but in artistic style as well. Unlike Worms however, this game doesn't feature terrain destruction or heavy weaponry, the most 'dangerous' weapons are a huge mine that simply pushes your opponents back, and a fish with a dynamite stick coming out of its mouth.  Still, it's somewhat fun to play, although a bit frustrating at times, since the terrain is very slippery.
2121	1	a	good decent game but im not recieving my trading cards
2123	1	a	Follow my curation :  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorio   I got this from a bundle quite sometimes ago.  Honestly, not bad at all. No sarcasm intended.  Simple premise, no complex mechanics, very cute graphics and rather enjoyable gameplay.  I can see this game enjoyed by kids very much.  Somehow it just need more polish tho.
2125	1	a	i got this game in a bundle so i was sceptical about it i thought it was going to be a rip of of club penguin or somethin (not that i like that game) but as soon as i played it i entered a world of ragdoll phisics , slaping phisics and state of the art rocket jumping,not to mention the catchy music.
2127	1	a	Penguins Arena: Smegma's World is my new favorite game.
2129	1	a	Was looking for a well-made, action packed fps to play for hours on end and still never get bored.      then I said f*ck it and bought this instead.
2131	1	a	Serious Review   This game, is basically a BF or CoD version but club penguin added. If your into this type of club penguin shooters, this is for you.  Sadly no one really plays the mutiplayer, and well you can really just do single player.  Then again, you can use this for a time killer or give it to your younger sibling.  Overall, it's a club penguin shooter. Where u shoot the penguins in the water and they die.
2133	1	a	There's not much to say about this game.

2135	1	a	Stupid fun that never gets old.
2137	1	a	10/10 #Gameoftheyear2014 just go ahead and buy it you wont regret it! (much)
2139	1	a	10/10 Definetly the best FPS games I've ever played, probably the best one on the market!
2141	1	a	This game depicts the Club Penguin Civil War perfectly. No wonder the war went on for years and years; the penguins were using a pretty rubbish weapon: the snowball.  Personally, I thought that the Club Penguin Government would have been clever enough to not use a ball of snow to destroy the penguin rebels, but I'm not a historian. I'm just a guy on Steam writing misleading reviews. Nobody knows why they used a ball of snow for years - the records and details were all cleared when the rebel fighters got access to a nuke.  Serious: This game is actually pretty amazing, but only buy it if you like playing with bots.
2143	1	a	A fun little game most recomended with friends. Also the next best source for MLG videos.
2145	1	a	Great game, if you are a RIC FAZERES fan!
2147	1	a	What do you get when you force Super Smash Bros and Quake to make love?    This Masterpiece   
2149	1	a	this game is honestly a better arena shooter than quake, doom, cpma or even tf2 its incredible
2151	1	a	Fantastic game has a more competitive scene than CS:GO
2153	1	a	Forget all your skill in every other game, this is the real deal.  Intense action packed snowball throwing, yellow snow free.   Airshotting a penguin will now replace every trick shot you've ever imagined yourself making. This intense action AAA title will blow your socks off
2155	1	a	A fun little arena shooter style game where you knock others off your iceberg to the orcas and claim the iceberg for you and your faction. Not much of a life at that point... Just floating around on a tiny iceberg...
2157	1	a	Super Smash bro peguin edition
2159	1	a	  This game was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sick before. But the AI is terrible as of the most recent update :(  Please fix it you cuties  --------------------------  Edit: It's been long since fixed :) Great game pick it up with friends
2161	1	a	Want a true Smash Bros and not this Brawl crap? Play Penguins Arena. The game is fast-paced and actually has gameplay with some depth in it. You can combo kicks and throw projectiles that affects how much you push your foes. This is a true PC gaming experience and remembers the basics such as lan-based multiplayer and windowed support. Taking advantage of PC Hardware, offers a true HD 60fps experience, something consoles wont give you. If you are a true pc gamer, or gamer in general, and this game doesnt have 500 hours of playtime on your account, you are a terrible person and should be ashamed of yourself.
2163	1	a	Whole point of game, kill penguins amen to me.
2165	1	a	  This game was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sick before. But the AI is terrible as of the most recent update :(  Please fix it you cuties  --------------------------  Edit: It's been long since fixed :) Great game pick it up with friends
2167	1	a	this game is like the best club penguin DLC eva.  IGN gave it a 10/10 for GOTY  I'm not having a jiggle, when i step in that game i feel like Iron Penguin shooting snow balls at people.  would recommend to anyone who is amazing like my m8 Matt Dowd who thinks hes Matt Dowd.  100000000/10 would play again best game ever Peng/Peng
2169	1	a	Do you like penguins? Liar. Everybody likes penguins.  P.S. I also once found 2 servers playing this game simultaneously. I think it's a world record.  P.P.S Got it for free, anyway.
2171	1	a	9/10 Like Battlefield with Penguins
2173	1	a	best game i've ever played, club penguin, quake, cod, csgo, all in one (cod being the fact it crashes now and again, still crashes less than cod at least) but i play this and life becomes clear. i recommend a gtx titan x for the intense audio (better audio option in settings) it outputs tho so if u dont then consider upgrading sorry mate thanks same nice cheers
2175	1	a	one of the defining games of this generation, Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a game not to be missed. Combining elements from masterpieces such as: Quake, Unreal Tournament, Depression Quest, and Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Penguin's Arena: Sedna's World is a high-octane first person shooter beloved by the most hardcore of FPS players.
2177	1	a	penguin arena inspired me to have a penguin fighting ring that is valued at $50,000 thank you penguin arena
2179	1	a	I would rate this game.
2181	1	a	It's actually quite fun, too bad there's no one playing
2183	1	a	This game is DLC for Club Penguin and as we all know Club Penguin is the best XxX_PenguinPu$$ySlayer_XxX game and i think that we should all buy this game now  10/10 - Ign 'Ten outta ten, Hundred outta Hundred, best game BEST GAME' - Jontron 
2185	1	a	10/10 best game 2012, 13, and 14
2187	1	a	This game needs servers and more players. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it's fun.
2189	1	a	ok ok ok i play this game a long time a go I LOVE IS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2191	1	a	Oh yeah. Thats right. Ladies and Gents, what you see before you is down right combat and bloodshed in it's concentrated form.  No one who has ever see that you may have had a hope that maybe, just maybe, you could get out alive can just forget it now. This is war. Not only is this war, but its a gang war; one of the most illegal types of war is gang war but dont let that get you down, son. Nothing can prepare you for what will go down on the streets, even if you keep your head down and check your corners and stay frosty, no one can be really for certain what is going down downtown pound town. You know?  This game is about that head ho dog, Sedna, and her nonsese that she brings about. She is pretty salty that her big boy league was deciding that she was down to get settled on the retirement fee of what she really has done. No one could have predicted that she went and caused that the fallout of the supermarkets would crash and all the rival gangs would start fighting. The penguins returned in force and decided that they must fight eachother in order to unite once again under one banner, under one day, under one sacrafice.  The day has gone that the world within the Sedna arena of death will rise again withing this day of the day of tomorrow.   One day, you will understand how this deep lore calls out for a good day in the day of me. Nonstop fun for the family.
2193	1	a	Its actually an amazing game! The advert and picture does not do it justice, i was sceptical about buying it, but as it was on offer for Â£1.09 i though 'why not'! So i got it, played it, and i can tell you somthing: i am on the edge of my seat when i play it! Its great fun, just need some better multiplayer servers now, but im sue that will kick off when more people play! Definatley get this game!
2195	1	a	just pure awesomeness!
2197	1	a	ok ok ok i play this game a long time a go I LOVE IS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2199	1	a	  Best 8 minutes of my entire life, 10/10 cured my cancer cleaned my pores and brought my grandma back from the dead to say goodbye to the family. Would not reccommend

2203	1	a	i recommand my second game,penguins areana:sednas world.this game is so fun,it hurts.its like call of duty4 mdern warefare2 but even better.it just needs more um,mod stuff.my 1st game is ,the path,and they are both my only reviews so far.the graphics are regular,the game play ,,is like cod4mw2,the fun ...is realy fun ,and eazy to like.hackers can stay away,it needs more servers.i wish they had a turbo version like street fighter.the price and game dont mix,but it is worth evbery penny you want to spen on it.
2205	1	a	For a fun game with a amazing community and that has endless fun and gafs, You can get your very own copy of Penguin Arena. Any haters are 20 year old men who dont know fun if it slapped them, Kepping goin eonguin arean users &lt;3
2207	1	a	This is where real men settle their arguments.
2209	1	a	I bought this game too far back to remember, and just left it sitting in my library, untouched. I started it up earlier to let it run in the background to get the cards, but thought 'What the heck, name sounds interesting, I'll play it for a minute.'   This game is extremely underrated! Seriously, if you're browsing the reviews and don't know whether to buy this game or not.... BUY IT! Seriously, you won't regret it.
2211	1	a	iron man meets super smash brother, little miss pac and the pac attack will confirm. nigel is dumb, joe is dumb, i beat them so their intelligence is in question. nintendo, get it together, this is whats up. hats for days, got some hands, feet claws, what else do you need. seven other people are on my team for the world penguin arena national booty call, and there ya go. get the game, $200 is a steal
2213	1	a	A very simple yet very fun game. It will make you want to throw snowballs to other penguins one more time.
2215	1	a	It you want a perfect mix between the best sellers of Call of Duty and Club Penguin, this is perfect for you.
2217	1	a	This game supports animal abuse, 10/10.
2219	1	a	  Best 8 minutes of my entire life, 10/10 cured my cancer cleaned my pores and brought my grandma back from the dead to say goodbye to the family. Would not reccommend
2221	1	a	like skyrim with guns
2223	1	a	This game is basically 'AIRSHOT Training'   i love it
2225	1	a	Ees good gam. has dank pingu memes, is cool, n its accually pretty good. it doesn't really look like an accual game, but it is. buy it. i think. get it on sale. ye. do that.
2227	1	a	I don't know what this game is, or how I came to own it, or why it was installed on my harddrive. I found another friend who also owned it without any memory of purchasing it, and from this I can assume that it is an ancient and horrible curse, spread through the digital platform known as Steam. What initially appears to be a cuddly FPS version of the snowball battling minigame from Mario Party is actually a creation hiding a terrible evil. If I stop responding within the next week, know that the penguins are cÌ¨Ì¨Í Ì¥Í…Ì¥ÌªÌ¦oÍ Ì§Ì¼Ì Ì£ÍšÍˆÌ¯Ì±Í‡ÌÌ°mÍ˜Ì³Í”Í•Í‡ÍšÌ¯Ì iÌ¢ÍÌ«Í•ÍÌ³nÌ¶Ì¨Í€ÍŸÌ–ÌÌ¬ÌªgÌ›ÍœÍ˜Ì¡ÌµÌ¯ÍÌ¼Í”Ì¼ ÍÍ˜Ì³Ì°Ì¼Ì»Ì³ÌŸÌ¥Í™Ì«ÌŸÌ™Ì¯Ì¥fÌ¶Ì¶Ì¢Ì´Ì¨Í”ÌžÍ…Ì£Í•Ì™Ì³Í‡ÌŸÍ…oÍÍ€Ì´ÍÍÌ–Ì ÍÌ—Í“Í“Ì¼Ì¼Ì«Ì»Ì£Ì»Ì¯Ì°Í–Ì°Í“Ì©Ì³rÍ¡ÌµÌ¬Ì–Ì²Ì£Í‡Í™Í™ÌÌ£Ì—Ì Ì»Ì£ ÍœÌ¶Ì¥Ì¤ÍŽÍ™Ì¯ÌªÌ™Í”ÌœÌÌ¯Í–yÍžÌ¢Ì¢ÍÌ ÌªÍšÌ¯ÌªoÍ˜Ì•Ì›Ì§ÍÌœÍŽÌ¼Ì¹Í“Ì¥ÍšÌ–Ì¥ÌªÍšÌ¬Ì–Ì¯Ì²Ì Ì®uÌ¡Ì¢Í•ÌŸÌ¦Ì¥Ì»Í™ Ì¶Ì¢Í¡Í ÍÍ”Ì–ÍÌ¬ÍšÌ²Ì¯Ì¯Ì¥Ì©Í–Í‡Í”Ì®Ì¼nÌ§ÍŽÌÍŽÍ…ÍŽÌ­ÍšÌ«Ì«Í‰Ì²Ì­ÍˆÍˆÌ¯ÌœeÍ¡ÍÌ•Ì¦Ì¬Ì°ÍšÌ ÌŸxÍÍÍ€ÌÌªÌºÍ‰Ì¦ÌœÌ³ÌœÌ£tÍÌµÍÌ§ÌµÌºÌ¦Ì£Í“Ì¹Ì˜Ì¼ÌºÌªÍŽÌ®Ì¥ÌŸ
2229	1	a	Fling snowballs, dynamite fish, spiky balls, and overpowered goldfish at coloured penguins (no racism intended) to feed sharks in the next generation of FPS - First Penguin Snowballing, that is to say.
2231	1	a	Got this for free somehow, 10/10. xD
2233	1	a	Amazing, theres so much skill needed. You have to try and knock each other a ice berg while not trying to die yourself. Recommended.
2235	1	a	99/50
2237	1	a	Real-life situations.
2239	1	a	Most MLG Club Penguin Simulator I've ever played.  10/10 GOTY
2241	1	a	This game changed my life. Let me explain. I was playing my call of dutys modem warface 4 and I see in the bottom corner \'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥82 has started playing Penguins Arena: Sedna\'s World\' my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ screamed to me but after that insane game of cal off dooty it was to tight. I find my wallet in the steam sale safe (that\'s so gabeN does not eat it) I take the needed amount of money out and insert it in to my steam machine.i relax. But then my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ becomes unclenched and screams \'NOOO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOU â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAY\' sadly it was to late I was already installing it. That was the pizza money oh no what have I done. The game... the game it it it will consume you. 10/10 better than cunter stroke
2243	1	a	I have no idea why I even have this game. It's just so stupid.
2245	1	a	I actually enjoyed this game LOL
2247	1	a	Most MLG Club Penguin Simulator I've ever played.  10/10 GOTY
2249	1	a	Meh. Only buy it on sale. I wouldn't put it as a priority either.
2251	1	a	Meh. Only buy it on sale. I wouldn't put it as a priority either.
2253	1	a	This is what COD wanted to be
2255	1	a	Actually a pretty good FPS game. It's lighthearted but fast-paced and fun to play. Devs are still active as well. Why not give it a go?
2257	1	a	please make this game cheap again my friend needs it
2259	1	a	Holy crap , FUN. This is the next call of duty that is how good it is. But really no joke me a and my friend had hours of fun just playing. Recommended
2261	1	a	10/10 would bang this game. did cry.
2263	1	a	
2265	1	a	10 out of 10.  It contains penguins. My soul has been bound to this game. No other argumentation is valid.
2267	1	a	This game its awesome
2269	1	a	N0scoped a penguin with a snowball.   I r8 1337/420.69
2271	1	a	A war fuelled solely from racism alone pits up to 4 different colours of penguins against eachother in a fight for dominance over an iceberg that varies from map to map. Not a bad game.
2273	1	a	  Somehow this game can be very funny...
2275	1	a	Possibly the best multiplayer FPS game on steam to date! pure adrenaline!
2277	1	a	BUY THIS PART OF THE ACTION INDIE PACK I love this game i mean..your a customizable penguin whos main goal is to BLOW THE HECK OUT OF OTHER PENGUINS  10/10
2279	1	a	Why have people stoped playing this game???
2281	1	a	Game of the year, why would you play anything else? 10/10
2283	1	a	GAME OF THE YEAR ALL THE YEARS. MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE. IT'S LIKE TRIBES BUT WITH AWESOME PENGUINS SO IT'S LIKE 20045 TIMES BETTER.
2285	1	a	Highly recommended
2287	1	a	My favorite sonic game yet.
2289	1	a	quite alot of fun, more so then i was expecting i suspect this game would shine in a LAN, the bots AI isnt to bad and its got a scaled difficulty level few different modes and ER MAH GAWD customise your penguin! totally had a space pengiun then a cowboy!
2291	1	a	This, is the end, the only end.  The ground was melting, the food getting scarce , the war erupted. But with our food so reduced who were the ones who had the idea to use fishes as weapons? Was it a warrior from the stern Pinks or a fisher from the dumb Yellows ? Who started to lure the children with booby trapped fishes ? The angry Greens? All these weeks after, I still don't know . All I know is that it was us, the noble Blues who scorched the land with mines stolen to the humans.   All these fights, all this war, the endless labour, the running, the sliding, the teeth in the water, the brief moments of elation: soaring into the air , flying even, just to descend as the flipper of Sedna to angrily push our ennemies off the ground, to push them in the water, to the teeth waiting in the water.   The Blue became the avatars of death, fighting all the other tribes in the ambient chaos of mutual assassinations but in the end we prevailed. Like Sedna said, there could be only one tribe of penguins.  Now, only the Blues. The ground is melting still. The food is scarce again. The teeth in the water. The teeth, in the water.
2293	1	a	One of my favourite childhood games,only buy it if you wanna play with friends,otherwise you will get bored really fast because there aren't any servers online,only hosted by players.
2295	1	a	fun as heck 
2297	1	a	This is great game!!!!
2299	1	a	Amazing, awesome, fabulous dodgeball game. Very addictive and lots of fun! The best thing I have played in a while. I never had my hopes up for anything and went in blind then was delightfully suprised to see what kind of game it was. Shame it's badly translated from French though and that you can't choose a team. But this is a great casual thing to play when you just need cheering up or some quick fun.
2301	1	a	10/10 -GameStop Has penguins and snow balls
2303	1	a	NOW WITH STEAM CARDS!
2305	1	a	360Âº no scope headshot all of them, got no bonus points. 10/10 would r8 again
2307	1	a	This game reminds me of ps1 era games, on good way. I'ts actually very fun game, but gets dull very quickly if you play it alone, that goes for gameplay and for music (which seems to be a bit surferish). This game would be even better if it had better physics. Don't be afraid to try this game, but be cautious - playing this game solo is boring!
2309	1	a	You shoot penguins into water with fish that have dynamite crammed down their throats and they get eated up to death by sharks who eat specifically penguins of the blue, green, yellow, and red race. Afterwards you live out your life as a ghost penguin who's hobbies include, getting revenge on the penguin that got you eated to death by the shark, and launching bombs at other penguins to complete the first hobby that was mentioned.  All in all its a pretty simple and fun game i'd say.
2311	1	a	My favorite sonic game yet.
2313	1	a	This was the only game from the action indie pack that I actually enjoyed. Good thing I got it for 90% off. Please play this with friends.
2315	1	a	This game is the best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you'll ever play.   Graphics: Not that bad, seems like a game from the fawking mid '00s, but who cares? Saying COD has better graphics than this masterpiece is seriously debatable.  Gameplay: Awesome! Tired of those fake FPS games like Battlefield, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty? I'm sure this is the game for you. Droppin' bombs on innocent penguins all day every day. Conclusion: Although the game has its flaws, it's a must buy. Greatest game I ever played.  4/20. Would seriously consider smoking this.
2317	1	a	Do we like penguins? - Yes we do Do we love throwing rotten fish and bombs at other penguins? - Yes we do Do we miss our childhood and wish to play games that bring the feeling back? - Yes we do DO we wish to waste hours on games like these and then mourn about it ? - Yes we do  then this is the game for you give it a try :)
2319	1	a	Club Penguin with violence
2321	1	a	A war fuelled solely from racism alone pits up to 4 different colours of penguins against eachother in a fight for dominance over an iceberg that varies from map to map. Not a bad game.
2323	1	a	  Somehow this game can be very funny...
2325	1	a	This game is ok. There are some features which I love, and some which I don't. Here are the features I love: 1.Cute Penguins 2.Fun Competitive Multiplayer 3.When you die, you can come back. Features I hate: 1.Only one gamemode 2.Typos and bad spelling 3.No one is ever online I reccomend this game, because when you get it, you also get a bunch of other games. If this game was sold by itself, I think it would be worth $5 a copy.

2347	1	a	Best Game of the pack! Worth!
2349	1	a	You control penguin in snowball battle. All you need is to throw down other penguins into sea. It's a great funny non-violent fps game. I recommend it.
2351	1	a	I do like this game but only since i got it for a 95% discount. it's nowhere near worth 14,99â‚¬. There are a lot of games under the 1â‚¬ line that are much bigger and complex but for the massive â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ n giggles this game has given me i'd say i pay maximum 5â‚¬ for it.
2353	1	a	360Âº no scope headshot all of them, got no bonus points. 10/10 would r8 again
2355	1	a	Hi Im Steve Love me like I love this game
2357	1	a	Bombastic game 9/11 :) -EA
2359	1	a	You shoot penguins into water with fish that have dynamite crammed down their throats and they get eated up to death by sharks who eat specifically penguins of the blue, green, yellow, and red race. Afterwards you live out your life as a ghost penguin who's hobbies include, getting revenge on the penguin that got you eated to death by the shark, and launching bombs at other penguins to complete the first hobby that was mentioned.  All in all its a pretty simple and fun game i'd say.
2361	1	a	Lighthearted Quake  Penguin arena was somewhat of a pleasant surprise, as I was expecting some simple indie game.  There is minimal story to the game. Basically, global warming has made it difficult for penguins to gether enough resources to survive. A godess arrives and states that only one tribe can survive and the others will have to pass away for the greater good. IN order to decide which tribe survives, the penguins battle it out on the remaining icebergs...  Gameplay revolves simple FPS mechanics and sliding. Each match sets you up as one of the tribes of penguins and you basically have to push the other tribes off the iceberg without being pushed off yourself. There are basically three game modes which are team (16 players/bots), duel (each tribe has one player and multiple lives) and unlimited ammo duel (like duel except you have unlimited ammo for weapons). You can play these modes against three/two/one team depending on your preferences. You start off with a basic snowball as a weapon, but you can find other weapons such as rapid fire fish, bombs and mines. Every time someone gets hit, they will be pushed back and slide all over the place (due to the slippery surface). this makes gameplay surprisingly fun and challenging (if somewhat unpredictable) as players will be sliding all over the place (which is similar to quake/UT where characters bounce arond after being shot). After falling off the iceberg, you take control of one of your surviving team members (if they are a bot). After all memebrs are dead you will become an immovable ghost towering above the arena, where you can launch explosives at the guuys below. Multiplayer is dead, but you can still play against bots.  There isn't much audio to the game. Weapons sound decent as well as the music. There is no voice acting.  Graphics are appealing. Everything looks cartoony which adds to a light hearted atmosphere. The penguin models look alright, but I keep being reminded of 'Firbies' (the toy) when ever I look at them (due to their short nature and beak).  If you want a cartoony and simplified quake-like game, this game has you covered.
2363	1	a	One of my favourite childhood games,only buy it if you wanna play with friends,otherwise you will get bored really fast because there aren't any servers online,only hosted by players.
2365	1	a	I do enjoy playing this game, but I received it free from a promotion. Unless the makers of the game add more features I would not pay much for this game - definitely not $15.
2367	1	a	Old but gold !
2369	1	a	This, is the end, the only end.  The ground was melting, the food getting scarce , the war erupted. But with our food so reduced who were the ones who had the idea to use fishes as weapons? Was it a warrior from the stern Pinks or a fisher from the dumb Yellows ? Who started to lure the children with booby trapped fishes ? The angry Greens? All these weeks after, I still don't know . All I know is that it was us, the noble Blues who scorched the land with mines stolen to the humans.   All these fights, all this war, the endless labour, the running, the sliding, the teeth in the water, the brief moments of elation: soaring into the air , flying even, just to descend as the flipper of Sedna to angrily push our ennemies off the ground, to push them in the water, to the teeth waiting in the water.   The Blue became the avatars of death, fighting all the other tribes in the ambient chaos of mutual assassinations but in the end we prevailed. Like Sedna said, there could be only one tribe of penguins.  Now, only the Blues. The ground is melting still. The food is scarce again. The teeth in the water. The teeth, in the water.
2371	1	a	best game on steam
2373	1	a	There is nothing more to life than Penguins Arena: Sedna's World.
2375	1	a	A pretty good Call of Duty clone
2377	1	a	10/10 MLG Pingo    In all seriousness this is a great game, you can throw fish at other penguins. Plus it requires skillz unlike COD :) 
2379	1	a	It is a snowball fight.  I really can't say NO, but I would not buy this game again.  I snagged it when I first got on Steam a very long time ago, and it is not a bad or broken game, I am sure a lot of love went into it.  It is just a basic arena game, much like Fur Fighters multiplayer battles IMO  If you do not mind that it is an outdated feel and a rather short and small game, it might be worth your money.  I hate to give a thumbs down based on my opinions over the game being broken, so I am still giving it a thums up.  I am sure some niche will enjoy it.
2381	1	a	Only had it running to get a badge that fits my username, it's a decent game though
2383	1	a	most life-changing game i've ever played
2385	1	a	10/10 best penguin shooter out there
2387	1	a	how is this in my library?
2389	1	a	The game is a rather simple first person shooter, there's no health, you just have to push the other penguins off the small ice island to kill them. It's a fun game, though don't count on any multiplayer. Right now, May 2nd 2016, only 2 servers online (1 USA, 1 France), both empty.
2391	1	a	a very fun game &lt;3 :)) tho why can't i get power ups even when i bought the game? please fix it.

563	0	a	Penguins Arena: Senda's World is a really fun multiplayer game, but it's not worth your money.  Penguins Arena is a multiplayer game where you play as Penguins and you fight other Penguins to be the last penguins alive.  The game has an SP mode which is you fighting Penguins in an endless mode and most of it get's boring after a while and the only way to enjoy the game is to play with real people and this is where all the bad begins.  The game is completely dead. I tried joining a server, but no one was playing and it's quite sad cause the developer has been updating the game, but sadly there's no point in buying this game.  The audio design is also no that good, the soundtrack is really annoying and most of the time I turn it off when I start playing.  The game is really fun, but playing solo is not fun and unless you have friends who will play with you, don't bother with this game.  Pros: + Fun gameplay  Cons: - Dead Online - Boring Solo mode -Terrible audio design  Final Rating: 4/10 - Not worth it  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

565	0	a	Some grotesque wormquestish penguin game, fun excluded.
566	0	a	I have no idea how this abomination got over 600 positive reviews.  Multiplayer only 'arena' shooter with zero multiplayer. Seriously, no one is playing this.  'Arena' is a peanut sized island where you get catapultet into the water and die everytime a returded penguin farts in your general direction.  Rounds end in about 10 seconds because you either get thrown into the water or just commit suicide out of boredom.  No animations - The returded pengiuns just hobble around.  Crap graphics - looks like 3D stock models drawn in paintbrush  Crap physics - It takes my returded pengiun 10 seconds to hurl his retured snowball at another returded pengiun.  Annoying 'Surfs up dood!' 3 second loop music in an arctic themed game.  Probably took me longer to write this review than it took them to make this game.  Only play this if you're a returded pengiun.  Final verdit: Smelly fish
567	0	a	A cute game, where you must protect your penguin 'tribe' by pushing all the other tribe members off an iceberg (global warming, people!)  Interesting concept, fast gamplay which involves hurling bombs, fish and snowballs at the opposing penguins.  Since Steam requires you to say yes or no, I'm afraid I'll have to give it a no (even with the pitiful amount of time I've spent on this). The reason being - as can be seen from other reviews - the multiplayer is a barren wasteland. The AI isn't much fun, and doesn't look like anyone is playing this anymore...  I picked it up for free, but wouldn't recommened unless it sees a massive surge in popularity.
568	0	a	Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.  There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.  Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.  Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.  All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.
569	0	a	If you want to waste money on something completely ridiculous which you probably won't spend more than a few minutes on...  then lock your money away untill you regain sense. But if you fail to do so, you might as well buy this.
570	0	a	Luckily I got this for free. Is a bit too silly and penguins aren't really that easy to control. I'll leave this one for the kids.
571	0	a	I never thought id be at a point in my life where id review about penguin game, but here i am. What can i say, I had coupon on the game (as way as other games) and i had nothing better to do. About the game. Its like the cousin of super smash bros that was drop on its head a lot as a kid whos favorit animal is a penguin. Dont get me wrong, its a fun game on a brain dead level.
572	0	a	ok right away dont think i am a total hater. this game is not that great in my opinion though. yeah i only played 2 rounds but then agein those two rounds were frusterationg. the number of bombs they can through at you is also stupid. basicly in this game you are a penguin pushing other penguins off the iceburg, and maybe even killing them in the deadly waters. i think that this game is not worth even close to fiffteen dollers and to end this review there are great games out there but this, this let me down.
573	0	a	This game is only enjoyable because I obtained it in a pack of six games for 1.50, had I payed more for this game I'd hate myself. If you can get it for next to nothing like I did then go for it. If not stay away.
574	0	a	It's terrible..
575	0	a	Wtf is wrong with this game ?

579	0	a	How the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ can this game not work? This could run on a potato, let alone my somewhat decent PC. 1/10 Would catapult into the center of the Sun.
580	0	a	I shouldn't be too hard on this game because of what it is: a game for kids that I think I got in some mega-pack of other games.   Think of it like baby's first Doom, with penguins!  But honestly... pass. Not really even worth the novelty for anyone over the age of 12.
581	0	a	I Uh.... Was this someone's final uni project? Oh well, Free Cards.
582	0	a	Club Penguin is better....
583	0	a	Maps are poorly designed and hitboxes are nearly nonexistant. You can always buy it as a joke, but that's the only fun you'll probably get out of it.
584	0	a	Come on, even the people that made this know it's terrible
585	0	a	BEST GAME NA. The combat in this game is perfect, its really is the apex of what next gen has to offer. The graphics make bf4 look likes its being run on a toaster using the DayZ engine. The mechanics are 100% polished and make the ARMA II UI like clean. The particle effects of this game even Rival 'Call of Duty: Ghouls '6GB RAM Edition'' and it even trumps the fish AI too. Overall this game is so good, I would reccomend not buying and instead stabbing youself in the eyes a few times and breaking your hands, as you are not worthy of playing it. On a final note the only issue with this is game is it would not uninstall fast enough.
586	0	a	A thoroughly unremarkable casual Non-Violent Family-Friendly Holiday-Themed FPS piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   It's not hideously bad and if you like jacking off to penguins then there's penguins to jack off to here.   Sort of has a 'Dreamcast FPS' vibe to it. Could possibly be fun with Friends &amp; Bros but pretty much everything is fun with Friends &amp; Bros and ahahahahahahaha at actually playing this online with randoms.   PS hope you like playing with bots because literally nobody actually plays this game.   PPS you can also teamblock / teamkill and I'm sure there were plenty of extremely â™¥â™¥â™¥-raged tweens back in the day.
587	0	a	but there was no joy in penguins arena that day, for mighty sedna had struck out.
588	0	a	Simple little dodgeball game not that great might be fun for a lan.
589	0	a	Bugged, crashes after every game camera is positioned too far forward no way to tell if/when i can shoot fighting is entirely random for inexperienced players and gives experienced players/bots an edge, leading to unfair gameplay full of spelling and grammar errors 2/10

599	0	a	It is... alright, y'know those old Shockwave games you might have played, back in the day? This isn't Shockwave, but it feels very much like one of them. Except a lot better. That should give you a fair idea.  If you're a kiddo who doesn't remember those olden days, then let's just say it's about on par with a Flash game.    But it's also ridiculously priced, so don't get it.

604	0	a	I want you to imagine Team Fortress 2, in that this is a competitive, team-based multiplayer first-person shooter.  Except you're all penguins, and there are 4 teams.  And it costs money.  Also, it's a bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
605	0	a	Cute little game, unfortunately not much here. Its an online game with only 2 total servers, so you'll be lucky to play with 1-2 other ppl. Mechanics are finnicky. Sometimes you'll hit someone and they'll barely move, either times they'll go flying. You'll hit right next to someone with an explosive item and they won't move at all. Sometimes you'll hit someone way off the ice and they'll be able to just fly back down to it. Other times you'll barely go off and you won't be able to go back. Every level is pretty similar and you use the same 2-3 guns with the same 2 powerups. Can get repetitive and take forever.   5/10.
606	0	a	A real stinker of a title. Basically the whole thing is a 'Sumo' style of game, knock all the other Penguins off the ice to win the round. The issue is that gameplay is dull. The whole thing moves too slowly and is riddled with random bugs and issues that wreck the game.  The Computer players themselves are completely dim-witted too, either openly jumping off the ice float with little to no provocation, or looping in a basic pattern. Multiplayer is completely dead too making gameplay all but non-existant.  Basically theres a reason this isnt sold by itself, its just pure trash.
607	0	a	Oh man... This game is so bad, I guess most of the positive reviews are fakes or trolls. First game, game crashed. Second game, I spawned 'dead' so I couldn't do anything but watch. Third game I finally got to play, and it sucked. There was 2 people in whole world playing this game same time as I, and it only has multiplayer, so it's worthless... Stay away!
608	0	a	For a free game it's nice, but it's not a free game.

612	0	a	Not for me, this concept could have been very good if the controls and physics were not so floaty.
613	0	a	Surprisingly fun for the premise, but the lack of other people playing and the lack of any real soundtrack prevent me from recommending this at full price.
614	0	a	Best game ive ever played  Ive never played another video game
615	0	a	is a dead multiplayer only game (4 player peek a day). It has some value in fighting against bot on online server
616	0	a	it's too simplified, too blocky, clunky, and the tutorial was terrible and had spelling mistakes. No love put into it. would not recommend people playing a half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game.  no, I know more fun games you can play when you pull out the whiskey
617	0	a	I've played very little at the time of this review.  Pros +Penguins are awesome. +Graphics look nice. +Controls are responsive. +Funish...  Cons -The game crashes with out fail after every match if in fullscreen. -The game resets video options after every restart of the game. -The OS can start to become unstable if you crash because of being in fullscreen. -When you die you are placed as a ghost penguin in wierd places, unable to move and in terrible view of what is actually happening. What makes this worse is that the maps are just large enough that it can take upwards of 10+ minutes for one of the last two penguins to die, leaving you trapped waiting.   In addition to being trapped and unable to move, you are given the ability to shoot what I can only assume are ghostly eggs but your aim is virtually non-existent.  Now if the glaring issues are ever resolved I would highly recommend this game. It could be the perfect fast paced mini game it wants to be if some changes were to be made. The maps are just too large and that forces matches to last longer than needed and with the other problems just makes it less fun.  I do think I'll continue to play a few matches here and there for a long while but I can't honestly see myself playing for long periods. If you watch some videos and think it looks fun I would get it. I just can't recommend a game with so many glaring problems. Although I do love mechanics of pushing penguins off of an island. It reminds me of some of these mini games that were on the first xbox back when I was a kid. I loved those and I'd still play those today if available for PC. 
2415	1	a	Before I even say anything, I love the guard AI.  'Hey, Pierre. I keep hearing these strange sounds behind me.' 'I know right? It's weird. Everytime I turn around to look at it, all I see is a big gaping hole in the wall.' 'Damn straight. Not only that, but these damn theives keep disappearing.' 'Tell me about it. I'm chasing a guy armed with a sledgehammer, but he runs around a corner and poof! He's gone.' 'Huh. Well, keep a look out for anyone not in a suit or dress. They're obviously imposters.' 'What about that guy in the suit with the rocket launcher? The one aiming at us right now?' 'Nah, he's cool. He's got a suit, see?'  TL;DR: It's fun as hell. Go for it, man. Buy the damn game.
2417	1	a	Monaco truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled 'Best Plan Ever' complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying â€œReady? GO!â€, only to see it backfire in seconds.The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. Monaco offers a new and unique kind of chaotic co-op stealth gameplay, resulting in a work of indie art worth stealing.
2419	1	a	BEST GAME EVER. I FEEL LIKE A LESS DOUCHY BRAD PITT IN OCEANS 11
2421	1	a	Pack 3 Friends and get the Heist going. Monaco: What's Yours is Mine truly is a game for anyone and everyone.

GO!â€, only to see it backfire in seconds. Regardless of whether you plan on flying solo or with some buddies, do yourself a favor and go play Monaco
2423	1	a	Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.  Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.  The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).  As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.  On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.  In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win.   But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more.   The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.  Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.  The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.  All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.  Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.
2425	1	a	Absolutely recommended. I originally got it with the Indie Mega Booth pack, since six games for $20 was a steal. I'd never heard of Monaco before that, and I fell in love almost right away. The soundtrack is great - all jazzy piano that changes intensity depending on if you're sneaking or being chased; the game itself is gorgeous, very colorful but not blinding; some levels can be difficult, but with persistence and planning you can get through it. 10/10 would recommend.
2427	1	a	(This game was rated Overwhelmingly positive, I have no idea why it says mixed. Must be bug ;-;)   This game is underrated. Very nice design and awesome game play. Never gets boring and is challenging no matter how good you are at the game, you will be learning new things about every time you play!     WHY DIS GAME IS GOOD:
2429	1	a	Doesn't matter how rich you get, how infamous you get, how many guns you get, how many people you kill, how many guards you alert, how many lasers you trip, how many holes you dig, how many computers you hack, how many doors you unlock,  how many times you disconnect, how many times you get blown up, how many coins you collect, how many teammates you revive, how many records you get, how many disguises you find, how many toilets you pee in, how many venues you rob, how many maps you make, how many pianos you play, how many trophies you get,  You will never ever have the world record for prison break.
2431	1	a	This game is very fun if you play it with friends. It is just slowly getting harder but in the end it is like the good old party games you played with your friends, full of laughter, fun and calling them bad names ;) This game makes you feel like the good old mario cart + super smash bros melee evenings you all are missing.
2433	1	a	This is a well built stealth game, a game genre we are lacking in quality. You have your choice of several characters, each with unique abilities and unique styles to play through the maps.  What this game offers is more variability of gameplay. If you're spotted or set off an alarm, you have options. You can try gunning down the enemies, running around corners, sneaking behind a nearby bush or running for a vent. It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.  The difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?  The in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.  The bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.  I highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.
2435	1	a	it's like payday but without microtransaction
2437	1	a	steam glitched from the free weekend and gave me this game for free forever 10/10
2439	1	a	AMAZING GAME!!! The best ever timekiller of a game. Screw MetaScore... I do not see a 99 there... i'm not satisfied. This game is amazing with some of the best gameplay i've ever played. This should be on the steam MUST-HAVE pack. For such a fun indie game I wouldn't be surprised if we saw this title on ios sometime soon. I do not know about IPod but IPad will be in the APP store soon.    - 9.63/10
2441	1	a	Pretty amazing game all things considered. It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.  As you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision. Her secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.  There are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look.  Another frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.  As people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy.   Finally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale. It's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.  I continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)
2443	1	a	Awesome 2D overhead stealth action thievin' game!  The only real issue I had with it is that it can be hard to get MP games going for the higher levels, as apparently a majority of the people never finish the first storyline.
2445	1	a	well, 70% of my steam friends are from this game, that's how good the multiplayer community was back then. (can't say how it is for now cause haven't play it again in a while tho).  tl;dr : great sp game, fun(?) mp times.
2447	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of 'Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!' way. Monaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it. The way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket. The difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together. Replay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, 'Fin'. I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up. The story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with 'Identity'. The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of 'how we got here' thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised. If I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though. All in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries. Singleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging. Multiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had. Art: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous. Sound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french. Difficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time. Replay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.
2449	1	a	Yes! I definitely recommend playing and trying out this game. Very challenging at first but once you get the hang of it it's truly a great game. Co-op is where this game truly excels at, though. You can find yourself putting lots of time playing this game with friends. 8/10
2451	1	a	 Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine Review
2453	1	a	This game is pretty simple, you just collect all the coins, but it's very addicting. When I bought it I thought it might be good fun for a bit, but it's really great. The characters all have strengths and play differently enough to make the choice matter. There's about 40-50 official maps, zombie mode and tons of custom maps. I got it on sale, but wouldn't have minded paying full price. If you think you might like it go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.
2455	1	a	Monaco is an excrutiatingly difficult 4-player co-op fast-paced stealth game played from a top-down perspective with many unique characters to play as.  While it starts simple, this game becomes progressively more complex and challenging, demanding your crew to have great spatial awareness, a lot of patience, wit, and most importantly, synchronization. Violence is only a countermeasure when there's no other way to solve a dangerous problem (like an alert) and supplies are very limited. Each crewmate can only hold one type of item and stocks of it are only generated by collecting many coins, forcing teams to prioritize coin collection to a certain individual depending on the item and the map being played.  Overall, a very fun and addicting game, completely recommended.
2457	1	a	You can pee in the middle of the heist and seduce zombies with a redhead.
2459	1	a	Probably one of the best co-op (local or online) games out there. The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.  Now, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.
2461	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine captures the thrill of pulling off the perfect heist. When Monaco is working â€” when two or more people are picking through its stages, evading traps, conking out guards, and breaking into dangerous territory, it clicks like an expensive safe. It nails the white-knuckled, Hollywood heist motif with style. But you're going to need like-minded friends â€” and a whole lot of patience â€” to get there.
2463	1	a	it's a 2D, top-down stealth and inflitration game. this is one of the best co-op games you'll be able to find for you and 1-3 of your friends.  + it's able to be both entertaining and challenging + the design is charming + great soundtrack + have a blast with your friends, playing locally or online - it's not all that much fun playing solo  score = 4.5/5
2465	1	a	A surprisingly complex game stems from a very simple goal: steal all the goods in the building and don't get caught. The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.
2467	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made ever. I prefer to play it naked.  I've replayed this game multiple times. Each time more naked than the last.
2469	1	a	Fun and simple game. Much more enjoyable with other players, however.
2471	1	a	  Hours of multiplayer fun
2473	1	a	Great gameplay, awesome storyline, and cool characters. 10/10
2475	1	a	What a cool funny game!  Sure, the graphics aren't Mona Lisa-like. But the gameplay is so super easy to get the hang of, and the music so fun, and the whole game so generally cute and nicely done that you can't help but like it and play it.  Get friends, play it together, and have fun for a good number of hours (yes, this game is surprisingly long, compared to what I expected). Plus, there's a zombie mode! Get it and have fun =)
2477	1	a	I haven't finished playing it yet, but it's absolutely a fine single-player stealth game with lots of replayability that doesn't give any special advantages to one character like all those other co-op games do. Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold. Also the sound and visual design are pitch perfect as well.
2479	1	a	At first I thought this game was all smoke and mirrors when it came to the game play and graphics, but up until I took the time to actually play this game then I realized the potential it has playing yourself or playing online with others.    The games premise is to rob places without being detected, which seems simple right? The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.   The unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.    I would recommend buying it on sale.

2481	1	a	Extremely satisfying heist game.   It's not exactly a fully stealth game, getting found is not the end of the world, you just need to escape and hide. The gameplay alternates between trying to be stealthy and purposefuly or mistakenly getting discovered while accomplishing some objective.   The coop experience is vastly different than the solo experience. The ideal is to have a group of 4 friends and play together.
2483	1	a	tl;dr: It's a top-down heist game about collecting shiny things. Maybe get it if you have friends to play with, and both of you are willing to spend a couple hours figuring out mechanics.    What is Monaco?
2485	1	a	Amazing co-op and fun singleplayer, can be played with chaos or stealth. A combination of both will guarantee success. Must buy, $15 is a steal for the amount of play time and possibilities this game has to offer.
2487	1	a	For its money its definately a must! this game suprised me positively, it has everything an indie should have including multiplayer!
2489	1	a	â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…  Director Andy Schatz realizes his vision of creating a Slapstick comedy disguised as a David Mamet thriller.

Monaco: What's Yours is Mine gives thrill seekers the intense highs and lows they've come to love from their favorite heist movies while appealing to those outside the genre with its lightheartedness.

2497	1	a	This is the greatest game of all time, buy it because I told you to. Do you like fun? You'll love this game.  Verdict: BUY
2499	1	a	The gameplay and story is essentially about 8 characters who are all criminals, looking to steal some stuff. The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable.   Though single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.  I would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth a purchase.
2501	1	a	Such an awesome game!  You can clear each level the way you want to. A lot of different characters and ways to play, difficult to get bored of it as you can always switch and try to beat the same area a different way or try and aim for the achievements.  Also one of the greatest and most fun games I've played in co-op with a couple of friends as you sit and devise the perfect plan to clear the level in the most clean way possible only to find  your group massacring everyone in your way and run for your lives!  10/10 would recommend this game to all types of gamers
2503	1	a	This is the greatest game of all time, buy it because I told you to. Do you like fun? You'll love this game.  Verdict: BUY
2505	1	a	prison break simulator 2.0 don't drop the soap
2507	1	a	Kind of like a stealth-oriented Hotline Miami, the name of the game in Monaco is to get in, steal an objective, get out, while taking all the dosh along the way. Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage. The characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability. Single-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach. Like all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels. The music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action. Haven't heard anything like it in other games. Comes with a level editor, and the hours of additional play that entails. I had a ton of fun with this game and I think you will too.
2509	1	a	Adrenaline. Hilarity. French Accent.
2511	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.  In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.  The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.
2513	1	a	Wow! So fun!
2515	1	a	Great coop play, good couch game. Different play styles accommodated with different classes, challenging levels that make you work together.
2517	1	a	This was such a gem of a game to play, it became one of my favourites in an instant. It's simple and fast-paced with a story I didn't even think would get so deep like it did. It's hard not to have a favourite play style and team setup with all the options available to you. Do yourself the favour and pick up this game, it's worth the price and you get so much replayability out of it.
2519	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game.  I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.  So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.  This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try.

The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.  The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.
2525	1	a	It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game.  I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.  So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.  This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try.  
2527	1	a	Mon Dieu, les gardes m'ont vu! :-) This is a unique game, it is different to any other game you've ever played. To really enjoy it, grab 3 friends, get a microphone and act as a team; the best team of burglars that could exist! :-)
2529	1	a	A fun and frenetic stealth game that is a must play with friends. 8/10
2531	1	a	Extremely fun game especially with friends and with random people it is still really fun
2533	1	a	I used to resist this game...i failed utterly
2535	1	a	Wow wow wow! Another very strong Indie game this year that is a must-buy! At its core, it KIND of feels like a really complex Pac-man. Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons. There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away. Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game! Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!
2537	1	a	Fantastic way to practice your high school French. Qui va lÃ ?   It's a decent single player game*, but the co-op play is great! Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.  Level design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...  The storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a 'mash the button to skip past all these stupid words' type, but not this time. Very well done.  It does have a few annoying aspects: - If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game.  - The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine.  - The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.    * My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing. I think he's nuts. :) 
2539	1	a	I love this game, action, stealth and more! Epic to play with friends (online/offline)!
2541	1	a	Great game for when you want to 'stealth' it up with your fellow idio-, I mean friends.
2543	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played
2545	1	a	This game is a favorite among my group of friends and I'm so glad they told me about it. It pairs strategic gameplay with the sudden panic of fleeing well. I love testing out each of the characters because my favorite literally depends on my mood. If I want to be sneaky, The Gentleman is perfect. If I'm likely to panic and run, The Mole or the Locksmith are great.
2547	1	a	It is payday pixilation in this handful of heists! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is all about knowing how to get all of that loot out, while staying in one piece. If you like puzzles with a shot of adreneline, this game is for you! Pick locks and pilfer loots in this amazing thrill of a game!
2549	1	a	My favorite multiplayer game of the past several years. Pacman meets Keystone Cops meets The Pink Panther.
2551	1	a	Co-op stealth OR Co-op beat-em up, depending on how you play. A slay
2553	1	a	Monaco is possibly the closest thing we'll ever get to an Ocean's Eleven video game. If you're a fan of classic heist movies this is the title you've been waiting for. Assemble a team and pull off the job of a lifetime.   What's yours is mine.  5/5
2555	1	a	I sometimes consider myself a man of fairly high game skills. I've manged to beat Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 100% and yet...I still can't beat a later level here! This game is harsh, and I mean harsh, This game hurts me, more than Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy, Or even Don't Starve! I cannot for the love of me. I bought the game a while back since a friend of mine had it, we played the first couple of levels and all was well. Then, we stopped for a while, after which I cam back multiple diffrent times to try again. Only recently have I mangaged to progress past the 'Quarter Diamant' heist. Seriously, if you like stealth and crying, This game is for you.
2557	1	a	It is payday pixilation in this handful of heists! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is all about knowing how to get all of that loot out, while staying in one piece.

2559	1	a	Monaco. As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris &amp; Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not.  Monaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael 'Canned' Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the 'why' or 'how' of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scÃ¨ne denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg. Who's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, 'The Man with a Hat on his Head' will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.
2561	1	a	What The Hell Is Going On? 10/10
2563	1	a	4 person cooperative steal-'em-up this game would be tons of fun if you actually had friends
2565	1	a	Step 1: Acquire friends. Step 2: Play Monaco.
2567	1	a	On sale or not - this game is fun to play. Here is a link to some game play with me and some friends.  Let's Play Monaco #1 with friends 
2569	1	a	Super Hard at some levels but extremely Fun
2571	1	a	The game looks simple at first glance due to its artwork and design. But honestly, it very challenging once you play it. This game shows that indie games aren't sucks, as a matter of fact most of the time they are the ones that make compelling games even if it looks cheap graphically, financially. Anyhow, I will definitely recommend this game.
2573	1	a	It's an amazing game that you can play together with friends, and I've had lots of crazy antics playing in this game with my friends. You can just go absolutely nuts playing this together with friends, with a load of maniacal things happening, even if you're just screwing around or playing the normal story mode! The variety of characters you can play as are incredibly fun to play with The Gentleman if you want to be stealthy, The Pickpocket if you just want to hoard money, The Hacker for taking out security systems, The Mole for taking those irritating walls(who needs walls anyway? :D), The Lockpick for quick break-ins, The Lookout for a better view of what you're up against, The Redhead for getting those random cops to fall for you, and The Cleaner for silent knockouts... It's a great game, and you just have to play it! -WesTheDerp
2575	1	a	Destroys friendships. 10/10
2577	1	a	A really fun game, kept me entertained for hours
2579	1	a	Im drunk while writing this review so this game is a 10/10 Edit: Now that I'm sober this game isn't that great 7/10
2581	1	a	A cracking game.  A top-down heist 'em up with old-skool graphics. It might not look the part (though I find the graphics charming) but it more than makes up for it with fiendish level design and fun. The plot might be difficult to follow at times but the payoff is well worth it.  Absolutely recommended as a co-op experience where it varies between good teamwork with flawless execution of plans and full on panic mode if one of the guards stumbles across your operation...  Special mention to the characters and some of their abilities to basically rewrite some subtle game rules.
2583	1	a	It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol   seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...  Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love. It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone.   Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game, where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.
2585	1	a	pretty fun. especially with friends. deffinitly reccomendddddd
2587	1	a	A simple yet really enjoyable game that can be played with your friends online. All the characters provide a different feel for a stage and the levels are quite unique
2589	1	a	You can pee in the toilets, and if there is an npc already at the toilet, you can share. That's a good enough reason to buy this game. It also has pretty colors.
2591	1	a	Buythisgame  This game is the best multiplayer co-op game I've ever played. You and three friends will experience the rush of breaking into museums, banks and hospitals all in the hopes of scoring some loot, as well as some unexpected characters. Don't skip the story, it deserves the time to read!  Have fun and don't get caught!
2593	1	a	Monaco is by far one of the best co-op games I've played.  Due to the game's amazing accomodation to differing playstyles, Monaco can be a stealth game, shooter, or simply a run and gun race against the clock depending on how you play it!  I was extremely excited for this game to come out, and it definitely lived up to the hype: polished controls, amazing soundtrack, accomodating to multiple playstyles (not only with the different classes, but with the tools involved as well), and overall just a barrel of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Monaco, whether you plan on playing alone, with friends, or with complete strangers.  That feeling when you pull off a perfect heist? Nothing compares.
2595	1	a	Really addictive game!
2597	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the best co-op games I have ever played.
2599	1	a	Really wonderful retro style game. The map editor is really great too. Just buy it and start robbing like a boss!
2601	1	a	Saw this game before its release, and i got it while it was on sale. Its a nice rounded game, the view point is eagle eye third person. and your goal is to steal things, or escape. the story mode has depth as well as many different classes to play as, my favorite class is the hacker, it turns off lights, and even turns off security.
2603	1	a	This is a fun stealth game. It can be challenging sometimes but with one or more friends you should be able to get through it fairly easily, I'd reccomend this to anyone who loves co-op stealth games or just stealth games in general but it's way more fun with a few friends.
2605	1	a	Love it. So much fun to play it with friends! Especailly thanks to the cross platform, the gameplay, and the music!
2607	1	a	This game is great if you want to do something with your friends. It has amzaing gameplay that is well balanced, and lots of fun missions that gives plenty hours of fun.
2609	1	a	pretty fun. especially with friends. deffinitly reccomendddddd
2611	1	a	Tons of fun to play with friends! I definitely recommend it!
2613	1	a	This is a great multiplayer game up to 4 players, each character has a specific skill, and they need to work together to beat each level.  Levels are like  heists , you get in, get the valuables and get out.  The graphics are retro style, in good taste and with gameplay functions in mind.  The music is very good, and it draws inspiration from old piano music composed for black and white mute movies.  The gameplay is where it's at, it is a lot of fun to play multiplayer with friends, public games are also fun if you are lucky and meet cool people.  Playing solo is also fun but a lot harder, the game then becomes more stealthy.  You can also pick up and use items like guns, bombs and tranquilizers that you may use if you're not feeling particularly stealthy, thus playing the game more like an action game.  In fact you even have a bonus ( unlocked from the start )  Zombie  mode where you are encouraged to kill the enemies.  The story, while not the main attraction, will keep you entertained ( should you choose to read it, since you can skip it ), it contains humour and a few unexpected twists and turns.  There's a lot of content, and it'll take you a while to beat it all ( some of the later levels are quite hard ).   I recommend. 
2615	1	a	Fun Fun Fun and for Thiefing Fun
2617	1	a	This game stole my virginity          there is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my computer
2619	1	a	One of the best crime simulation games of the year. Play and plan with your friends the prison break, infiltration, and other jobs. Customize your own levels. Live a life of crime!
2621	1	a	This is a really good and addictive game
2623	1	a	I had fun with friends, but it doesn't have that much replayability. It does have workshop support but the missions are still sorta lame. Another thing is they have a new game + mode after you beat the first story. Its just kinda useless, I wish they wouldve made a second storyline or something more interesting. Im not saying this is a bad game but I would get it if it was on a good sale.
2625	1	a	Monaco   ~A Short Review with no spoliers~  I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment I began.  The bright colors contrasted against the dark background, the fun music, and the multiplayer environment made for a terrifically fun experience.  I played this game with another person,and by doing so, I feel that I got the most of the game, and thus I would recommend playing this with two or more people.  Multiple playable characters, each with their own special abilities, are unlocked through a driving story line of criminal behavior -which was executed with the perfect balance of elements. This game was not as serious of a heist game as Payday 2, but it was not what I'd consider a â€œkiddy gameâ€.  When you assemble a team of the right characters for the mission at hand there's no way you can fail - that is unless you are me and my friends. Though you can fail multiple times, the fun never ends, at least it didn't for me. Each play through is different in itsownunique way, even though the layout of the levels is the same.  Changing your characters may help if you fail a few times in a row.  But when you just beat a level, it's not over. You can go back and try to â€œcompleteâ€ the level, picking up every coin and every trophy. There's so much to do in this game, and that's why I love it.  I didn't have a single complaint about the game with the catchy music and bright colors. I rate it 5/5, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer heists.
2627	1	a	Monaco is a very unique heist game with great stealth elements. Every class has a different way of outsmarting the cops. Also, the game has pixel graphics, meaning you can bring your friends that don't have high end PC's along for a unique crime spree!
2629	1	a	This game, while having a simple premise, quickly leads itself to be a formidable challenge to any gamer. Countless times my friend and I had to restart a level from failing due to one too many mistakes. Most definitely a multiplayer game, playing by yourself is no fun. While challenging it is definitely worth the fight and I recommend it to any gamer (and their friends!).
2631	1	a	This is Payday in 2D without the character customization.  -Easy to learn but hard to master -Fun
2633	1	a	Very nice game! Makes for some really fun play with friends. Later missions in the game are really hard, so playing in teams of at least 3 is important.
2635	1	a	I really love the simple graphics and the music. I quite enjoy playing this game although I can only play in short bursts as it is very stressful! There will be a lot of yelling while playing and begging your teammates to come revive you (if you suck at it like I do!)
2637	1	a	Buy this game in a Steam Sale when it's 80% off. It's a fun game, however it gets tedious very quickly. One of those games you play once every while, but not any more often. And if not even that it will add to your game library, because heck.. it was 80% off!
2639	1	a	I began playing this game alone, and I simply loved it. Then my brother started playing co-op with me, and i can say it is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Simply a must-have for any REAL gamer
2641	1	a	A simple yet really enjoyable game that can be played with your friends online. All the characters provide a different feel for a stage and the levels are quite unique
2643	1	a	Great strategy game, can be a shoot em up if you want to but you wont get past the hard levels. Can be very difficult but is always fun, great to play with friends and if you really need the help just play with random strangers. Brilliant music to match.  9.5/10
2645	1	a	A quirky, yet addicting multiplayer rob-em-up. Lots of different roles, lots of levels, fantastic style and music, lots of depth to the gameplay. Very unique and different, worth the price.
2647	1	a	You can break through walls. 10/10
2649	1	a	Monaco is by far one of the best co-op games I've played.  Due to the game's amazing accomodation to differing playstyles, Monaco can be a stealth game, shooter, or simply a run and gun race against the clock depending on how you play it!  I was extremely excited for this game to come out, and it definitely lived up to the hype: polished controls, amazing soundtrack, accomodating to multiple playstyles (not only with the different classes, but with the tools involved as well), and overall just a barrel of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Monaco, whether you plan on playing alone, with friends, or with complete strangers.  That feeling when you pull off a perfect heist? Nothing compares.
2651	1	a	I think I have a new addiction. This game is pretty damn amazing, in single player OR co-op, and especially addictive if you enjoy trying to completely clear games or compete on the leaderboards. I just need a group of good bros to steal with. Let me know when you buy it!
2653	1	a	There aren't many servers out there but it shouldn't be a problem if you play with friends. It requires coordination with your team mates since punishment can be dealt out of spite because of one player. Overall, I think it's a game that pushes you to be versatile in many situation since a veteran has the same risk of dying as a new player. It's a great game.
2655	1	a	4/5 More fun than a boat full of criminals.  Monaco is a hide and stealth type heist game. There are 8 characters to choose from, all with their own skills. You spend your time sneaking around guards, hacking computers, opening vaults and stealing assets.  Fun story, Lots of levels! you can even make your own and upload them for others to play.  Single player is challanging and fun. Multi-player can range from 'Epic' to 'All hell has broken loose'. If you buy the game, you have to try multi-player at least once. It is so much fun, and has a great voice chat system. There is a Zombie mode as well...  Monaco is one of those games I would buy for all of my friends to enjoy.
2657	1	a	Very fun game. You never feel like it's the game's fault when you lose, and the destructible levels offer a lot of replay value.
2659	1	a	This game, if you play it with friends, is absolutely amazing. Such fun, screaming at each other and laughing your â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, truly spectacular.
2661	1	a	Summary: Heist simulator 2013 Multiplayer: 4 Completion: 5 hrs Cards: Yes Cloud: Yes  When you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.  In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.  The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.  Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.  If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.  If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.  While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!
2663	1	a	I love this game so much. The artwork and gameplay throughout. I still haven't finished the game because the guards are binding my brain, but still. Singleplayer or Multiplayer. It's still a really great game. I like the soundtrack and theme of the levels. The characters are cool, too ;)  Great game. Get it now!
2665	1	a	Fun game. Nice to play whith your friends even though you might not understand something. Cool story
2667	1	a	better than payday2
2669	1	a	An extreamly well designed came, loads of fun in coop. Probably one of my favorite indie games on steam.
2671	1	a	You know these types of games where you have to take something and then escape? But there's like lots of these things you can't resist taking even if it means going through â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fire but it gives no real reward besides a marking that you did so?  This is pretty much that again, and it's amazing.  11/10 gotyay buy it already seriously buy it I need more friends to play this with  Not sold yet? You can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ into the toilet while standing behind the toilet. Through a wall you just broke.
2673	1	a	Very fun game, played a few hours so far. Reminds me a lot of Hotline Miami, but with a slower pace that makes it easier to play. I love the idea of having four specialized characters that each have a different skill. It is fun to sneak around, knock out guards, hack computers and security systems while stealing money.
2675	1	a	Reminds me of Payday.
2677	1	a	Monaco is really fun, I like that it has a varity of diffrent classes with different skills but can be really hard at times
2679	1	a	Great fun with a friend. Probably even more fun with three. Don't buy it for single player, but absolutely pick it up for some great co-op action.
2681	1	a	One of the most fun coop games I have played. Monaco is a top down heist game that supports 4 players with half a dozen different classes that each bring something different to the table. Get your friends together and rob some casinos and blow some stuff up.
2683	1	a	The best crime/heist game i've ever played
2685	1	a	Awesome game, great multiplayer, and great level editor!
2687	1	a	This game is basically Benny Hill: The Heist. Buy if you have friends, or you will be alone and sad.
2689	1	a	This is basically the old Arcade classic â€œGauntletâ€ reimagined with crooks and thieves, instead of Elves and Dwarves. Teams of players work together to steal loot, and escape alive. Im a give fan of heist movies, and I can say that this is awesome and want all my friends to get a copy of it, so we can rob banks together.
2691	1	a	A top-down retro-styled thief 'em up, Monaco has a delightful soundtrack and makes a fun co-op game with the right people. By yourself you may find yourself playing far more cautiously and conservatively, fully exploiting the bag of tricks provided to you, but Monaco is at its most fun with 3 friends played as a hectic anything goes heist.  Difficulty curve for solo players may provide quite steep at times, especially the need to 'clear out' levels to advance the more interesting plot (which is well worth exploring right to the end to fully appreciate the whole story), while co-op with randoms is, as expected, a hit-or-miss experience.
2693	1	a	This game is like Payday 2, brought onto an 8-bit platform. This game has up to 50 missions to complete, a zombie mode and a map editor. The fun never stops! Would recommend this to everyone that has consumed a marshmallow.
2695	1	a	to good to be true
2697	1	a	When you play Monaco, you will feel like you are on a CAPER, straight up. Gameplay is Thief meets Pac-Man meets Left 4 Dead through their mutual friend, Ocean's Eleven.  You will feel classy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you play this game. You will feel like a smooth criminal. Even if you don't want those things for some reason, it's worth playing for the music and sound design alone.  Monaco is crazy-good, has something for all skill levels, completely changes depending on how many people you play with, and has high replay value. Oh my god get this game.
2699	1	a	This game is like the movie Oceans 11 but in a top down comedic flavor and with a better story.  It's refreshing, has a ton of content and a lot of re-play value, because of the easy to use level editor.  Steal this game.
2701	1	a	Monaco is a action, stealth, and strategy heist game, where in every level you are passing through high-tech security to find the item you are looking for.  Pros: -Very unique characters -The jazz piano is unrivaled -The storyline is excellent -Barely any bugs or glitches -I like the very unique pixel graphics  Cons: -The only con I would have to say for this game is the repetitiveness in the game.   
2703	1	a	One of the best cooperative games I own. Those clutch saves when one of you is stuck in a tricky situation, or pulling off perfect team timing make it all worth it
2705	1	a	You can't stealth in this game.
2707	1	a	SOMEONE GET THIS GAME SO I CAN PLAY WITH YOU  -coughs R3D and Pie and Mio-
2709	1	a	A simple yet complex game. It requires getting used too, but wheb you do, its great fun.
2711	1	a	This game is great- it's not too simple, not too complicated- the stories are pretty hilarious, and there's just enough humor to balance what could be potentially frustrating challenges.. There's also a built in editor so you can make your own levels! Tons of fun to play with friends- especially in zombie mode!!  I can't say enough about it- I hope they keep making new stories! Try it- chances are good that you'll love it :)
2713	1	a	Dont Look The Trailer Or The Screenshot You Have To Play It By Yourself This Game Was So Awesome
2715	1	a	super great for wasting a few hours with a couple homies.
2717	1	a	I'm the mole now.
2719	1	a	Finally a game designed to encourage teamplay amongst friends. Get it for a group of buddies and you'll be having a grand old time in no time. The screw-ups are great for laughs all around and it gets challenging enough towards the end to give four brains working in unison a run for their money.   The story is intriguing and the music is quite nice. If you have a single friend in the world, then you will enjoy this game.
2721	1	a	Superb music, vibrant colors, and superb gameplay makes Monaco one of the best indie games i've played in 2013. Multiple classes, and the ability to play as any of them to clear a level, adds replayability as you try to beat the clock or clear all the loot on each level.   Monaco's multiplayer makes it even greater. The game is hectic as everyone tries to combine their individual skills to complete the game. While it's online multiplayer isn't the liveliest, the local co-op allows your for your friends and families to easily join in the fun.   In short, this game is a real gem.

2725	1	a	Great game. Couch Co-op rules!
2727	1	a	This game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
2729	1	a	Sometimes, i get question from my friends about game i can recommending. For FUN, ACTION, bit PUZZLE, yet SIMPLE, also AMAZING, and can have blast with FRIENDS. well, i dont have any good answer, till i fin MONACO!  YES! THIS GAME DEFINITELY MUST BUY!!! CANNOT GO WRONG with THIS! XD
2731	1	a	It's a good game. Maybe I'll write a review when I'm not lazy.
2733	1	a	I was part of the core group of beta testers for this game and even have my name appearing in its credits. I invested dozens of hours into the work-in-progress version of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise is theft - and you can choose from a handful of different character classes that all possess unique abilities to to pull off a successful theft (the ability to smash through walls, hack into security systems, assassinate guards, pose as guards and more). The game affords for hilarious, whimsical encounters as one progresses through a map collecting treasures that all play into a single narrative or over-arching storyline. If you are a fan of robbery/theft films and games, you'll enjoy Monaco.
2735	1	a	It's a good game when you have smart friends
2737	1	a	Be heist or be silent. This !!!
2739	1	a	Sneak is for the weak. 9/11 would blast through the level with rocket launchers again
2741	1	a	Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer.   Think of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.  First of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way.   Also, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.  The single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).  Now, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with a group of friends.  This little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely.  Make sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.  [Rating: 80/100]
2743	1	a	One of the most exciting and puzzling game i played. Its more fun to play with friends.
2745	1	a	This is by far my favourite 2d game i have ever played, i find the graphics are very easy to look at and both the gameplay &amp; storyline are great :)
2747	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an amazaing game of stealth and sneakyness with many YOLO moments as well! Great with friends, Great for busting time, and AMAZING for general fun!  Get Shotgun, Get Money, Get Kills - NO WITNESSES!!!! 10/10 - Love It To BITS
2749	1	a	Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer. Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play. Playing with friends is where this excels. Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun. If you dont have this and see it on offer for under Â£2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.
2751	1	a	Love it!
2753	1	a	Leg it boys! Gotta get that gold ya see, ya see?
2755	1	a	I'm always looking for good co-op, and this one of my favorites.
2757	1	a	This game is a must buy for such a low price! Easy to understand when you start off playing.   A great combination of stealth play, tower heist and a 16 bit colourful retro theme. Plus the light piano music &amp; french accents is like the cherry on top. Also a bird eye view setting.  If you feel like stealing a bunch of valuable objects from buildings with plenty of security guards that you can either kill or make confused as hell, then you'll love this game.  There's a choice of 4+ characters with distinct unique abilities to help disarm alarms, hack computers, unlock doors, break down walls, you name it! You can pick up weapons too (AK-47s, spanners, C9s) but I find that breaks the stealth mode you want to enjoy and should really be used if you have no other option.  There are plenty of levels to play with character stories behind them. Co-op of up to 4 players is a great feature with so much more room for activities!  Super fun, highly recommended 10/10
2759	1	a	8/10  very nice co-op game.
2761	1	a	Loving this game so much!
2763	1	a	Excelent, adictive, fujn game to play with friends. thumbs up!
2765	1	a	Great game, very intense and perfect for co-op!
2767	1	a	This game is very addictive. It's fun to play with your friends either online or in the same room as you. Monaco is a very simple game, but getting the gold coins can be tricky. I always have that sense of suspense when a guard sees me and I have to immediately figure out a way to hide. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.
2769	1	a	This game is fun and interesting
2771	1	a	Frantic and challenging. You'll be left arms-in-the-air-cheering when you've finally cleared that difficult level on your 9th attempt.
2773	1	a	10/10 best new stealth
2775	1	a	Before you get this game, do you have at least 2 friends who would play this with you? If you do, then go ahead and buy it.  A cooperative stealth/collection game, Monaco offers a variety of ways to play with its ecclectic cast of characters. With skills unique to each character, such as Disguise, Spot and Breaking Down Walls, playing with a different set of team members will create a whole new approach to each carefully designed level.  
2777	1	a	100% Worth the money
2779	1	a	u git 2 b a bank robber my life long dream :)))))))
2781	1	a	This game is, hands-down, fantastic so far. Both the classic and zombie mode are fantastic.
2783	1	a	15/5 IT'S ALWAYS CRIME TIME
2785	1	a	One of the first Indie games that I can honestly say I enjoy. Interesting gameplay that provides challenge on a number of levels. So amazingly fun to play with others. Not really fun to play alone, but there is a good way to easily match up with others in public lobbies. Has in-game voice chat for communication, which is absolutely necessary to do well.
2787	1	a	Metal Gear ? Splinter cell ? ( waht's yours is mine) :trophy:
2789	1	a	Great game, take a bit of time to get use to the style of it.
2791	1	a	Game is too good. Would buy. Price well. Quality. 10/9 Would buying.
2793	1	a	Find yourself a handful of wired x-box controllers, and this thing is a blast. We'll get 4 roommates together on the same PC, grab some gold, blow away the guards, run, yell at each other, and generally have a good time. Honestly, the more people you have to play with, the better the game gets.   A good time to be had by all.
2795	1	a	Story mode that can be played in co-op from the very start. Exciting to play in teams, and the more the merrier!
2797	1	a	I've been excited about Monaco for some time so it was great to finally be able to sit down and play it. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed.  One of the greatest things about Monaco's design is that messing up is most likely going to happen. In fact, it's almost a guarentee. You can be as stealthy as you like but the moment you linger in a guard's face for too long he's going to come out shooting, the alarms will bare, and the classy piano-only soundtrack is going to kick into high gear. This is where your character's individual talents will come in handy. For example: The Cleaner can subdue any enemy that hasn't already been alerted to your presence (has a exclaimation point over their head, or a red question mark). The Mole can make holes in areas where they shouldn't exist. The Gentleman (my personal favorite) can make semi-effective disguises for himself when he isn't seen.  There are roughly 32 missions that you and your criminal enterprise can run through, each one favoring one character over another but allowing for improv. Half are through one campaign and half on the other. Playing by yourself is possible, but difficult and not as fun to perform. Playing with others is where the game starts to shine. Since messing up is pretty much built into the game's coding (see any mission with dogs in them), it's not a matter of being a perfectionist, it's more of making sure you're going the right way, picking up as much gold as possible on your way to the objective. Gold is optional but necessary to unlock new levels. Once you're finished with the entire campaign, you can go back in for your best time. Every gold piece you miss will add 10 seconds so if you're looking to speed run it's a matter of choosing your battles. The resulting multiplayer mayhem is less like Counter-Strike and more like Payday with a little more leniency and a hell of a lot faster.  So I recommend Monaco, even more so if you have people to play with. If you're going to play alone I highly recommend using The Gentleman as his disguise trick means you're holding down the shift key a lot and planning ahead, but you're not dying as much. Otherwise, practice practice practice.
2799	1	a	I was lead to believe this was the sequel to the really great game The Ship due to the picture but it wasn't. Currently exchanging letters with Mr. Newell over a refund.
2801	1	a	Monaco is a great co-op dungeon run. Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.  There's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the 'proper' gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.  It has a forgiving 'death' mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!  It also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are 'cheevos' through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.  The graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the 'ring' of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.  And the price? Cheap! I highly recommend this game.
2803	1	a	I ran around, shot everyone in the level with a shotgun. WIN
2805	1	a	its awsome

2809	1	a	Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was 'The Perfect Game' but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10
2811	1	a	High amounts of fun. Especially when played with 3 friends in coop
2813	1	a	Do it sneaky and 100% the map or just run though everyone and everything for fun and beat a level in a minute. Or... just make a cute house in a wall as a mole :P
2815	1	a	It's OK
2817	1	a	Played the same pvp map until 3 in the morning 10/10
2819	1	a	I personally like Monaco, and I know this sounds stupid, but I personaly think that Monaco is a 'birdseye' PayDay, but more Stealth than Gun. (Unless you play Gun) Every character has different abilities, so its important you get a charater your good at, and will get the job done. Over all, this is pretty fun, the campain is short, but doing it again with friends brings the meaning back. Personaly, I think the level editor is hard. But It's just not my thing. Worth the $15.00, and gives you a hindsight experiance of tense moments of the ultimate hiest.
2821	1	a	The game i will bring on an island... (an island with a good bandwith^^)
2823	1	a	This is by far my favourite 2d game i have ever played, i find the graphics are very easy to look at and both the gameplay &amp; storyline are great :)
2825	1	a	Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.

2827	1	a	I wasn't sure what to expect from Monaco, whether it would be more arcade or more realistic. And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.  When you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into â€œCampaignâ€ mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode.   The gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.  Pros: Menus move very smoothly. The graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent. The objectives are always clear. You can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose. All campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer. The controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller. There's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play. It's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.  Cons: Gun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload. The co-op community is not as large as I had hoped. Guards are almost too easy to get past.  So, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale. 
2829	1	a	Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:  'Dear future security officer,  congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:  - If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing. - If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it. - If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1. - Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at. - Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY. - Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER. - Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO. - Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting â™¥â™¥â™¥ is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.  With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.'   [[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]
2831	1	a	Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard. So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.
2833	1	a	I lost all of my friends playing this
2835	1	a	It fun, and stuff
2837	1	a	its awsome 
2839	1	a	A fun 2d birds eye view 'Stealth game'. Despite being fun, it is infinitely more fun if you play with 4 people in a skype chat.
2841	1	a	Amazing, fun and simple. What more could you ask for? Get in.  Get the objective.  And get the hell out.  bit samey at times, therefore I give it 4/5
2843	1	a	Brilliant fun to play in coop with a friend and seems like there's a lot of content in the game. The various different characters make it very interesting and add some replayability. The music is great and adds up to the atmosphere. It's also great how you can choose your play style; be it stealth, guns blazin' or something in between.
2845	1	a	What a fantastic little game. Playing by yourself is a ton of fun, as you take on one of many theif roles in daring top-down heist gameplay. Multiplayer is also a blast, but also a totally different game, as something inevitably goes wrong and you must make a panicked escape through the levels. Definitly worth the cash, with many hours of fun to be had both on your own and with friends.
2847	1	a	Amazing, fun and simple. What more could you ask for? Get in.  Get the objective.  And get the hell out.  bit samey at times, therefore I give it 4/5
2849	1	a	Great story. Awesome characters and concept. TENNAWTATENN
2851	1	a	Great game to play with friends
2853	1	a	This game surprised me by how good it was, given that I'm not usually a fan of this kind of game. It's fast-paced and hectic, especially when you start playing co-op. Each character has a different playstyle, so the game has a lot of replay value.
2855	1	a	An incredibly fun 'heist' game. Has a huge campaign (both for single-player and multi-player), local coop, online coop, matchmaking, user-created levels (via Steam Workshop)...
2857	1	a	This is one fo the best games ever. Very fun with friends.
2859	1	a	Great game with amazing stealth mechanics
2861	1	a	If you want a nice over-the-top stealth game that has a lot of variety and challenge, then Monaco will satisfy your desire. The stealth mechanics are well implemented and the different Thieves all have different playstyles and abilities. The stock story is really fun and even more when playing with friends. You can get a solid 30 hours out of the stock story without going for all trophies. After the regular story, you can play in zombie mode, where stealth isn't as big of a factor as on-the-fly decision making. Whether you are playing alone or with friends, I would recommend this game to you.
2863	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is heck of a fun little game. It follows the story of four (and later more) bandits on their quest to flee the country. How? By doing what they do best, stealing and thievin'. It has very unique art style, in pixelatted goodness, and uses a top-down view, which allows you for better planning in the heists you will be making. The game has you select different characters to pull these off. Each character has its own assets and they are all very unique. You will need to use their different abilities to collect money and other collectibles and complete a variety of missions. You can play this game offline or with friends in a four player online co-op game, which is the has its assets and its disadvantages. Alone you only have the benefits of a single character skill, but you are less likely to be caught, so the way you play really suits your style. It has a great number of missions in the main campaign, to which is added another campaign of harder difficulty, PvP maps where you can duke it out against others online to see who can collect the most treasure or kill the opponent(s) first, to which are added other levels that explain the origins of the characters through score-attack like levels. The game can even be played in whole in 'Zombie mode', where the whole game has not only a zombie skin change, but the characters have different abilities too. And finally, the integration of custom maps made by the users only make Monaco a potential source of infinite fun. I highly recommend it.
2865	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time.   Well worth buying it.
2867	1	a	The mole is very judicious in his digging.
2869	1	a	When it comes to heist games, Monaco is King. It is also the king of both hilarity and frustration so to maximize your enjoyment and minimize the frustration do yourself a favor and grab at least one competent partner and one complete imbecile. Trust me, you'll thank me for it later.   Now go out there and get yourself some trophies and some cash... no no.... go out there and get yourself ALL the trophies and ALL the cash.
2871	1	a	Crime through teamwork. The only way to do it efficiently and successfully is to work together and use your abilities. Committing crime has never been so much fun (and safe) as it is in Monaco! Unless you die and then you have to be revived by a teammate if that's possible at the time. Nevertheless, this game is definitely worth it and playing online with others as you craft a strategy is even more enjoyable. Monaco FTW! 
2873	1	a	Nice graphics, cool music. Really like enhanced levels, they seem to be much more polished. Online gameplay is quite fast and funny. A lot of workshop levels with funny dialog and nicely arranged assets. Offline play is quite fun too with two controllers
2875	1	a	Bring your friends for the co-op and become thieves! Such a funny game. Totally worth the buy!
2877	1	a	Hai, this is a awesome game.
2879	1	a	Way too much fun...
2881	1	a	it's so much fun when you play it with your friends :D
2883	1	a	It's easy to speedrun a level, because then you won't even have to sneak. But if you'd like to collect all the loot, it might be a bit challenging doing that alone.
2885	1	a	Great game with amazing art and concept.  This game will surely bring all your friends together as you will work toegther as one cohesive unit. This game relies on the skills of each and every character. You can beat this game on your own, but it will be hard. Playing single player often gets me thinking 'Having a breacher here would be great.' or 'Man, a lookout stationed here would be really helpful' which is why playing online is the only way to go.  The music, is another plus point in this game. The music has a lot of pace, picking up extremely fast as you get spotted by a guard, or managed to take the prized loot. During sneaking mode, the music provides a spy-ish sort of music.  Overall this game is guaranteed to give you a whole lot of fun and a unique experience, be it bad or good totally depends on your teamwork, when working in a team.  My rating: 8.5/10
2887	1	a	With a colorful artstyle and a chaotic nature, this is a game where you seem not to know what is going on at any moment in time. Yes, I am here reviewing yet another four-person co-opertative. This is a very strange type of game through concept, but achieves enjoyment through being very chaotic, escpcially when all four players are present for the experience. There are multiple characters to play as, with each one having a special ability that assist the team in one way or another. You can play through the game either through the stealth means or running through it, getting spotted by the security will peforming said action. This video game was specifcally taliored for co-opertative, as having multiple individuals in the game at once is benefital to the success of the operation. If you are trying to play this without being spotted, it is very difficult, with their being a mass amount of security officer and civilans present on each level. There are ways to avoid said obstacles, such as vents and other means of traveling around. The gameplay is enjoyable, with teamwork infused into multiple actions, such as if a teammate was killed you will need to go to revive them and can not proceed without doing so. So, would I recommend Monaco, yes, as it is an enjoyable co-operative experience.
2889	1	a	the only 2d bank heist game.
2891	1	a	This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.  Thumbs up!
2893	1	a	I've played a ton of this on Xbox, and picked it up on Steam summer sale. Well worth it. Monaco is linear. It is repetitive but it is also damn fun and outstandingly exciting when you pull a win out of your a$$. This IS a co-op game. Single player is less mayhem and challenge. Half the fun is your friends tripping alarms or gunmen and you having to figure out wtf do we do now? Haven't made it to community maps or level editor yet, but that plus more content is what brought me from Xbox to Steam.   Bottom Line: get some friends, get some copies and enjoy this great co-op indie title
2895	1	a	Game is awesome. Gets completely hectic at the drop of a hat and then dies back down into the slower paced stealth game it was designed to be. The art style is awesome, the music is amazing, and the accent is even better.
2897	1	a	Frantic and fun, would recommend!
2899	1	a	Great co-op game, recommend 3+ players when playing to make it interesting. Not very fun solo
2901	1	a	Wow! What can I say about this game? If you have EVER wanted to be in a heist movie, this is the game to get. It's pure joy! I cannot recommend this one enough!
2903	1	a	As many people have said, if you look at the disrecommendations, this game is very easy and boring. However, what those people fail to realize is that, they didn't try hard enough. This game is so boring and simple if you just run through, grab the objectives, and dodge bullets. Now, on the other hand, if you actually go for the achievements, try sneaking through undetected, getting every coin, and not dying, it quickly becomes very difficult and fun. Several people have stated it lacks challenge and strategizing, but that's probably because they played the first levels designed for newcomers, and didn't even try to do good. My friend and I played through the entire game, getting every trophy and achievement, including a hidden one, and it was not easy at several points. For example, in one level, guards spawn every 20 seconds, and form giant conga lines of destruction. Now try sneaking past their unpredictable routes into a guarded room, knocking out the guards without getting seen, so that you can hack a computer and hope that everything works out to let you get through the other 2 rooms, past some lasers, and giving you enough time to grab the cash and get out. My friend and I got rather good at the game and it took us about 30 tries to get lucky on that level. This game has tons of gameplay, and even more replayability with the many character combinations and strategies you can use on each level. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
2905	1	a	Great game!Shows how well ur aware are u in a game and mosts of all one of the best co-op games I've ever played
2907	1	a	really cool game 
2909	1	a	i have no idea what im doing i r8 8/8 m8
2911	1	a	Monaco is easily one of the most addicting and fun multiplayer games out there. The game mechanics are great, story is good, and a level builder to top it off. Great for casual gaming with friends. I recommend it to casual and pro gamers alike.
2913	1	a	I'm a big fan of Heist type games/movies and cooperative gameplay, Monaco is one of a kind and aside from such games as Payday, Monaco delivers a more unique user experience with it's immersive gameplay, style, and it's playable classes of characters. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone!
2915	1	a	took a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and came back and it was done downloading  10/10 would download again
2917	1	a	This is a fun game with plenty of challenging levels, neat graphics, co-op AND pvp, and a level editor. It also has the most amazing music ever. Get it now.
2919	1	a	u git 2 b a bank robber my life long dream :)))))))
2921	1	a	This game drives me nutty. When im hacking as the hacker my shingy dingy gets in a twist and all these popo mcgees are all up in my grill. This is the overall reason for me being shamwowed by the judges badonka donk after the part time security guards latched me to a subway car and sent me down to the station. Monaco is a fantasmic game about litterally stealing from every place robbers shouldn't be stealing from; Hospitals, Embassies, and even hotels. The creators of this game are hands down the smartest people on this planet, because I would have never thought to rob a hospital for a quick buck. 10/10 would rob again.
2923	1	a	If there ever was a game this is the one. 
2925	1	a	This game is, hands-down, fantastic so far. Both the classic and zombie mode are fantastic.
2927	1	a	This game will be amazing when you play with friends. So much fun will be had.  Problem is, none of my friends have it... and I finished everything solo -soooooooooo hard.
2929	1	a	Interesting game where you can choose between different characters with interesting abilities i give it 9/10 stars
2931	1	a	I didn't know what to expect when I first played Monaco, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it that it's fast, tense, and fun! It's interesting to play levels over and over by switching up your characters, and seeing what works out best, and while I'm not good enough to start doing speed-runs, it also adds even more replay value to the game.
2933	1	a	Monaco is the game that I started to play with my wife. It has been only 3 month that we married and she got her first steps on gaming culture, so I was a bit suspicious about how she will gonna interact with this game. I can't find true words maybe in shortest way, but It Was Amazing, Full of Fun! We were shouting each others about what we doing for each other whle playing game feeling whole adrenaline rush while running in corridors and hiding from swat guys etc. It was enormous feeling and fun to spend together with keyboard - gamepad while looking on same screen. I just wish to thank dev's team who gave us this beautiful time and opportunity to spend together.  My only con note about Monaco is, there is no way to play 2 people on same-screen whle online... We cannot setup 2 different gaming pc at home which I dont believe as 'standard' around, and we wish to play 2 more people in our team, so we couldnt understand technically why this is not possible... But generally, awesome game.... Awesome!
2935	1	a	This game is amazing very challenging at points. I recommend to play with friends and it's a great price.
2937	1	a	A joy to play alone and ONE OF THE BEST MULTIPLAYER GAMES!!  Really nice and original! 8/10
2939	1	a	GUARD. GUARD. Is all i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hear. Theres no black guy in this game, so it's super unrealistic. I'm also waiting for the Zombie's mode dlc, so I can buy the RPG on the wall with chalkboard. BTW, the gentleman is gay â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. He's a ripoff of spy from TF2 but hes not french, so he's not a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I also like mole because it takes balls to dig a hole. Lookout is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ character that likes to suck other's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for vision.    (I do not mean all of this. Don't kill me pls)  69/10 would buy more DLC
2941	1	a	Surprinsingly funny and addictive with several players. The general design is really good, and the graphics fit perfectly with the game.
2943	1	a	Its a game!
2945	1	a	One of the best dugeon crawlers that i have seen. The goal is to steal every bit of money aka gold from the map while avoiding getting caught or by killing the guards. you can hack, break through walls, pick locks, etc only one character can break walls though.  4.9 out of 5
2947	1	a	I think the biggest issue this game has is getting people to give it a try due to the graphics.   Even though the graphics give off that old 8-bit atari feel, it feels nothing like it. Try to imagine a stealth game like theif in a more retro setting, and then add three other players plus lots of awesomeness. While it can be played single player, this game thrives as a team stealth game.   In terms of content Monaco has more than enough to keep you busy for months. There are tons of levels, each taking anywhere from 10-20 min on average, and even after you beat all the levels you can try the levels with different character combinations. Each character having it's own unique ability that helps your team in it's own unique way.  Truley an amazingly fun and challenging game, if you already have a group of friends you game with, this is definitly a game worth getting.  
2949	1	a	Is it trying to be a stealth 'em up or an action-me-do? I couldn't really tell. I had some decent fun with the game despite it being a bit muddled and directionless, until later on when the missions became ridiculous. The multiplayer is a laugh. Overall I'd recommend it but don't expect anything groundbreaking.
2951	1	a	An extremely fun rogue-like co-op game. Distinctive styling and fun atmosphere.
2953	1	a	It was great fun playing with friends. I recommend you buy the 4 pack! It's especially fun when someone messes up, everyone starts to panic!
2955	1	a	It's like Payday in 2D.  Much friends = Many fun
2957	1	a	Loving this game so much!
2959	1	a	Before you get this game, do you have at least 2 friends who would play this with you? If you do, then go ahead and buy it.  A cooperative stealth/collection game, Monaco offers a variety of ways to play with its ecclectic cast of characters. With skills unique to each character, such as Disguise, Spot and Breaking Down Walls, playing with a different set of team members will create a whole new approach to each carefully designed level.  
2961	1	a	Mole stop doing this!!!
2963	1	a	A really original take on a video game: case da joint, sneak past the guards, h4xx0r the alarms, and get away with the loot. The variety in obstacles and powers to overcome them is good, though I think that some characters seem underpowered compared to their fellows. I like that it's designed with single and multi-player in mind, but think that the single-player is a bit too frustrating. It really ought to let you swap out characters during the level if you're playing by yourself. As it is, you only get to use a new guy if your current one dies. I've yet to actually suicide in order to do this, but close. There are definitely spots where it gets tough in the later levels, and sneaking by solo is all but impossible. If you want to grab everything, you may wind up brute-forcing an unpleasant amount of stuff. Haven't tried out the multiplayer to date.
2965	1	a	Excellent game to play with friends.
2967	1	a	Find yourself a handful of wired x-box controllers, and this thing is a blast. We'll get 4 roommates together on the same PC, grab some gold, blow away the guards, run, yell at each other, and generally have a good time. Honestly, the more people you have to play with, the better the game gets.   A good time to be had by all.
2969	1	a	10/10 best new stealth
2971	1	a	Monaco is the game that I started to play with my wife.

But generally, awesome game.... Awesome!
2973	1	a	For when your mom doesn't let you play Payday. 10/10
2975	1	a	Really fun game to play with your friends! 15 bucks is a bit much, but anything below that during a sale, etc. would be a great deal.
2977	1	a	Surprisingly refreshing and entertaining, especially when played with friends. Stealth isn't a must, and is rather difficult to maintain at first, but it can come in handy when you don't have a lot of ammunition and want to avoid a high body count.
2979	1	a	Siz geme is so funny.
2981	1	a	The game mixes 2d and stealth and does it perfectly! The game has tons of levels and classes to choose from. I would recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of stealth games.
2983	1	a	High amounts of fun. Especially when played with 3 friends in coop
2985	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an amazaing game of stealth and sneakyness with many YOLO moments as well! Great with friends, Great for busting time, and AMAZING for general fun!  Get Shotgun, Get Money, Get Kills - NO WITNESSES!!!! 10/10 - Love It To BITS
2987	1	a	Frantic and challenging. You'll be left arms-in-the-air-cheering when you've finally cleared that difficult level on your 9th attempt.
2989	1	a	I'm a civ player and something is telling me that I'd really like monaco.
2991	1	a	Nice game! overall 8/10
2993	1	a	
2995	1	a	It was great fun playing with friends. I recommend you buy the 4 pack! It's especially fun when someone messes up, everyone starts to panic!
2997	1	a	Tons of fun with four people. Good controls, good AI and just a great game overall.
2999	1	a	This game is super hilarious for me! I don't know why, but watching people struggle with gaurds is funny.  +Funny +Cooperative Gameplay 
3001	1	a	A person who doesnt like this game is a person who doesnt like live. This takes its place as 4th favourite game (EVER) I am a person who doesnt really like these type of games but when I played it I fell in love.
3003	1	a	A great little Indie heist game that eveyrone should try. If you have any controllers, it's a BLAST for 2-4 players! I play with my sisters a lot. :)
3005	1	a	Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop. I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard.  The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms. It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.  I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3
3007	1	a	Very fun! Simple concept but very addicting, the replay value is pretty high especially when you get friends involved!
3009	1	a	Fit and playing with friends
3011	1	a	Played couple hours, what can I tell it's worth to buy and spend some time at weekend with friends. Good game!
3013	1	a	Strongly recommend! Great game, if you love Stealthing stuff or going full out, it's mostly Stealthy though, great game to play with other friends ! get it while its on sale! I'll play with who ever has it &lt;3
3015	1	a	Monaco has a 2 great things about intense escapes and great startegy 10 out of 9 
3017	1	a	Is a really fun game once you get the idea of the game, I would recommend it more in local with some friends, multiplayer you end up being tied and you'll end up repeating a lot of missions
3019	1	a	This game is the most fun i have had in along time. The only down side is that there isnt a lot of people playing it now. Never the less the single player and multiplayer are some of the best.
3021	1	a	Some say 8bit PayDay. But my first in game experience of this was similar to that of 'Metal Gear Solid'. A guard spotted me and a red '!' appeared above his head. I made a run for it juked out 2 guards and headed for the exit van.
3023	1	a	The best stealth-based party game makes its way to Steam! Amazing sound design, online heists with buddies, and a good sized amount of maps and objectives. It is true that the visuals take a bit of time to get used to, but everything looks a certain way for a reason.
3025	1	a	This is a really nice game, was a good change of pace from most of the hardcore action games i've been playing really enjoyed it.
3027	1	a	Way too much fun...
3029	1	a	it's so much fun when you play it with your friends :D
3031	1	a	Cool game.Escapes,Heists and other.I love tthis game!
3033	1	a	Monaco is easily one of the most addicting and fun multiplayer games out there. The game mechanics are great, story is good, and a level builder to top it off. Great for casual gaming with friends. I recommend it to casual and pro gamers alike.
3035	1	a	best played with friends, a fun little stealth coop expirience has given me so many frantic and fun moments, would wait for it to go on sale though, not sure if it's worth the Â£12
3037	1	a	Unique classes with different abilities, doesnt require a good laptop, fun (especially with friends), but later on gets kinda boring. 7/10
3039	1	a	WIKID GARFIXS. GOOD GAMEPLAY. ITS A TOUGHIE. BRAP.
3041	1	a	the only 2d bank heist game.
3043	1	a	How bad are you at stealth games? How bad are your friends at them? This game is a sure way to find out
3045	1	a	Strongly recommend! Great game, if you love Stealthing stuff or going full out, it's mostly Stealthy though, great game to play with other friends ! get it while its on sale! I'll play with who ever has it &lt;3
3047	1	a	A lot of thought and design went into this game and it shows, from the concept to the level design this stealth / heist game is a lot fun. Most of the various characters feel unique each with there own advatages and disadvantages. Co-op is great especially with 3 or 4 players each playing a different class lending their special talents like a disguises or tranq darts. If you like playing rouge / theif type characters you'll really enjoy Monaco.
3049	1	a	Monaco is a game thatâ€™s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether youâ€™re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay thereâ€™s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment.   Itâ€™s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I canâ€™t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.  Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.
3051	1	a	Me and my homies like to play this kind of game. We played it todai and we like the game. Have fun playing the game
3053	1	a	What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine.
3055	1	a	Stealing has never been so much fun!
3057	1	a	This game is annoying and weird at first, however! after about 1 hour into gameplay and playing some with my friend, who also bought this game. It began to become fun. I give this a 30/10 :) for anyone who likes PvP and Heisting in France. The only catch is the new interface and the confusing intro. I also recommend playing this with a friend for best results :)
3059	1	a	Well designed game. Much fun solo but the real fun begins in multiplayer when it's getting chaotic. What really stands out are the visuals and the soundtrack.
3061	1	a	The game i will bring on an island... (an island with a good bandwith^^)
3063	1	a	Tons of fun with four people. Good controls, good AI and just a great game overall.
3065	1	a	Fantastic game, fast paced and tense with a multitude of roles to play. This game is best with a group of people and even better with friends, although you can still have a swell time if you're playing just by yourself. Definitely worth the price tag, especially in a sale.
3067	1	a	pvp in a nutshell   omg i have all the trophies better escape *shotgunned to the face right at the boat*
3069	1	a	This game is EPIC! its like PayDay 2. I just wish there were more guns... But still, this is a AWESOME GAME!
3071	1	a	Awesome game. Can meet lots of talented people on it too ^_^
3073	1	a	its good has intrestrefatsf game play weird story good grafixs i guess its just good buy it..... its also really hard
3075	1	a	Thrown into a game with no guidance or form of instruction, with up to 4 player co-op this is one of my favorite games for multiplayer shenanigans. Every character is fun and the whole team will benefit from whichever you choose, inventive and original gameplay not seen since the likes of the original Payday. 8/10.
3077	1	a	Buy it and be impressed.
3079	1	a	OMG so much fun! chat engine is a bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ though...
3081	1	a	Great story. Awesome characters and concept. TENNAWTATENN
3083	1	a	Reminds me of like if Hotline Miami and Mark of the Ninja had a kid.
3085	1	a	What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine.
3087	1	a	Heist game that is recommended only to those that like sneaking around and doing certain missions. Great game to have just to fill in your time real quick.
3089	1	a	Unique classes with different abilities, doesnt require a good laptop, fun (especially with friends), but later on gets kinda boring. 7/10
3091	1	a	best played with friends, a fun little stealth coop expirience has given me so many frantic and fun moments, would wait for it to go on sale though, not sure if it's worth the Â£12
3093	1	a	Great game which is easy to learn and great chracters to play as with unigue abilities. The game is always different with different people and a different character set. You can have a good time with some strangers or have a laugh with friends especially when new friends join the game and sing new york new york as he walks past people the first time he uses the gentleman. But in the end it is a great game and you have fun learning what to do with the simple controls and good gameplay.
3095	1	a	Proboably one of my favorite games of all time...Fantastic art style and chaotic fun make it a fantastic arcade game.
3097	1	a	Thia game is so much fun me and my friends got a four pack when it went on sale. Its great.
3099	1	a	This game is awesome !!! It has nice graphics, low requirements and it looks cool. It is totally worth buying.
3101	1	a	can the mole tunnel through the barrier of failure?
3103	1	a	I cannot say enough praise for this game. Not only do I enjoy it, I recommend it to everyone I know. Most games get boring after you beat them, but Monaco just stays fun by allowing you to try it different ways, with different characters, making it a game you can play multiple times. And multiplayer is great (assuming no one lags too badly) since you can have more fun, knowing that someone's got your back. Even the story is great, as I was truly enthralled in it. As of right now, I'm working on the achievments, which have never felt more rewarding. I cannot recommend this enough.
3105	1	a	Smash walls, get paid. Need more? Hella mad co-op. Get in on it.
3107	1	a	A lotta fun with friends 8/10
3109	1	a	Fun and a bit challenging worth it if you can get it on sale. 
3111	1	a	This is a really good game. It can be played single player or multiplayer (up to 4 people). Great pick up if you get it in a sale.
3113	1	a	A definitely recommendable game, with a very good concept, art style and humor. However, playing with friends is almost a must, especially in the later levels, and constitutes most of the fun. This is sadly a little bit hampered by the awkward private game creation system (x on the level for list of games, from there create, from there set to private, then send invites...). Perhaps the option for friendly A.I.s and a more streamlined private game with friends system would be of help.
3115	1	a	Smash walls, get paid. Need more? Hella mad co-op. Get in on it.
3117	1	a	Fun and a bit challenging worth it if you can get it on sale. 
3119	1	a	dirty criminals should think like dirty criminals.

3123	1	a	I recomend this game for everyone.
3125	1	a	packed full of stresfull, intense, badass, ect. moments, and a variaty of carictors and their storys. definitly a game to get!
3127	1	a	Lots of fun!
3129	1	a	It's fun just running around like a maniac and causing the guards to kill themselves
3131	1	a	A fun 2d birds eye view 'Stealth game'. Despite being fun, it is infinitely more fun if you play with 4 people in a skype chat.
3133	1	a	This game is tons of fun! It has a complex storyline, the map design is brilliant! Music is nice too, I love it!
3135	1	a	a fun game for you and your friends to play togethor, and the soundtrack is amazing
3137	1	a	Monaco is an incredibly varied game with very simple game mechanism. Itâ€™s actually quite staggering with how much you can get done and nuanceful (thatâ€™s a real word I am sure) your game play can be with so few commands at your disposal. Itâ€™s nothing short of brilliant. It also makes its very approachable and in all probability resulted in 8 different character classes rather than one multitalented one and too, is very cool since it opens up a nice setting for very fun multiplayer games that rely heavily on co-op to get things done efficiently. And with a game play as smooth as Monaco's it really is a treat!  So what type of game is it? Itâ€™s a stealth action planning coop game where you collect treasure, whack out baddies and hide in the bushes. Occasionally when things go wrong and might have to put the shotgun on the table and some cleaning.  The game has a top down view, you have a field of vision (opponents too) and you can see most of the buildings layoutes once you have explored them. You move around with arrow keys and with the help of different character you can go through walls, pick locks or hack computers etc. Your goal is get through security and fine the 'cake'.   For me itâ€™s the coop that really shines since you can have your buddies set up different scenarios or organize traps for the baddies and itâ€™s just a lot of fun. Itâ€™s also the type of game you can easily play with your girlfriend!  9/10 in my book. 
3139	1	a	it great play it nowwwwww
3141	1	a	If you're into 8-bit games, and into intense strategy, then this is a must-buy.  Atmosphere: The background music is great, gives a nice touch while playing.  Gameplay:  Alot a variety with 8 'classes' with each with his/her own specialization. Multiplayer is where this really starts to shine.  Graphics: It's a 8-bit game, why bother?  Story: If you're willing to read every dialog, then the story itslef is pretty good.  Downsides: Controls and gameplay styles are easy to play, but hard to master.  Overall: I'd give it a 9/10, one of the best games of it's type out there.
3143	1	a	Realy Fun Co-op Game. And Realy Good To Mess Around With.
3145	1	a	This game taught me a valuable life lesson: Never rob a bank with my friends. We will all scramble like idiots and quickly die. 11/10
3147	1	a	Monaco is the first game Iâ€™ve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.
3149	1	a	Fantastic game, especially if you can team up with your friends, it gets even more hillarous when you're on teamspeak or something. Amazing soundtrack that changes according to the current situation and has a great heist feel. The visuals are good, colours are nice but when things get hectic, it's pretty hard to see and usually things get a bit clutterd. But who cares about that in a game like this? It's dirt cheap on sales too. I wouldn't reccomend buying it full price thoguh, becasue it doesn't seem like a game you'd play a lot.
3151	1	a	A great game for it's price!
3153	1	a	Killing is not necessary. 10/10
3155	1	a	Its amazing! I love the music, style and story! :D
3157	1	a	The real gem in my game library. Monaco is a co-op heist game with 4 players just like PAYDAY (btw there're some PAYDAY maps available to play in the workshop). Like I said, my favorite part in the game is Community made levels (my favorite is PAYDAY maps). Sure the original campaign is good, but the community made maps have a lot of detailed hand crafted game mechanism. So why aren't you buying this?! go ahead buy the game without hestitate!
3159	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time!!
3161	1	a	Fantastic game, especially if you can team up with your friends, it gets even more hillarous when you're on teamspeak or something.

3163	1	a	I love this game. I was so addicted and when you finish all the levels you get the trophies on them like the 1p trophie and the All Coins trophie and when your done with that you just start joining other people's servers and start making friends with them and help them finish all the levels and it just go's on and on. The Hacker is my favorite charecter because like love green and love neon green even better.
3165	1	a	I love this game because of the many ways to play, beyond just the 8 characters. You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little 'tricks', such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain 'loot container' (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.
3167	1	a	By far the most fun co-op game I've ever played. The soundtrack and graphics are both amazing, and the characters are all pretty balanced. 10/10 would go to jail again
3169	1	a	Brilliant stealthy tactics in single player, with lots of chaotic fun in multiplayer, as well as a lovely sense of humour and excellent soundtrack. Definitely worth a buy.
3171	1	a	It's definitely something that you can play, be challenged by, but also feel like you're clever enough to beat it. Thankfully online multiplayer is friendly and cooperative, though maybe that's because you can't complete the levels unless everyone is alive. Definitely fun when playing with friends, but also rewarding when playing alone, either in the normal mode or zombie mode. Worth the money at any price.
3173	1	a	This game's attention was worth it. In 2010 this game was shown at IGF, and it won a slew of awards, now, three long years later, it has arrived. the enviroments, animations, and enimies are stylish, and the top down look works well, the story is cool, and the multiplayer is great fun (even with strangers). BUT... there are some flaws, the level design is very so-so, and the playable characters' models need some work. the music is great, it sets the tone very well, you would never know that it was composed by the same guy who did Journey's music. all-in-all a solid 8.75

3177	1	a	Over priced but if it's 2 Euros, why not buy it?
3179	1	a	it is AWESOME
3181	1	a	I would highly recommend Monaco, especially if you love stealth or heist based games. This game can be played with 1-4 players and even has its own level editor that allows you to design your own banks, houses, or whatever to steal from with friends and others!  Get it or you shall miss out!
3183	1	a	A great pixel game. It has a rich gameplay, where you need to plan every movement and try to get the best out of each character. Playing a multiplayer game may be very funny (even more when cooperation falls down, and everyone runs for their own lives). The history is great and funny, also.  Recommended  9/10
3185	1	a	Awesome game, very fun with multiplayer. Tends to be either hit or kind of miss; there's still 20-40 hours of gameplay even if you aren't really into it. Multiplayer is definitely a better experience than single player, but single player is fun as well. (especially if you enjoy speedrunning)
3187	1	a	this game is good if you just want to casualy play shumshin... seriously you guys.get it
3189	1	a	The only reason you could not like this game is if you have â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ peakskills and if thats the case you just aren't good anyways.
3191	1	a	The best part of this game is when you diligently set up a detailed and flawless plan to complete the mission. And upon execution, the plan falls apart and everyone is running around in choas. A co-op blast.
3193	1	a	Its challenging fun with great elements of stealth! 8/10!
3195	1	a	Fun in a bun. Classic overhead stealth game, with line of sight and awareness control. Story is full of twists and turns, told elegantly. And the OST is 95% upright piano music. What's not to love?  What badge?
3197	1	a	Best played in coop.
3199	1	a	This game has a Dark Souls difficulty...
3201	1	a	A great game with well thought out stealth mechanics, interesting characters with helpful abilities (And the pickpocket), and overall amazing sneaky gameplay that challanges your mind, reflexes, and strategic skills.  Or you could just yolo it and run through all the levels real fast and hope nobody catches you like I did.
3203	1	a	This is sincerely one of my favorite games of all time. It's simple to play, but has room for fantastic strategic thinking and co-op team play. My boyfriend and I have been playing this game fairly consistantly for years. I've spent most of my 35 years playing video games and I've probably never played anything as consistantly as this game. Seriously, cannot recommend it enough.
3205	1	a	awesome game. recommend to everybody.
3207	1	a	Love it!
3209	1	a	Monaco: What's yours is mine , is one of those games I don't want to play, because I'm afraid I'll finish it. Luckily it has Steam workshop, so there's no fear of that anymore. :=)
3211	1	a	i bought this game so i could write this review   10/10 game reminds me of the first half of my name
3213	1	a	Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.  The goal of each level is to go through a series of 'floors' of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.  The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong. You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.  The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!  All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!
3215	1	a	Me likey. I'd cut off my balls and sell them on ebay just to play 5 minutes of this game. Its cereal guys. For realzies.
3217	1	a	A very interesting, entertaining game. The devs are also awesome!
3219	1	a	Simplistic and fun. Enjoyable
3221	1	a	Monaco is a fantastic game with great level designs that can be tackled in numerous ways. Every class has its own methos to get through each challenge and to work together. A note however is the beginning parts start of rather easy, however the challenge lies in getting all the coins(cleaning out). For a great experience make sure you have a friend to play with and enjoy yourself in the heist of the century!
3223	1	a	This is a very fun game!

3229	1	a	I love the fact that I can go all Jihad and suicide bomb the guards in this game. That's probably my favorite part. This game is one of if not my favorite game I've played. It is hilarious. There is much entertainment value in it, you can play with friends, you can build your own maps, and the replay value is phenomenal. They have two separate campaigns (I guess it's sort of like the same campaign only the level gets bigger and more difficult). The different characters you can play are very diverse (not the bad, politically correct way) and have different skills. The NPCs are friggin' HILARIOUS in their interactions with you and the bush in which you are hiding (but they, of course KNOW you could not possibly be hiding there) and it's just an all around well balanced and fun as hell game. I give this game an 11/10 (because that's possible).
3231	1	a	Great game for COOP LAN fun

3243	1	a	Outstanding in every regard. 10/10
3245	1	a	Me and my friends robbed everyone inside a whole building. In order to escape, we had to rob a car, so me and another fella got inside a common-ish looking car while the other guy was outside looking at a nice looking lamborghini. 'No, since we're at it, let's take this one instead' - He said So the 2 of us left the common-ish looking car and attempted to steal the lamborghini. The alarm went off. We all got shot in the face. Started over, and damn right we stole the lamborghini!  This game is pure evil. 10/10 would die again
3247	1	a	Very fun and addictive 8-bit heist simulator with your friends.
3249	1	a	Pretty cool game
3251	1	a	attempting progression during unorganized revelry
3253	1	a	**
3255	1	a	Having put 60 hours into this game solo and co-op with an additional 25 hours in creating my own custom mission, I felt it's finally time to leave a quick review. This is a great game for casual gamers like myself. With my short attention span for games nowadays, it's awesome to come across one that is so simple in concept that it is easy to pick up. Missions range from a few minutes to maybe 45 minutes, and it's just perfect.  Even when you're done with the campaigns, there is a plethora of custom missions created by dedicated players. Of course, not all are winners, but there are definitely some very fun ones to play with friends.  And of course, that brings me to the best aspect of this game: Co-op play. It's hard to find great co-op action these days, and Monaco delivers. I just love that you really have to work together to finish, period. If just one player is dead, you simply cannot progress. It's also fun to have to constantly be saving each other's asses...especially when you have a friend who likes to throw himself into the throes of danger just so he can shout 'WHOOOOOOOOOOO!' And then he gets blasted in the face by shotguns.  As someone who doesn't even play games that much anymore, Monaco was a delightful surprise that will keep me playing as long as the custom missions keep coming out.
3257	1	a	Good story but only a few hours of fun. 7/10
3259	1	a	me:do you have this game  you:no  me:what the hell get it right now it is so awesome  you : ok  that is what u say to people who dont have the game cause it is so god damn awesome

3263	1	a	Great Game High replay Value this game is Amazeing and Fun its comical just by hearing Pst when u type to someone Very interesting and simple gameplay but complex Great game the Very Fun high high replay value Though its not for the young kids cause its not like Payday The heist or any other Heist style game its unique and fun in its own style Highly recommended
3265	1	a	this game is an awesome game is great game to play co-op :D

3279	1	a	Do you like Oceans Eleven?!?!?!? WELL THIS BEATS IT!!!!  Monaco is an amazingly amazing incredible, frustrating, yelling at you friends while laughing! Type of game.  Monaco Prepare to Die Edition &gt;_&lt; You get caught heal your friends and most of all... RUN!!!!!

3287	1	a	This game is amazing. Some people don't like it just because its a little hard. But its actually really fun! On xbox i was bad, but on pc im really good for some reason. Even tho i only played 1.0 hours so far, i still really think people should get this game. 9/10 - HeadZipper
3289	1	a	Better than Payday
3291	1	a	Fun 2 play 10/5 if you ask me 5/5 if truth is said
3293	1	a	It's fun.
3295	1	a	how to be a thief? then play this game...  8.5/10
3297	1	a	wie Payday nur aus der Topdown sicht aber mit weniger ballern just like Payday but with less shooting
3299	1	a	Neon, 2D, pixelated, heist game that's loads of fun. For those who like leaderboards, it can become a time trialing coin collecting runthrough. For us normal people it's just a great game with a great look
3301	1	a	The ending of this game is very possibly literally and clinically â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Otherwise, it's a fantastic and fun piece of work with a totally baller soundtrack.
3303	1	a	1v1 me in club penguin i'll hack into your webkinz account
3305	1	a	Great graphics, great music, a great experience. Some levels can be frustrating if you're a perfectionist like myself, but what's a game without a little frustration, amirite? Would replay new levels 10/10.
3307	1	a	This is a very good game has classic and everything i recommend this
3309	1	a	I'm a big fan of Heist type games/movies and cooperative gameplay, Monaco is one of a kind and aside from such games as Payday, Monaco delivers a more unique user experience with it's immersive gameplay, style, and it's playable classes of characters. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone!
3311	1	a	Okay....I'll admit it. For a long time I didn't like Monaco because it just felt strange to me. It's an acquired taste (As one of my friends said in his reviews).  But after many heists with friends, I must make a confession....I LOVE THIS BLOODY GAME!!!!!  It's not too good in single player, but when you're playing with friends, the chaos becomes your new best friend!   You can relate this game to a top-down Metal Gear game, but with a charm of it's own.   BRILLIANT story-telling. BEAUTIFUL music. WONDERFUL chaos. FUN gameplay. GREAT mechanics.  If this game is not in your library, then why are you even on Steam?!  If you meet me in a server, be ready for a good time. But don't forget........what's yours is mine!
3313	1	a	Best Co-Op game I have played in a while. Very fun to play with friends and local Co-Op. Great game I do reccomend!
3315	1	a	Awesome game! 'Payday 2' but in a even better perspetive!!!
3317	1	a	Bought this for 3 others and myself. Start up a multiplayer game, all hell breaks loose. On a scale of Pineapple, I would rate this game 7 egg custards out of 4 Eggs.
3319	1	a	It will make you yell at your girlfriend. Therefore, all I can say in review of this title is that if you enjoy getting laid, never play it with her.
3321	1	a	Very fun four player co-op. So many ways you can fail.
3323	1	a	very fun, pixelated, fun for online multiplayer or single player. I enjoy this game. There is not many acheivments. It does not take up that much space. It will most likely run on any computer. You do not need friends for this game because you can play alone. there are good discounts for this game so hurry up n get it.   
3325	1	a	  it's very fun multi / single player game :) 9/10

3353	1	a	I don't remember ever playing this game, i also don't own it yet I can review it.  GG
3355	1	a	This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.  As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.  As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).
3357	1	a	This game is awesome. It's about many 'classes' doing various missions. 'Classes' being: Locksmith (Blue), Pickpocket (Yellow), Hacker (Green), Lookout (Red), Redhead (Orange), Gentleman (Blue-Green), Cleaner (Pink), and Mole (Purple).
3359	1	a	Tactical game for thieves!

3377	1	a	Fun game, fast action, bright graphics. Classes and abilities aren't explained well, but community guides make up for that.
3379	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.
3381	1	a	Monaco is a great stealth action-packed game. You take the role of 8 different thieves with very different gameplay through two campaigns and great number of challenges. The gameplay is solid. While you can pretty much force your way through the first levels, you really must avoid getting caught later on. The difficulty of the second campaign is quite hard, with a lot of achivements to go for. While the game is great in solo, it really shines in coop multiplayer, where each player control a different thief. There's also versus multiplayer, which is great fun too.   Monaco also has a very fitting soundtrack and a very interesting storyline, mostly because of the way it is told. For those interested, there's also a great deal of community maps made with the very complete level editor in the game. The game recently recieved an update consisting of a reworked campaign and a zombie mode with new enemies.   If you like stealth games, monaco really is a blast. I especially recommend it if you can find friends to play with.
3383	1	a	Two words to describe this game... 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it' 10/10
3385	1	a	A fantastic and fun co-op experience that can lead to absolute hilarity when it all goes wrong. That said, when it all goes right and you get the loot and get out its an immensely satisfying experience, especially as the difficulty ramps up in the later levels.
3387	1	a	THE best stealth game ever, and awesome multiplayer. Get it!
3389	1	a	The best way to steal something is to flail around in doing so. 10/10
3391	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.

3395	1	a	Best birds' eye view game out there
3397	1	a	LOTS of fun if you have more than one friend.
3399	1	a	I really like the gameplay and the well done roles. The neon artstyle is fitting and is pleasing to the eye. The stealth system is well designed and the game is a lot of fun with friends.  But the whole playerbase is pretty much 7 years old so prepare yourself for a lot of screaming on online play.
3401	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO MUCH FUN But the real thing So its alot of fun, even singleplayer, good way to let time fly 100000000000000000/10
3403	1	a	FUNNY AND AWESOME GAME! THUMBS UP FOR THE MULTIPLAYER!
3405	1	a	IDK WHAT THIS GAME IS
3407	1	a	Fun game, fast action, bright graphics. Classes and abilities aren't explained well, but community guides make up for that.
3409	1	a	10/10  Would not play again.
3411	1	a	Two words to describe this game... 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it' 10/10
3413	1	a	i dont really like this game becuase i dont know whats going on when i play it but i like the idea and i would recomend it
3415	1	a	Different but good
3417	1	a	Great OST but don't play public coop.
3419	1	a	  i don't own this game, but if you give it to me for free ill play it and rreview it for you ;^)
3421	1	a	Such neat, much hipster, many fun. Wowe.
3423	1	a	Class game.
3425	1	a	Let's get some money with this
3427	1	a	This game is more fun than I thought it would be. Sort of like a mini-Left 4 Dead combined with Alien Swarm.
3429	1	a	Whether a casual pick up and go gamer or a hardcore computer wizard, Monaco has something for everyone. With a gentle learning curve but a painfully difficult proficiency requirement near the end of the campaign coupled with the arcade feel and deceptively intricate classes, this game holds appeal for those both playing for fun and those looking to leave no coin behind.
3431	1	a	This game is amazing fun to play with friends due to the amount of co-operation you have to do and if you dont work together it just ends bad, but overall its just fun to play
3433	1	a	great stealth game. reccomend if you cant afford payday 2 :) 
3435	1	a	I want more characters!
3437	1	a	Amazing game, very entertaining. It can get boring but only after a long time of play in one sitting. I especially like the controller support.
3439	1	a	Pros: -Extremely fun -Nice gamemodes -4 Player coop -Incredibly nice map designes -Good ai -Nice graphics for a retro game Cons: -The feel when you left a coin behind -You can't understand wtf is going on on 4 player coop  
3441	1	a	THE best stealth game ever, and awesome multiplayer. Get it!
3443	1	a	really good game, only downside is that it is basically IMPOSSIBLE to play single player, so recommend at least a party of 3 people. besides that, real good fun. :D
3445	1	a	Awesome game! The only flaw in this game that I've noticed is the lack of people playing.
3447	1	a	I bought this game to play with friends and family. I really enjoyed playing with them, but I found that playing solo or with others it was either super tough or close to unbeatable...  Its a good game to have in your library and when you play... just remember.... TEAM WORK! other wise everyone runs around like group of chickens leaving feathers and what have you all over the place. :)
3449	1	a	Best birds' eye view game out there
3451	1	a	Just by playing the one-day-for-free deal, I loved every sneaky little moment of it! Great game to play co-op!
3453	1	a	great stealth game. reccomend if you cant afford payday 2 :) 
3455	1	a	Stealth and Co-op!!?!? 10/10!

3461	1	a	Simple game but very good. I recommend it to everyone
3463	1	a	A fantastic and fun co-op experience that can lead to absolute hilarity when it all goes wrong. That said, when it all goes right and you get the loot and get out its an immensely satisfying experience, especially as the difficulty ramps up in the later levels.

3467	1	a	Would recommend
3469	1	a	highly entertaining with friends
3471	1	a	great stealth game. reccomend if you cant afford payday 2 :) 
3473	1	a	Way overpriced but fun. Worth a pick-up on a steam sale.
3475	1	a	It's a great Indie game if your into stealth and a great game overall. However, I recommend playing with friends because it's dangerous to go alone! (and because it's more fun)
3477	1	a	this is a fun game to play with with friends, by yourself its not as fun
3479	1	a	It is good
3481	1	a	This is a good video game
3483	1	a	Im not sure what im doing but I like it
3485	1	a	Is honestly most fun stelth game I play ever in life.
3487	1	a	 What I liked:      Missions start out easy, but get more difficult later on     Every character has a good use, some are better on certian missions ( I liked the Cleaner)     Has mod support     It's a great stealth game, how many of those exist?   What You Need to Know:      You would be lucky to find anyone playing this game     I tried singleplayer, wasn't bad, just not the true way to play      You need a good team, because you everyone has to escape, so one person can ruin the game    My Score:
3489	1	a	Flawless gameplay. Great for solo and co-op play.
3491	1	a	Really fun, great co-op game!
3493	1	a	it is a good game with stealth mechnichs like the spy in  tf2
3495	1	a	This game is one of the most elegantly designed games I've played in years. The simplicity of all the ancilliary components (controls, graphics, UI) really belies the level of depth and just pure fun that you get in this game.
3497	1	a	Creative as hell. One of the best co-op games I've played on Steam.
3499	1	a	The best strategy/shouter game ever
3501	1	a	nice co-op game. recommended
3503	1	a	It is good
3505	1	a	This is a good video game
3507	1	a	excellent 'goonish-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burglar' simulation
3509	1	a	A great game, you should definitely buy it.
3511	1	a	this game is the  bomb.com 
3513	1	a	I have no clue what the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you are supposed to be doing in this game. I find it rather irritating the view and the controls. Only thing that is good is the coop with your friends lets you be confused togethre.
3515	1	a	Just read the reviews and buy it already! It's amazing!
3517	1	a	Strictly one of the most brilliant and immersive games I've played in a while. And it's even better with co-op.
3519	1	a	I thought gunpoint was a hard spy game. THIS is a HARD SPY GAME. YOU WILL DIE. (at least once)
3521	1	a	pretty fun in multiplayer.
3523	1	a	one of the most fun co-op games ive played. 10/10
3525	1	a	awesome experience unique game you have to try it it is worth it
3527	1	a	Killed my friends in pvp before they could grab guns. 10/10
3529	1	a	The 2D payday 2 :D
3531	1	a	A great game, you should definitely buy it.
3533	1	a	i like to buy it but i cant steam is be a f***Er to me and say no you can play a good game so if you can buy it BUY IT i love to but like i say it will not let me if you can help me say so plz 
3535	1	a	Eh, this game is alright. I enjoyed it mostly. Although this seems like a game that's better suited for consoles. I wouldn't get this game unless it is on sale.
3537	1	a	Only played a few hours with friends. Not a bad game at all! Just tough to play with people who genuinely don't like 2D games and / or playing for realz.  Can't see anything wrong with it. 7 / 12
3539	1	a	Amazing game, even better with friends... 11/10.
3541	1	a	Reminds me of pacman but if you could stealth around the ghosts. Clever ideas and really awesome multiplayer.
3543	1	a	'loved this game, that is all and i think you will too, yes you there this shirt buy this game now'
3545	1	a	Great fun! Much better when you play with mates... Almost like a 2D Payday if that makes sense &gt;.&lt;
3547	1	a	I might say its a great game the story is nice the levels arnt too frustrationg the workshop and zombie mode are good player vs player could do with an upgrade.But this game is more demanding to be played online or with a friend so yeah 7/10 GOOD JOB EVERYONE!
3549	1	a	What's yours is mine. My virginity is no ones.
3551	1	a	this is a fun game to play with with friends, by yourself its not as fun
3553	1	a	Its bloody expensive I had to freaking sell my house to but this crap ...omg please don't buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ...I beg you don't make the mistake I made...but I recommed it
3555	1	a	Eh, this game is alright. I enjoyed it mostly. Although this seems like a game that's better suited for consoles. I wouldn't get this game unless it is on sale.
3557	1	a	Killed my friends in pvp before they could grab guns. 10/10
3559	1	a	monico is a stealin game its fun i tried to sneak around my partment and steal the gemsss but i gotcaught and had to pay the price  no more monico for a whole week oh no!
3561	1	a	Honest review  Best gun simulator 2015 Enjoyed hitting people with wrenches while getting spanked by guards
3563	1	a	This game excels at being a frantic multipllayer game where if stealth didn't work, run. Alll the levels have a twist and a new perk to them, which makes the game never boring. The characters are great for that extra help you need in the game (I like thee pickpocket, as he can just be in a room and Hector, his mokey, can take everything).You cant anticipate the next move of anyone in the levels, which adds to the excitement and suspense. The music is great, the graphics suit the design of the game, and the gameplay is fantastic.
3565	1	a	Sneak is for the weak. 9/11 would blast through the level with rocket launchers again
3567	1	a	  i don't own this game, but if you give it to me for free ill play it and rreview it for you ;^)
3569	1	a	shot a guy with a rpg next to his friend. was wearing a suit so he did nothing   10/10
3571	1	a	this is the funnest fast paced arcade game I had ever played!!!!! it is an amazing and fun coop experience and also has an intense pvp mode to play with your friends. all of the classes are usefull and fun to play as, whether your into difficult stealth gameplay or just want to have some fun with your steam friends this is a game I recommend for all  10/10
3573	1	a	Best fireworks show I've seen in ages 10/10
3575	1	a	Deserves more attention 
3577	1	a	*Pees in a prison toilet* Me: Screw the mission, I'm busy in here m8ts. *Gets kicked*   10/10
3579	1	a	quite fun, and has good single and multiplayer. lot's of fun when played co op. mostly tactical in real time, but about 25% action.
3581	1	a	Very fun game especially during co-op. Definitely recommended to anyone with a computer.
3583	1	a	  This game is awesome!!!
3585	1	a	Awesome co-op game. A must have for any Pacman fan. Ive put in 200 plus hours on this baby and still going strong. The map editor is worth the money by itself. 10/10
3587	1	a	The new standard for stealth games
3589	1	a	This game is absolutely phenomenal. It's great if you have friends that can play with you, and even better if you can talk to eachother whilst playing it. This game is my game of the year 2013 and game of the year 2014 so far! I love this game so much, but my only knack is the dodgy level editor system. It's controls are somewhat flawed, but if I could navigate it with my mouse then I feel that it would be greatly improved. Buy this game and share it with your friends!  P.S. I have taken the liberty of creating a group for our Monaco friends by the name of Voleurs De La Nuit. Please join us and invite your friends to have even more fun in Monaco!
3591	1	a	  boring
3593	1	a	This is a great game with with everything you could want in a game. It has great graphics, fun gameplay, online co-op, great controls, lots of stuff to do, and best of all it's unique.
3595	1	a	1. Start Game. 2. Sneak up on someone. 3. Make them sleep. 4. Make them sleep again. 4. Rage because they wake up and you have to make the sleep again. 4. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  11/10
3597	1	a	Unbelievebly good! Pick it up if you can, makes a great controller enabled game + has brilliant multiplayer. Get some friends round if you can and play single screen. My friend bought this at full price while we were at his house and we were bored, and it was the best Â£12 we ever spent. He loved it so much he 100%ed it within a week (normal for him). And then we went back a month later and discovered there were 2 new campaigns! Just seriously, get it!
3599	1	a	Didn't think this game would have guns. Alwell, whats a game without guns thesedays?   - 10/10 would be sad again
3601	1	a	A good game to play with your friends online.
3603	1	a	I wish i knew how to be good at this game, becasuse it looks â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cool!
3605	1	a	Very unique idea for a stealth co op game. Just brilliant !
3607	1	a	Awesome game, the stealth, the knocking everyone down before you get caught. Just plain awesome. Buy this game. Now. Even when you're reading this.
3609	1	a	its fun if you have friends to play with
3611	1	a	The Graqphic are so good, the gameplay is better and the local co-op is teh best. the only thing that is not so good is the Storie . So buy it and the worst thing is that the keybord is from france. that is not okay but buy it now
3613	1	a	If nothing else, the level of content has been astonishing
3615	1	a	The best game ever made.
3617	1	a	if everyone followed that motto we would all have things, but they would like always be replaced with new things every few seconds... it would be a rotation of other peoples things that then becomes yours and vice versa... oghrigt goldengirls out of cia miami
3619	1	a	What the hell do I do in this game? Help Me PLEASE!
3621	1	a	I have only opened this game for the trading cards.
3623	1	a	Super fun and easy to play.  nice game to play with friends on lan, u have no friends?&gt;? no worries there's actually a community playing this hardcore.
3625	1	a	I walked through an entire manison for the goal to find the mysterious golden vase. We entered the building and spent 2 hours fighting through hundreds of enemies. We died so many times but we got up to finish the mission we came to do. We made it to the final boss and spent 30 minutes fighting him while crying everytime a team mate died. Once he fell over a gold vase came out of his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Inside the vase read-Kick me nudes 609-619-7348
3627	1	a	Great game, if you can pick it up during a sale for only $8, its a steal. Even at $15 its a great price for the game. It is fun single player and even better with friends. If you pick it up we could play it together too! Love the graphics and art style, and the gameplay.
3629	1	a	Only good with other people. The graphics are awful and the music is OK.
3631	1	a	11/11
3633	1	a	
3635	1	a	What are you doing? Grab three friends and go loot! Some of the most fun I've had in awhile.
3637	1	a	10/7
3639	1	a	It's good.
3641	1	a	Star in your own zany heist movie with friends, local coop or online.
3643	1	a	Very fun!! :D Rainbowdashy's :3 rainbowz peace! ZWOMBIEZ :C RAINBOWS! c:
3645	1	a	One of the funnest games ive played with friends. Its great to mess around, screw with your friends, guards etc. while still cooperating. DEFINATELY a good game if you have friends willing to play with you, which I don't :'( Im lonleh :C
3647	1	a	GAWD! (Guard!) GAWD! (Guard!) GAWD! (Guard!)  10/10   stupid sounding french accents sell this game.
3649	1	a	Great game in concept, less great in actual use.
3651	1	a	grant me badges steam
3653	1	a	Pretty good overall, although the missions do get a little repetitive. CO-OP is a good change that tends to fix that though, giving a whole new life and style to the missions.
3655	1	a	overall. i do recommend this but it is very hard to get used to and kinda lame.
3657	1	a	All my friends defriened me because i kept on smashing through walls and got them kiled.   11/10 would friends friends again.
3659	1	a	...
3661	1	a	If you like Payday: The Heist or Payday 2, I highly recommend this game. It's like a 2D version of Payday: The Heist, but better.
3663	1	a	I've always been a fan of 8-bit games and this one is by far one of my favorites. Gameplay is very intuitive and addicting. There are endless opportunities in playing this game and the story is pretty interesting.  I'd reccomend this game to any gamer who owns a computer and mouse.
3665	1	a	I bought this when It came out and it was worth it. Updated every now and then, still in development and exactly why I like Indie devs way more than the big industry publishers. Great game, buy it nao.
3667	1	a	  6.5/10 TJBs
3669	1	a	Don't believe the hype. The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible, or it would be if i got to play it on the throne. This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pile is funnier than gilbert godâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ his own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-cunt. Trust me there's no bowing you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, only monday morning memes and a mass dose of aids. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who talk about this show all the time, ned stark died â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, dumb â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  Also Monaco is kinda cool.
3671	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
3673	1	a	CAN SOMEONE BUY THIS GAME FOR ME WHEN ITS ON SALE pwease pwease pwease with a cherry on TOPA
3675	1	a	Good co-op experience.
3677	1	a	This game is sick !
3679	1	a	Strategy, cunning, craziness
3681	1	a	fun game for a buck!
3683	1	a	This game is one of my favourite co-op puzzle games. It is one of those games that challenge you, and make you enjoy every second of the game.
3685	1	a	I remember my Nintendo and Sega Genesis games - 90% of them had the option to play co-op (Player 2 PRESS START!!!). Now, if you want a co-op game, you have to search - and that's very sad.  So, if you're looking for a co-op game - you can easily grab this. It will soothe all your co-op needs.
3687	1	a	This game is great for a bunch of messing around with your pals or by yourself, it's even better if you're all bad at it.
3689	1	a	Ridiculously fun, and a perfect balance of strategic pacing and anxiety.
3691	1	a	Playing alone, it's probably a 6/10. Playing with friends with open mic chat? 10/10. Hilarious.
3693	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
3695	1	a	Game is great, lots of replaying. Dern Sure fun game with friends.
3697	1	a	A friend of mine bought the 4-pack for the small group of us that he plays with on Steam. It was a blast and we have so much more to complete. I would totally recommend this for anyone who can play through it with friends.
3699	1	a	Great game, whether you play sinlge or co-op. Very amusing story and characters.
3701	1	a	This little gem was well worth the price for hours of co-op mayhem. Great stealth action with lots of tactical choices to make when played with others. The solo experience is severely lacking. Do not judge the game if you've only played it alone. The more players involved the more complex the plans you can hatch.
3703	1	a	Monaco is a blast of a game. So far I have really enjoyed playing it in single player or in multiplayer, as the gameplay, the story, and the music and graphics are all well-done. The only complaint I have is that its hard to find multiplayer matches sometimes and getting a full game is pretty hard, and unless your teammates know what their doing, multiplayer missions can go south pretty quickly, but even then it can still be pretty fun.
3705	1	a	A co-op stealth game, no fun alone but great with friends.
3707	1	a	Really nice game to play with your friends :)
3709	1	a	Amazing heist game with high replayability value. Would totally buy.
3711	1	a	Great game to play with friends. Multiple storylines in the campaign to play through. A few different game modes and a map creator make for good replayability. It's fun to try and be stealthy, but it's equally as exciting to try to run and gun through the map. Or do both, just hide really well after running and gunning and you can go back to being stealthy haha.
3713	1	a	cool game really enjoying it
3715	1	a	Buy it, what are you waiting for?
3717	1	a	Great co-op game.
3719	1	a	This is the BEST game I've ever played... And I've played Skyrim!
3721	1	a	Nice &amp; easy to play :)
3723	1	a	Cute. Never finished. Probably needed multiplayer to fully appreciate it.
3725	1	a	I liked Monaco, but my co-op partner did not get it. I suppose it isn't a game for everyone, but I appreciated the well-crafted levels and thuroughly developed gameplay in single player enough to recommend it.
3727	1	a	Fun, but more fun when you have friends to play it with.
3729	1	a	Great game , worth every penny
3731	1	a	Best robbery game EVER! I love all the carecters and all there specile abillites. 1 thing i dislike is dat pick pocking allways allerts gaurds. 
3733	1	a	Some of the best co-op I've ever played.
3735	1	a	Such a great Co-op game! In my opinion a perfect one! But it's a bit boring when you play by yourself! So, if you are going to get it, get somebody else to get it also! Other than that, this game has almost no flaws!
3737	1	a	What's Sarps is everyones!
3739	1	a	Pretty interesting game. There isn't anything like this on the market right now. It is fun!
3741	1	a	This game its sooo awesome.You must to play it if u like to be sneaky
3743	1	a	Do you like games where stealth matters? Where you start of really well, don't alert anyone and then half way through, fail totally at staying undetected, pull out a shotgun and finish the level by murdering everyone (following the hitman mentality: nobody will notice of there's nobody to notice)?  If so this game is totally for you.
3745	1	a	Really fun co-op  
3747	1	a	A simple top-down, 2D Heist game. Amazingly fun, especially with friends.
3749	1	a	This is a really good game
3751	1	a	Dunno wut the game is about
3753	1	a	Awesome game, cool music, guards have amazing AI  10/10
3755	1	a	Awesome game kind of like gauntlet but with heists and alot more characters.
3757	1	a	rly AWESOME game!!
3759	1	a	This game is sweet. ridiculous fun. get it!
3761	1	a	Bought the four pack on sale to play with friends. Find a group of four and play through the levels. Great workshop support as well so it seems like you wont ever really run out of levels to play through. Live the graphic scheme too; very appealing.
3763	1	a	This game is everything I want in co-op. I've been introducing it as Pac-man but stealing money. Its fast-paced and frantic, yet very forgiving in its stealth elements. The controls are simple but have a lot of room for subtlety. On top of this it has a polish you don't expect from indie games. The music is absolutely fantastic and it has Steam Workshop support now so custom maps galore.  A warning though, the game loses all its charm to me when played solo. Play with friends or not at all. (It works very well both local and netplay though.)
3765	1	a	Awesome game, well worth the money!
3767	1	a	Incredibly fun co-op or solo game filled with hijinks and theivery. Highly recommended.
3769	1	a	A humorous co-op oriented game with a wide difficulty range from beating the level to 100% completion.
3771	1	a	1 Minute Review of Monaco.  This is a great game with its retro arcade machine feel but the problem is when it comes to playing with strangers who don't appreciate the stealth aspects involved. They can ruin the fun.  Final Word Buy if you have 3 friends to play with or at least a friend... Buy a copy for them if they are cheap. Don't Buy if you have no friends, in which case you should probably be out socializing instead of playing games.
3773	1	a	This game is very logical:   'Where did they go? I swear they went in this room'  'How about that bush in the corner?'  'Brian, don't be an idiot'  9/10 not enough pineapples
3775	1	a	one of the best indie games i've ever play i would rate it 9/10 -012sean 
3777	1	a	Hiding in Bushes Simulator 2015
3779	1	a	Very fun, unique multiplayer co-op game centered around coordination and execution to heist various buildings for various valuables. Choosing from several different roles within your heist gang, you infiltrate your target and rob them blind. Very fun, espeicially with friends.
3781	1	a	A great game! The playing style changes based on how many people are playing and who's playing as which character, and can range from expert stealth to charging in guns blazing. I love the in-game art style, but the pixel-ish dialogue segments before each event where a bit odd; but then again it fits with the menu very well. Music is FANTASTIC! I love how it changes as the mood of your gameplay becomes intense, relaxed, or frantic.  It is a very difficult game, and the difficulty will change for how many people are playing (depending on the people, it can either get easier or harder with more friends). I can recommend this to almost everyone I know; if you like a game for it's story, gameplay, art style, dialogue, you name it! This is a great game for everyone to enjoy.
3783	1	a	A game that teaches you how to get away with stealing. The end.
3785	1	a	Very strange but fun - mostly fun with friends only 6/10
3787	1	a	This is a really fun co-op game. Think of it as a top down version of payday but it has more than just heists, with a pvp mode and a create your own level mode. It is definitely better with friends as the levels are exactly the same in singleplayer and co-op so singleplayer is very hard. Overall i think it is worth the price:)
3789	1	a	Monaco is a charming game where you and three friends take all the priceless artifacts out of various buildings while avoiding detection of guards and cameras. There are different classes you can choose from, find the one that suits your style. This game is pretty cool with an interesting story and vary people who talk to you in game. Complete with the workshop to continue the game even after the story is over. Also go back to previous levels and beat the record speed. Fun game, great multiplayer.
3791	1	a	find out which of your friends are bumbling â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and which of your friends you actually like
3793	1	a	its great plebs
3795	1	a	I really cannot recommend this game highly enough. The artwork is nothing short of beautiful, the story is intriguing, and the gameplay is perfectly paced to accommodate for both strategy and quick thinking. This game is perfect example to illustrate how amazing indie games can be.
3797	1	a	Monaco is a wonderful game and for all you heist loving fans this would be your type of game. It's a stealth co-op game. You cna work together as a team or do it yourself. But it is hard when you only have one person. All the characters are used in this game for different things.  Pros: - It's a good game, perfectly made and has a wonderful aspect to it.  Cons: - It's a more Team Effort game and not everyone is up for that and it's just hard doing it by yourself and there's not that meny people playing online to do it with. Despite the fact you can't choose servers it just hooks you up to a random one.  But overall this game is well done and i recommend this game to people who like a sneaky challange.
3799	1	a	two words to describe this best: tight and pimp
3801	1	a	Monaco is one of the best coop/multiplayer games out there.  Not recommended for people who does not like pixelated arts or for people who wants to play alone.  Must-buy: 10/10
3803	1	a	One of the most challenging and fun games that I've played. Leads to some frustrations but rewarding to complete. Definitely play online with friends as having multiple characters helps.
3805	1	a	The best and most approachable cooperative game experience I've ever had, hands down. Don't bother purchasing it for yourself - grab the 4-pack and spread the joy!
3807	1	a	Great Game
3809	1	a	Disappeared for a whole year, came back, still an awesome game. A bit buggy and I got disconnected a few times today but I would definitely recommend it..
3811	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends! I had it on my Xbox 360 and played it a ton with my brother.  The item pickups and character abilities are cool. The levels are interesting and pretty challenging later on. The art style and music make the game more fun and intense.  I recommend adding this game to your wishlist and that you and a friend buy it during a good sale!
3813	1	a	A brilliant game.  Hard to do be yourself, hillarious with others.  You will find yourself in a level with 3 other people, being stealthy, robbing people blind without them knowing. Then suddenly... An alarm More alarms sound of gunfire and then your teammate runs through the door, spraying the area behind them with bullets and continues running, followed closely by a pack of dogs, some guards, some agents and some guy wielding an RPG  *Cannonfodder1995 has been shot by a gaurd*     10/10 would hide in the bush again
3815	1	a	Such game Much enjoy Very Monaco Omg Wow.
3817	1	a	Got this on sale for 1.50, a LOT of content for such a seemingly simple game. Multiplayer is great fun but haven't played it alone.
3819	1	a	A very simple and fun game. 10/10
3821	1	a	Great, fun party game. If you want some awesome stealth and heist-themed gameplay but not the crazy, fast-paced, teamwork-is-essential gameplay like the Payday series, give this game a try.  Story: Main story is short, however there are other side missions that take place after the main game is completed, as well as custom missions you can find, adding replayability.  Gameplay: Emphasizes on stealth a lot, but not always required, so pick the character based on your play style and go to town. Enemies can overwhelm you rapidly but if you know what you're doing, you can get away reasonably quick.  Controls: Absolutely simple, with the theme of 'within reach.' Moving with WASD and using gadgets with the Spacebar or Left Mouse button? Couldn't get easier.  In all, very fun game that's easy to get into, with easy achievements for the new guy, to the hard ones for the hunter who wants it all.
3823	1	a	Wow this game is so good I hate it. I have so much fun whenever I play it that I seriously start puking all over my keyboard so now I have to play with cellophane over my keyboard and I can only get through a solid 10 minutes of gameplay before I blow chunks. 10/10
3825	1	a	
3827	1	a	Gameplay is excellent. Multiplayer is excellent. Art Design is excellent. This is a purely excellent game!
3829	1	a	it's a lot of fun if you are playing it with friend/s. Not so much alone in my expirience
3831	1	a	To be honest i have no clue whats going on but it is very enjoyable for some reason, maybe its all the colours **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR COLOUR BLIND PEOPLE**
3833	1	a	Monaco is good, if you have friends its good. play monaco, it has good good
3835	1	a	Oh snap! It's the THE ARCHITECT'S PATCH!
3837	1	a	This game I bought blind, only knew that it was about stealing, one of the best games I bought this year, Id Highly recommend it, its just super really fun, And I want to learn to make my own maps on it!
3839	1	a	Very fun for the amount of money you pay for it
3841	1	a	Amazing game. Whether you want to take it slowly on your own or hop online for some of the most chaotic and unpredictable heists - get the game. Go watch a gameplay vid if it helps - screenshots and trailers don't really do it justice.
3843	1	a	GG (Great Game)
3845	1	a	This is like payday mixed with hotline miami. 15/10
3847	1	a	As Monaco is only really for the dwindling few its various characthers and missions keep it interesting and plentyful. If you're into co-op games with a twist I recommend purchasing the 4 pack and start taking on some missions!
3849	1	a	This is a great game to play! The gameplay is enjoyable, and the graphics give the feeling of an old fashioned 90's gane. However, don't be fooled! This game is HARD to play as a singleplayer, so playing it with someone else is a must. Prepare for laughs , raging, and a sudden hatered for france.
3851	1	a	Great game to play with friends
3853	1	a	Bought it while it was on sale for $1.50. Best $1.50 I have ever spent.
3855	1	a	Charming and stylish co-op stealth game. Be one with your inner Pink Panther. It also has an arbitrary Zombie mode...which I guess one of you asked for? 8/10 So far...
3857	1	a	Tons of fun with friends!
3859	1	a	One of the most enjoyable multi-player experience I've had in a long time. The game is unique, fun, and challenging. I would recommend picking it up with a friend and playing through the campaign at least once.
3861	1	a	A fun game to play with friends, and the price is nice. The PVP is a bit broken, a player can get everyone's trophy only to get killed once and the killer takes all trophies and wins. The story is good I guess.
3863	1	a	VERY fun game whilst playing with friends, co-op is hilariously fun and challenging as well!
3865	1	a	Best couch co-op I've played in a long time
3867	1	a	This Is a fun Co-Op game the gameplay can range from hectic to strategic gameplay depending on your friends. It has a tonne of levels and workshop support so you'll never be bored. Best played with friends so I suggest picking up the 4 pack for the best experience
3869	1	a	Simple Stealth Action!
3871	1	a	Super fun! Took me a minute to understand the controls (mouse + WASD) and I've only played single player... But so far so good!
3873	1	a	Fantastic fun! 10/10 would play always haha
3875	1	a	Do I recommend this game? HELL YES! This game is an amazing game, the levels are well designed, the soundtrack is nice and the gameplay is INCREDIBLE. Singleplayer is fun but Co-op is where this game shines. Up to 4 Player Co-op staging heists and robbing people whilst avoiding cops. HELL YES. Using different characters with different skills. HELL YES. Playing Monaco? HELL FREAKING YES. GET THIS GAME. NOW.
3877	1	a	Yh i recomend this game to everyone, i think people who have played stealth â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will like this game.
3879	1	a	This game is a blast to go through with friends! Seriously, why haven't you bought it yet?
3881	1	a	Ingenious game reminiscent of the old breakin capers, complete with all the main prototype characters. It's like Ocean's Eleven without having to look at Brad Pitt and George Clooney all the time.
3883	1	a	If you like heist and 2d downview killing fun then this is the game for you basically payday 2 meets hotline miami!
3885	1	a	A fun game with friends but it gets pretty hard without warning, so you could play it like a muppet for a good 10 levels and then realise - oh no, we're meant to be doing it like this, that's how you do level X.  So it's fun but it can be a bit hard at times. Nice fun game, nothing ground breaking but still fun.
3887	1	a	A brilliant game of theft and teamwork, except when your entire team screws up and gets you caught by guards. Even then, each class's unique skills are invaluable to the effort, and overall, this makes a great co-op experience.
3889	1	a	This game was really fun to play with friends!
3891	1	a	amazing game and really fun with friends
3893	1	a	It's okay. I wouldnt pay more than a cheap sale price for it (I paid like $1.50 or something). It's a top down game w/ pixelated graphics and it's very simple. Theres 4 classes (locksmith, etc.) and you do these missions where you traverse through structures of traps and bad guys to achieve goals like getting an item or saving some guy.  I don't want to rate it poorly b/c it didn't dissapoint me. My expectations were low given it was a cheap game, but overall compared to what other games are available and what you could be spending your time playing, this is pretty boring.  
3895	1	a	This game I bought blind, only knew that it was about stealing, one of the best games I bought this year, Id Highly recommend it, its just super really fun, And I want to learn to make my own maps on it!
3897	1	a	One of the funnest games I played in 2013, especially if you have a group of people to play with. At 80% off you can't afford NOT to buy it.
3899	1	a	Great game, realy fun to play with friends!
3901	1	a	Absolutely must buy. The soundtrack is simply amazing, the layouts keep the challenge refreshing, and there is no reason anybody wouldn't like this game. It's simply that good.
3903	1	a	This is a brilliant game in art, and gameplay. Didn't really pay attention to the story, I should look into that. But GO BUY THIS GAME!!
3905	1	a	This one's a keeper! Fast-paced multiplayer steal-em-up!
3907	1	a	Shares some similarities with Payday 2, Hotline Miami, Minesweeper, and a whole lot of it's own thing. Nice graphics too (watch some videos, skip the pictures).
3909	1	a	Monaco is a great stealth game with a big mystery, as there are always 2 sides of the story, in this situation, they both are criminals. Let's get down to the pros and cons!  Pros * Mysterious and easy to follow story, which you can choose which to believe. +2 Story, +1 player choice * Fun characters, each with their wonderful mechanics. +3 Player Choice * Workshop support, where you can download any maps you want and play them! +1 Entertainment * Great multiplayer, with excellent replay-ability. +1 Multiplayer Cons * A bit glitchy. -1 Entertainment
3911	1	a	The saying 'Hitman meets Pac-Man' is somewhat accurate for this game.  You play as one of many robbers, each with their own special traits. From there, you sneak though the level, using your ability and stealth to pick up as much loot scattered around the level before getting your main prize and escaping.  While it can be played single player, co-op is much better. Instead of just one person with four lives, it can go up to four players, working together.
3913	1	a	Excellent when playing co op, less so when solo, but still a great romp nonetheless.
3915	1	a	Incredible, just looking out for some more friends to play with!
3917	1	a	Watch out for the guyy. he's gonna put you in jail
3919	1	a	I am gonna start by saying that I love heist games and this happens to be a 2D heist game. It has some advanced scripting, multiplayer is flawless and simple, and the controls are easy. The AI is not bad, it was challenging sneaking around guards and it gives you options on how to perform the heists you do. The graphics get a 5/5 (for 2D graphics), the gameplay is a solid 4/5, and the story is a 3.5/5. Overall this game is good and I recommend it and especially for the price that got it at. (Which was about $1.50)
3921	1	a	A very entertaining game with many hilarious possibilities happening. In short, I love it.
3923	1	a	A steal for its price, a must buy
3925	1	a	Such game. Many prison break. Very burglar. Wow.
3927	1	a	Definitely a decent game, made more fun if you can play it co-op. Keep in mind however, playing as newbies co-op is actually more difficult than solo as this is a stealth game with a few game mechanics that are quite subtle which you discover as you go.  I would recommend playing through a fair few levels before starting co-op. Once you get the mechanics down playing as a team is very rewarding as each character brings a special ability to the table.  With 4 players it can get a bit chaotic, I would say 2-3 is the sweet spot.
3929	1	a	Hackersaretooover-poweredforyoufriend. 10/10
3931	1	a	great game, totally recommended for playing.  this game is addicting !
3933	1	a	10000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
3935	1	a	great game i loved playing it a lot like payday and payday2
3937	1	a	Chaotic fun  Monaco is a 2D-top down, stealth game developed by Pocketwatch game. The premise of the game is simple. You and a your team are need to rob the area of specific treasure, which is found in the later levels of the stage, and then escape. The problem you have to face however are gaurds, dogs, lazers, helicopters etc which are trying to stop you. There are eight characters that you can play as which each have a unique trait, for instance the gentleman can disguise himself to avoid detection, while the locksmith can unlockdoors and vents the quickest.  In single player, there are four campaigns which tells the story of a group of thieves and the variest heists they commit. Each campaign has various levels to choose from and you unlock new leves and campaigns as you complete the previous ones. When you get killed in singleplayer, you switch to one of the other seven characters. When all your characters have died, the mission ends and you have to restart the level. The levels are well designed, having plenty of places to hide in such as vents and bushes and various routes to reach the objective. You can also find items/weapons such as shotguns,machine guns (which have limited ammo) to help deal with the gaurds as well as diguises, smoke bomb and health kits. The sound is fantastic, playing quiet music when stealth and panicky music when your alrms ring and your being chased by gaurds. The weapons sound good as well. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.   The multiplayer is where the game truely shines. You can play the campaign mission with up to seven other players. Each player chooses one of the eight roles available. When one of the players dies, they need to be revived by another player to continue playing and progress to the next stage of the level. Things get pretty fun and hilarious when alarms ring and you or another player are running around like headless chooks trying to hide from the gaurds who are chasing you down.  I highly recommend this game to players you love team based stealth games. 
3939	1	a	Maybe one of the funnest co-op games I've ever played. Haven't done much single-player so i don't know how that holds up, but if you can get two-three friends together Monaco is a GREAT time.
3941	1	a	Awesome game, great for the strategist or going in 'guns blazing'. Spent many hours on it and still not tired of it.
3943	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. Lockpicker is the best! Dem bones though...
3945	1	a	Get the four pack, it's like a six pack only it entails you sitting at a computer tugging at your scalp (you've torn out all your hair already) and screaming at your friends, rather than entailing that you exercise regularly.  10/10 Would reanimate my friend's dead corpse while hiding in a bush again.
3947	1	a	This game is tonnes of fun, better when with friends but it is playable by yourself.  If you can get a few friends for PVP or Story it is very good.
3949	1	a	Gameplay is simple, but fun and interesting. Also, good single player and co-op.
3951	1	a	OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO THIS GAME IS VERY' WORTH TO BUY !!
3953	1	a	the mole is just too good :P
3955	1	a	Most entertaining game in my library. Get some friends and play.
3957	1	a	So much fun and frustration while playing with friends, would def recommend to anyone 10/10 A+ would shrek again
3959	1	a	Simple but engaging gameplay. Harder than it looks. Great game
3961	1	a	10/10 GET ME THIS GAME OR I WILL DESTROY EVERY ONE.
3963	1	a	An absolutely fantastic game to play locally with 3 of your friends, though I can't quite get my head around why one of us was forced to use a keyboard and mouse rather than a 4th controller. The game's biggest strength is its simplicity; you get your choice of 4 characters (8 by the end) and each has one distinct function, with perhaps one other side function. You take your little team through numerous 3 or 4 level stages and try to steal as much stuff as you can, as fast as you can, while trying not to be seen. We were incredibly bad at it but still managed to finish the main campaign and have 12 hours of fun on a lazy Sunday doing it.  Also, you revive your teammates by pressing against their dead bodies while your character makes a bunch of slurping noises. Just saying.
3965	1	a	Hiding in Bushes Simulator 2015
3967	1	a	Stealthy
3969	1	a	quite an entertaining game need to be played with frineds
3971	1	a	A superb stealth game where half the fun is getting spotted and escaping your pursuers. Best played with friends in the same room so you can all yell at each other like lunatics  if  when everything gets chaotic!
3973	1	a	Such a gorgeous, brilliantly unique game. I love it.  (As always, ignore my play time as I play offline too often.)
3975	1	a	Awesome, funny. would recommend it to anyone who likes the style, genre or both :D
3977	1	a	Definitely reccomend this game.
3979	1	a	I stole everything!
3981	1	a	Ridiclously fun! 10/10
3983	1	a	Requires an amazing amount of teamwork and is challenging ,Worth a try
3985	1	a	Very unique. Very fun. Amazing co-op. Own it on many platforms and would buy on PS4 if available.
3987	1	a	fun game but it is more fun when you have friends playing with you.
3989	1	a	This game is perfect to sit down to and play with mates, you can spend hours running through levels with a shotgun, smashing and grabbing, or you can play stealthily and the game mechanic somehow almost completely changes. Its a must play if your a fan of games like Payday. The art style is incredibly simple yet unique and it really characterises the game into something I have never played before.  Definitly a 10/10 as long as you play with friends, playing singleplayer is okay but no way near as fun personally.
3991	1	a	Even Better than payday
3993	1	a	Great heist/stealth game, even the single player is fantastic
3995	1	a	Great Indie Game, it's like Payday if it were in the SNES Era :D
3997	1	a	10/10 Wonderful game. Really great with friends (lot of screaming involved) and by yourself (slightly less screaming).  To the bush!
3999	1	a	Hipster pacman.
4001	1	a	Great to play with friends! I fell in love with this game instantly, the controls and visuals were weird at first but I easily adjusted to them. If you're gonna buy this buy copies for your friends too!
4003	1	a	Amazing Game I've been Playing it for a While now, Nearly completed it but ITS STILL AMAZING! This game Is the Best game I have EVER Played.
4005	1	a	First of all I must admit that I didnt really like this game when it came free for a whole weekend. Manage to try it but didnt enjoy the game at all. It stayd dead for a while. Then Microsoft decide to give it for free on the xbox, so I was like yeah super awsome a sucky game! So i decided to give it a try, wasnt expeting anything at all except beeing bored playing it.... I was wrong, and happy to admit it. This game is original and a master piece in his kind! the gameplay is so simple but effective and playing multiplayer raise the bar even higher. I mean you can play up to 4 player, each of them beeing a different kind of class like pickpocket, cleaner, locksmith and a scout i think. Put all those togueter and you get an amazing teamplay. I would actualy recommend this game giving it a 7.8/10  The game is not perfect and it is not for everyone, but it is worth the try!
4007	1	a	Being a thief has never been more 8-bit!!! Truly an unbelievably fun games, with or with out friends!
4009	1	a	Steal stuff with friends
4011	1	a	One of the greatest multiplayer experiences i've had. Insanely fun to play with a couple of friends. Pick between several different characters all with different sets of skills. Find one that suits your play style and just watch the hours melt away.
4013	1	a	Monaco is the best Co-op expirience i have ever played. The singleplayer is all right and there is random online games, but to really get your money's worth, get some extra controllers, invite over your friends, and have a grand ol' time! Even if you don't have anyone to play with i would still recommend it, since it's definitely worth its price tag, but trust me, to truly expirience how great this old-fashioned heist-movie game is, you NEED to play with some friends by your side. 6/10 if you're alone, but an 8/10 with friends.
4015	1	a	Great, fun party game. If you want some awesome stealth and heist-themed gameplay but not the crazy, fast-paced, teamwork-is-essential gameplay like the Payday series, give this game a try.  Story: Main story is short, however there are other side missions that take place after the main game is completed, as well as custom missions you can find, adding replayability.  Gameplay: Emphasizes on stealth a lot, but not always required, so pick the character based on your play style and go to town. Enemies can overwhelm you rapidly but if you know what you're doing, you can get away reasonably quick.  Controls: Absolutely simple, with the theme of 'within reach.' Moving with WASD and using gadgets with the Spacebar or Left Mouse button? Couldn't get easier.  In all, very fun game that's easy to get into, with easy achievements for the new guy, to the hard ones for the hunter who wants it all.
4017	1	a	Freedom spoon, must play, fun, quick, adictive.
4019	1	a	Fun and cute game if you like being sneaky and grabby. This game definitely revolves around team work. You will learn quickly that communication is key and going in alone is not the best approach. Good pick up.
4021	1	a	this game is great in my opinion i think that the graphics and style are great 
4023	1	a	If you like peforming daring heists while avoiding contact with night guards, Then Monaco is the game for you. Trying to stay hidden is challenging, and if you're a noob like me, you're going to get caught. But once you do, it ads a whole layer of intense fun to this game. I recomend this game to anyone who likes heists and keping quiet.
4025	1	a	Monaco manages to give the feels of a good Esport, which is what is is, albeit in co op form. Can a strictly coop focused game be an esport? can it have a coloful and unique story inspired by classic heist films and retro 80's gaming alike? Monaco is the ultimate coop heist simulator, forget payday 2. The wildy different characters all have interesting backgrounds and more importantly their skills are essential for working together to complete each heists. A great scoring system gives it amazing replayability. Monaco is a game that teaches me new things about it's mechanics every time I play, it's nuanced design has so much buried under it's neon noir 80's gaming style and it looks gorgous while it showcases it's depth. The split screen function will get a lot of use in this household, as Monaco is also quite acessable. I had good times with a work buddy and a 5 year old guest alike, Reccomeded for pretty much anybody with a passing interest in coop gaming.
4027	1	a	enjoyable game play.  simple story, but some how i cant play with my controler :( 
4029	1	a	A criminal amount of fun with friends.
4031	1	a	This is one of the most fun co-op games, but the keyword here is cooperative. When you sucessfully pull one piece of the heist and you clean out any level with your best friends, I genuinely believe that's one of the best feelings I've had in awhile. Also: Hacker is a little too much fun. Go buy this, it's on sale -- I think. And even if it isn't, it will be eventually.
4033	1	a	What happens when you couple a formula for the perfect heist thriller with gameplay found in staple arcade games? You get Monaco: What's Your Is Mine.  All of the key players are here, the game allowing you to play as one of eight unique character classes. The Locksmith is a master at unlocking - duh. The Lookout can see things that are outside the normal point-of-view, The Pickpocket has a monkey companion that will assist in collecting loot, The Cleaner can take out guards from behind, The Mole can devestate through certain obstacles with ease, The Gentlemen is a master of disguise, The Hacker can disrupt electronics from anywhere a socket is available, and the Redhead is a charmer able to coerce anyone that might be on to her.  The controls are very simple, you move, and certain objects can be interacted with simply by moving into them, such as picking a lock or slipping through the windows, or crawling your way through the ventaliation system. There is a sneak button and another button that allows you to use the gear you may be carrying.  The numerous stages featured in Monaco, which cover everything from casinos to caverns are riddled with security cameras and guards on patrol to keep you from reaching your goal. Fortunately there are numerous tactics you can use to approach your goal, stealth being the key in this title; perhaps moving through the shadows being left unseen is the best method? Or perhaps you're feeling bold and want to distract the guards using a smoke bomb here and there. Or do you prefer to wear a disguise and move freely incognito? Sounds like fun, right?  Between these unique characters, their special abilities and the gear, this game offers variety.  The visuals are appealing; bright colorful pixels fill in detailed reproductions of landmarks across the city in this French Riviera. The contrast between the grayscaled unseen and the bright enviornment make a stunning effect.  You should think about purchasing this one. It's definitely fun with other players, especially friends - and a means to communicate of course, or feel free to escape these tunnels and constructs alone, the choice is yours.
4035	1	a	Fun with friends - be sure to buy the 4-pack! This game is definitely more engaging with company.
4037	1	a	It's a top down steath coop game. Something I would recommend for people who like steath and team work, rather then run and gun action.  each player can choose a class, all ahve their own special ability and running speed. you need to use their ability to get an advantage over obsticals. the game doesn't really allow you to to kill anyone unless you have a gun which you don't get much bullets in them and the only way to get more ammo for guns or anything you have equiped, you have to loot 10 things. Killing is not the objective, but stething and keeping the chaos at a minimum is the theme of the game. You want to be decreat is posible.  This game gets a 5 out of 5 for what it does. It does everything well
4039	1	a	eh it was ok not amazing but pretty good
4041	1	a	This game is totally worth the money. The gameplay is unique and refreshing. The graphics/art style stand out and looks very nice. The soundtrack is ear-melting and catchy. The different game modes, time trial/ score run and characters add a lot of reasons to replay every last drop of content this game has to offer. Plus, there's custom user-made content to try if for some reason you get bored with the regular game. This game definitely deserves a lot more recognition than it's getting.
4043	1	a	simply addicting game! Oi, not so simple, but godamn fun! Buy it or u will cry miss this awesome game! 354/10
4045	1	a	Good game. Perfect. Just.. Dont do this in real life kids.
4047	1	a	What's yours is mine and monaco is mine.
4049	1	a	Cool game to play with your friends
4051	1	a	Great multiplayer game and loads of fun. Really easy to pick up on immediately and the characters personality makes the game shine in terms of story. Wouldn't pay $15 for it, but a total steal for $1.34
4053	1	a	Really fun with friends, best spent 1 key in my life.
4055	1	a	A hell of a game for the intuitive and the observant. This game boasts nerve-racking single-player campaign and multi-player chaos for up to 4 people! A genuine must play for the sneak and greedy people!
4057	1	a	A blast to play co-op. Works best over LAN- or netplay, but okay with local co-op too, especially if you stick closer to each other/have a good monitor. Given time, I will sink many more hours into this, and any fan of a good top-down puzzle shooter I'm sure will do the same!
4059	1	a	The game play is challening and rewarding. You'd think there'd be an urge to race to the end but the it's quite fun to challenge yourself and try to 'steal' as much moolah as possible. The co-op play can turn pretty hectic.
4061	1	a	Fun multiplayer stealth.
4063	1	a	Man do I love this game. Like a murderous French femme fatale/magnificent scoundrel stealth version of Pac-man, with pixelated guns and guts, seduction and betrayal (i.e. co-op play). Gameplay is fun and even full-blown team wipe losses are entertaining. The more advanced levels suffer from elite multiplayer syndrome--forget about finishing with random teammates without coordination.  Someday I'll know the levels well enough to respectably finish the higher levels. Future Retired Me will have time to learn all the guard walking patterns, by which point I hope to still have the vision, reflexes, and backwards compatibility to play the game. You younguns should take advantage of the Matrix and play it now!
4065	1	a	This is easily one of the best games I've played. And, I've played lots!  There really is something magical about it.  Don't hesitate to give this your money and your time.
4067	1	a	A better heist simulator than Payday, if you ask me. There are multiple ways to approach a problem, and the different levels never get repetitive. Fantastic colorful graphics, and one of the best soundtracks.
4069	1	a	If you're looking for a fun game to play with friends and while you're on your own than this is the game. It doesn't take very long to get used to the controls and when you do you'll be happy that you bought the game. The heists are very entertaining although there aren't a lot of them but there's no reason to worry because there are community made maps. There are multiple ways to complete the heists and multiple awards to go along with each one, so needless to say you can easily find yourself playing this game for hours on end. Overall great game, extremely fun to play with friends and well worth the money.
4071	1	a	Best co-op game forever
4073	1	a	It's tricky, frustrating and so much fun! xD Perfect game to play with your friends!
4075	1	a	Cant recommend this more, 9 out of 10, if you like Hotline Miami, youll probably go for this as well.
4077	1	a	In The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 20 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scheme that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden.  Overall: 9/10 its okay  Review paid for by: Amazon
4079	1	a	crazy insane co-op action, definately buy the four pack get some friends together and enjoy
4081	1	a	Fun game; can get tricky with more than 3 people
4083	1	a	This is a really fun stealthy grab everything topdown with sight line game, and if your friends play it, it's even better.
4085	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, what an interesting game, the combat system is slightly damaged, however the AI are incredibly intelligent - Whatever You do, they sense that there is perculiar behaviour. Monaco is a very clever Heist Simulation Game, with different classes to choose from - Ranging in abilities to give Heists different approaches which I extremely enjoyed. Although, Monaco has a downside, there are limited Heists and after playing for a while - The Game just gets tedious. I incredibly enjoyed the filters avaliable in Monaco - Such as the Zombie Mode (Zonaco) and Classic style Monaco. Overall, a great game, definately worth the small sum that this game is avaliable for. Also, take note that this Game is frequently on the Steam Specials for even lower prices.
4087	1	a	I approve. I love the tiny download sizes. I love talking to people and telling them not to screw it up. I love the chaos they create when they ignore it. And you can p*** in the toilets.
4089	1	a	Great game
4091	1	a	Buy this game now
4093	1	a	Its a good game, but if you play with your friends you will end up killing them
4095	1	a	Enjoyable graphics and gameplay, and it's a blast to play with friends. I found it boring while playing solo, so wait for a sale, buy a four-pack, and guilt your friends in to playing it with you.  Side note: Purchasing this through the Humble Store comes with a Steam key and DRM-free version of the game.
4097	1	a	One of the best co-op games I have ever played.
4099	1	a	I CANT EVEN TELL WHAT IM LOOKING AT WHILE I PLAY  THIS GAME IS EYE STRAIN SIMULATOR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  fun tho
4101	1	a	7/10 Overall Monaco was a highly enjoyable coop top down stealth game. This game blew my expectations sky high as the combat, soundtrack, and graphics blew me away. This is a sturdy game for all to enjoy.
4103	1	a	It's a cool game that works perfectly both playing on your own and with some friends.  The single player experience is really fun and invites you to try to beat the levels with all the different characters - depending who you choose to play as the experience will change but at least on most of the levels it will always feel fair too.  Multiplayer, at least with a group of friends, is an even more fun, sometimes chaotic beast - not that this is a bad thing.  Great music, great visuals (although they might be a bit confusing at first) and artistic direction... A great game indeed
4105	1	a	Monaco is a neon-blooded marriage of Pac-Man and Thief, a grand tribute both to 1920s silent comedy capers and to modern-day heist movies. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Keystone Cops, played out top-down in a world of living blueprints. It's a criminal take on Laurel and Hardy, except with a four-man band instead of the dysfunctional duo. By and large, Monaco is one of those rare games that somehow stay magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right or your mission has turned into an eight-lane car crash.  'Monaco stays magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right.' And crashes of the non-software-related variety will happen in abundance. With Monaco's minimal approach to player guidance, the only way you're going to figure anything out is through trial and disaster. Have a Hacker (one of the game's many playable characters) interact with a power outlet and watch as sensors go out and security cameras turn friendly. Walk across a red panel and discover that there are, indeed, pressure plates connected to the security system.  The missions are all performed to a similar tune: get in, get the prize, get out. Or, in some instances, simply get out. You start in a safe area of the level, surrounded by items that you can take along with you. Once you've selected your weapon (or non-combat item of choice), it is your prerogative to determine what 'getting in' will actually entail. Do you cut through a queue at the local nightclub or do you sneak through a locked door on the other side? Though all the levels operate in largely the same way, there's sufficient diversity in the contents of each to make every playthrough outright enthralling. Should you circle around the main area of the map and inch towards the safe on the third floor, or do you take a quick detour through the guard-infested inventory room? (Hint: don't do that second one.) Your choice, your years behind bars, monsieur.
4107	1	a	Brilliant game to play with friends although it causes more arguments than teamwork!
4109	1	a	This has to be one of the most fun multiplayer games I've ever played! And teamwork is KEY.
4111	1	a	I really enjoy playing this game.
4113	1	a	Pretty fun if you know what your doing but not if u don't.I like how u can hide and be super sneaky and alot of other crap that would take me a while to list.
4115	1	a	Don't try playing this on your own. You need friends to revive you (a lot) and show you where to run (all the time) and save your butt from guards, dogs, lasers and knockout darts (heaps). On the downside they usually insult you as you're struggling to remember which way to run next. I mean the friends insult you, not the guards, the dogs, the lasers or the knockout darts.
4117	1	a	Better than I expected.
4119	1	a	This is probally the dankest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive played in a year I literally flew from my chair and became god -IGN 10/10
4121	1	a	10/10
4123	1	a	I love this game. The game is about being a thief. There are multiple types of characters each with their own playing style. Soooo much fun. The music adds to the gameplay. Definetly playing this with family. It is one of the few games on PC with local multiplayer. Personally, 10/10.
4125	1	a	This game is all about the multiplayer. Oceans 11 wouldn't have been as fun if it was just Ocean's 1. Pulling off the perfect caper with your team is truly fun.
4127	1	a	One of the best sealth co-op games around, with hilarous results!!
4129	1	a	This game is fun with friends, not so much without. The best thing about this game is content never runs out. You have workshopand a bunch of regular missions.
4131	1	a	I highly recommend this game. Monaco is about a bunch of crooks and thieves breaking out of jail and getting to safety. The art style is awesome and it gets even better when you have 3 friends to play with. You can also play 4 player local which i think is awesome!!!
4133	1	a	~~~
4135	1	a	Excited! An interesting game with friends.
4137	1	a	its its really sad to buy this for a friend and never play it with them or anybody else but still 10/10 just make sure you have a group of friends to play with
4139	1	a	I would definitely reccomend getting a group of friends together to play this game  PROS: +Decent visuals, easy to distinguish things on screen +Gameplay that never gets stale, plenty of different ways to take on each stage  8.5/10
4141	1	a	Great game with awesome music and gameplay. Probably one of the best Indie-games I've played this year.
4143	1	a	Its great fun if you have friends to play it with... If you have friends to play it with
4145	1	a	This little gem was well worth the price for hours of co-op mayhem. Great stealth action with lots of tactical choices to make when played with others. The solo experience is severely lacking. Do not judge the game if you've only played it alone. The more players involved the more complex the plans you can hatch.
4147	1	a	This is a really good game, it's basic, has basic controls, has interesting levels and charactors, and has a solid goal for each level. Honestly, I can't find anything about this game that is bad.   My cousin introduced it to me to Monaco and I'm glad he did. Over all, it's a great game and fun to play with friends. I think Monaco is great for anyone and will enjoy this game.
4149	1	a	This game doesn't get me excited so much, the game mechanics are good, you can decide depending on the character you've selected how you want to play the game, action or stealth approach, but from this point of view the game doesn't excels in neither of those two types, the soundtrack is appropriate for the game and it is very good, as for the graphics, i find the environments well done but i dislike how they have made all the characters like caricatures, i would have liked more the pixels style, like Hotline Miami;  it's more like a personal review but i don't recommend to buy this game at full price.
4151	1	a	Probably one of the most fun games I've ever played with a friend, period.
4153	1	a	The game is simple to learn, but don't let it's retro graphics decieve you, it has a huge depth to master, and produces exciting spy movie moments on the fly.
4155	1	a	I like the game and its mechanics, seriously. but all fans of the game will agree with me when I say they were expecting a better art style. the flashy neon colours are cool enough but all players appear to be fat, hunkering lumps. the games also a tad expensive. Still, a great game
4157	1	a	Great Game
4159	1	a	Initially I put off playing this one because I figured I knew what it was already. And while my guess wasn't too far off, it didn't account for just how much fun it would be. You get to play as one of a number of different criminal roles (locksmith, mole, lookout, etc.) as you attempt heists, prison breakouts, etc. In a way, it almost feels like a multiplayer version of Bonanza Bros, which not a whole lot of people probably remember. Definitely fun and way more fun when playing multiplayer.
4161	1	a	This game is a lot of fun to play with friends! I had it on my Xbox 360 and played it a ton with my brother.  The item pickups and character abilities are cool. The levels are interesting and pretty challenging later on. The art style and music make the game more fun and intense.  I recommend adding this game to your wishlist and that you and a friend buy it during a good sale!
4163	1	a	Another game that I love
4165	1	a	it is like playing payday but in casual way..at least you still can steal stuff
4167	1	a	Bought on recommendation from a friend. So much fun to play! I mainly play online because by myself is a little boring but once you're in a team and chatting away it's a lot of fun.
4169	1	a	 Monaco  is a top-down stealth/action game. I had a lot of fun with it, but it can be boring under the wrong circumstances.  tl;dr: this is a top-down tactical stealth game, it's by far the most fun with a friend in 2-player mode, and you should experiment with different characters.   Single-player runs are a bit too predictable and straightforward, and every mission will feel just like more of the same thing. Multiplayer is much more interesting - it's moments like sneaking in to steal the treasure while a friend stands guard and another hacks the security, or splitting up to clean out an entire floor within a minute, that make this game worth playing. On the other hand, groups of too many (inexperienced) players are likely to get in each others' way and spend too much time being discovered to get anything done. Two coordinated, voice-chatting players are the best for combining your characters' abilities successfully and pulling off your own strategy together. On the other hand: While smooth and coordinated runs are very satisfying, it can also be fun to treat Monaco as a party game and frantically stumble through a level with four players and swarms of guards behind you.  The graphics are stylish, unique and do their purpose, but a bit taxing on the eyes and take a while to get used to. The music fits the heist setting, but there's not enough of it. The story also helps to set the mood, and while it's not  important , I'm glad that it's there because it gives the missions context.  Stealing money slowly grants you additional tool uses/ammunition, so raiding optional rooms is actually rewarded within missions and it can be advantageous to do so and e. g. gather additional EMP charges before taking on the main vault's motion detectors. This means that while skilled maneuvering is still a focal point, threat assessment and careful planning are just as essential. While the core stealth gameplay always remains similar, the 8 characters' special abilities have a huge influence on which path and approach you can take to beating the level. One team may allow you to tunnel towards the objective past a large portion of the treasure and just run past the guards that remain in your way, while another one relies on luring them one by one and knocking them out so no one's even awake to answer the alarm. Monaco is fairly forgiving for a stealth game - getting detected early on hardly ever means having to restart a level in advance. It does get kind of boring how easily you can disperse attention by crawling into ventilation ducts and waiting.  The normal price is a bit high because the game only shines if you buy a second copy for a friend, but I very highly recommend buying this when it's on sale if you're into strategic, sometimes chaotic co-op action.
4171	1	a	Engaging storyline? Check.  Great gameplay? Check.  Fun as hell multiplayer? Check.  Having a monkey that steals loot for you? Check and mate.  Monaco is one of those games that I could probably go back to whenever I feel down. It's a game that offers an interesting approach to the classic bank heist genre. Highly recommended for anyone that loves the best Indie has to offer.
4173	1	a	Great game. That's all it is. Great game.
4175	1	a	So much fun when playing with 4 player local koop!!!!  Use controllers.
4177	1	a	Best played with 3 friends. This game is all about cooperation and strategy, if anything. Totally recommended.
4179	1	a	very simple 2d platformer. but yet very fun and quick for before work or school
4181	1	a	Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic. The multiplayer is where it especially excels. The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level. All of this with an excellent musical backing. Watch some co-op here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oTlS5wQG0cuqhlYsE7mY0z 
4183	1	a	I wish i had more people to play this with!
4185	1	a	Its great with ranch.
4187	1	a	This is a very comical game with face-paced action and multiplayer. My favorite character is the PickPocket because hey, who doesn't love money and a pet monkey who steals money from people's pockets?!? The best part of the game is the soundtrack. IT IS ALL ON PIANO AND IT IS MORE BRILLIANT THAN FUC***G MOZART!!! :D
4189	1	a	A humorous top-down 8-bit esque game involving hours of entertainment. The accents that the civilians and guards have is highly amusing and the gameplay is at first glance simple but becomes increasingly complex as each character plays in different ways and the complexity only goes up as you play with more people in different combinations trying to get the highest score. The gameplay can switch back and forth between frantic flight from the police to stealthy guard knockouts within less than a minute and at no point in the game will you not feel challenged. A good game for yourself, a great game for friends.
4191	1	a	Monaco is a great game that follows a group of thieves breaking out of prison. But it gets more complex. You have to be stealth, strategic, and above all, you have to work with your team. This is definetely more fun with friends!
4193	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
4195	1	a	Normally i don't like top-down games, and games that involve an enemy sight radius, but Monaco puts together stealth aspects and multiple mechnics of this interesting game to put together a great crime/stealth game. Working together to collectively plan out and co-ordinate a heist is not easy, and if you're not a fan of Payday's FPS or messy style of heist, this game offers complete opposite, where getting detected is not recommended and getting through the entire level undetected is possible. Especially with friends you know and through voice chat, co-ordinating you're movements together and having loads of fun. Just a awesome co-op experience overall
4197	1	a	I rarely complain about graphics but it should be stated that the first 30mins of this game will be used to figure out which smudge is your character. It is best to learn that fast becase as the game goes on it quickly can become crazy with all that might be going on.  Monaco is a stealth based game first, coop second. This means while thugging it with a heavy hitting team will breed success early on, it can quickly fall apart on higher difficulties if the team doesn't know what they are doing, and with the games drop in style play you'll often run into the latter unless you host private games with friends.  The Online at the time I played was an utter mess with people trying to FREEDOM SPOON through everything and quitting when it didn't work. The Mole however is still a top tier character for higher difficulties its just it often ends up in the hands of the unskilled player so it gets a bad rap.  In all this a great game with friends and frustrating one with randoms. I reccomend this game.
4199	1	a	i think this game is good it fun and its a type of sneking game you need to hide much and not draw attention to youre self thats the best part of the game 
4201	1	a	Cooles Coop Game
4203	1	a	Great fun, but like every game, better with friends.
4205	1	a	Stylish heist-planning game with a lot of replay-ability. BEST PLAYED WITH YOUR FRIENDS!
4207	1	a	very nice game... creative design and story
4209	1	a	The story and writing for Monaco were both charming and cute, and I was a fan of the art style. Although the bright colors and cluttered maps seemed overwhelmingly distracting, I became more accustomed to navigating through new levels over time. Hilarity always ensued when playing with friends. I exclusively played with friends only, and found it more fun when played at a LAN party.
4211	1	a	One of the best games I've bought from steam. And I bought this for 1,40â‚¬ from summer sale!
4213	1	a	this game oozes class, best co-op in ages - pure and simple fun if you have taste please buy this and support the devs
4215	1	a	Amazing heist game with high replayability value. Would totally buy.
4217	1	a	I have purchased this game 3 times now - once on the Xbox, and twice on Steam (I bought a copy for a friend). All in all, I've put many hours into this game and loved every minute of it. There are very few multiplayer experiences as unique, challenging, addictive, and flat-out fun as Monaco. It's simply a wonderful game that will test the limits of your creativity and teamwork.
4219	1	a	I cannot believe that I'm the only person among my friends who picked this up. You guys are missing out on some seriously fun coop action. This game is way too much fun.
4221	1	a	Monaco is a stealth heist game that has a fairly unique design. You go on missions with 1 of 8 specialists, with a simple objective of robbing Monoco's biggest stockpiles of cash. Each individual you may take on the mission impacts how the game works; with a listed big effect such as 'creates disguise for self' or 'Knocks out a guard on successful sneak', and a minor bonus like 'climbs into vents faster'. Most of these are very well designed and fit together surprizingly well. If the stealth elements fail, it's a problem, but doesn't kill the mission. You will eventually reset. Completing this with my group we often called that 'Crime Time!' Speaking of the group mechanic, get yourself some erliable, patient playmates for best results. This is a great game for cooperative multiplayer.  You can get through the whole first story without an impressive amount of patience or even mastery of mechanics. After that though, the game is going to kick you in the pants untill you learn the fundamental rules of stealth, for they are far more powerful than collected items and individual abilities.  The stories are very interesting. I found myslf wanting to keep going no matter how difficult because of the story. The sound track is fairly satisfying as well. All around reccomend.
4223	1	a	Heaps of fun if you are looking for a light, casual game to play with your friends.   
4225	1	a	Love this game. The controls are so simple that anybody can pick up and play it without much difficulty. But the gameplay isnt lacking due to it's simplicity, as a little cooperation is key to success. Whether you're just playing with your best friend, or your whole gang, this game is greatly worth it. The story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and (without giving too much away) is told from more than one perspective of the characters that you play as. So there's a little for everyone to enjoy. Story. Gameplay. Simplistic. Fun. 9.5/10 Highly recommended.
4227	1	a	Awesome game  +Playable with 3 friends (good for LANs) +Any Character combination is useful +Skipable Text +Level Editor +Can be played for 5 minutes or 5 hours and be still fun  -Guards seem dumb as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
4229	1	a	fast paced game similar to risk of rain or hotline miami
4231	1	a	MGS: Multiplayer Edition
4233	1	a	Fun with friends~
4235	1	a	Fun game to play with your friends. 4 playable characters type. Trying to steal stuff while making it out alive. :)
4237	1	a	I remember my Nintendo and Sega Genesis games - 90% of them had the option to play co-op (Player 2 PRESS START!!!). Now, if you want a co-op game, you have to search - and that's very sad.  So, if you're looking for a co-op game - you can easily grab this. It will soothe all your co-op needs.
4239	1	a	Aight
4241	1	a	i can't get this game to run for me 0/10  edit: now that this game runs for me it's an okay game so 2/10
4243	1	a	Fun local multiplayer, but I hadnt the courage to play online.
4245	1	a	Incredible Fun! Excellent Co-Op action in a fun Retro style.
4247	1	a	Someone bought this for me during a sale and I have to say that I didn't expect to enjoy it. But I did. The game itself is great; I love the art style and the way that the whole thing feels. But the thing that made it for me is the soundtrack. This Ragtime-French-Criminal style of music fits so well with every level and I adored every note of it. Fantastic.
4249	1	a	It's fun, just a bit tricky.
4251	1	a	i have no idea what to type here.
4253	1	a	I love this game! 10/10
4255	1	a	TURNS INTO SKELETON. Friends perform ground breaking surgery to bring me back alive in 5 secs. 5/7 would resurrect again
4257	1	a	To state one thing clear: I have owned this game now for about 5 hours and have not seen every aspect of the game in its full depth, but from what I've seen so far I can say, that this game knows how coop functions and is with friends great fun. Its gameplay as well as the artstyle and sound are smooth, funny and simply beautiful.  Especially for the sale price really worth it.
4259	1	a	Beautiful game. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who likes caual atmospheric games!
4261	1	a	There is a hidden dinosaur following you.
4263	1	a	Fun and cheap, lots of game modes and local coop - what else could you ask for?
4265	1	a	This game allows me to steal money and murder people, both legally.   If you've ever had terrible urges to do these things but don't fancy serving multiple sentences in prison, go ahead and buy Monaco.   Your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will thank you later.
4267	1	a	Great game fun solo better with friends. Not for people interested in story it's all about gameplay with a choice of just rushing it or being a stealthy ninja.
4269	1	a	Very fun stealth game
4271	1	a	10/10 you can stealth
4273	1	a	My favorite parts of the game were digging and shooting people in multiplayer.  WE DIG DIG DIG DIG dig dig dig dig dig THATS WHAT WE LIKE TO DO  WE DIG DIG DIG DIG dig dig dig dig dig THATS WHAT WE LIKE to do  WHITE GIRLS  WHITE GIRLS  looking at looking at looking at me  WHITE GIRLS  WHITE GIRLS  
4275	1	a	Great game to play with friends
4277	1	a	Amazing game. Most fun I've had in a long while. Buy it, especially if its on sale. Worth every penny. 10/10
4279	1	a	Good fun multiplayer gameplay, new aspects to the gaming world, 8/10
4281	1	a	piano soundtrack is YES!
4283	1	a	Very neat design highly recommended
4285	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
4287	1	a	It's a brilliant game when all your teammates just follow the plan and go steatlh. But sometimes situation goes FUBAR and game feels absolutely fantastic: colourful mess, total chaos and desperate attempts to get your s**t together. I hate co-op games but this gem is totally worth to buy 
4289	1	a	It's a great game especially for the price Friends I have two copies if you want. Only downside is you have to play with other people. You're supposed to have 4 but 3 would do.
4291	1	a	pimp co-op, redhead is BANGIN, highly recommend.
4293	1	a	Fun game for those heist type people!
4295	1	a	Monaco will test your skill in timing, planning and hiding as fast as you can. Teamplay is highly encouraged as different classes bring variety to the gameplay. The campaign is plenty long and will not disappoint. And if you're one to collect every last coin, you will definitely be in for a challenge.
4297	1	a	I love this game but can never get 3 people to play!
4299	1	a	So ggod, needs more people though
4301	1	a	This game is very good. I originaly played it on xbox 360, and was instantly hooked. It was very well made, good for almost every kind of player.
4303	1	a	This is a really great game. One of my favourite games of all time. It has Workshop and a big community, but sometimes there is hardly anyone online.
4305	1	a	Its great because you can choose how you want to play: Do you want nobody to notice you? Do you want to finish the level as fast as Sanic? well you can... Infact you can be sanic and be stealthy.
4307	1	a	Good multiplayer, interesting concept, and the most important, FUN!
4309	1	a	One of the best co-op games I've played. It can get really challenging, so try not to rage on your team too hard!!
4311	1	a	Great multiplayer antics!
4313	1	a	Fun multiplayer stealth.
4315	1	a	Really fun with friends, best spent 1 key in my life.
4317	1	a	Monaco is best played as a co-op stealth get-as-much-loot-as-you-can game, but could also be played Solo.  It is one of those games where it is easy to learn, but very difficult to master and compete for the top score, but that doesn't matter as long as you get your loot and survive; and more importantly, have fun for yourself.  Playing as one of the 8 characters, each with their own specialty to either assist themselves or their co-op buddies navigate the security-enforced levels. Each character will have their own traits that will be particularly useful in each level or your allies. Up to you how you want to plan your mission.  It's rather slow at the start, and rather easy (you could just break in and alert everything without a problem). However, in the later levels, the security is amped rather heavily and the loot is protected even more.  I would highly recommend it if you have a few buddies looking for some insanity in the later levels where it takes either patience and planning, or 'balls-deep run-n-gun get-out-of-my-way crime-time we-out' kind of style.   If you're looking for a solo-game; then it may or may not be your cup of tea.
4319	1	a	Great fun solo or co-op. Become a team of field experts and take it all. good story and level progression.
4321	1	a	This is an amazing game - the retro feel makes it that much enjoyable with the wide array of characters. Whether playing with friends, or solo, it's a great game all around.
4323	1	a	Game has some sweet music and gameplay, can recommend playing it with at least one friend.
4325	1	a	A nice casual stealth like game that is always there to help cut off the edge from your normal day. I highly recommend that you buy this game, it offers multiplayer with up to you and 3 other players, (Friends not included). But regardless you play it either alone or with friends its a hell of alot of fun to play.
4327	1	a	A very well crafted and enjoyable multiplayer game.  Can be enjoyed with friends online or locally in a party environment and something I still can't help but return to from time to time.  If you enjoy light-hearted stealth with well crafted classes and a decent plot that you can pick up and put down whenever, look no further.  It has decent sale prices all the time and Steam Workshop support too!
4329	1	a	This is an awesome game. The gameplay is challanging in many different ways and each level has a great degree of replayability. The different classes change the way of how to approach the given tasks. But not only the way how you play the game is unique, the aestetic is as well. The artstyle is great, the music and the rare voicesamples in french reminds the player of old heist films. Coop allows to finish the stages with friends or random players, the workshop support and the level-editor allows to create levels and share them or just play user created content. Everyone who is on the search for a nongeneric AAA-game should take a look at it, it's worth the price.  TLTR: Awesome game, buy it.
4331	1	a	seemed pretty cool if you have a squad to co-op it up with
4333	1	a	'This isn't hotline miami, put down the gun you idiot' You and your idiot sidekick rob a bank. What can go wrong? - you say after reviving him over and over again.
4335	1	a	Monaco is a very interesting take on a stealth game (Unless you're one of those people who just run throught stealth sections like nothing). It's hard to describe, but the gameplay is pretty darn fun. The soundtrack is wonderful, as well.
4337	1	a	Awesome coop game. Gather your friends and steal the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the places. What to say more. Enjoy! ;)
4339	1	a	9/10 Perhaps the best co-op multiplayer, where every member relies on each other yet is integral to how smooth the heist goes. Loads of player-created maps, as well as enhanced and zombie mode for every flavor of the game It's simple. Simpe and effective, with how you get and use items, yet each little nuance refines your skills. Loads of fun to speed run or be super stealthy  Negatives? A few times playing online the whole floor map appears and locks me in, so I had to make or find a new room to play. When everyone spreads out things can get reaally small, while already detailed--but to each their own, this is little problem to me. I'd recommend this game to anyone
4341	1	a	6/10-A great experience but get it in a sale
4343	1	a	I read loads of peoples comments about this game saying it was class but it plays best with people you know, I was put off paying Â£12 for it because of graphics but when it was in one of the bundles at  www.humblebundle.com  I grabbed it &amp; i can say now after playing that it wort tenner &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't always need fancy graphics and blood to make a great game !
4345	1	a	Fun addictive game, great to play with other people.
4347	1	a	Really addicting!
4349	1	a	Its just so much fun to play &lt;3
4351	1	a	I absolutely adore the stealth mechanics in this game, I haven't this much fun being a sneaky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a long time.
4353	1	a	Finish thief game I've played. Its easy to pick up and gets intense instantly. It'll steal your hours away. Be sure to play with friends! That's were the fun is
4355	1	a	Mad fun! Many jokes and great action to play with friends. Recommended.
4357	1	a	Awesome game. I don't much care for trying to aim with my trackpad, but maybe next time I will hook up my 360 controller to do this game
4359	1	a	One of the best games of 2013! To best it good friends and some skill is required.
4361	1	a	Got this game as a gift from my friend during the winter sale. Played it together and I must say it was very fun. The first few levels are quite easy, but it gets harder pretty fast (or me and my friends just suck at coordinating). Have only played a few hours so far, but will probably spend many hours playing this with my friends.
4363	1	a	Love this game. Best played with friends, but mostly oldschool arcade fun.
4365	1	a	Fun with friends.
4367	1	a	One hell of a fun game that can turn into a chaotic disaster if done without teamplay!  exactly what i was looking for :)
4369	1	a	Monaco is a whismical, colorfully violent game. It boasts an intriguing story, one-of-a-kind art direction and soundtrack, and the kind of cooperative gameplay and mechanics we haven't seen since Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. It improves on that formula in almost every aspect, bringing true cooperation to the modern era outside of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Every character has their own distincy personality, color and playstyle, and it's super fun to figure out which one would be best for each encounter. A single round can turn from meticulous planning to outright chaos in seconds, and no matter how you play, it's just a blast. And what's even cooler, is that the community is the most civil I've ever seen. Perhaps it's the lack of a competitive element, or how it's impossible to do well solo, but people just love this game, and are super cool about who plays as who.   TL;DR: BUY THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME.
4371	1	a	This game's the most fun when you get a team of four competent players working together. Try it out with friends.
4373	1	a	If you like the idea of the perfectly executed heist, you will love this game. Play with a few tight friends, and you will feel like a bad-â™¥â™¥â™¥ (or get your â™¥â™¥â™¥ kicked). Either way, it's a solid game.
4375	1	a	If this was a potato it would be a good potato
4377	1	a	If you like old school graphics, and a cat/mouse type game, then this is for you. Id say 7/10 ... Not bad, can be a bit hectic.
4379	1	a	'I AM THE MOLE.'
4381	1	a	Stylish and very atmospheric indie heist game. Very very cool.
4383	1	a	BEST GAME 
4385	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Super fun heist-y game. Fun to play with friends. The different people that you can play as keeps it interesting. Highly recommend.
4387	1	a	This game is insanely fun as, especially when playing with friends, as you try to escape Monaco with all the money trophism and without being seen (hopefully).  Overall, Monaco offers a great experience!
4389	1	a	Would only recommend if you've got friends, probably would kill myself if I played solo.
4391	1	a	Its good fun with friends for the price you pay
4393	1	a	co-op is the best. THE BEST.
4395	1	a	The game is good, mainly for multiplayer. The only real downside is that it doens't have Jean Claude Van Damme as an extra character grabbing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and stuff.
4397	1	a	A high octane, visually pleasing, pixel crime adventure. A game that is most enjoyed with groups of friends.
4399	1	a	Interesting heist game that is best played with friends. Multiple heist characters to choose from and stealth is essential in the game. You can't expect to run through and entire room without guards noticing you. Line of sight is especially important as you can lose your pursuers by hiding in a room or behind a pillar. It takes some time to get used to the top down view though, some stuff can get cluttered and new players i've noticed kept getting lost.  All in all its fun and i recommend you get it if you don't mind Bit-styled teamwork.
4401	1	a	I really love this game How you must play through different condition But, I recommend to play this game online Because there are so many things you can do more than just play alone  So don't be hesitate, buy and play this game Regards  Kirik-Kirik
4403	1	a	very cool :P
4405	1	a	Simple game but great to play with friends.
4407	1	a	It was awesome! 
4409	1	a	Very entertaining and not difficult to just pick up and run with.
4411	1	a	It's a great game especially for the price Friends I have two copies if you want. Only downside is you have to play with other people. You're supposed to have 4 but 3 would do.
4413	1	a	Such game Much enjoy Very Monaco Omg Wow.
4415	1	a	Got this on sale for 1.50, a LOT of content for such a seemingly simple game. Multiplayer is great fun but haven't played it alone.
4417	1	a	What an awesome game. Pac-Man on steroids. Run around gathering coins using different class characters. They are all evenly balanced to allow you to be proficient at clearing certain obstacles ... and if you catch a semi decent online team it gets to be alot of fun.  Full controller support too is great. I could play this game on my 360 pad for hours! Now if i could just get touch support on my surface for it ... its a perfect tablet game otherwise.  Also, I hadn't tried it just yet, but the game appears to have a built in mission/map editor where you can post you missions to the community. That got me really excited. Unlimited mission possibilities really extends the life of the game.
4419	1	a	yes this game so good  in the game your like little heisiters that are funny :D to play with friends its more FUN! try that game you dont have something to lose i RECOMMEND THIS!
4421	1	a	Greatest multiplayer game (that is not an MMO) I have ever played. sequel please!
4423	1	a	A VERY fun game. The characters are very diverse but each useful. Many of the levels players can just run around and work pretty much alone, but some of them require real teamwork- those are the best and the most rewarding. The campaign's extra levels don't add much in my opinion, but the core campaign is great.  The levels often take between 30-45 minutes to complete 100%. It's enough that it starts to get pretty intense, but not to the point where you're not willing to try a level again if you fail. The gold scattered around levels is simply irresistible to grab; most everyone I've played with just won't finish the level without getting 100%, but it's sometimes a real risk.  The level making community seems to be taking off really well now; I hope enough players start working through those and not just the campaign. There's REALLY great stuff in there.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to stealth lovers.   I got this game in a Humble Bundle.
4425	1	a	Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.  When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.  The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.  The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.  The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another.   If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.
4427	1	a	It's like performing a heist in a movie, but harder. Lasers, guard dogs, civilians, and a particular man who keeps losing his job are all out to get you. But with both multiplayer and singleplayer gameplay, eight characters to suit you, and even a zombie survival gamemode, this game doesn't get old. It seems impossible at first, but you just have to think about how to come about it. You want to steal diamonds, but lasers are in the way? Hack the security or cut the power. Did your disguise fail, and the guards are starting to look at you funny? Time to casually walk around the corner and into a bush. Or, if things go poorly, you could always, you know, pull a gun on them.  The game is well balanced, and all the characters have a redeeming trait that makes them all fun to play. If you're playing multiplayer, it might be in your best interest to work together. Have someone lure out a guard while another person comes up from behind and knocks them out. Hack a nearby computer and turn off the cameras. You can mastermind much more powerful schemes with just one more person with you, but the game is also really fun in singleplayer. There seems to always be two ways to do something...  Overall, there's no reason not to give this game a shot. Stealth and planning are rewarded, but it doesn't take a genius to get hooked to this. Should you be playing Singleplayer, even if you die, you can play as another character and continue where your last character failed. If you fail to snag the loot in Multiplayer and go down, a friend can revive you if they can manage to get to you. It's possible to recover from a failure, and the game seems to encourage trying new things.  9/10, excellent game. Plus, if you beat the entire game, you can try robbing player-made levels. A real challange.
4429	1	a	Great little co-op game. Get 4 players in there for a rioutous time. 
4431	1	a	The most enjoyable local co-op game in my collection.
4433	1	a	Let me tell you this game. THIS. GAME. Its super rad. I don't tend to latch on to stealth games or online games that make you follow the story, but Monaco is one that I was able to do just that. Each class is useful with none being better than the other, and the combinations that you can use in this game really makes is a game you can play with anyone! I highley recommend this game and I highly recommend you get other people to play it with you!
4435	1	a	I'd definitely recommend it. It doesn't punish your for screwing up too much, although it will make it a little harder. It's not a 'camp in one spot until the guard leaves' kind of game. You can be really agressive if you want. And best of all: It isn't a linear hand holder. You just think, 'Gee, I need to rob a bank. Where would the money be?'
4437	1	a	This is one of the best coop games I have ever had the fortune to play. It is right up there with Left 4 Dead, and Portal 2, I just cant recomend it enough.
4439	1	a	This is a very fun game. Very much like an 8-bit Pay-Day. It's a fun heist game and playing online, you never know, who you're going to meet and be friends with forever.
4441	1	a	I wish i had more people to play this with!
4443	1	a	Great game for a group to play, had loads of fun playing!
4445	1	a	A humorous top-down 8-bit esque game involving hours of entertainment. The accents that the civilians and guards have is highly amusing and the gameplay is at first glance simple but becomes increasingly complex as each character plays in different ways and the complexity only goes up as you play with more people in different combinations trying to get the highest score. The gameplay can switch back and forth between frantic flight from the police to stealthy guard knockouts within less than a minute and at no point in the game will you not feel challenged. A good game for yourself, a great game for friends.
4447	1	a	If you want good co-op game this is your choice for 100%
4449	1	a	Very good game, I recommend to play this game with a friend, holds up to 4 players AND has custom map support, for all your creative needs!
4451	1	a	A high octane, visually pleasing, pixel crime adventure. A game that is most enjoyed with groups of friends.

4455	1	a	An absolute blast of a game, especially if your playing with friends. Its quick, fun and can get incredibly intense when there is four of you! Just to see what I mean, check this video out:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Kiwi &amp; Lime | Monaco | Part 1: The Lesbian Embassy&nbsp;
4457	1	a	Great in coop
4459	1	a	An awesome co-op game that could run on a toaster, and its $1.49 right now. Buy it!
4461	1	a	Monaco gives the player two options how to complete the mission: 1. Run through the level and collect as much as you can Or 2. Try to be like a ninja and sneak your way through the level, collecting everything that isn't nailed down. One can try these tacticts alone, or with another players online in a co-op mode.   And the possible combinations in the co-op mode makes the players rethink their strategies, adapting them to a new team in every playthrough.  With an awesome co-op mode and levels that are easier to complete in co-op mode than in single player, Monaco makes even the most secular player try working together for a change.   Gr8 game m8, I'd r8 8/8
4463	1	a	Hints on map make this game easy to play even you're the first time. Every class has its own feature, but the balance still has room to improve Some of them is barely useful. (locksmith?) Love the music how it fits this game. And the pixel style characters, always classic.  I like to solo, it's challenging, but co-op with friends? It's fun! Look at these nuts running around and stomp every single alarm, lol...  Recommend! 8/10.    
4465	1	a	Pretty fun, Team work makes it even better.
4467	1	a	love the hacker 
4469	1	a	This is a great game if you want a fun challange you can play as a variity of skilled players
4471	1	a	I'm really not sure what I can say about Monaco. It's a pretty good single-player experience, but the multiplayer is where it really shines: heists can be anything from incredibly tense, with your team struggling to fight their way to the level exit with little to no health left and the police closing in on you; or bloody hilarious, as you all run around beating the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the security guards and trying to figure out just where you have to go next before they all wake up and give you a well-deserved spanking. I would totally recommend it: It's worth the full price, and it's pretty much a crime not to buy it with the discount.
4473	1	a	Can I buy the soundtrack? The music is awesome!
4475	1	a	This game is amazing. I love it so much. It makes you feel like you are really a criminal. I loved going through the storyline running for my life as hundreds of cops chase me and I am scared so bad.
4477	1	a	Great fun in both single and multiplayer.
4479	1	a	You see, monaco is like a really really good pizza pop. not much build up, but its explodes in your mouth and covers you with delicious
4481	1	a	At first this game feels very redundant, but you'll feel glad that it is. Each level is absolutely stunning and presents their own challenges. I &lt;3 Hacker
4483	1	a	Suprising. I usually don't like indies so much but this one is kinda funny!
4485	1	a	super awesome game of amazing-ness
4487	1	a	Very fun game, even on public, it does give a lot of fun. Greatest indie game i played the last month
4489	1	a	i realy like this game
4491	1	a	I absolutely adore the stealth mechanics in this game, I haven't this much fun being a sneaky â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in a long time.
4493	1	a	Wondrous. Especially if you have at least one friend to play with!
4495	1	a	Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a truely unique game. In those times where you really don't know what to play, this is the game to fill that hole. It's an absolutely fantastic game to play solo and an even more spectacular game to play with friends  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDBYp82dZ5M) . A true gem.
4497	1	a	really nice game I like it very much 
4499	1	a	AMAZING GAME!!!!   P.S. I hardly play it, dunno why tho :P
4501	1	a	monaco is a game were you control a thief.
4503	1	a	Cool Game!
4505	1	a	very fun game if you want to play something with a friend
4507	1	a	Cooperative spy espionage at it's best!
4509	1	a	What can i say: i spent 40 hours last week playing this beast. This is what i game for; pure playability depth, with trophie and score based levels.  Multiplayer-centric, but optional. Anyway, in the last levels you will really miss not having partners to help you, so mp is almost a must.  You can play 100%, mp, 1p, any% speedruning, you name it, and the gameplay changes entirely  It even has an story going (skippable), with plot-twists here and there.  Really looking forward for the next update, so i can munch more levels.  10/10
4511	1	a	This may be one of the best games I've played. With a beautiful soundtrack, unique, yet still aesthetically pleasing style, and an amazing multiplayer, this one is definitely one to get. Happy heisting.
4513	1	a	Without friends, very boring game. With friends, very fun game. Easy to learn, hard to master. The trophies on each level are fun to attempt to achieve.
4515	1	a	This game is a lot of fun! the campaign is vast, the levels well made, and the experence just gets better with friends.
4517	1	a	To call Monaco a stealth game would be like calling a dandelion food. While technically it is, if you are eating a flower you are probably doing it wrong. In the same way, Monaco is more of a cooperitive game then a stealth game. That isn't to say that it's a bad stealth game, in fact it's one of the best that I've ever played. It just that it's so much better with friends. The best parts of the game are when one player saves the rest of the party and completely turn the hiest around. Even playing online is better than playing solo. So if you are looking to spend a weekend with friends, this is the game to play.
4519	1	a	Monaco is one of my favorite games, and probably will remain so. From my perspective, its meant to be played co-op and not too seriously. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously. You and three of your friends (or three strangers on the internet) get to run, hide, steal, and generally cavort your way through tons of zany levels. And due to the amazing level editor, the content does not stop when you finish the story mode. Its tons of fun, so go buy it! You won't be disappointed. This game knows that even without the most advanced graphics, perks, or features, its all about gameplay, and Monaco's gameplay cannot be beat.
4521	1	a	Nice and cheap game, totally recommend
4523	1	a	There's nothing quite like the experience of tripping an alarm and having to run for your life.
4525	1	a	Nice one,just buy and enjoy it. XD
4527	1	a	This is an amazingly fun game! the single player experiance is really well designed, but the game really shines when when it comes to the multiplayer! it's great fun to get a few friends together an play some local co-op. My friends an I would play together for hours on end, working out strategies and creating our terms things, while stealing everything we can!
4529	1	a	This game is multiplayer stealth that works. As if that alone wasn't enough of a reason for you to check this game out, it's also crazy amounts of fun. I say best played in a group of people you know, or with a mic, but even then, so much fun. Highly reccommend.
4531	1	a	Lots of fun, highly enjoyable with lots to do
4533	1	a	Fun, interesting, unique, and made complicated at times by its simplicity.
4535	1	a	'Oops, the guard saw me.' 'Uh I may have just ran through a laser.' 'Someone revive me, dammit.'   Play this game with friends you will get so mad at them, you'll love it.
4537	1	a	Monaco: The city of opportunity, and the game like no other. Every class feels important, and every situation I was in I could solve with every character in one way or another. In co-op this game shines like you wouldn't believe. I have no regrets picking this game up, or recommending it.
4539	1	a	Buy this game if you: Ever had urges to steal money, Learn french, Like sneaking around, Dont like COD, Killing your friends, Playing custom maps, Killing your friends, Like indie games, Like co-op games, Like indie Co-op games, and Dont like COD :PPPP
4541	1	a	I tend towards knocking everybody out before stealing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the levels. Cleaner too good. I really need to finish this game.
4543	1	a	A top-down third person version of the Payday series, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play among friends. Relatively easy to learn as well and has a variety of game modes and community mods to ensure you neevr get bored.  The mechanics of the game are fairly simplistic and easy to understand and remain constant for most parts of the game.   The only thing that needs improvement would probably be the connection system. It took me 20 mins on my first try to create a room and start a game with friends. The gameplay afterwards made this mishap relatively forgiving though.  8/10, strongly recommended for groups of friends of all ages.
4545	1	a	I just picked it up on  HumbleBundle.com , and i do not regret it, great co-op game.
4547	1	a	Although it starts simply, Monaco delivers a wonderfully varied set of environments and challenges. The Pac-man reminiscent graphics lend wonderfully to the panic when you inevitably mess up and have to flee from guards. My recommendation: play it with friends and play it often.
4549	1	a	Definitely a fun game, 4 players who know what they are doing is a blast even going solo is possible on every level and can be just as fun. If you fail a mission just a click away and your trying it again. missions are quite short so you can blow through them (literally for a few of them). Had trouble getting groups of 4 but when they were together they were great. Groups of 3 or 2 are much more common and just as intense.
4551	1	a	Best coop game since sliced coop games!
4553	1	a	Largely multi-player co-op based. Really fun to play with friends, especially with the enhanced missions.
4555	1	a	Fun game. Better with friends for your heist.
4557	1	a	Manic, multiplayer madness, the maelstrom of mania is pretty damn fun.
4559	1	a	A few guys I run a gaming comminuty with convinced me to pick this up one night. We had about 3 people playing it and we had a blast running through most of the first quest chain. The graphics, story, and music are absolutely awesome in this game! I have not played it by myself yet, but I believe fully that this game is meant to be played with friends. Most of the time we could not stop laughing. The game is quite enjoyable.
4561	1	a	This game is an awesome fun to play alone or with friends, if only it was for free...
4563	1	a	its a very good game, great storyline and very family friendly
4565	1	a	I got this game when its was free and still play it its one of the best sneaking games,Good Job, 10 of 10
4567	1	a	This game is awesome, thats my epic review. Have a wonderful day
4569	1	a	i like this game it is really boss
4571	1	a	The Mole Experience
4573	1	a	I like the game but i can,t play it for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but deing sly as a fox to get stuff and steal stuff and save people for ther death i guess its alright
4575	1	a	I love this game. This game is diffrent than most games like these. The layout and the story line depending on the charactors are really laid out. This game is a really planned out game. It has a nice sound track. The smooth jazz always fits in with the sneaking or even the running. And the charactors all have that special layout. If i could rate this game i would give it a 10/10. I recomend this game to friends. And even if on youtube the sound track and the gameplay will give it that feeling of suspence or suspicouseness in the game. All i have to say now is.... Nicely done.
4577	1	a	Excellent fun with friends
4579	1	a	Grab somefriends, and play the living **** out of this game &lt;3
4581	1	a	Its a really good game, i recommend it
4583	1	a	At first this game feels very redundant, but you'll feel glad that it is. Each level is absolutely stunning and presents their own challenges. I &lt;3 Hacker
4585	1	a	great game, you need 4 people though coz it gets a little hard at points
4587	1	a	Awesome, Become a stealer and sneak in and out of ships, houses, bruning boats you name it. 9/10 stars 
4589	1	a	Its a very good game 
4591	1	a	Its pretty good. I like the multiplayer quite a bit. It can be hard sometimes but then you realize its actually a pretty strategic game and requires a plan to win. 8/10
4593	1	a	screew that i dont wanna buy this! i already downloaded it! 
4595	1	a	A Really Great Game, You should get this gmae if you are into slow-to-fast paced game, thinking what will happen beofre you should do it.
4597	1	a	Such steal, Very sneak, Much mistakes 10/10
4599	1	a	A really great stealth co-op game to play with friends. This game isn't the greatest to play with strangers or by yourself but if you can, always group up with friends.
4601	1	a	Great game! Makes it worth more when it's on sale. :) But this is a great and addicting game. A must have for the Indie game player
4603	1	a	MICS OPEN RADIOS CLEAR ITS TIME FOR A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ HEIST TOM HANKS LEO DECAP COMMING AT YA REAL HARD IN THIS HIGH ACTION RIPPING RARING THRILLER. STEAL.MURDER.PICKLOCK.MINING.LEVELUPS.HEADSHOTS.NUTSHOTS.SIMS2.SIMS3.CLOUDSTRIFE. THIS GAME-HAS-EVERYTHING  4/10 only buy it when its not on sales caio
4605	1	a	Good game i would say, especially when playing co-op with friends, it is really fun, enjoyed all the different character with different skill traits, and the game works best with people playing together, it requires teamwork to get through the missions.
4607	1	a	mentally ill hacker  11/10
4609	1	a	Buy. This. Game!
4611	1	a	Highly recommended. Excellent game. Very fun multiplayer, especially single screen multiplayer.
4613	1	a	Uniquely superb in both its design and plot. Captures one of the best experiences for a co-op, heist game.
4615	1	a	Not a great buy if you are only going to play single player, but I suspect it is a lot of fun with others.
4617	1	a	asome game love every thing about it i would have liked more lvls and more playable chrachters but still a great game
4619	1	a	LOVE IT, BUT I ONLY PLAYED FREE. :/
4621	1	a	this game is pretty cool i want to play much more though lol
4623	1	a	its yummy
4625	1	a	worth while
4627	1	a	It's an amazing tiny game, I even never play this kind of the game. attracting my desire.
4629	1	a	Overall it's a pretty fun game especially with friends. The PvP is a lot of fun and so are the missions but much better with friends because sometimes you'll get a person who has no idea what they're doing and just ruin everything. The main problem I have is being able to aim. I also feel that screen is a bit too clutered at times too. If it's on sale definetly buy it.
4631	1	a	one of the best co-op game ever!  A Heist and stealth game for couch co-op
4633	1	a	This is pretty fun on multiplayer!
4635	1	a	Do not hesitate to purchase.  I welcome you with open arms even if you're damn troll.
4637	1	a	One of the most enjoyable co-op games I've played. 8 unique classes that all have their own abilites that both work well with each other, and fit almost any playstyle. The campaign is straight up film noir, and the levels are very well designed. I haven't even touched any of the Workshop content yet, but that's coming in the future.
4639	1	a	Thanks for the Linux port but you need to work on the keys as the feel stiffer than some of the homebrew games I've played.
4641	1	a	Beautiful game, but too much stupids player. it ruin the game
4643	1	a	Great fun, even tho confusing as fun and I would recommend getting your own friends to play it with.
4645	1	a	A fun game that requires some planning and foresight, as one slip up may not necessarily cause justice to be served, but will cause a lot of chaos and take time to get the mission back underway.
4647	1	a	Even thought I just started this game, I find it quite entertaining even thought I didn't know what to do half of the time. But, once you get the concept of the game down, then it's super easy to play. Plus, if you get the right kind of weapon, then you are invinsible in this game. I'll keep playing this game, it passes the time away.
4649	1	a	Fantastic. The game has great graphics, simple, yet intriguing, game mechanics, and a nice little class selection list.
4651	1	a	Awesome, Become a stealer and sneak in and out of ships, houses, bruning boats you name it. 9/10 stars 
4653	1	a	Its a very good game 
4655	1	a	Its pretty good. I like the multiplayer quite a bit. It can be hard sometimes but then you realize its actually a pretty strategic game and requires a plan to win. 8/10
4657	1	a	An amazing top-down payday like game. I Give it a 9.5/10 because the levels get to big for my tastes.
4659	1	a	You can kill things
4661	1	a	Simple, but not easy. Addictive game play!
4663	1	a	Fun multi or single player stratagy escape game with smooth gameplay and cool 8-bit graphics. A must buy.
4665	1	a	I like the game a lot. I want to play more of it but I don't have money to spare to get it. Buy it play it have fun.
4667	1	a	This is Honestly A Good RPG game and has 
4669	1	a	its an awsome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it  
4671	1	a	this game is sweet 
4673	1	a	its kinda boring but i dont like how i keep dying and my team dies and fails the misson
4675	1	a	it is a fun game
4677	1	a	This game is as good as the movie The Italian Job
4679	1	a	The action is frantic but the game is better if you play with friends. 
4681	1	a	Amazing deal this weekend at 3.74
4683	1	a	Just got this game and it really fun. you can choose many different classes and rob people with your friends. :)
4685	1	a	Yes it is fun to the max
4687	1	a	Don't underestimate this game because its 2d. Probabaly one of the best stealth games i've ever played. 9/10
4689	1	a	worth while
4691	1	a	It's an amazing tiny game, I even never play this kind of the game. attracting my desire.
4693	1	a	If you like Pac-Man, then this game is for you. A combination of action, adventure and many more. The story is interesting and the gameplay is somewhat very cute.
4695	1	a	its great u should buy it
4697	1	a	Sweet game with great graphics, reccomended to stealth/heist lovers or to destruction lovers, enjoy!
4699	1	a	If you have a few friends to play with it can get pretty hectic, definatly a must try.
4701	1	a	If you like hilarious games that go brilliantly wrong despite your best efforts, here is the brilliant mmo for you. Monoco is amazingly done and I wholly recommend it.
4703	1	a	Its a fun game.I got the week version...So i dident play it enough.But i hate the idiots that dont know what to do 
4705	1	a	Fantastic game with friends, pretty good game alone too
4707	1	a	This game is too fun to exist. Why doesn't everyone have this?
4709	1	a	I think some people will like this game but its not for me. I only played about 10 missions and it just didnt grab me in any meaningful way. I dont think its a bad game so it stills gets a thumbs up. Its kind of like Hotline Miami with less challenge and tension.
4711	1	a	I read loads of peoples comments about this game saying it was class but it plays best with people you know, I was put off paying Â£12 for it because of graphics but when it was in one of the bundles at  www.humblebundle.com  I grabbed it &amp; i can say now after playing that it wort tenner &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't always need fancy graphics and blood to make a great game !
4713	1	a	It Is fun But A bit boring With out others
4715	1	a	Crack safes! Hack stuff! Sneak past French-speaking security guards!  Recommended to play with friends though, going solo is a recipe for disaster.
4717	1	a	Its a good game
4719	1	a	This is a really fun stealthy grab everything topdown with sight line game, and if your friends play it, it's even better.
4721	1	a	Entertaining certainly, but only becomes fun when you start competing not for completion of levels, but rather points.
4723	1	a	SO MUCH FUN  Accents ftw
4725	1	a	GET IT. BEST 1.49 EVER SPENT!
4727	1	a	Excellent game! Loving the missions so far. 10/10
4729	1	a	It sure is a game. It has a character, or maybe more (no spoilers). It has context. It has a start and levels. Much Review, such wow, very dog
4731	1	a	This game is awesome !
4733	1	a	'Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine' is a very unique game that is one of the best in it's genre. The stealthiness gives you a feeling of acomplishment as well as being a spy yourself. Also, the cooperative gameplay is amazing, leading to very funny times and very fun to play moments. The levels are also great, being difficult enough that it's very hard, but not too much as to not motivate you to try again. Monaco is truly an indie gem.
4735	1	a	Great fun with a group of friends!
4737	1	a	this game is amazing
4739	1	a	It's pretty cool. Might be more fun with friends, but I personally hate dealing with strangers online, so I normally LAN with my closest friends.
4741	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
4743	1	a	Amazing game. Most fun I've had in a long while. Buy it, especially if its on sale. Worth every penny. 10/10
4745	1	a	Excellent when playing co op, less so when solo, but still a great romp nonetheless.
4747	1	a	Incredible, just looking out for some more friends to play with!
4749	1	a	Great game, Have you wanted to be the bad guy so this game is for you. found only one but big disadvantage - you can t play alone, must play with other people. Tihis game is not hard but not easy, hard only when you play alone. buy this game its great.
4751	1	a	this game is amazing, but dont buy this if you dont have friends
4753	1	a	I played it for only 30 mins and it was sooooooooooooooooo awesome! Works really neatly with a controller aswell.
4755	1	a	fun game, i recommend playing online, more fun that way.
4757	1	a	I thought this game was very creative, sometimes it would get repeditive but i think it has a great multiplayer feel!
4759	1	a	Only buy if u have someone to play with
4761	1	a	Nice game. Love the style and gameplay.
4763	1	a	A great game to treasure bushes.
4765	1	a	Fun and frantic. Better with friends than solo, of course. It gets pretty crazy and pretty difficult, but that's part of the fun.  The music and ambience is great, too.
4767	1	a	it is a good game it is good i like it must download it and the free offer is good thanks steam
4769	1	a	Such a fun game! -Must play with friends -Cheap -Unique artstyle Overall great game
4771	1	a	Co-op is so much fun!
4773	1	a	Good gameplay but it costs too much for this game
4775	1	a	This game is so fun once you start you cant stop playing as it gets more and more difficult, but you unlock some characters who can do many things well.
4777	1	a	Well this is a basic but fun game. Get it if you have the chance I'll vote 9/10. 9 because the priced should be lowered to 8.99 or 9.99.  
4779	1	a	One oF tHE bEST cOoP gAMES.9,5/10
4781	1	a	This is pretty fun I guess.
4783	1	a	i love it i love the controls and the graphics its just a blast
4785	1	a	This game so far is very fun should get it for fun 4 co-op family night.
4787	1	a	Do I recommend this game... HELL YA
4789	1	a	Monaco is an interesting game. It's straight forward gameplay, and level design really sold it for me. Due to the fact that each player has different abilities, each player has a specific role to play. Working as a team takes practice and timing, but is really rewarding at the same time. Yet, you could also just run loose and have crazy missions which are equally as fun.  The only areas of the map that you'll see in color is your field of vision, so get use to black and grey layouts. While I haven't beaten this game 100% completely, it is still in my top 25 games.  The only problem I had with it is that finding a group to play with can be difficult at times, and if you lack any way to communicate, then you'll have to play the game by ear.  Overall I give it a 4/5.
4791	1	a	One of the greatest indie games I've ever played. Monaco is insanely fun, both by yourself and with friends. It perfectly captures the essence of a heist movie and translates it into a quirky, 2D game. The soundtrack is awesome, adding another element of the heist genre to the game. Do yourself a favour and pick it up.
4793	1	a	This game has a lot of fun things me and my friend played this game and its fun.
4795	1	a	i love it please let it free forever
4797	1	a	great game for anyone who likes coop games and loves to rob stuff :P 9/10
4799	1	a	Neon Thief Simulator 2013
4801	1	a	Fun multi or single player stratagy escape game with smooth gameplay and cool 8-bit graphics. A must buy.
4803	1	a	I got this game during Free Weekend and can't play again. Anyway this game is AWESOME. Love the characters, like the sounds.
4805	1	a	this game is cool
4807	1	a	Its fun. go buy it. multiplayer is great.
4809	1	a	This game is tonnes of fun, better when with friends but it is playable by yourself.  If you can get a few friends for PVP or Story it is very good.
4811	1	a	Gameplay is simple, but fun and interesting. Also, good single player and co-op.
4813	1	a	Looks good, fun to play, cheap. Overal just a great game. You should really get it.
4815	1	a	it is great with friends
4817	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
4819	1	a	One of the best Top-Down stealth games on the pc is worth a try.
4821	1	a	amazing but right now its not working for me 
4823	1	a	This game is so fun .... ur missing out
4825	1	a	Monaco is chaos, beautiful and organised chaos. I originally played it co-op with a friend and we had a great time trying to pick the perfect combination of characters to crack the missions. We thought with four of us it would be even easier, we were wrong. While four players gave us a wealth of skill it turned the whole thing into hilariously crazy and usually fatal attempts at the missions.
4827	1	a	Wow, I didn't expect such an addicting game from the previews. I love stealth games as a whole, but this one takes the cake with the 8 character classes, each with their unique skillset.  **Play the tutorials on character classes and weapons before you start the missions**  It's fun and challenging for single player. But with teammates, it's even better: 1) They're there to pick you up when you fail, 2) They're hilarious when being chased by guards, and most importantly 3) Their abilities complement yours when going through the mission.  Great Multiplayer missions, challenging single player missions. Cool concept and through the roof execution. One of my favorite games, hands down.
4829	1	a	Have owned since last summerand everyone seeing this sale on it NEEDS TO BUY IT. BEST CO-OP GAME EVAR.
4831	1	a	fun, good difficulty, not so hard you want to put your fist through your screen, but just enough to make it fun.
4833	1	a	This game is pretty fun. The early levels are too easy but one the difficulty ramps up lots of fun is had. Best played with friends
4835	1	a	Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .
4837	1	a	Nice game! But make it free! All players want this free to play! Please just make it free!! I played it on free weekend its awesome!!
4839	1	a	very nice game 
4841	1	a	Monaco is an awesome game and i realy recomand it for people that like to kill, steal and find seacrets
4843	1	a	Its a fun game.I got the week version...So i dident play it enough.But i hate the idiots that dont know what to do 
4845	1	a	Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.  When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.  The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.  The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.  The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another.   If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.
4847	1	a	i love this game
4849	1	a	Kirby-tested, Kirby-approved
4851	1	a	This game was sooo good i think if you and your friends love having a laugh then get it. if not your still missing out
4853	1	a	Really great!
4855	1	a	the game is good
4857	1	a	Monaco: whats yours is mine is a fun single or multiplayer hiest game playing the game single player makes for a fun and challinging hiest game which at times can be very difficult but is still very fun. The multiplayer is when it gets insanly fun. Overall very fun game worth $15.00 9.8/10

4861	1	a	Best co-op games what I've ever played!
4863	1	a	Monaco is a great looking game and is VERY fun to play with your friends. You'll find yourself and your friends messing up a couple levels constantly but it only adds to the fun. Usually gives you a good laugh whenever you do something wrong or read something funny in the game. The PvP mode is also very fun to play with your friends and strangers. Gets really intense when you end up having all the trophies. I would recomend this game to anyone who is willing to just have fun and not take a game seriously.  9/10
4865	1	a	A really fun and organised friendly game :)
4867	1	a	A very fun 4 player co-op game if you have 3 other friends to play it with then get it and do so
4869	1	a	Not bad, confusing at times. 8.8/10
4871	1	a	I really enjoyed the game
4873	1	a	Multiplayer is amazing!
4875	1	a	Monaco is a wonderful game, especially if you get your friends playing with everyone on voice chat. If you're looking for a simple yet complex multiplayer title to sink some time into, this is your game.
4877	1	a	This is a really great game. One of my favourite games of all time. It has Workshop and a big community, but sometimes there is hardly anyone online.
4879	1	a	A hilarious game to see if you and you friend(s) can actually work as a team.
4881	1	a	Monaco is an absoloute legend of a game in multiplayer although it lacks entertainment when you are in single player. I would recommend this game for it's superb game-style and although the plotline isn't that definite it is possibly one of the best mulitplayer games I've ever played.
4883	1	a	great game, very funny!
4885	1	a	Monaco, charming, challenging, chaotic, my most unique and addicting gameplay from the last year
4887	1	a	Great game! Very unique game style. I love the retro colorful graphics. Definitely a very fun experience! I wish more of my friends owned it so I could do co-op with them! haha
4889	1	a	I find this to be a great co-op game. My friends and I have a great time playing Monaco. I do think that if you don't have friends(that is a joke I just mean if you do single player or don't have relieable friends) then you may have a lesser experience but it can still be a fun and humorous game.
4891	1	a	Ridiclously fun! 10/10
4893	1	a	Requires an amazing amount of teamwork and is challenging ,Worth a try
4895	1	a	
4897	1	a	this is a good game but there should be 2 player one keyboard
4899	1	a	Monaco is a pretty fun way to let out your inner thief without those pesky moral values stoping you.
4901	1	a	A lot of fun in both single- and multiplayer. Easy to learn, hard to master. Well worth the price.
4903	1	a	Simple but astonishingly entertaining game. It makes a very complex idea simple and fun.
4905	1	a	Mole has freedom spoon.
4907	1	a	Surprisingly simple stealth game with complex variations that takes co-op play to a new level
4909	1	a	Great game to play with friends.  Can rapidly switch from a sneaky hiest to a Benny Hill-esque sprint down a hallway dodging guards and bullets. Plenty of action, thrills, and laughs.
4911	1	a	one of the best co-op game ever!  A Heist and stealth game for couch co-op
4913	1	a	This game is undoubtably a co-op game. It requires teamwork, and if you get the job/mission done nicely, you feel like a total badass. Pros : Cool, colorful graphics. Co-op fun. Easy to connect. Several different playable characters. Zonaco, a zombie version of the game which is interesting. A PvP aspect which is fun if played with friends. Very easy to fun. Never crashes. Cons : Not fun alone. Can be aggravating, but that's just a player preference kind of thing.
4915	1	a	One of the most enjoyable co-op games I've played. 8 unique classes that all have their own abilites that both work well with each other, and fit almost any playstyle. The campaign is straight up film noir, and the levels are very well designed. I haven't even touched any of the Workshop content yet, but that's coming in the future.
4917	1	a	Very good game would recommend it. Only downside is the pvp it gets either overly boring or 2 chaotic. 
4919	1	a	This game is really good i really love heists game!
4921	1	a	This is pretty fun on multiplayer!
4923	1	a	To be quite honest I bought this game only because the trailer was made in such a great way and because it was on sale but it turned out to be a really good choice. It's an interesting take on stealth genre and it's a fun multiplayer experience with all the different classes. The single player is also worth checking out but is nowhere as fun as the online matches.
4925	1	a	not expecting to really enjoy this game. but i had a great time with this game!
4927	1	a	Ridiculously fun, and a perfect balance of strategic pacing and anxiety.
4929	1	a	Playing alone, it's probably a 6/10. Playing with friends with open mic chat? 10/10. Hilarious.
4931	1	a	This game is a blast to go through with friends! Seriously, why haven't you bought it yet?
4933	1	a	Ingenious game reminiscent of the old breakin capers, complete with all the main prototype characters. It's like Ocean's Eleven without having to look at Brad Pitt and George Clooney all the time.
4935	1	a	It's an absolute blast with friends.
4937	1	a	I approve. I love the tiny download sizes. I love talking to people and telling them not to screw it up. I love the chaos they create when they ignore it. And you can p*** in the toilets.
4939	1	a	I picked up the 4-pack bundle on a whim and shared it with 3 of my friends. Best decision ever. This game highly encourages you to play with 4 people; the jobs are always possible no matter which of the 8 classes you choose, but the difficulty amps up with fewer tools at your disposal. Since each class has its own specialization that only they can do, not having certain elements available makes missions significantly more daunting when alone. Also, the stealth in this game is quite fun, though perhaps more forgiving than hardcore lovers of stealth games might enjoy. Running around the corner and hiding in a potted plant is usually the best course of action for getting guards off your tail.  9/10, will no doubt be playing this well into the future.
4941	1	a	I recommend Monaco as both a good single player game and an amazing co-op experience. This cross betweern pac-man and payday delivers fun gameplay unlike many titles before. Pick this game up with a few friends and you'll have a blast.
4943	1	a	This is a really good game, it's basic, has basic controls, has interesting levels and charactors, and has a solid goal for each level. Honestly, I can't find anything about this game that is bad.   My cousin introduced it to me to Monaco and I'm glad he did. Over all, it's a great game and fun to play with friends. I think Monaco is great for anyone and will enjoy this game.
4945	1	a	Monaco is a super-fast-pace crime simulator game that's more or less a meatier version of the SEGA Genesis game Bonanza Bros. Whether you're with a few friends, or strangers, or yourself, Monaco is a blast!
4947	1	a	A great co-op game that is a lot of fun. Also has great music
4949	1	a	Well worth the price, this is a fast-paced and fun game. The look is unique and the co-op makes for a great evening of play.
4951	1	a	I personally find this game with just the right amount of challenge but not to the point where you get very frustrated with it. I also enjoyed this game much more than the splinter cells series mostly due to the four player co-op ability.
4953	1	a	Actually a fun little game. Great for one player or multiplayer. The jobs really matter and it feels like everyone contributes. My only criticism is about five stages in or so, the difficultly really gets ramped up, so it's harder to find multiplayer teams to do those levels.  Still, a solid game.
4955	1	a	Great game, addictive!
4957	1	a	Fun co-op game. Great gameplay; good music to set the tone; lots of missions to do (even a PVP mode). Definitely worth the price if it's on sale! Check the Humble Bundle store or Steam Sales!
4959	1	a	Is a very fun stealthesque experience. One of my favorite co-op in a while
4961	1	a	Definitely a fun game, 4 players who know what they are doing is a blast even going solo is possible on every level and can be just as fun. If you fail a mission just a click away and your trying it again. missions are quite short so you can blow through them (literally for a few of them). Had trouble getting groups of 4 but when they were together they were great. Groups of 3 or 2 are much more common and just as intense.
4963	1	a	This game is cool
4965	1	a	man oh man i having hade so much fun with any other one's simular to this brings me back to my fond memories
4967	1	a	A Definate Must-Play.  Monaco is one of those games that put itself out there to try something new, and it made it through. Monaco, like Minecraft or Team Fortess 2, is one of those games that were inovative and risked being criticized for leaving that line of what has become the cliche' of modern gaming. It is a game of skill and precision, you can't go around kill everything... well... actually, you can, but I wouldn't consider it. Sure, it's not anything to compete against espionage of today like the god-forbidden Splinter Cell, and whatever happened to it's dignity, or Metal Gear Solid, but it is completely worth the $15, it is intensly fun, especially with friends. I recommend that you and a friend buy this game, it's a really good way to spend an afternoon.
4969	1	a	i love this game
4971	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
4973	1	a	A great game with great gameplay. I stronly reccomend this game!!!!
4975	1	a	This game is really fun,worth every cent. :D
4977	1	a	its a very good game its like payday a little bit but there's more characters and each one has a skill or power whatever you call them but its awesome so far because of the new update so yeah you should definitely play it.
4979	1	a	An over the top heist game with an amazing art style and soundtrack. This game is a blast to play with friends.
4981	1	a	best 4p co-op availble. plus it's an awesome solo campaign. kind of like a pixel-sized metal gear solid.
4983	1	a	This game has a unique storyline that I wasn't really expecting, interesting characters, freedom spoons, gameplay that looks difficult at first but is understandable when first played, and guards. Guards everywhere.
4985	1	a	This game is hillarious, so much fun when playing with friends, definitely worth the money!!
4987	1	a	Did you watch the movie Italian Job or Ocean's series? You like it? Then Monaco is perfect choice for you. There are many playable characters and each one of them has unique ability which is helpful to stealing. Single play is good, but co-op is better for this game. Monaco is very nice infiltraion game with unique art style and beautiful soundtrack.
4989	1	a	At first I was like what the F is this game? Then I decided to try it and wow.. Fun fun fun
4991	1	a	Nice Gameplay, Awesome sound It's nice and very good games
4993	1	a	This little coop game is amazingly addictive and suprisingly suspenseful! It has a charming story and doesn't get boring easily.
4995	1	a	Very fun for the amount of money you pay for it
4997	1	a	This is very fun with friends, even when things go wrong it's fun running around and trying to find a hiding spot. Lots of laughs and very entertaining.
4999	1	a	Game built perfectly for co-op leading to some really fun situations as carefully made plans fall apart. Fantastic audio and visuals.
5001	1	a	Fantastic game to play with friends. Co-op with your friends to find the best ways to clear the stages and brainstorm new and interesting strategies. Not nearly as good solo however.
5003	1	a	This game is great provided your team isn't poopy at it
5005	1	a	Amazing multiplayer game with alot of fun and a few ways to play. Sneaky or RUNNING. bought it and fell in love with this game. makes you think as you collect all the coins and then find a guard around the corner. keeps you on your toes
5007	1	a	Pretty fun, friends who are idiots will want you to no longer be friends w/ them. 
5009	1	a	great game, very funny!
5011	1	a	Monaco is a well done game that is just plain fun.
5013	1	a	A VERY fun game. The characters are very diverse but each useful. Many of the levels players can just run around and work pretty much alone, but some of them require real teamwork- those are the best and the most rewarding. The campaign's extra levels don't add much in my opinion, but the core campaign is great.  The levels often take between 30-45 minutes to complete 100%. It's enough that it starts to get pretty intense, but not to the point where you're not willing to try a level again if you fail. The gold scattered around levels is simply irresistible to grab; most everyone I've played with just won't finish the level without getting 100%, but it's sometimes a real risk.  The level making community seems to be taking off really well now; I hope enough players start working through those and not just the campaign. There's REALLY great stuff in there.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to stealth lovers.   I got this game in a Humble Bundle.
5015	1	a	Great game if your palying alone or with 3 buddies. you can choose to be either sneaky and silent or barge right through the misson not caring if guards see you! And the level creater is really cool too, but hard to get the hang of, and it takes an incredibly long time to create a level because of the way they set it up, but i still recomend this because the level editor is not really part of the game. the story is not really in depth and should not be the reason to buy this game, the way the game plays and how awsomly fun it is to play should be the thing that someone interested in buying this game should pay attention to!
5017	1	a	Very fun and challenging, but a little on the hard side if played solo!
5019	1	a	Fantastic game. Best played in co-op. Chaotic arcade-y action when things go south, but cool rush of stealth game when things are going 'well'. Things tend to go south often, though, and it's a blast when they do.
5021	1	a	Overall an insanely fun little time waster, it gets more entertaining the more friends or people you play with, can't complain!
5023	1	a	Buy this game at your own Peril!
5025	1	a	Good game not great. Not alot of action but its still fun. I'm more into shooter/survival type games but this is still alot of fun 7/10
5027	1	a	Play it Co-op with friends. It is heaps of fun that way, cos when someone messes up, things get really frantic.
5029	1	a	I've never wanted to throw up so hard after robbing a bank.
5031	1	a	Hectic neon-gasmic fun.
5033	1	a	Me and my friend play this together and well it is hard at some points with two people but we manage! I love this game for its disigne and how well it plays! The game is very fun on multi-player and very competitive too! If you like action and 2D games then this is ment for you. It even has stealth in there for those who want that!
5035	1	a	This game looks simple but it is more than meets the eye. Its a clever concept with suprisingly difficult gameplay. the comination of cooperative online gameplay and story based campaign is totally unique.
5037	1	a	This is probably one of the easiest games to pick up and play, yet still be a great game.
5039	1	a	...
5041	1	a	Even thought I just started this game, I find it quite entertaining even thought I didn't know what to do half of the time. But, once you get the concept of the game down, then it's super easy to play. Plus, if you get the right kind of weapon, then you are invinsible in this game. I'll keep playing this game, it passes the time away.
5043	1	a	This game is sweet. ridiculous fun. get it!
5045	1	a	Awesome game, well worth the money!
5047	1	a	Incredibly fun co-op or solo game filled with hijinks and theivery. Highly recommended.
5049	1	a	It may look dumb, but so did Hotline Miami and boy! Was I wrong about that game as well. Just give it a try if your reading this while its still on sale or maybe consider buying later on the full price if you missed the sale.
5051	1	a	Overall, this simplistic game is an absolute gem. Sure you can pass a lot of levels by just running through, ignoring half of the loot and almost all the guards, but to do so is a waste. You will miss all the fun of sneaking around trying to pass each level without being seen/killed. Ok, single player has a limited lifespan, but multiplayer is great fun, and the ability to make your own maps extends the games life by a long time
5053	1	a	A great heist game in its own nature
5055	1	a	Killing people and robbing places all in a smal 2D game
5057	1	a	Great game you should buy it 
5059	1	a	This is an amazing game :3
5061	1	a	I love playing the lookout. However when the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hits the fan I tend to run around shooting and screaming and jumping into bushes after triggering every alarm. That behavior has caused my husband to yell 'This is why we're never robbing a bank!'
5063	1	a	Great game , worth every penny
5065	1	a	Best robbery game EVER! I love all the carecters and all there specile abillites. 1 thing i dislike is dat pick pocking allways allerts gaurds. 
5067	1	a	Monaco is a difficult game to describe because it doesn't fall into a well-tread genre, but it's part puzzle game, part top-down action game, and overall a lot of fun. Up to four players form a team of criminals attempting a heist, and the game is a race to collect all of the money and treasure without getting caught by the gaurds. It's heavily designed around online multiplayer, and the open lobby system makes it easy to get matched up with random partners in crime.  One of the best things about the game is how it handles difficulty and varying player skill. Aside from levels that get progressively harder as the storyline unfolds, success in each mission is less about getting through the mission at all and more about doing it as quickly and effeciently as possible. So if you end up with a mix of veteran players and n00bs, everyone can still do their own thing and feel like they are contributing even if some players are doing more of the work. The time/speedrun system works well for replayability, because once you become better at the game it's a lot of fun to use your new skills to plow through some of the earlier levels.  There are eight different characters in the game all with different abilities, and the balance between characters is pretty good so that there are not obvious best and worst characters. Also each level has different aspects that can make certain characters more advantageous, although it's always possible to complete the levels with any set characters. There's also an entertaining and somewhat convoluted storyline for the game that gives each character a unique personality.  The core gameplay and level design are both top notch and that's why the game makes you want to keep playing levels to try for better times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-y games, especially if you are looking for an online co-op game. Even for people who don't generally like online multiplayer games it can be a good intro into that kind of game because you can start out as a novice and not feel like you're in way over your head. Great game and I look forward to more games from Pocketwatch.
5069	1	a	poop face
5071	1	a	Awesome Game! I love it!!!
5073	1	a	Pretty sick game, online is fun, can be difficult but is a very good and unique heisting game
5075	1	a	Lets game is different and its great. I have had so much fun with this gem.
5077	1	a	Very fun and addictive game, must have this game on your Library P.S. the game will be very hard in late game if you play only one player and use all of your weapon + collect all of your money in game
5079	1	a	Simple, effective multiplayer gameplay. The different character types are fun, and working with a friend through some of the more frantic situations can get pretty funny. It also has an awesome piano score to go with your heists. Totally worth the price tag, but on sale it is a steal.
5081	1	a	Really fun.
5083	1	a	Love the style, it's so different from any other game I have. And I love that it's co-op =) Nice and 'different' game.
5085	1	a	Let me tell you this game. THIS. GAME. Its super rad. I don't tend to latch on to stealth games or online games that make you follow the story, but Monaco is one that I was able to do just that. Each class is useful with none being better than the other, and the combinations that you can use in this game really makes is a game you can play with anyone! I highley recommend this game and I highly recommend you get other people to play it with you!
5087	1	a	One of the best coop ever played, simply addictive like it's awesome music
5089	1	a	ahhh this game is so much fun!
5091	1	a	Fun game, really picks up in the later levels. Best played with 4 people so everyone does stupid stuff .
5093	1	a	Amazing game! Really fun to play, especially in multiplayer. Each character is unique.
5095	1	a	The strong sense of having to rely and work together as a team in Monaco: whats yours is mine is overwhelming. And I mean that in a good way. It can really bring people together and make them think instead of just doing the same function sover and over again you have to be constantly alert. Lots of fun
5097	1	a	Fun addictive game, great to play with other people.
5099	1	a	I'm playing crokinole with the princess of Monaco!
5101	1	a	Cool !!
5103	1	a	I've wanted this game for quite a while. It's a pretty fun stealth game. There are several characters, each with it's own ability such as hacking or faster lock picking or breaking through walls which adds depth to the game. You can approach these levels several different ways, from hacking your way and to shooting your way out to diging through the level. It's a surprisingly long game, and there is a emphasis on co-op. Who doesn't want to rob banks with friends? Buy this game!
5105	1	a	Got this game as a gift from my friend during the winter sale. Played it together and I must say it was very fun. The first few levels are quite easy, but it gets harder pretty fast (or me and my friends just suck at coordinating). Have only played a few hours so far, but will probably spend many hours playing this with my friends.
5107	1	a	It's a fun little casual game that gives numerous replay opportunities.
5109	1	a	A geezer, a fat guy, a nerd, and a monkey walk into a bank....
5111	1	a	Awesome fast paced game, worth every cent and then some!
5113	1	a	Reminds me of Pacman......but with guns
5115	1	a	Great co-op stealth gameplay with friends. Tons of missions even though I don't mind playing missions ovewr again. Complete with an awesome soundtrack and a good story line.
5117	1	a	Good fun, really shines in multiplayer.
5119	1	a	Top-Notch!
5121	1	a	Great fun with friends. Definitely encompasses that feeling of 'nothing goes according to plan' in every mission.
5123	1	a	The most fun that can be had from this game is with 4 people, and it's even better if you know them and if you are talking to them. It can get complicated it there is no communication. I reccomend this game if you want to play with friends.
5125	1	a	IT*S CRIMETIME!
5127	1	a	I admit, I haven't been following Monaco's epic sucess story since the beginning (I actually bought the game on a whim after seeing all the raved reviews), but I do know a thing or two about the game's past. It's the winner of the IGF 2010 grand prize, and that was THE SAME IGF HOLDING FEZ AND THE BINDING OF ISAAC (I think). Now, it's a full-fledged game. The story is a classic story of a bunch of criminals trying to escape Monaco. Stealth is challenging, collecting all of the coins can make your life hell, and the characters all feel unique with specific designs and special abilities. The one thing I didn't like about the game was the art style, because, contrary to the popular belief, I feel that it only really worked for characters and not the environment. Overall, 9/10.
5129	1	a	very fun game, relaxing and casual
5131	1	a	Excellent game to play with your friends. Definitely worth the buy.
5133	1	a	What can I say about Monaco? Well the 2D graphics are simple extraficant and eye catching, smooth and beautiful and also fun to play with. Monaco is a puzzle solving game. One of my favorites.  But there are some faults. Like inactivity of NPC. I would love to see something like an NPC in the futher makings of the game. It just fustrates me how you have to play by your self (just one character with one ability) making it hard to solve levels, multiplayer (online people from around the globe) you'll probably get left behind if you suck online, and splitscreen, if you have no friends then thats a big downer.  If there were NPC you could solve the levels at you own pace, not getting left behind or waiting for others. You can solve it easily and enjoyably and you can have some friends! No their not real get a life.  But in all honesty this game is fully enjoyable and I fully reccomend it to everyone who loves to solve puzzles without the impossible challenges. Monaco earns a good 7/10. Great platformer and I cant wait to see the improvements in the upcomming years.
5135	1	a	Fun, simple, and challenging. That's all a game really needs to be.
5137	1	a	Creative, challenging, and fun. You should own it.
5139	1	a	Everyone should play this game! It is wonderful &lt;3
5141	1	a	Monaco has excellent trippy visuals that really apeal to my color sense. When I first got this game I thought of it as being a stealth/heist type game, but now that I have played it I understand the comment that I read about how it feels like a puzzle game.
5143	1	a	great multiplayer gaming experience!
5145	1	a	If you can find three friends, or even one, this game can be a perfect match for you! its just one of those games that is fun for everyone!
5147	1	a	Amazing game. Whether you want to take it slowly on your own or hop online for some of the most chaotic and unpredictable heists - get the game. Go watch a gameplay vid if it helps - screenshots and trailers don't really do it justice.
5149	1	a	What a game. Super fun with other people. It's great how it has community made missions so the game will last for a long time. For the cheap price it is right now, I recommend getting it, especially the 4 pack. It's practically the price of your lunch.
5151	1	a	So much fun with friends! Takes time to figure out how to work everything but once you get the hang of it it's awesome.
5153	1	a	Really amazing game to play locally with friends.  Perfect music too.
5155	1	a	Best for relaxing and passing your time
5157	1	a	Nice game. Extremely nice! For those who are wondering if Monaco will run on their Macbook: I can run it on my Macbook Pro 13' late 2011: CPU: i5 2.4GHz; GPU: Intel HD Graphics 3000 with about 300MB. Just have to switch graphics quality to low, but even then it still looks beautiful!
5159	1	a	A very good game, to play with friends
5161	1	a	Monaco has very simple mechanics: walk into things to use them, line of sight the gaurds/civs, and steal everything of value. The classes pretty much do the same thing as the next class can do but are specialized in some actions. Locksmith picks locks and safes fast, Pickpocket hides in bushes fast, etc etc. Some classes have special abilities as well, like Mole can dig into most walls, Redhead can charm enemies, etc etc.  Unlike most stealth games, Monaco doesn't end when you're seen. Your score isn't based on how stealthy you are, but how fast you cleared the level with coins missed adding time. It's a ton of fun when you're with 4 people, alarms are going off, and everybody is disorganized.  Despite the simple mechanics, it's a challenging game. Towards the end you're up against SWAT guys with shotguns who can pretty much 2-3 shot you from accross the room so STAY HIDDEN!  UPDATE DEC 21 '13: I should note that the game comes out with free updates. Last update came new game mechanics like pickpocketing keys off gaurds to unlock doors in the mission or 'buttcash' (people used to stand on top of coins, now they have wallets) which should have been in the game from the start but is in now. Last update also nerfed some of the difficulty in a lot of the missions in order to allow for all players to get through the game.
5163	1	a	Pac-Man meets Gauntlet in all the best ways!
5165	1	a	Monaco, is one of the most briliant pieces I've ever played. For once, this game actually requires teamwork and strategy, the soundtrack is amazing, the style is stylish, the visuals are stunning, and the gameplay overall is hilarious and provides loads of fun. It's unlike anything you've ever player. Mostly worth for the co-op, while the singleplayer can still provide a very nice experience. The community is amazing, and this game is one of the best I've ever played. Buy it. NOW.
5167	1	a	This game is pretty much the most amazing thing ever. Equal parts utter terror, intense frustration, careful planning, and excited exhilaration! Highly recommend; not for those who charge in without thinking, though.
5169	1	a	Fun. Probably better with more people.
5171	1	a	Monaco is good, if you have friends its good. play monaco, it has good good
5173	1	a	It is like like Legend of Zleda 4 swords. You need a friend to play it with to get the full experience and the public matchmaking is terrible.
5175	1	a	Monaco doesn't have great graphics, and if you're Chaide and you suck, the music isn't great either. However, Monaco offers a wonderful multiplayer experience. It's a simple game, the rules for most of the missions being to get in, get something, and get out. The way you handle doing that is entirely up to you, and they provide you a good sized selection of characters to accomplish your goal*  While it is 'entirely up to you', there's really only two things you're doing; you're either sneaking around, or you're running around all crazy because you didn't do the sneaking thing right. Still, a very fun experience that has you trying to plan ahead all your moves.  There's quite a lot of missions, too. Definitely takes a while to get through this game.  I think my biggest complaint may be the difficulty curve. Once you acquire all of the characters, the missions get hard fast. I recommend getting more players to assist, or get ready to have a very slow mission.  But at the end of it, it's a game I recommend because it's unique. It's hard to compare it to anything else, but it doesn't fail in what it was trying to accomplish. If you're into zany heists with friends, give this a shot if you aren't too turned off by the rudimentary sprites.  *I'm going to make an exception here for the pickpocket, who only seems to help with...your Time, I guess? Whatever money you miss picking up on the mission when you get out adds a lot of penalty to your final time, which is only really for bragging rights on leaderboards I guess. Pickpocket's pet monkey can sweep areas for money to assist with that, and ammo for your weapons. Overall though, you'd probably do better with some other character if you're focused on just the objective.
5177	1	a	The perfect combination of stealth, asymmetrical character design and wackiness.
5179	1	a	Great game and even better with friends. Missions are competetive to get the best time and not get seen and get all the coins.
5181	1	a	Very interesting game with cooperative)
5183	1	a	I recommend this game because itÂ´s not the usual type of game. It has a great multiplayer mode.
5185	1	a	It's no exaggeration when GameFront says that Monaco is a strong contender for Game of the Year. It may look like a simple game at first, but Monaco is the most fun you can have, alone or with friends. Multiple well-designed campaigns, a cast of quirky and sometimes lovable characters, and a terrific soundtrack make Monaco one of the must-have games of the year.
5187	1	a	Great multiplayer, you have to work as a team, if you dont everything gets screwed up and it all becomes crazy, running and freaking out. so much fun, deffently wotrth buying.
5189	1	a	Its a really fun game and great for a Inde game. However from time to time it can give you a couple issues (The Whole Screen is Issuey 
5191	1	a	Awesome Game. Nuff Said.
5193	1	a	Incredible game. Stealth, robbery, shotguns, emps, dogs, hacking - this game has it all and more. The multiplayer aspect is great if you have people with you that you know, and the push to talk being an xbox controller button is genius. Fantastic 2d strategy.
5195	1	a	A well made little stealth game. I really enjoy it and thats either by myself or online with matchmaking. I believe it can be even more fun playing it with voip and a gang of friends. There is some shooting envolved with this game but don't expect to have a gun on every mission. However you really don't need one. I recommend this game to any and everybody!
5197	1	a	This game shines in co-op (local and online). Stealthy, thoughtful approaches usually devolve in to absolute messes and tons of laughs. Already had a few memorable moments and I've only played a short time.
5199	1	a	Great game, tons of fun to play with friends, and a really cool soundtrack. Definitely recommend this game to anyone! Use a controller, the game is better with one.
5201	1	a	Really fun stealth co-op game.
5203	1	a	Genius coop game, very cool role system and gameplay mechanics. Definitely a recommendation!
5205	1	a	(Local) co-op is a lot of fun, the story is great. Once you've completed the game once, you can try and master all classes, get all trophies. Play online with a friendly community and see what strategies other people have come up with.
5207	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
5209	1	a	Don't be so dramatic, Troy. The answer is simple: We just have to plan an elaborate heist!
5211	1	a	Love this game. Best played with friends, but mostly oldschool arcade fun.
5213	1	a	this game combines simple and stunning visuals with a tense, professional atmosphere and gameplay. whether you're grinding through the levels by yourself or frantically robbing a bank with friends, this game is fun and addicting.
5215	1	a	It's a neat game with some interresting mechanics, and I can tell that this is one of the few games where 'more the merrier' will apply. Especially if you have a crew of friends where you can voice-chat the hilarity.  And if you find the game to have freakishly slow FPS, try uninstalling the game then re-installing it *ON THE C DRIVE' -- Or perhaps just moving the game from an external hard-drive to the C drive may fix it.  Previous Review: It looked exciting, and like it had some great humor to it My PC is quite over-qualified to run this game, and yet this game is practically unplayable. There is extreme input lag, and general sluggishness that gives a 'chug..... chug.... chug chug.... ch..... chuuuuuuuugggggg' feel to the game.  If it weren't for that, I could give a better, and more informative, review on the game.
5217	1	a	Straight up fun playing in multiplayer. Being under powered, the game really forces you to work as a team, which is rewarding when you work together.
5219	1	a	Great game, but to achieve maximum enjoyment you need to play with friends.
5221	1	a	it is a Tanelnted game that i would recommend, witch means try not to get cought by cops or anything related, or pve and try not to die
5223	1	a	A fun little stealth game. Horrible with singleplayer, but amazing with friends. It's entertaining to say the least.
5225	1	a	superb little game here - in fact little is the wrong word - it's got hours of endless fun!
5227	1	a	6/10  Was OK, not really my style. Liked how you have the option to complete each mission in different ways.
5229	1	a	great game, really fun, but especially in multiplayer. Recommended!!
5231	1	a	I've really enjoyed playing Monaco, both with my friends and solo. The diversity of characters and level-dynamics keep levels interesting, and gives the game a fair amount of replay value. This is not a shoot-em-up game. While some characters and items give you the ability to go head to head with guards, Monaco rewards patience and precision as a whole, so be prepared to wait things out and to spend a little bit of time hiding in stairwells and in the ducts. If sneaking, vibrant styling, and quirky character dynamics appeal to you, grab a couple of friends and play a few rounds. You won't be disappointed.
5233	1	a	Would only recommend if you've got friends, probably would kill myself if I played solo.
5235	1	a	Its good fun with friends for the price you pay
5237	1	a	definitely worth getting on sale, great to play if you have a group of four, but pretty bland to run it solo imo
5239	1	a	Really fun to play! I actually got into this from people playing it on youtube and it was worth every cent I spent! :) Definitly reccomend
5241	1	a	Monaco what yours is mine is a good 4 player co op game with a little fun story with cool characters  .The Locksmith: Blue-collar infiltration expert   .The Lookout: She can see and hear everything... a natural leader   .The Pickpocket: A hobo with a monkey and a penchant for crime   .The Cleaner: A silent psychopath... Jack The Ripper in pink   .The Mole: Big and dumb... likes to tunnel   .The Gentleman: He doesn't always wear a disguise, but when he does, he looks fantastic   .The Hacker: Armies of viruses shut down security... a modern day warlock   .The Redhead: Manipulative and murderous... a lady always gets what she wants  THIS GAME A 10 OUT OF 10
5243	1	a	Cooles Coop Game
5245	1	a	Lot's of fun, but don't play alone - it's rather difficult for one player.
5247	1	a	This game rocks. You have a couple of guys, they all got their specialty and you need to break in to houses/banks/exhibitions and all kinds of other places. Get in. Get the objective loot, and the coins if you want to get rich, or die trying. Get out. Multiplayer is as much fun, if not more than the singleplayer. I bought this game on the sale with 90% discount, but it has been so much fun it would have been worth my money without discount.
5249	1	a	It's a top down steath coop game. Something I would recommend for people who like steath and team work, rather then run and gun action.  each player can choose a class, all ahve their own special ability and running speed. you need to use their ability to get an advantage over obsticals. the game doesn't really allow you to to kill anyone unless you have a gun which you don't get much bullets in them and the only way to get more ammo for guns or anything you have equiped, you have to loot 10 things. Killing is not the objective, but stething and keeping the chaos at a minimum is the theme of the game. You want to be decreat is posible.  This game gets a 5 out of 5 for what it does. It does everything well
5251	1	a	Nice indiegame for short plays and fun.
5253	1	a	eh it was ok not amazing but pretty good
5255	1	a	Get during flash sale. Play with friends.
5257	1	a	This game is totally worth the money. The gameplay is unique and refreshing. The graphics/art style stand out and looks very nice. The soundtrack is ear-melting and catchy. The different game modes, time trial/ score run and characters add a lot of reasons to replay every last drop of content this game has to offer. Plus, there's custom user-made content to try if for some reason you get bored with the regular game. This game definitely deserves a lot more recognition than it's getting.
5259	1	a	You probably won't even be stealthy in co-op and do everything yourself.
5261	1	a	Monaco: The Heist is a co-op digging simulater where you go around and dig in buildings to collect money that is laying just about everywhere.    11/10 would dig again  Can you dig it?
5263	1	a	best to play with random newbie, yes, blow everything
5265	1	a	Dumb fun. A heist game where the consequences don't really matter. Set of an alarm? Did someone die? Hide in a vent, hide in a doorway, wait, revive, continue. Different characters/classes allow you to approach things differently but you'll probably find yourself using the same classes over and over again and some are definitely more useful than others. Story is rather convoluted and I lost track early on but that didn't seem to really matter, as the story has little importance once the level loads. I guess a way to approach the game might be to try and do each heist 'perfect'. Or it can just be dumb fun. The art design and perspective used in the game can also make things more confusing than necessary as well. Either way, I'd only recommend on discount.
5267	1	a	Fairly simple: Get in. Get the goods. Get out. Couldn't possibly mess that up, right?  Wrong.   You can. You will. And you will have fun doing so.   Insanely fun, Monaco is a multiplayer game featuring a top-down view. You can collect various weapons/tools in the game to help you get the goods and get out, Each playble character has their own skills to bring to the table. Some of them are more useful than others, but arguably they all have different callings/playstyles; you just need to figure out which one works best for you and on which map.   Note that this is best played with friends. Although you can solo some of the maps, keep in mind that the game was designed around the idea that you'll be playing with other people, so you'll need multiple skills being brought to the table to ease your mission. You might want to be in call to coordinate efforts.   Have fun stealing stuff and breaking the law.
5269	1	a	You'll find yourself in hilariously chaotic situations when playing with friends, totally recommendable.
5271	1	a	Multiplayer, top-down, stelth thief game. Sort of team reliant but can be really fun with friends. 9/10
5273	1	a	6/10  Was OK, not really my style. Liked how you have the option to complete each mission in different ways.
5275	1	a	A great art style and fun main mechanic. a good variety of characters and is a generally fun game. 8.5/10
5277	1	a	The world needs more games like Monaco.  Monaco is easy to learn, yet challenging enough to hold my interest. It has a nice polished finished and was given the care every game dev should give their games. Monaco is couch co-op, which is always a plus, and it has it's own unique enviroment and atmosphere which really immerses you in the game world. I even found the story to be compelling, despite that story only be a few lines of text between levels. I became attached to specific characters and their personas.   My only complaint is that the AI can seem simple at times. For example, if I am caught via alarm and then seen by a guard, but I manage to escape then all is well. I feel their should be an option for the AI to change behavior if an alarm is sounded or a player is seen. It would be neat if SWAT showed up when you set off the alarm at a casino.  9/10 - Only because the AI can isn't as dynamic as I would like it to be, but considering the type of game it is and the fact that nearly every other aspect of the game is amazing, I can overlook this flaw almost as quickly as I notice it.
5279	1	a	A fun little stealth game. Horrible with singleplayer, but amazing with friends. It's entertaining to say the least.
5281	1	a	4 player coop makes this game full of robbing, heisting, escape and betrayal all the better. A+ would play again and again
5283	1	a	Broke into a house and used their toilet. Then hid in a bush. 10/10
5285	1	a	This is a fun, exciting game. It's not Payday, nor is it Left 4 Dead, but it's a fast paced multiplayer experience just the same. While it may be tough to get into if you're not used to overhead 2D graphics, it's quite enjoyable once you get used to it.  My main greivance is the lack of a single player mode, and that you need to play with others. If you're as bad as I am, it's embarrasing to die in front of others. Yet, I understand that programming AI for a heist game is pretty tough, and must be even more so for indie devs.  If you're not into playing face paced, quick games; this is not the game for you. However, if you're willing to give it a try, you'll find this game to be more than enjoyable, and what it lacks in a single player mode, it more than makes up for in the artistic sytle and captivating environment and music it provides.  Overall, I give it a 4.25/5.
5287	1	a	Another game that I love
5289	1	a	Pretty good, but lacks content
5291	1	a	The game is full of fun and is worth the dollar an hour cost, because of the mods added.
5293	1	a	Fast paced and crazy while maintaining a level of strategy, this game is fantastic. The multiplayer is where it especially excels. The cast of characters each has a unique feel and are suited for different approaches to getting through the level. All of this with an excellent musical backing. Watch some co-op here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oTlS5wQG0cuqhlYsE7mY0z 
5295	1	a	This is a fun little co-op game, as long as you have a friend or two to play it with. Otherwise it's not worth a damn.  Final Verdict 3 out of 5
5297	1	a	Despite the simple graphics and gameplay, this game have a lot of potential and will be one of my good game in my library.
5299	1	a	Realy fun with 4 friends.
5301	1	a	I think some people will like this game but its not for me. I only played about 10 missions and it just didnt grab me in any meaningful way. I dont think its a bad game so it stills gets a thumbs up. Its kind of like Hotline Miami with less challenge and tension.
5303	1	a	crazy insane co-op action, definately buy the four pack get some friends together and enjoy
5305	1	a	Fun game; can get tricky with more than 3 people
5307	1	a	Get during flash sale. Play with friends.
5309	1	a	Fun with friends - be sure to buy the 4-pack! This game is definitely more engaging with company.
5311	1	a	The most fun I've had playing co-op in years. Solo challenges are fun but best with 2-3 friends running around the level causing havoc and rushing through and grabbing all the gold. Such a blast. Buy it and text me. I'll play it again and again.
5313	1	a	You can pee in toilets.  10/10
5315	1	a	Really nice game to play with your friends :)
5317	1	a	WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half-â™¥â™¥â™¥ review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess. It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck. Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must be something behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includes different amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats. Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine. *OPENS THE GAME* Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is. Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcade no that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing  the game you went like,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include  them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPC with the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll already be there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the place I just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero! Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half-â™¥â™¥â™¥ now they were too  lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get. Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaÅŸ.Almost forgot,since the developers are too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy to get a minimap at the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understand how much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer. Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everything you wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked. WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from  freesounds.org?  Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining. By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either. That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  NO GOD! PLEASE NO!!! NOOOOOOOOOO&nbsp;
5319	1	a	A very fun Indle/Stealth/Heist game like PAYDAY 2. I suggest it for playing Co-Op with your friends!!
5321	1	a	A cheap game that's not too hard to pick up, but it's still plenty of fun to play with friends.
5323	1	a	This game is awsome! Everybody must buy 
5325	1	a	Reminiscent of old school top view games action adventure games. Play as multiple characters with different abilities that influence the way you complete the game. Best with multiple people.
5327	1	a	Multiplayer and co-op modes of thieves, hilarious storyline. Best played together with friends.
5329	1	a	Quite hard in the later levels but i like a challenge and this is a good stealthy game so i reccomend this game :P Also it's a fun game to play with friends
5331	1	a	Fun with friends.
5333	1	a	One hell of a fun game that can turn into a chaotic disaster if done without teamplay!  exactly what i was looking for :)
5335	1	a	I open the van and step into the light drizzle of rain. A bolt of lightning flashes, illuminating the grand museum that holds artefacts that wait to be stolen. The rest of my group, The Lookout, The Locksmith, and The Pickpocket, stand by my side. I smile sinisterly, 'Lets go rob a museum.' 
5337	1	a	Most fun with friends, awesome game!
5339	1	a	It's great. Stealth gameplay done right, and it's co-op, including offline co-op if you plug in a game pad.
5341	1	a	'I AM THE MOLE.'
5343	1	a	Honestly, this game is worth buying. even though it may appear simple, its complexity grows as you progress through the game, and when teaming up with friends, heists become a lot more interesting and interactive. probably one of the best indie-games in my opinion and is quite a refreshing casual game.   10/10
5345	1	a	Massacrate one floor,steal all the money and activate all alarms    Get to the other floor,no one gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 10/10
5347	1	a	very fun, but only if you have other people to play with.
5349	1	a	If you like old school graphics, and a cat/mouse type game, then this is for you. Id say 7/10 ... Not bad, can be a bit hectic.
5351	1	a	This game is insanely fun as, especially when playing with friends, as you try to escape Monaco with all the money trophism and without being seen (hopefully).  Overall, Monaco offers a great experience!
5353	1	a	Amazing game. Music, plot, art, gameplay, multiplayer, singleplayer, workshop, everything about Monaco is a 10/10.
5355	1	a	Good multiplayer, interesting concept, and the most important, FUN!
5357	1	a	Its great because you can choose how you want to play: Do you want nobody to notice you? Do you want to finish the level as fast as Sanic? well you can... Infact you can be sanic and be stealthy.
5359	1	a	
5361	1	a	wow that game is AWSOME!!!!!!
5363	1	a	One of the best local co-op games to have!
5365	1	a	Great multiplayer, you have to work as a team, if you dont everything gets screwed up and it all becomes crazy, running and freaking out. so much fun, deffently wotrth buying.
5367	1	a	Its a really fun game and great for a Inde game. However from time to time it can give you a couple issues (The Whole Screen is Issuey 
5369	1	a	Killing people and robbing places all in a smal 2D game
5371	1	a	this is interesting......
5373	1	a	Monaco doesn't have great graphics, and if you're Chaide and you suck, the music isn't great either. However, Monaco offers a wonderful multiplayer experience.

Whatever money you miss picking up on the mission when you get out adds a lot of penalty to your final time, which is only really for bragging rights on leaderboards I guess. Pickpocket's pet monkey can sweep areas for money to assist with that, and ammo for your weapons. Overall though, you'd probably do better with some other character if you're focused on just the objective.
5375	1	a	The best coop-indie game ever!!
5377	1	a	Utterly amazing co-op play.
5379	1	a	Looks good, fun to play, cheap. Overal just a great game. You should really get it.
5381	1	a	it is great with friends
5383	1	a	Monaco is a top down stealth based game that is insane amounts of fun to play with friends or even by yourself if you like a challenge. There are several different characters with special abilities that can be used to great affect. If you enjoy stealth based games, thief games, or even strong co-op games, then Monaco is a must buy. Get your friends together to enjoy some 4 player looting.
5385	1	a	it s fun to play ,great strategy game
5387	1	a	Must collect... ALL TEH COINZ!!!
5389	1	a	Have owned since last summerand everyone seeing this sale on it NEEDS TO BUY IT. BEST CO-OP GAME EVAR.
5391	1	a	Interesting game to play with friends because there are a max of 4 players and each character only has one ability meaning the levels are much easier if you have more players to perform different tasks. If you're looking for a relaxing co-op game, then give this a shot.
5393	1	a	fun, good difficulty, not so hard you want to put your fist through your screen, but just enough to make it fun.
5395	1	a	This game is pretty fun. The early levels are too easy but one the difficulty ramps up lots of fun is had. Best played with friends
5397	1	a	Spoon is best class.
5399	1	a	Very fun game. At first I was a little unsure about the very simple graphics and top down view, but it works really well and is very crisp/stylistically appealing. My friend and I have fun trying to play stealthily and sneak past guards, but we quickly learned there are some levels where it's just easier to run around like a chicken with its head cut off; both approaches are very fun. Also there are cute small touches that add personality, like the guard character who keeps popping up in every level writing an email to his family why he got fired from his previous job. Really enjoying it so far, A+ .
5401	1	a	Great game, great fun...though I am a little less stealthy than required to play this game. :)
5403	1	a	There is a hidden dinosaur following you.
5405	1	a	I love this game! 10/10
5407	1	a	This game is not dissapointing. i thought i would want to try it and then refund it but no its actually REALLY fun i love it its like payday but in 2d
5409	1	a	This game allows me to steal money and murder people, both legally.   If you've ever had terrible urges to do these things but don't fancy serving multiple sentences in prison, go ahead and buy Monaco.   Your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will thank you later.
5411	1	a	This game is just pure of joy and excitement for group of friends who would love to chill and enjoy playing together i would totally recommend this game ! :D enjoy
5413	1	a	Awesome coop game. Gather your friends and steal the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the places. What to say more. Enjoy! ;)
5415	1	a	This game is too fun to exist. Why doesn't everyone have this?
5417	1	a	Its everything I could want in a heist game. You have to plan out and be smart about your moves or just run out and leeroy jenkins it like a real desperate thief. You also have to decide which character is the right one for the job or for the team.  It gets harder and harder ever level that you'll spend hours on it.  Their accents are also hilarious!  -Le Guard
5419	1	a	Fantastic multiplayer game with fun level design and characters. 9/10
5421	1	a	This is probally the dankest â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ive played in a year I literally flew from my chair and became god -IGN 10/10
5423	1	a	what an awesome game!!!!!!!
5425	1	a	I just couldnâ€™t get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâ€™s not a bad game at all, just wasnâ€™t for me.   Iâ€™d consider Monaco a stealth puzzle game. You have several different characters each with a special ability. Itâ€™s played in a top down view with the trick being you can only see where you are looking and the other areas are blank.   This limited view leads to a lot of enemy and trap surprises which was a real turn off. There is a character to alleviate this problem but it felt unfair to me overall.   The game is based around sneaking and not being seen but many times I completed levels just by running through collecting the coins and then escaping the enemyâ€™s line of site. Basically, I didnâ€™t care enough to sneak around when running around produced passable results  Bottom line: The story and mechanics are there but I just couldnâ€™t get into it. I only played about 11 missions before calling it quits as my frustration level was getting up there at that point. I ultimately felt like the characters I could play as didnâ€™t allow me to complete the levels efficiently and how I want to do it.   It includes a level editor and an easy way to play user created levels so that is a big bonus for replay value and fresh content.   Even though I didn't do co-op play I wanted to mention it may be more fun and engaging with a friend.   I feel that I didnâ€™t play this game enough to give it a pros and cons list so Iâ€™ll leave that part out of my review. Same goes with a final score.
5427	1	a	This game is awesome. I love that you can play it stealthy and strategically, but you can get ammo and shoot everyone or run around going YOLO. (not with the automated machines. dont do that QQ) The music is really fun, the guards are really funny (does this brush look a bit awkward? *looks at the potted plant containing 3 people and 5 corpses* nah.)  The story is witty, the modes are fun, there are a lot of workshop content that you can play after the campaign. I also have to add that I loved the crunching sounds made by the cleaner when you 'crush' a victim. You can play it alone, but co op makes it really fun, especially pvp is a blast! (especially if you have c4)   It's not difficult or complicated, but it's challenging and fun. You can do a mission different ways, for example you can just sit by the electricity switch(?) and wait for all the guards on the floor come by one by one to turn it on and 'crunch' them all!
5429	1	a	6/10-A great experience but get it in a sale
5431	1	a	It's a top-down, stealth, arcade Payday! Play with friends for maximum enjoyment; Have funzies~
5433	1	a	A game of hiesting,sneaking/killing,and funny missions where you can disquise or kill with an arsenal of weapons.Completing levels with the silent touch using smoke bombs and disquises or just use the gentlemen to make a duisquise while hidden,But you can always go in guns ablazing well after finding a gun first.
5435	1	a	10/10
5437	1	a	its the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr i will bye the full vershon when it comes out  
5439	1	a	one of the best games; i got it for 2 days to try it and after i purchased it at sales
5441	1	a	A brilliant game.  Hard to do be yourself, hillarious with others.  You will find yourself in a level with 3 other people, being stealthy, robbing people blind without them knowing. Then suddenly... An alarm More alarms sound of gunfire and then your teammate runs through the door, spraying the area behind them with bullets and continues running, followed closely by a pack of dogs, some guards, some agents and some guy wielding an RPG  *Cannonfodder1995 has been shot by a gaurd*     10/10 would hide in the bush again
5443	1	a	Payday in 2d pixel version. 10/10
5445	1	a	Fantastic both when it comes to graphic style and sound. Very interesting and demanding gamplay which requires strict cooperation. Highly recommending it to everyone!
5447	1	a	Been playing it for the last two weeks. Brilliant attention to detail, both graphically and musically. It also taught me some French.
5449	1	a	WELCOME! FlamerJoe here with the half-â™¥â™¥â™¥ review of 8bit-MMO since you wanted me to review this piece of junk,I have to do it...I guess. It is made by the quote 'company' quote called Archive Entertainment.Which seems to be owner of the previous games like..Nothing.What the duck. Before,I actually start the review of this game I will see what I can see from store page,uh it is free to play that seems fine but there must be something behind this greatness...UH THERE IT IS! STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK BASIC aand as you guys asked for it STEAM FOUNDER'S PACK DELUXE which includes different amounts of gold and plats and exclusive hats!Waow,I mean everyone likes hats. Alright let's not keep our expections high and we should be fine. *OPENS THE GAME* Alright,so game asks me to create an account even though I am connected to this game through steam,that means nothing to the game.Oh there it is. Select a Server...There are 2 servers I guess Primary and Potato!?!..*sighs*....Aight whatever.OH...MY...GOD..This looping music,it is so...arcade no that is not the word,so annoying,yeah that is right.There better be a mute option for this music,oh there we go.Wait a minute..That graphic oh my god,is that 3d or 2d I mean while you were developing  the game you went like,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it let's mix them up oh by the way let's fool these idiots by calling this game 8-bit and MMO but let's not include  them all HAHAHAH- alright.Hmm W,A,S,D = Movement E= Use Door/ Talk THIS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL SEGMENT EVER! No not really.Alright let's talk to this NPC with the quote 'tutorial' bubble.Go on.Head up through those doors and speak with me in the kichen.*SARCASTIC VOICE* No' don't ask me how I'll already be there when you arrive. Shh. HAH DID YOU SEE THAT IS HUMOOOOOR NO,JUST NO PLEASE GOD NO.Alright this guy seems to be 2 meters in front of the place I just was.Hmm let's check what he gotta see..You survived the great and treacherous journey to my kitchen.Truly you are brave enough to be the hero! Etc,etc,now get out.Oh the developers of the game did not just call this game player-created world and made the enviroment half-â™¥â™¥â™¥ now they were too  lazy to write a dialouge between me and the NPC.That is it ladies and gentelmen,this is what we get. Alrighty,I got my first quest which is to slay 5 Slugs and come back.How originaÅŸ.Almost forgot,since the developers are too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy to get a minimap at the corner of your screen they just tell the locations of these objects,NPC's,enemies simply like Head to pantry (south-east),I can finally understand how much hardwork went in to this game but if you are looking for a map you could simply click map BEFORE you enter the game from servers section and get a GOOGLE EARTH style map from your internet explorer. Alright there is one slug,let's attack him,hmm.. space bar to attack with your sword.What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,did I just poke it with my sword and it just faded away in a paint of red.WAOW,you get everything you wish for.And those sound effects there are only 2 kind of SOUND EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE GAME, and that is the sound you get from attacking or getting attacked. WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE ATTACK SOUNDS from  freesounds.org?  Oh my god this humor in this game would be better if it did NOT exist.So after I choose respawn (root) I get teleported to a place kind of like lobby where I see RobbyZ the guy from the beggining. By the way there are no in-game real characters so developers decided to put their nicknames in the game because you know it is more harder that way to make a decent story or maybe even a decent townkeeper.NO.HAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA.Alright let's not go that harsh on the game maybe player made world is actually made better than those developer's intro buildings lobby and that kind of stuff.So I am simply going to uninstall this game so I won't go harsh on it and It won't be able to go harsh on me either. That is it ladies and gents! As a result:I would say OH GOD PLEASE NO PLEASE OH GOD NOOOOO (OFFICE)         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  NO GOD! PLEASE NO!!! NOOOOOOOOOO&nbsp;
5451	1	a	Endearing and frantic, this is definitely worth your time, if maybe not the standard price.
5453	1	a	this game is worth IGN:10/10 i love it so mutch
5455	1	a	Monaco is one of those rare multiplayer experiences where everything goes from ok to 'everythings on fire, and all we have is oil to put it out' and you love every minute of it.   The characters you choose from each have their own unique strengths, and often you'll find yourself choosing a specific one that matches your playstyle.   The music is very well done, changing based on the situation but never feeling intrusive.   Lastyly i've never joked about chloroforming people as often as i have in this game. If you have a good group of friends and you want a solid co-op experience buy this game.

5459	1	a	Fun top-down Ocean's Eleven simulator where nothing is left to chance. Although guards and civilians are dense and forgetful you'll have a hard time bypassing sensors, dogs, turrets and other death-dealing devices public buildings shouldn't have. Very good and forgiving difficulty curve although you'll need some brute force (C4 and guns) to wipe out obstacles in the last levels; especially if you're playing solo. Great for couch co-op but the graphics are so tiny and detailed you'll want to push your couch a little closer to the TV.
5461	1	a	Fun game playing four friends co-op.
5463	1	a	quite an entertaining game need to be played with frineds
5465	1	a	Monaco is original and exciting, but it also makes you think. Moreover, if you are similar to me, it will make you jump. A lot. There's not thrill greater than being chased through an international bank or a mental hospital by a security guard who is intent on beating you up. This game satisfies that need.
5467	1	a	Regular heist games are tense, they make you feel like every move you make could ruin the whole operation. Regular heist games have a specific play style in which you must be stealthy to gain each objective while avoiding numerous guards and alarms. You could play this game like that, buy when you play this games with three of your friends and run around the level with a train of guards around you setting off every alarm just so that you can get to those coins you so desperatly need and then finding that your friends have similar trains and you converge them into one super train from which two of you will die and then, when the only two players left alive reach the stairwell and realise that the others must be saved to progress, only then do you realise how ridiculously amazing this game is. Also speaking the voices, Quoi?
5469	1	a	A very fun Indle/Stealth/Heist game like PAYDAY 2. I suggest it for playing Co-Op with your friends!!
5471	1	a	My friend bought me this game i thought its some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ BUT !!!!! its rly funny this game is nice coop game i love payday and this is as good as payday the idea is rly good !
5473	1	a	I like and respect this game. Unfortunately, a lot of the multiplayer community is gone, which leaves the cooperative aspect fairly limited.  Edit: The multiplayer community comes and goes when this game goes on sale.  Why I like it: Gameplay is how you choose to play, which gives a great open environment feel that lets an action game be an adventure game if you want it to be. As you progress into the story, there's a lot of flexibility on how you can play, which even furthers this feeling of open environment. Almost anything can be destroyed or mined through, and can, in some regards, be looked at as a scaled down, 2D version of Payday.  Why I respect it: This game is the embodiment of the idea that not all great games need great models. A lot of the game is basic pixels scaled up. There are no flashy skins or gorgeous maps.   The atmosphere fits the game perfectly, and playing it just feels right. It's hard to explain why this game feels good to play - stealth, fighting, sneaking around, all packed into an 8-bit-style game about robbery.  As a single player experience, it's not bad. But where this game really shines is multiplayer.
5475	1	a	Very fun game if you like robbing stores and running away from cops
5477	1	a	its the best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr i will bye the full vershon when it comes out  
5479	1	a	The only problem with this game is you can't get the god damn amazing soundtrack.
5481	1	a	I love the stealth aspects of this game, it is very fun and has lots and lots of replayability due to all the things that you can do in this game. It is also very fun to play this game on co-op and I love the different skills that each character can have. I would reccomend this game to anybody who is lokking for a stealth game.
5483	1	a	The time I spent on this game speaks for me. Very good game, in my opinion as good in solo than in multiplayer. Wonderful team of developers, very active and attentive. The level editor is amazing, so the quality of the workshop maps is excellent. New content is also added regularly: for example, a new campaign is coming. My favorite game of 2013, definitely.
5485	1	a	Great couch co-op, great music, nothing to complain about.
5487	1	a	I just couldnâ€™t get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâ€™s not a bad game at all, just wasnâ€™t for me.

5489	1	a	this game is great even more fun with friends. if you dont like this something is wrong with you 
5491	1	a	Very fun game that is best played co-op.
5493	1	a	Great game, i thought that it has done what a lot of new games are failing to do and actually grab the audience and drag them in and make them want to play the game. Very good game and it makes you want to play a lot more. Great story mode.
5495	1	a	The main menu is pretty fantastic. And the shotguns have sound effects. 10/10
5497	1	a	If you can read this i reccomend buying this game!!!!!!!
5499	1	a	9/10 disapointed by laser shark 
5501	1	a	Steal stuff the game!  Or fight your friends to steal stuff in versus modes!  Or ZOMBIES!  this is an interesting topdown stealth game which i normally hate but this game is great learning the roles of the characters is important for team missions I like THE CLEANER the most just knockin people out!  I highly recommend this game!
5503	1	a	What's fun: retro-graphics, co-operative multiplayer and varied level designs and goals. It's a challenge and you'll probably spend some time learning how to be any good at it - if you can find anyone else patient enough to play with you, that is. Entertaining soundtrack and plenty of roles to choose from - the only things to lose are what you steal from everyone else.
5505	1	a	It's a very nice game if you wants a puzzel-game to play with youre friends. You can play it in singel player mode, but the co-op makes the game.  
5507	1	a	Fun to play with a friend.Nice style.Nice Gameplay.Story is nothing special but the concept is cool.  7/10
5509	1	a	Monaco is a neon-blooded marriage of Pac-Man and Thief, a grand tribute both to 1920s silent comedy capers and to modern-day heist movies. It's Ocean's Eleven meets Keystone Cops, played out top-down in a world of living blueprints. It's a criminal take on Laurel and Hardy, except with a four-man band instead of the dysfunctional duo. By and large, Monaco is one of those rare games that somehow stay magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right or your mission has turned into an eight-lane car crash.  'Monaco stays magnificent regardless of whether you're getting things right.' And crashes of the non-software-related variety will happen in abundance. With Monaco's minimal approach to player guidance, the only way you're going to figure anything out is through trial and disaster. Have a Hacker (one of the game's many playable characters) interact with a power outlet and watch as sensors go out and security cameras turn friendly. Walk across a red panel and discover that there are, indeed, pressure plates connected to the security system.  The missions are all performed to a similar tune: get in, get the prize, get out. Or, in some instances, simply get out. You start in a safe area of the level, surrounded by items that you can take along with you. Once you've selected your weapon (or non-combat item of choice), it is your prerogative to determine what 'getting in' will actually entail. Do you cut through a queue at the local nightclub or do you sneak through a locked door on the other side? Though all the levels operate in largely the same way, there's sufficient diversity in the contents of each to make every playthrough outright enthralling. Should you circle around the main area of the map and inch towards the safe on the third floor, or do you take a quick detour through the guard-infested inventory room? (Hint: don't do that second one.) Your choice, your years behind bars, monsieur.
5511	1	a	Really fun game, still kinda challenging though. Takes skill and is better with friends
5513	1	a	It's a really fun game to play with friends, you don't have to be really good at games to get the hang of Monaco, you can find a person that fits your playstyle and stick with it and have fun.
5515	1	a	dear devs BEST GAME EVOR and i luve the sound track plz make it a dlc that i can buy 
5517	1	a	A really fun and unique stealth game. It's primarily a co-op experience, but can be played solo. Quite a few characters(classes) to choose from, tons of heists(community made ones as well), all with a neat style. Lots of replay value.
5519	1	a	Monaco is original and exciting, but it also makes you think. Moreover, if you are similar to me, it will make you jump. A lot. There's not thrill greater than being chased through an international bank or a mental hospital by a security guard who is intent on beating you up. This game satisfies that need.
5521	1	a	Great game with so many ways to play. You can choose how you go through the game
5523	1	a	A game that requires true teamwork to get threw each individual heist.   8.8/10
5525	1	a	I like this game, the levels are good, the music is great, but it's much better with friends!
5527	1	a	I played the demo, and despite being moderately difficult, I enjoyed it. Overall, it was a good play, and if you enjoy Hotline Miami, you should definitely buy it. It's sort of like a fast-paced stealth shooter, it requires a lot of skill, and is good paired with a sunny afternoon of Portal and possibly some tea. Overall, I'd have to give this game a 9/10. Also, HAPPY HALLOWEEN!
5529	1	a	Monaco, with your simple-yet-stunning aesthetics, atmospheric sound effects and music, tight gameplay, brilliant mechanics, and excellent longevity, the only thing you have stolen... is my heart.  Caveat: I've never played this game solo, but boy is this strategic heist game fantastic with friends. Once you've finished the main narrative, and tried out all the gameplay options via multiple characters -- characters whose traits grant them a unique ability -- then play the many missions added by the developers. Or make your own. Or download more from the workshop.  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by the developers. Bravo.
5531	1	a	trust me...it looks complicated but its super easy. its also fun to play with friends !!
5533	1	a	great game. i cannot say more.
5535	1	a	Oh my god. Monaco is possibly one of my favorite games to just pick up and play. The early levels are usually 5-10 minutes, with most levels being about 20 minutes, and maybe 30 minutes on the later levels. The game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in solo. Don't buy it to play alone. If you're going to buy this game, make sure some friends have it too. Each character has a special skill, all of which are useful for the current situation. (Except the Pickpocket and Locksmith, they're only good for a speedrun)  There are 4 chapters, each told by a different character, and each one escalating in difficulty from the last. Notably, there are 3 versions of every level- Monaco 2013 has the original levels before updates were made, and Zonaco replaces all NPCs with zombies. The entire game is orchestrated by Austin Wintory's fantastic soundtrack(Discotheque Rouge is the best), and let's be honest, how many games feature ragtime in their soundtrack?
5537	1	a	this is addicting game!
5539	1	a	Wonderful game, lots of fun to be had. I especially enjoy the disguises where you can move around undetected for a small amount of time. Thoroughly enjoyed this so far. Recommended!!!!!
5541	1	a	Hackersaretooover-poweredforyoufriend. 10/10
5543	1	a	Lots of thought put into gameplay and story and maps.  Good game.
5545	1	a	Fun. Good gameplay, ignored story.
5547	1	a	Enjoyable graphics and gameplay, and it's a blast to play with friends. I found it boring while playing solo, so wait for a sale, buy a four-pack, and guilt your friends in to playing it with you.  Side note: Purchasing this through the Humble Store comes with a Steam key and DRM-free version of the game.
5549	1	a	great game. i cannot say more.
5551	1	a	this is addicting game!
5553	1	a	Want to run around screaming? Want to panic and hide in the bushes? Want to dig with your freedm spoon?   Play monaco. With Friends of course.
5555	1	a	Four player Stealth/Shoot Them Up. fun.
5557	1	a	This game is awesome. The gameplay, the music, the pixelized astetics, everything. Granted, this game is best played with friends, but if you have the patience to get through the game, each level you finish becomes one you can play with whoever is hosting that level.  The Heists are fun and have a good learning curve. You can mess around all you want at the start, and even the slightest wrong move will kill you in the last levels. My favorite aspect of the game is the PvP. One on one, the gameplay is very tactical, and stratigic, if you're killed holding all the trophies, then you've basically lost. If you have the fortune to get in a lobby with two or three other people, then a riot will ensue, unless you've honed your skills, you will be constantly killed, and constanty be killing the other players. Matches can last a long time and be utterly epic when you win. Like others have said, get the four pack, and share it with your friends, or if you don't have any, just wait around for open lobbys to pop up. You won't regret it. (The music is epic too)

5563	1	a	Chaotic fun  Monaco is a 2D-top down, stealth game developed by Pocketwatch game. The premise of the game is simple. You and a your team are need to rob the area of specific treasure, which is found in the later levels of the stage, and then escape. The problem you have to face however are gaurds, dogs, lazers, helicopters etc which are trying to stop you. There are eight characters that you can play as which each have a unique trait, for instance the gentleman can disguise himself to avoid detection, while the locksmith can unlockdoors and vents the quickest.  In single player, there are four campaigns which tells the story of a group of thieves and the variest heists they commit. Each campaign has various levels to choose from and you unlock new leves and campaigns as you complete the previous ones. When you get killed in singleplayer, you switch to one of the other seven characters. When all your characters have died, the mission ends and you have to restart the level. The levels are well designed, having plenty of places to hide in such as vents and bushes and various routes to reach the objective. You can also find items/weapons such as shotguns,machine guns (which have limited ammo) to help deal with the gaurds as well as diguises, smoke bomb and health kits. The sound is fantastic, playing quiet music when stealth and panicky music when your alrms ring and your being chased by gaurds. The weapons sound good as well. there is no voice acting in the game, with the story told through text.   The multiplayer is where the game truely shines. You can play the campaign mission with up to seven other players. Each player chooses one of the eight roles available. When one of the players dies, they need to be revived by another player to continue playing and progress to the next stage of the level. Things get pretty fun and hilarious when alarms ring and you or another player are running around like headless chooks trying to hide from the gaurds who are chasing you down.  I highly recommend this game to players you love team based stealth games. 
5565	1	a	Monaco has the foundations of a great co-op heist game. Each character has a special ability and quirky attitude, and when you have 2-4 people working together, the cooperative stealth in this game truly makes it fun. The music is absolutely delightful to listen to with the push and pull of the cautious environment. There are many different playing options in levels and style of playing too. It definitey has something great going here.  But, there is one thing I find a little annoying and odd. When I started playing, I was expecting there to be some sort of brief on each mission; map layout, special persons, particular weapons/traits, just something to predetermine some strategy. This is a heist game after all.   To be fair though it's not that big of a deal, but it would save me time in having to put up with a rather really slow and overly cautious play through, or, a hectic and rushed one, just so I can get some strategy down.  8/10
5567	1	a	10/10
5569	1	a	Incredible Fun! Excellent Co-Op action in a fun Retro style.
5571	1	a	Great game fun solo better with friends. Not for people interested in story it's all about gameplay with a choice of just rushing it or being a stealthy ninja.
5573	1	a	High quality fun
5575	1	a	Someone bought this for me during a sale and I have to say that I didn't expect to enjoy it. But I did. The game itself is great; I love the art style and the way that the whole thing feels. But the thing that made it for me is the soundtrack. This Ragtime-French-Criminal style of music fits so well with every level and I adored every note of it. Fantastic.
5577	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
5579	1	a	So I first played this game on an Xbox 360 and LOVED IT. This game is even up there to compete with games such as Payday 2 and other big titles. 11/10 -IGN would recommend again.
5581	1	a	10/10 would write review again
5583	1	a	One of the most fun co-op games I've played. Especially with four players the game will become quite intense and chaotic experience with laughter assured. There are many details that make the game fun - atmosphere, music, sound effects and general feel of light hearted fun. Recommended!
5585	1	a	I wish I had someone to play with ;-;
5587	1	a	Very fun, and filled with strategy! That or you can run in head first and blow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up but it wont end well. Violence never ends well with Monaco.
5589	1	a	Great game to play with friends
5591	1	a	I didn't expect it but this is one of the most intresting games. Its so simple but so fun at the same time. And so many ways to do something simple and all roles are useful.
5593	1	a	Monaco is the best strategy indie game out there especially playing co-op! Love the different characters/classes to play as. Not really worth $15 so best buy it when it's on sale. Overall, can't really say anything bad about it!
5595	1	a	Dis a gud stealh game.
5597	1	a	A great local multiplayer game, me and my friends have had hours of fun playing this in the past.
5599	1	a	AWESOME GOT IT FROM STEAM FAMLIY SHARING SOOOOOOOOO GOOD
5601	1	a	I love this game but can never get 3 people to play!
5603	1	a	I just couldnâ€™t get into Monaco. I still give it a thumbs up because I can see why this game would be liked. Itâ€™s not a bad game at all, just wasnâ€™t for me.   Iâ€™d consider Monaco a stealth puzzle game. You have several different characters each with a special ability. Itâ€™s played in a top down view with the trick being you can only see where you are looking and the other areas are blank.   This limited view leads to a lot of enemy and trap surprises which was a real turn off. There is a character to alleviate this problem but it felt unfair to me overall.   The game is based around sneaking and not being seen but many times I completed levels just by running through collecting the coins and then escaping the enemyâ€™s line of site. Basically, I didnâ€™t care enough to sneak around when running around produced passable results  Bottom line: The story and mechanics are there but I just couldnâ€™t get into it. I only played about 11 missions before calling it quits as my frustration level was getting up there at that point. I ultimately felt like the characters I could play as didnâ€™t allow me to complete the levels efficiently and how I want to do it.   It includes a level editor and an easy way to play user created levels so that is a big bonus for replay value and fresh content.   Even though I didn't do co-op play I wanted to mention it may be more fun and engaging with a friend.   I feel that I didnâ€™t play this game enough to give it a pros and cons list so Iâ€™ll leave that part out of my review. Same goes with a final score.
5605	1	a	I like the game but for me it sadly won't work properly... I tried every fix but nothing worked so far and the game freezes within 5-15 minutes after I started it...
5607	1	a	give me money! Give me money! Give me Money!
5609	1	a	Great stealth heist game. Nice characters, awesome to play with others co-op, pvp or single player trying to do each level without dieing for intense stealth gameplay. Kinda like a simplistic top down version of payday. 8.8/10 &lt;3.
5611	1	a	First, I want to say one thing. If you think FPS games are annoying sometimes and have a lot of flaws then, buy this game. If you like absolute chaos, then buy this game. If you like good soundtrack... then buy this game. if you have Â£10.99... then buy this game.  First off... I'd like to say that this review is longer than this. I would MOST CERTAINLY recommend this game. But to play it properly you need (at least) a small amount of intelligence. Even if you don't have some intelligence then it can be fun, but not to the fullest.  The game is set in, as the title suggests, Monaco, and it revolves around a group of theives who escaped from prison, and are trying to escape the contry by performing heists on certain buildings. There are A LOT of mechanics. You need to play the game to realise how complex it can be... without being very complex in itself.   The stealth aspect of the game revolves around a line of sight kind of thing, along with crouching so people dont turn around and kill you with their machine guns/pistols or batons. It's a bit like metal gear solid but there's no alert mode exactly, just each guard can be alerted by stuff like civilians screaming 'MON DIEU AHHGHHH!!' and things like that. (Heck, there's even red exclamation marks above alarmed guard's heads!).  Overall, wonderful game, blissful soundtrack and is absolutely crazy. 10/10 Would kill 8 people in a row with a shotgun again.
5613	1	a	It is a very nice stealth-coop game
5615	1	a	Beautiful game, 100% worth.
5617	1	a	Probably the best coop sleath game I've ever played. 10/10 if playing with friends
5619	1	a	High quality fun
5621	1	a	it is a fun game i and i love to play it whit frinds you and your frind will love it have fun p.s dont hack on the game it will not be fun 
5623	1	a	its a great stealth game,with friends.
5625	1	a	Damn good heist and coop game. 8 classes and maps are nice. Map editor is coolest thing in this game I loved to make levels with it. ^^  6,8/10
5627	1	a	I sat down to play this game for a minute or two to just get a feel for it because I didn't have much time before I had to go out. Three hours later, I'm still enjoying this game. It's a weird feeling playing this game. My mind makes this into a 'caper' or 'heist' style flick, exept it's more like resevoir dogs where everything goes south really fast. I long to play this game over lan. A setting where my friends and I are in the same room but looking at different things. Communication can become really interesting on more difficult levels. Either way, it's a wonderful game.
5629	1	a	Oh my god. Monaco is possibly one of my favorite games to just pick up and play. The early levels are usually 5-10 minutes, with most levels being about 20 minutes, and maybe 30 minutes on the later levels. The game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in solo. Don't buy it to play alone. If you're going to buy this game, make sure some friends have it too. Each character has a special skill, all of which are useful for the current situation. (Except the Pickpocket and Locksmith, they're only good for a speedrun)  There are 4 chapters, each told by a different character, and each one escalating in difficulty from the last. Notably, there are 3 versions of every level- Monaco 2013 has the original levels before updates were made, and Zonaco replaces all NPCs with zombies. The entire game is orchestrated by Austin Wintory's fantastic soundtrack(Discotheque Rouge is the best), and let's be honest, how many games feature ragtime in their soundtrack?
5631	1	a	Fantastic game which doesn't require coop but it does make it more fun. It's kind of hard to tell what things are since you are seeing everything from a top-down perspective.
5633	1	a	If you wanna have a night of fun, Monaco is the true coop experience for with 3 friends. Such a lot of fun!  9/10 this truly deserves it because it is one of the most colorful, fun and just cool.
5635	1	a	Great co-op and strategy game! Doing the levels on your own is equally rewarding, but harder. Best to play with friends you're in the same room with. &lt;3
5637	1	a	Great game! Just turn off the stressful piano music and play your own instead, and the experience will be loads better.
5639	1	a	Fun and cheap, lots of game modes and local coop - what else could you ask for?
5641	1	a	Played for a few hours and its already pretty fun! When I get more time definitely gonna put more hours in!
5643	1	a	Freaking awesome game. Simple but very fun, do-able as a 2 person game so great for couples, also works with the full party but co-operation is required.
5645	1	a	Very fun, great with friends, downsides are the workshop and how dead it is.
5647	1	a	To state one thing clear: I have owned this game now for about 5 hours and have not seen every aspect of the game in its full depth, but from what I've seen so far I can say, that this game knows how coop functions and is with friends great fun. Its gameplay as well as the artstyle and sound are smooth, funny and simply beautiful.  Especially for the sale price really worth it.
5649	1	a	Helped me successfully plan and execute an actual bank heist.  10/10
5651	1	a	10/10
5653	1	a	Played for a few hours and its already pretty fun! When I get more time definitely gonna put more hours in!
5655	1	a	What makes this game is the ability to play with friends. Challenging enough to stay engaged, easy enough to be fun.
5657	1	a	This game is one of the best and most challenging co op games out there, guaranteed arguments, screaming and noob calling. Love how the different characters synergize better with some characters and not with others. Great fun with some strategy and skill required.
5659	1	a	Freaking awesome game. Simple but very fun, do-able as a 2 person game so great for couples, also works with the full party but co-operation is required.
5661	1	a	Very fun, great with friends, downsides are the workshop and how dead it is.
5663	1	a	Straight out stealth, can't run and gun like payday unless your boss. 8/10 for zombies, but took me 15 minutes to figure stuff out. Needs a better tutorial system and user friendly interfaces.
5665	1	a	Great game, but it's a shame that none of the playable characters are named Lewinsky. What a missed opportunity for a tasteless pop-culture reference!
5667	1	a	fun &amp; runs well on (water-cooled) i5-4440 &amp; IGP, 4gb RAM w/ 1gb allocated to video, at 1080p/60hz/vsync
5669	1	a	Its a very fun 8-bit sneaky game but can turn very poor if you either have a very toxic person or people just trying to run in and grab stuff not knowing and end up getting themselves killed but you can just switch to single player wich is just as fun with an amazing story mode and ive had a very hard time finding server that dont have 300+ ping but if get a friend or a group of friends it is very fun trying out new strategies like diging through everything and not get caught as the mole or doing somthing stupid like that good experience but the gamplay alone is enough to make up for all the problems it has has and the level design is very well put together and thought out it all around a really good game.
5671	1	a	it's all mine
5673	1	a	Monaco is the greatest game ever made. I like to play it naked.
5675	1	a	AWESOME GOT IT FROM STEAM FAMLIY SHARING SOOOOOOOOO GOOD
5677	1	a	It's absolutely perfect game for multiplayer. But unlikely no one play this anymore.  For me I still find Monaco players to complete the story together.
5679	1	a	Great stealth game, especially with friends. I had so much fun playing it online ! You can unlock some interesting characters and play quite a long campaign on your own or online (neat idea). I loved the style of the graphics and the dialogues. Some levels are quite challenging but, oddly, i had the time of my life dying again and again after being chased, laughing at my screen like an idiot while my friend was trying to save me. That was a great experience, too bad not a lot of people play it now but i can only recommend it for all the great laughs I had !
5681	1	a	Great art style.  Game would be more fun if you have friends to co-op with you.  Single player is cool too, sort of reminds me of the early metal gear games. Controller supported.  9/10 Game has a lot of personality and charm.  Not really my cup of tea, but I think it deserves a nice review, the development team seems to have put a lot of heart and effort into making this a cool game.
5683	1	a	Dis a gud stealh game.
5685	1	a	Great Indie game about a group of criminals. Funny dialogue, fun original gameplay. Probably better with friends - feels limited as one character. Frustrating in some places when you get seen.
5687	1	a	I no longer trust anyone but myself with the lookout.
5689	1	a	Perhaps the most fun I've had in a game. A relaxing, yet not overally simple, game that is genuinly fun. Highly recommended.
5691	1	a	Well this is a special game but super fun 100% better if you play MP
5693	1	a	  clean out a mission. feel like a boss.
5695	1	a	A great local multiplayer game, me and my friends have had hours of fun playing this in the past.
5697	1	a	Excited! An interesting game with friends.
5699	1	a	its its really sad to buy this for a friend and never play it with them or anybody else but still 10/10 just make sure you have a group of friends to play with
5701	1	a	Game is really great and its really fun. It is fun when youre playing alone but in some levels you need a friend. But it is really good stealth and funny game. Music is really nice and i live it, but sometimes game make me mad (thats understandable XD) I recommend this game to everybody whos looking for STEALTH COOP game :-)
5703	1	a	Great coop play! Good range of classes to suit various play styles, allowing you to specialise in what you want to do. Allows you to create highly skilled teams with people playing what theyre good at.
5705	1	a	Amazing game with friends, solo is ok my hours are short here but on console i played around 400 hours ish
5707	1	a	Great co-op game play, we can't put the controller down to stop playing. The game keeps you interested with increding diffulty and completity. Highly recomend!
5709	1	a	A very good stealth game except for the fact it suffers from the same problem all stealth games have: Enemies can find and track you regardless of the mechanics built into the game regarding stealth. It doesn't matter if you just started the level or if you're hiding on the far side of the level, all enemies will converge near on your location and will never leave. Other than that large issue, it's pretty fun.
5711	1	a	This is an amazing game - the retro feel makes it that much enjoyable with the wide array of characters. Whether playing with friends, or solo, it's a great game all around.
5713	1	a	'This isn't hotline miami, put down the gun you idiot' You and your idiot sidekick rob a bank. What can go wrong? - you say after reviving him over and over again.
5715	1	a	Fun game to play with friends. But a bit cheesy
5717	1	a	*Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.* *Breaks wall.*
5719	1	a	This is an awesome game. The gameplay is challanging in many different ways and each level has a great degree of replayability. The different classes change the way of how to approach the given tasks. But not only the way how you play the game is unique, the aestetic is as well. The artstyle is great, the music and the rare voicesamples in french reminds the player of old heist films. Coop allows to finish the stages with friends or random players, the workshop support and the level-editor allows to create levels and share them or just play user created content. Everyone who is on the search for a nongeneric AAA-game should take a look at it, it's worth the price.  TLTR: Awesome game, buy it.
5721	1	a	Morning gentleman. Nice day for a heist, see? NEAH SEE NEAH
5723	1	a	AMMMMAAASSSSSSIIIINNNNGGGG game but i wish more people played multiplayer; seems fun but there are never any lobbies.
5725	1	a	10/10 Killed a dog with a wrench and then stuffed its dead body into a bush to avoid being detected
5727	1	a	It's like Payday without the microtransactions! Every heist will somehow turn on its head and will provid hours of laughs and fun. Get this game, it's super cheap during sales and even at full price it's worth it.
5729	1	a	I recommend this game for everyone it's a funny game and multiplayer one to so i hope most of you start to play this game ninja out
5731	1	a	IS COOL AMAZING MUSIC OMG
5733	1	a	By far the most fun stealth game I've played.  Loads of content bring lasting fun for new and experienced players alike. Perfect for solo, online, and couch play!
5735	1	a	This is a very fun game if you like team cooperation and pixel art style. I bought the 4 pack for 3 friends and I, and we had a blast.
5737	1	a	Top down Payday 2
5739	1	a	  So a hobo and a monkey walk into a bush...
5741	1	a	This game is one of the best coop indie games out there. Every level is cleverly designed to be completable with any of the cast, all who have unique skillsets. However, no character makes any level too easy. Similarly, playing with friends doesn't make the game any easier / harder, but instead changes how you approach it, with new challenges, and also new tools to overcome those challenges.  Plus, the graphics and controls are simple yet beautiful, and the story is something that I didn't think I'd even pay attention to, yet it captivated me. This game is probably the most polished indie game I've seen, and is a must get for any colletion for fans of coop or stealth games.
5743	1	a	Good game. Requires some patience and tactical skill which come with playing and knowing the classes and items. For classes and items there are good Workshop maps.
5745	1	a	Easy to learn, hard to master. You are guaranteed plenty of frustration and fun. Co-op is the best!
5747	1	a	Fantastic co-op game. Not the most realistic stealth, much more 'gamey' which actually makes it a lot more fun imo. Such a joy! Even SP it's still pretty good.
5749	1	a	So amazing. This game has the best elements of heist and stealth genres in a top down POV. I can't wait for tooth and tail to release Awesome job guys. :)
5751	1	a	Makes you feel like a professional until the alarms go off, and then you panic like a tiny baby.

5755	1	a	The best heist game one can play, whether it's a solo, online, or local multiplayer experience. Play it as stealthy as possible, stealing every last coin without losing a single life, or go completely nuts, making a destructive mad dash for the main treasure with guards in pursuit. The game offers a wide variety of character classes and challenges to suit your preferred diffulty and style of robbery.
5757	1	a	A perfect mix between aracde-style shooting and stealth, Monoco feels like pulling off a master-heist every time.

5765	1	a	Dont know why this game is SO AWESOME. Beautiful art, great music and sound effects, but none of them would work alone. BUT IT WORKS FOR SURE. You must absolutely play this game with your friends, you might have some fun
5767	1	a	this game just keeps getting better and better. Works flawlessly with the steam link and steam controller
5769	1	a	Excellent Bro-Op Game. Great for it's simplistic and easy to pick up playstyle. Doesn't mean it's an easy game. Bring reckless friends to draw the bullets, while you clean up shop.
5771	1	a	Great game wait untill a sale to buy this game(if yyou are a cheap skate) but diffinetly worth the price offgetting it also do not getthis game if you are going to play by your self because it can get very boring at times. With friends it a great laugh and lots of fun. heres a link to a playthough its very funny.         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Rythian and the Boys Play Monaco #1 - Worst Thieves in France&nbsp;
5773	1	a	Get a four-pack to play with friends because the multiplayer is dead and enjoy fun best steathh heist gameplay and plot better than in some AAA games!
5775	1	a	A great game that I would recommend to anyone
5777	1	a	ONE OF THE BEST THERE IS *TRADING CARDS *WORKSHOP *ACHIEVEMENTS *MULTIPLAYER AND CO-OP BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE FUN INDIE GAME MUST PLAY WITH FRIENDS INCLUDES ZOMBIE MODE *GUARANTEED LAUGHS* GREAT COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY VOICE CHAT 10/10 FIVE STARS
5779	1	a	 This is a long review so if you just want a summary of why I recommend this game skip to  Results  and read from there.   IonFX makes a fun little puzzle game that produces a special world that combines Newtons three laws with gravity pushing your puzzle solving to the test. With sweet music and pleasant level design Obulis offers a deceivingly peaceful play through.    Gameplay:  After nine fearless hours I have completed Obulis. Obulis is an interesting game, but surely isnâ€™t for everyone. In the category of puzzle games Obulis tests you by using a version of physics without friction to propel, roll, jump, shoot, catapult, and bounce spheres into containers. The levels vary and there are about 152 levels. The level difficulties go from Simple to Master with everything in-between. There is no difficulty setting for the campaign so in a single play-through you will play through a various difficulty settings, which pushes you through a rather smooth difficulty curve. Each section of Obulis has an ULTRA level which unlock after completing challenges throughout the â€œentireâ€ campaign. These levels push you to the test and completing them unlocks achievements.    Features:  One of my favorite aspects of Obulis is that there is no rating for the puzzles. You either solve a puzzle or fail a puzzle, there is no score. I like this concept, but it essentially means there is no replay value to Obulis as there is nothing to do after you complete the game. The puzzles keep you on your toes, and the slowly getting more difficult challenges keep pushing you to new levels. As you progress through the chapters of the game the not only are the levels changing, but they introduce new concepts: cannons, catapults, ballista, trebuchet, gears, horizontal moving floors, vertical moving floors, and more. These concepts differentiate the puzzles and make each of the levels seem unique rather than repetitive.    Game Issues:  I write a lot about this, but if you love puzzles and like precise timing you will probably get past this quiet easily. My major gripe about this game is that the puzzles are really more based on precise timing rather than finding a solution. You may find the solution on your first attempt, but because you have to time each click perfectly youâ€™ll be sitting there for hours. When I was playing Obulis there were actually times where I went online to look at guides to see if I was solving the puzzle correct only to find out I was, but my clicks were not timed exactly perfect. On some puzzles it gets to the point where it stops being a puzzle game and it becomes more like â€œSports Arenaâ€ the arcade game made by Sammy USA Corporation where there are lights circling the border and to win prizes you must push a button right as the light next to the prize goes on. If you have never heard of this Arcade Machine you may be able to assume that itâ€™s essentially impossible to win because of how difficult it is to time when to push the button. Obulis presents similar annoyances as â€œSports Arenaâ€. Essentially you are just sitting there clicking a button at slightly different times to solve a puzzle you figured out the answer too quite some time ago. One of the other annoyances was that Obulis didnâ€™t always give the same result to the same physical interaction. Sometimes the ball would move slightly differently even though the same exact event was occurring. This â€œglitchâ€ sometimes resulted in me having to restart even when all the clicks were correct. Luckily if you are worrying during gameplay about whether you solved a puzzle correct and are just timing the clicks wrong there is a way to ease the pain. Go on YouTube and all the puzzles have been solved and made into videos, this can allow you to view if youâ€™re making the mistake or not.   Results:  The tedious timing issues and the minor glitches in the physics engine didnâ€™t take away from Obulis; Obulis is actually a good play through. It offers about seven hours of puzzle solving (about two of the hours I played was with the game on pause while I was out doing other things). I recommend this game if you can get it in the Indie Puzzle Pack for a discount. I would not recommend paying full price for this game as it is essentially something youâ€™d be able to find free elsewhere.   Pros: +Over 152 different puzzles +Fun simple puzzles with nice serene music +Comes in the Indie Puzzle Pack with a few other games +Puzzles of varying difficulty, not all puzzles have to be solved to complete the game (some of the hardest puzzles can be skipped) +Very easy controls, only requires a mouse +Puzzles vary, add new challenges, and increase in variation as you get further in the game.   Cons: -All the achievements are for completing the Ultra Puzzles -The game has some flaws in the physics engine -Most of the puzzles have obvious solutions but require tedious work to correctly time to collisions
5781	1	a	 'Balls into the pots'
5783	1	a	One of the hardest puzzle games I ever played. 150+ levels of rage and frustration.
5785	1	a	Obulis is a puzzle game that utilizes physics in order for you to solve the puzzles. You have multicolored balls that must reach a given pocket or hole. In order to do so you'll have to figure out the proper order and timing on when to release them from their dangling/swinging chain, or when you need to move them with the click of a mouse. I really liked this game, it was very simple to play, but at times very complex to solve. That's what I want to see out of any puzzle game, the difficulty being in the puzzle itself, not trying to figure out how to get the game to work for you. Simple graphics, forgettable music, but it all fits perfectly because of the fabulous gameplay and physics that this game offer. Highly recommended for any puzzle genre fan.
5787	1	a	This game does justice to the puzzle genre. The music is good, the visuals are good, the difficulty ranges from fair to very difficult, and with more than 150 levels it won't leave you wanting. The physics are good, it implies that you have to use speed along with wit. Sometimes not everything will go the same way twice, which can be frustrating, but it's not a bug - if you throw a ball on the ground it won't always bounce the same way. You will have fun, you will get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you will be back again...and even if you're not a patient person, just quit - come back later, maybe you'll see it in a different way.
5789	1	a	Picked it up for 50 cents on a crafting coupon, it's a fun little physics puzzler.
5791	1	a	Obulis is a puzzle game that relies on physics, momentum and gravity. There are colored balls hanging in chains and using various items obtained in the map, the player has to guide those balls to the respective colored pots.  It is a great game, beginning with simple levels and gradually progressing on to harder and complex levels as the game progresses.  Some levels are actually easier than the others, even though they award higher stars of completion than other tougher levels. But this is just me, difficulty actually will vary from player to player. Some levels are constrained by your timing - it just has to be perfect or you lose. You definitely will be wanting to tear your head off at some of the tougher levels.  Obulis being one of the oldest games in genre, may seem lacking in advanced features but nowhere will the gameplay dull out. All levels occur at different loactions, each with its' own set of objects that can be utilized to help the player accomplish his goal.  All being said, this is a great game, containing upto 10 hours of fun gameplay.
5793	1	a	I bought this game in the indie puzzle bundle for 99 cents and have already gotten 10 hours of play time in it. While it was difficult at times, I never really had the feeling that I was stuck and after some trying I could always complete the level. The only negative thing about this game is that some levels rely on too precise rope-cutting: for example, you have to cut a rope in JUST the right timeframe, which is more annoying than anything else. Other than that I'd definitely recommend picking this little gem up in a sale.
5795	1	a	Highly recommend, puzzles are very fun and quite tricky in parts but well balanced and some aren't as obvious as they look. For 34p its a steal.
5797	1	a	This game is awesome. I did some of the levels on my own but had to watch for a solution on the rest (I would have never solved them on my own otherwise). I like how there is more than 1 way to complete a level sometimes. For example there were 2 different ways to complete one level and I completed it in a 3rd way (mix of the other two). :D Not hard to 100% with the guides available. Recommend it to people that like puzzles and challenges.
5799	1	a	Obulis is a wonderful physics-based puzzle game that will really put your brain to work. Through 150 levels, colored marbles found on platforms and hanging from chains must be knocked into their respective colored pots while the grey marbles, which are only used as tools to move colored ones, must not.  Chains are highlighted and cut with the mouse and you'll have to make use of order, timing of cuts and shots, and momentum from swinging, rolling and bouncing marbles to make it all work. There are also cannons, catapults, crossbows and moving platforms you'll have to work with. Difficulty varies wildly and there can be multiple solutions for a level, with some making you feel like a genius and some feeling like pure dumb luck.  The mobile game Cut the Rope has some similarities if you've ever played it, but Obulis is more serious and challenging.
5801	1	a	Obulis is a very simplistic puzzle game - break the links and use physics to your advantage, to get colored balls in their respective goals. Progression is granted through achieving 'stars' - each level has a certain number of stars it awards, which you can use to unlock levels. The hand painted backgrounds are gorgeous, and keep me surprised: they're a part of the game, interactive and useable as props to bounce your balls off (get your mind out of the gutter).  There is a lack of punishment to 'failing' a level, which in and of itself is both a boon and a blessing: on one hand, levels become less about skill and more about retrying until Lady Luck is on your side. On the other, being punished for levels that you will repeat upwards of ten times would quickly wear a player out, and make this game a bargain bin discount.  And really, that's what Obulis is: a game that's a fun in it's own right, but you'd never pay full price for it. Pick it up on a sale if you enjoy games akin to Fantastic Contraption, Cut the Rope and World of Goo.
933	0	a	I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. The physics are B-A-D. You do the same action over and over again and the result is different every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing single time, until the game itself decides that you can finally proceed after all this torture. It's buggy at some stages and that 'it's all about the timing' thing, is so frustrating, because you can totally miss the target for miliseconds of delay. Don't get me wrong though, it's a fun game to play and very challeging.  5.5/10
5803	1	a	Nice game, controls are using mouse, no joypad support.
5805	1	a	Not a bad physics game, I put 2 hours into it, but never finished it. You put the colored balls into the colored pots using gravity, traps, and physics.  Later the game becomes more difficult and requires a good chunk of luck. At some point I moved on and played other games.  I could however see that someone could totally dig this game. What I did play was quite fun, but also upsetting.
5807	1	a	Are you looking for an exciting chain breaking, ball throwing, flower petal action?WELL THIS THE GAME FOR YOU!! This game is hard as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and when it comes to throwing blue balls into those blue flower petals. This game is so ridiculously hard i've only beaten six levels. 10/10 if you're up for a hard â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ challenge.
5809	1	a	It's like Cut the Rope, but taken in a completely different direction. Whereas Cut the Rope had dozens of different ways to interact with the puzzles, in Obulis all you can do is drop marbles by cutting chains. But you need to cut them in the right order and with a strict sense of timing.   The physics of Obulis have no friction whatsoever. When looking at a level, you need to gain a sense of where momentum can come from and how to transfer that momentum from moving marbles to stationary ones. Sometimes it's easy to screw up the timing of a marble drop and need to repeatedly restart, which can get frustrating, but it's a skill you get better at if you play for long enough. There are also multiple solutions to most puzzles, so if you find yourself retrying a level for the 75th time, it means you're probably going for one of the harder solutions and you're missing an easier one.  If you're a puzzle enthusiast or an achievement hunter searching for a reasonably straightforward game to add to your 100% list, I recommend it. Just be warned that, also unlike Cut the Rope, this game is not afraid to pull out some difficult puzzles. There are a good 20 levels, especially near the end of the game, that will really give your mind a workout and make you earn that completion.
5811	1	a	2D puzzle game with decent music, mechanics and graphics.  I's all about getting the orbs of different colors into a basket of matching color by activating small mechanics in the surrounding, so no direct contact is allowed and it's all placed with just the mouse. The difficulty increase level by level, and will required better timing and cognitive thinking, but mainly just timing. This makes it very addictive though, since it trigger a nice sense of achievement when you finally succeed some of the trickier levels.  For me it felt like it was all mainly about relaxing and work on my patience, since some levels demanded a few tries to get the timing right.  I would say that this is a nice game if you are looking for a relaxing way to practise your patience, including a calm brain teaser. It's pretty good for when you need a short break from doing something else.
5813	1	a	Great game! Got it on sale and kept me intriged.
5815	1	a	Obulis is a fun, challenging game. I really like the design of the levels, it can make the levels simply hard. At first I skipped ahead of the controls you get when starting the first level, so I got confused on how to play. After that, I couldn't find a way to see the controls. So, check the controls... The art style looks just right for this game, and this game could be in my top 100 favorite games, right above 'Guitar Hero' and right below, 'Call of Duty 4'
5817	1	a	nice little physics based game, really good although frustrating in stages :)
5819	1	a	Good game to kill boredom..... And when you come to chapter 3,clock tower X,then begins frustration
5821	1	a	Obulis is probably one of the more satisfying puzzle games offered on Steam. The game showcases some really clever puzzle challenges using marbles. It encompasses a blend of patience, timing, and plain luck. Great stuff for puzzle lovers. There's plenty of 'Aha!' moments.
5823	1	a	Good physics puzzle. Had a lot of fun with it. Very good music too.  Like some puzzles, you may end up doing an alternate solution by accident or luck instead of the actual solution. That may happen in some levels but not always.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.
5825	1	a	a reasonable little puzzle game, not the best out there but its okay.
5827	1	a	Great Ball on Ball Action 10/10 Better Puzzle game then Portal
5829	1	a	PROS: - A great physics based puzzle game without much randomness. - Overall atmosphere of the game is old-fashioned but classy. - Creative puzzles with unique and historical themes. - A decent soundtrack with classical instruments. - End credits.  CONS: - Music transition is a bit too aggresive, abrupt, and unnatural while navigating the game menu, selecting levels, et cetera. - A select few levels are abnormally difficult even if you follow walkthrough guides (either the physics engine is acting wonky or a particular level design is flawed, or both.)  Final Remarks: The game is quite good. If you are having hard time solving the puzzles, make sure to check out the  Steam guides  written by our fellow gamers.  . RECOMMENDED .
5831	1	a	This is one of those strategic casual games. Very challenging at times but very enjoyable figuring out the puzzles. I recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing game.
5833	1	a	I love this game. Many people have already reviewed Obulis so I'll be short and lazy: it's fun and addictive. Most levels can be beaten by using your brain, but sometimes you'll need much skill to get the perfect timing. If you like billard or 'pÃ©tanque' (french game using hand-thrown metal balls), you will feel things you know... and new things. A really nice and peaceful game.
5835	1	a	Having played Obulis on mobile and now on PC, my best reccomendation for potential players is this: Stick to mobile. The PC version is bug-free, well made and graphiclly beautiful, making it stand out against many other indie games avalibe; however, it is cumbersome to play on a PC as you drag your mouse in complicated routes to guide balls into their holes. I will give it a reccomendation, but for the mobile version not the PC edition.
5837	1	a	Obulis is your standard physics puzzle game. You try to get the balls in their containers by hitting off of walls and other balls, rolling on platforms, and swinging off of chains. It's a pretty known concept, but the different environments created for the game definitely make the game a relaxing one. There are about 150 different puzzles to solve, and they range from simple to master difficulty, with 6 difficulties in between.  I read the other reviews written so far, and I gotta say I disagree completely with them; If you repeat a level, and do exactly the same moves every time, you will always yield the same result. By definition, that means there isn't any luck involved. Some levels do take a bit of precise timing, but they tend to have large margins for error, and the levels reset very quickly, so it's not like messing up takes too much time. All you need to solve the puzzles is a bit of patience (only necessary for the hard ones) and a brain (also really only necessary for the hard ones).  It took me about 6 hours to get through all of the levels and unlock all of the achievements. For a puzzle game with a fairly simple premise, I think that's more than good enough. I was fortunate enough to be gifted a copy of this game, but I feel like it's worth the $5 normal price, given that for me, that's like $0.80/hr of gameplay. And if you don't think it's worth it, pretty much all steam games go on sale 4 times a year, usually for more than half-off.  If you like Casual games, if you like puzzle games, if you care about atmosphere as much as gameplay, then I would recommend this game to you.
5839	1	a	Interesting and challenging
5841	1	a	This game is very good.
5843	1	a	Simple, fun, semi-addicting. Exactly what you want from a casual game. It's not hard and it's enjoyable. I recommend this game, but only if you are able to buy it in a bundle or for 1 euro. It's not a game that will keep you occupied for over a day and it's definitly not worth it's full price.   The idea of the game is that you have colored balls that you will have to get into a vase which will have the same color. The physics are well made and easy to understand. The levels you have to complete in order to get achievements can be tricky but all in all it's more like a puzzle book you take out to a holiday which you could complete in a day but might just do a puzzle a day.  Fan of mediocre puzzle games? Get it. Fan of hard puzzle games? Might want to check a video on youtube about this. Fan of achievement grinding? Get it.
5845	1	a	super! very clever design. thank you for patience training game,
935	0	a	A puzzler that fails at being a puzzler. The difficulty here comes from fighting with the badly implemented controls of the game and the stupidity of the physics. It looks unpolished, sounds worse, and horrendously lacks in configuration.
5847	1	a	not the newest game in town but i enjoyed it a lot. visuals are quite neat for its age, sound is ok as well and while the game mechanics are kind of simple there are a lot of challenging and entertaining levels to play.  two levels i had to check out on youtube because i just couldn't figure out where to start for ages but that was just me suffering from brain f4rt. everyhing else was completed 100% after 8 1/2 hours so the game certainly is not too short.  if you want to kill some time and test your (in)eptitude at puzzles then this is the way to go.
936	0	a	A physics puzzle game where even if you know the solution, you can still fail 10 times in getting it to work out the way you had intended.
5849	1	a	PLUSES: + Nice graphics + Very interesting game + Some physics laws may work uncorrectly, and believe me, you can solve levels using another way, especially in ultra levels  MINUSES: - When I capture video, most physics laws work uncorrectly. For example, without capturing I can hit the ball 10 times in a row and it always goes on its way, but when I capture I hit the ball, but it doesn't go on its way or it loses its power.
5851	1	a	I bought this for $0.50 with a 90% off coupon I received for crafting a badge for Bit Trip Beat, because that's what the world is like now. The game is fine.
5853	1	a	How is this not a eSport?
5855	1	a	when you need casual game. play this game. it is a fun game at least for me.
937	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I had to buy this for a good steam level. 9/10 would say never ever purchase.
5857	1	a	This was an excellent game! I also found it to be very relaxing. Puzzles had some challenge but never frustrated me.I even left the music on which is something I rarely do, as it added to such a peaceful atmosphere.
5859	1	a	Turns out that a game about throwing balls into pots would be so fun. Definitely worth the asking price for any puzzle afficionado.
941	0	a	So- so puzzle game....purchased it in a bundle so wasn't expecting a huge wow factor....def wouldn't pay full price for this.
5861	1	a	Well developers all I have to say with regards to Gameplay, Graphics, Sound, Music and Puzzle Difficulty is this...   http://youtu.be/IxAKFlpdcfc   If there was a second thumbs up button I would press that as well. The game will leave you with wanting more, more chapters, more prequel and sequels, they have a good thing here hope they continue it...
5863	1	a	This is the best game in the Indie Pack. Its easy to pick up and play but dificult to complete.
5865	1	a	Instantly addictive, 'Just one more level' feeling. Great little puzzle game, worth buying!
5867	1	a	Pretty funny but music is way too loud.
5869	1	a	Itâ€™s good game with interesting puzzles which are based on the laws of physics. Some of them are very tricky. Ambient sound is nice too. Moreover, itâ€™s a first game where I got all achievements. ^_^
944	0	a	I got Bluestacks. I play COC and Cut The Rope. No Problem. I buy this game. Install it. When it open. The screen goes white. only hear the music only. K Lucky i spend only around 0.4USD for this game
5871	1	a	im a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and i deserve to die. im garbage. everybody is better than me.
5873	1	a	This game is strangely addictive, I kept saying to myself 'I'll just do 1 more level' and then ended up doing about another 30!
5875	1	a	If you are in melancholic status, this game is getting interesting, so i recommend it.
5877	1	a	Obulis is a great puzzle game with good music. It has achievements and it's definitely a fun game if you like puzzles.
947	0	a	Just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ version of a free flash, unable to tell what the balls will collide with and physics â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s up at least once on every level
5879	1	a	I really recommend it. I liked it so much, not the game what i play every day. But still worth it's price. Completely
948	0	a	Obulis Review - Raymond K. Turcotte  Were do I start? My first impression of the game was ' Wow, a cheap rip off of Cut the Rope' but after really giving this game a chance, i relized how good the game really is. The music, soft mellody has a really good effect to the players and most likely makes them continue to play it. The Artwork also has a really good impact.  But, I don't recommend the Game. UNLESS, you like 'Cut the rope' type game, then this game is for you!
949	0	a	This game is ok, but does get frustrating after a while. I found the sound to be quite good, but I do feel that there should be some sort of volume adjustment instead of just a mute.
950	0	a	Seeing it in my library makes me sad.
951	0	a	Boring to death. Do not buy! (I got my copy in a bundle)
952	0	a	Uhhhh Soooo bored after playing this, I rather watch a screensaver!!!!! AVOID!
953	0	a	Tactical game where u need reading skills. Cheap game to spend alot of time. Its hard and u MUST use ur brain to complete levels :D  But isnt making that much fun. If u want to spend time with thinking then yes. But im looking for a fun game
954	0	a	Obulis is a great game about finding the right solution and making a stand. It is about acceptance, patience and persistence. Strongly recomended for all those who: 1)enjoyed Titan quest, Aion and/or wished there were more mobs in Prince of Persia 2)are profoundly pleased by repeatedly pressing the retry button A warning: uncontrolable weeping, especially bloody tears of rejoice upon completition An advice: tag it TIMING, cos, you know, PUZZLES are generally about thinking
5881	1	a	Try this.
5883	1	a	Very fun little game 
956	0	a	Just awful.
5885	1	a	ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
960	0	a	It has all the depth of a flash game. The music is repetitive. The level design is really annoying when you can't tell if something is in the foreground or the background.  It wasn't buggy, but it was a very shallow game with far too many luck-based time puzzles.
961	0	a	Annoying puzzles that are either too simple or too 'difficult'. 'Difficult' is in quotes here because it's not really the puzzle itself that is difficult, it's the fact that they require millisecond precision in making sure the balls hit the right thing at the exact right second. It's less a puzzle and more a frustrating exercise in trial and error reaction time crap-shoots where you'll be replaying the same level over and over with slight variations on your timing to try to make everything fall into place.  The controls are horrible. You have to click on a chain or thing to select it and then right click to cut it. It would be far more natural to use a swiping motion over a chain or thing to cut it, as is done in a popular game called Cut The Rope.  Also, you can't adjust the sound effect volume or the music volume. You can only mute or unmute.  Fortunately, this game only cost me 49 cents and I can write it off. 3/10 would not play again.
962	0	a	Oh it's just Cut the Rope  man
963	0	a	Why did i pay $0.50 for a flash game?
964	0	a	This game is essentally cut the rope, but uses jars instead of a candy-eating monster. ALthough it is fun, this game is just incredibly boring. I did enjoy Cut the Rope, but this game made me want to slit my wrists.
965	0	a	With all my CPU dedicated to this game alone, I couldn't even move the mouse more than an inch per minute. Tried it 3 times and always the same result. Only bought it because of my 90% off coupon but even then, this game is not recommended at all.
966	0	a	Game Was 150% and im still waiting for my $2.49
967	0	a	Boring
5887	1	a	A very fun physics based puzzle game. You simply break a few chains, setting a series of events in motion, and using gravity and inertia to get the marbles to their color coded destinations.
5889	1	a	A great puzzle game with easy-to-grasp physics! Even after completing the game 100%, I find myself coming back to it every so often and enjoying it all over again.
5891	1	a	balls ahUEUEUEUEUEUE
5893	1	a	It's Cut-The-Rope. Adding a few physics based differences here and there, regardless. download and play if you like that style of gameplay, it'd suit perfectly to you.
5895	1	a	Great puzzle based game which offers hours of entertainment. You've probably played games like this in the past, but they still offer a unique charm. Definitely worth the cost. If you want to casually game and unwind from a long day, this is a perfect game to do it.
5897	1	a	Some will think it's not worth the cost, but I think you have to play it to judge it. 8/10
969	0	a	This game is about as fun, as sticking your hand in a blender. Don't get it.
970	0	a	more than 70% of the puzzles are nearly impossible, + ONLY on the easy-no-brainer puzzles there is a hint button.
5899	1	a	.54 cents you can not loose. wish it was for android aswell. Good little gravity simulator. Very short but lots of replay. I'd expect addon levels coming for this title. Some really good action reaction get the ball in the cup chanlenges.
5901	1	a	Obulis is a neat little puzzle game where you got to get your balls to their spots. To do that you got to basically break the ropes/chains at the right time and in the correct order. Honestly, the game isn't that hard, it just takes a bit of trial and error. But this doesn't mean the game sucks. The game is still great for a puzzle game. It also has new mechanics introduced every now and then which makes the game more interesting and keeps you playing.  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83b_jXI1n4 
971	0	a	Not that great, could be ALOT better!
5903	1	a	Love this game. It has great chain reactions and sometimes really makes you think. I have honestly played this game for hours and it's well worth it for the price. Typically I don't review game. But this one has my recommendation :)
5905	1	a	Its actually a very well made puzzle game. Good graphics, good music, simple challenging gameplay, and plenty of 'AHA!' moments. I really like this game
5907	1	a	You get what you pay for here. A simplistic physics puzzle game with marbles. What more did you expect?  A game that wastes no time in exploring a fairly limited premise, and yet has no trouble racking up the difficulty. Some of the last levels may even need a guide with the sadistic amount of timing needed as well as foreknowledge of a handful of sequences to get your result. All an all a quick pretty game with a soothing soundtrack.
5909	1	a	A fairly simple but relaxing puzzle game. I really enjoyed it, it won't last you very long but if you can pick it up on the cheap I definitely recommend it.
5911	1	a	A breathtakingly accurate depiction on how painstakingly nerveracking dangling balls in diverse scenarios can be.  Protip: Use a guide.
5913	1	a	It's worth noting that the difficulty varies WILDLY throughout the game regardless of each level's difficulty rating and two or three puzzles (out of like 200) require millisecond-level timing. However, I did enjoy the game overall so it gets a recommendation from me.
5915	1	a	Highly Recommended! 10/10  This is a fabulous little overlooked gem! Great graphics, fun gameplay, peaceful scenes and music, and a great simplistic style overall. The music is very good, and actually varies by environment.   I'm actually so impressed with this game, that I think it's worth the full price, if you're considering it. It's not terribly long, perhaps, but it does have 150+ levels, so there's a decent amount of gameplay to it. 
976	0	a	Wow, 1.1 hours on record. I'm surprised it was that long. Unlike some people who feel compelled to finish, I quit when the frustration level got high and that was very quickly. It's not just that the puzzles are difficult to figure out, repeating the same level dozens of times to get the timing was not my idea of fun. Some people may like this sort of thing, but not me.
5917	1	a	Obulis is a pleasant, casual puzzle game, based upon little spheres transferring kinetic energy to one another, until each end up exactly where they're supposed to be: the pot (or sometimes, flower) of the same colour. There's something very calming about this premise, and the graphical design as well as sound direction really bolster this effect. The game opts to create a soft wall of sound out of sound effects appropriate to the setting, rather than plaster the levels with repetitive music. The result is a game that is a pleasure to play, for short bursts or long stretches.  Many of the puzzles do require precise timing, to varying degrees of difficulty, and some of the puzzles are difficult enough to become frustrating. However, when the solution is finally completed, it is often very elegant, and there is a great sense of satisfaction putting the complex little machinery into action, observing it working in perfect synchronicity, and watching the balls fall one by one into their respective pots, with a satisfying 'clink'.  It doesn't sound like much, but this atmosphere that the game fostered, has drawn me back to finish it three times. It's definitely worth a try.
5919	1	a	Very fun and challening game. 151 levels to beat. Some are easy, some are not, and some seem impossible to beat. Good price, so give it whirl if you have the patience for games like this.
5921	1	a	It's a nice puzzle game, the first levels are easy so you can learn in peace but some levels are really tough to beat.  152 levels, some of em need both reflexion and reflexes, for around 10-15h of play. Just don't ruin the game by checking the solutions :)
5923	1	a	Great, relaxing game. Buy it, you won't regret it.
5925	1	a	This is fun and small brain puzzle game. if you like brain puzzles with simple idea this is for you.
5927	1	a	Think, cut and... SWEAR as you missed by a degree. â•¯Â°â–¡Â°â•¯ â”»â”â”»  Great one! Something tells me I'll cut quite a few nights for this one ;]
5929	1	a	that game is awesome but hard.
5931	1	a	A fun little relaxing time-waster. Physics are great, puzzles range from quite easy to incredibly difficult (but never impossible). Good for when you're sick of playing high-octane FPS games and want a bit of a break that'll still challenge you. One of those puzzle games that's easy to learn but hard to master. 9.5/10
5933	1	a	I give the game an overall 9/10 score. It's pure fun and keeps you puzzling for hours, but with a little thinking it's not too hard to solve everything. It'd be a 10/10 if it weren't for the credits who show up too soon and repeat a few more times before you actually finish the 100 percent.
980	0	a	Well, for starters, this game feels like it should be on an touchscreen, not a mouse and keyboard. I like the physics aspect of Obulis, but the controls offset me. I would be waaay more inclined to play this game if the controls were better.
5935	1	a	Very nice, very addictive! ILIKE!
5937	1	a	Great puzzle solving fun for a night in with friends. The complexity of the puzzles grows as you progress but you will often find that there is more than one solve to any puzzle.
5939	1	a	I won't lie, I bought this as a joke. However, I got pulled into it. The simplicity puts my mind at ease. Everything in it has a purpose, and a path. A nice graphic style and calming music add to the Zen feeling that surrounds the game.
5941	1	a	Obulis is a really fun puzzle game. I didnt expect to play it as much as I do. It's basically like the love child of billiards and mini-golf.
5943	1	a	This game is just OK, honestly. There are a lot of in-browser games that have a lot of the same mechanics as Obulis, but Obulis has a lot more levels than the in-browser ones. There's nothing mind-blowing about this game, it's just very simple.
5945	1	a	ObulisÂ® is not a very good puzzle game as most levels require a lot of luck and not a small level of skill. so you may find yourself stuck on a puzzle long after you figured out how to solve it. I would recommend this game to people who like puzzles but just bear in mind the puzzles are easy,... but actual solving them...
5947	1	a	This is a very challenging game, it takes a lot of attention to detail, timing, a little luck, and a ton of patience to get all achievements completed.  It is very simple graphicaly, but I found this was a good thing, as it didn;t distract you from trying to obtain the obhectives.  I would deffinatly recommend this game to any puzzle lovers out there.
5949	1	a	Pleasantly surprised. It sort of like Cut the Rope without the kids graphics. There are lots of puzzles and many are not that easy. Thumbs up!!!
5951	1	a	This is a pretty fun physics puzzle game that will provide you with about 11 hours of content if you choose to complete everything. The later levels can require some very precise timing and quick reactions, so keep that in mind if that's not something you wan't to put up with. The ambient music does a fairly good job of setting the mood, but it does become repetitive. All in all definitely worth it, especially at a sale price.
5953	1	a	This is a great little puzzle game and it's cheap too! Definitely pick it up if you're into puzzle games.
5955	1	a	Hey, remember that flash game where you cut the rope to get balls into containers? It's that. It's 150 levels of that. You don't need me to tell you if you want that or not.
5957	1	a	I just started steam and wanted to start building up my Library so I bought alot of cheap games. Forsome reason I decided to download this game, as soon as I started playing this amaing puzzle game I could not stop playing it I was in the ZONE. As soon as i drop my mouse and decided to do something else I notice that I was playing it for 92 minutes non-stop. It is an amazing puzzle game and one of a kind. Must have game!!!
5959	1	a	Surprisingly fun and challenging puzzle game in which timing is a key factor! I really enjoyed it!
5961	1	a	Very fun and sometimes really hard. I would recommend this to people who like hard puzzle games. I would give this a 7.8 out of 10
5963	1	a	One of my favorite games I've ever bought on Steam. I own over 300 titles. This is like $5 @ FULL PRICE and $1 when on sale. Absolutely great value at either price. Over 150 physics puzzles to play &amp; trust me there are easy ones to get ya' started and then you move into VERY FRUSTRATING FUN. Some puzzles require PERFECT TIMING. A simple 'path' to victory may require 30 PERFECTLY TIMED 'mouse clicks or instructions' so a single puzzle could take 1000 tries if you JUST CAN'T TIME IT RIGHT.  Overall this is just SO DANG FUN but then again I love puzzles and the physics part of it makes it a blast.
5965	1	a	good game but need update more
5967	1	a	Great physics puzzles with a soothing environment. Honestly, I was easily addicted to the gameplay, but the music and the graphical presentation really sucked me in.  I am only writing this...because I want the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing ticket...but really...it is a great game 
981	0	a	Trial and error, oops 2 pixels too soon, sory that't won't do.
5969	1	a	Cut The Rope Acient Edition
5971	1	a	Good games, reccomended!
5973	1	a	Pretty Decent puzzle game. Some are easy, some are frustrating though not until chapter 2 but most of them are pretty enjoyable. Worth buying if on sale or you enjoy puzzle games. I put in 2 hours before I realized it, great time waster. Music can get annoying but you can shut it off, not much else to say about this one.
5975	1	a	This game is proof that physics can be fun after all. The premise is simple, you are given colored marbles to get into the same colored pot. How you get them there is a perplexing, sometimes maddening but always a rewarding expierence. Using the available chained black balls and other elements of the level at your disposal, you try to obtain the needed momemtum to achieve this goal. Gameplay is easy enough to master. Select a chain by left clicking and cut it by right clicking. There are a number of scenarios and bonus levels to unlock. Picked this game up because it was a steal for under 50 cents but it's well worth about $5. An underdog that is a pleasant suprirse. If you like good old fashioned brain teasers, this is a game not to be missed.
5977	1	a	A great underrated puzzle game. Seems hard at first but addicting as all hell once you get a handle on it.
5979	1	a	Fun and Challenging. Worth the money if you like puzzle games.
5981	1	a	For the $0.49 I got this for, it is an amazing game. The puzzles are challenging but not in the way you have to look them up. I am so glad this game went on sale for so cheap or I would not have given it a chance. Pick it up if you love puzzles.
5983	1	a	Best puzzle game i have played so far in my life.Although i am no fan of the genre this one is very well made and the physics work prety well.It also features some phenomenal levels which will really challenge your mind.
5985	1	a	Totally Addictive! If you a fan of logical puzzle games, the game will make you experience 'the physics' in puzzle. The graphics could look really basic but it make the game interesting somehow.
983	0	a	Marbles and puzzles.  Obulis is a game of both marbles and puzzles. The aim is to get the marbles into the same coloured containers. In order to do so you need to manipulate chains, which drop the marbles, to make sure the marbles bump into each other to allow the coloured marble to get to the right container. There is a bit of physics involved in this game as you need to calculate the correct time to release the marble to win. As you win each level you collect stars (which don't do anything except track your wins)  There is no story in this game, just a series of puzzles to complete. The game should last you a while since there are more than 150 levels, depending on whether you choose to play them all that is. The music is nice and calm which helps you think in these puzzle games.  Tghe main problem I have with the game is that there is no sense of progression in this game. Collecting stars isn't a good enough motivator to keep me interested in this game.  I can only recommend this game hardcore puzzle fans otherwise, it's best to spend your money elsewhere.
5987	1	a	When this game works it is a Zen like experence.  All of the pieces are layed out in front of you and the hardest part is figuring out the correct order things go in.  Sometimes you have to experement, or find less obvious solutions but it's all right in front of you.  Drop that marble, snip that rope...now...Done! Simple, elegent.   At least that's the way it should be. Ocacionally a puzzle will require too-precise timing or wonky physics will send your marble flying in the wrong direction. It might be that your solution was correct but something was off by just a hair. This leads to confusion and frustration as you vainly search for another way to solve the puzzle; sometimes getting it by sheer luck and determination.   Thankfully though, only a handful of the puzzles are like this. Most of them work beautifuly. Combined with the painted backdrops and soft music Obulis is a soothing puzzler...except when it isn't
5989	1	a	This game is all about timing and physics, lots of physics.  It can be a great pass-time if you are an 'analytical thinker'. No, it is not the same as 'nerd'.  Pros- * Great background scores * Sleek design * Minimal controls * Good theme for an indie game  Cons- * Sanctum levels can be a bit frustrating. * Ultra I, II etc are a bit repetitive, especially if you have beaten Ultra V, then it makes no sense to play Ultra I, II etc .  9/10. I got it in a bundle, was worth the price I paid.
985	0	a	Physic based 2D platform puzzler. Gave me rage, not happy feels
986	0	a	Guess it's fun to play for a little bit. But then it gets pretty meh.  4/10
987	0	a	6/10 Surprisingly addicting for simpletons. 1. Select rope or chain to cut ball 2. Try to drop ball into container 3. Gouge eyes out with nearest sharp pointy thing. 4. Rinse &amp; Repeat
5991	1	a	Well worth the $1.09 price tag... Just smoke a bowl and play...
5993	1	a	Fun puzzle game to burn off steam after raging from CSGO
5995	1	a	I could not recommend Obulis enough to anyone who's a fan of the puzzle and/or strategy genre... and to say that some of these levels require intense strategy and forethought is no understatement.  Each of the game's 151 maps have unique puzzles, no two being exactly alike, and the scenery of each stage combined with the tranquil music will surely create an experience you won't soon forget. However, if you're looking to complete the game 100% on your own, you will be spending  far  more than the eleven hours I spent with it. The eponymous 'Ultra' levels will have you tearing your hair out if you're not ready to look at them from every conceivable direction, and each of the 'Inner Sanctum' stages leaves you with a feeling of unease as it subverts many of your expectations and turns every lesson you've learned up to that point onto its head. The best part is that you can use what mechanics were introduced in older levels and re-implement them in harder stages, which is almost mandatory at some points... and the ending I received when I got to Dungeon XII and finally collected the Onyx Medallion was simple yet so heart-warming in the end. ( My one regret is that I didn't screenshot it for posterity, but... as simple as it was, it's worth earning and seeing for yourself. A 'credits' option once you have a completed save file would've been greatly appreciated just for the ability to revisit it at any time. )  My single complaint with this game, if I had any, is that some levels have events that cannot be replicated perfectly despite being played the same way twice. I would say this pertains most to levels like 'Dark Forest III Ultra' where the pendulous swinging of one of the balls can affect the entire pace of the rest of the levelâ€”too fast or too slow, and the final ball won't reach the cannon or will simply bounce right past it. The same could be said for 'Pond XIII' where single frames can decide if you dropped a large grey ball in just the precise manner to spur a chain of events that will let you finish the level or not. Precise timing is paramount... but thankfully, the stages are so short that even the longest of them won't take you more than a minute at the absolute most, even though with all of the retries you'll rack up, it'll feel more like hours before you discover the solution on your own.  For its low price, you definitely get hours of entertainment that you likely won't find elsewhere; besides the puzzles themselves, the scenery in each stage will be a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack will absolutely entrance you.
5997	1	a	Strangely... soothing
989	0	a	So basically it was Cut the Rope before actual Cut the Rope hit the market. The problem is, that to cut the chain here you have to select it first and then click the selected chain to cut it. While it could be entertaining in 2009, it's not really impressive in the age of mobile gaming.
5999	1	a	Great little physics puzzle game. Some mind buggling puzzles involving timing things just right that feel great when you finally nail them.
6001	1	a	Really cute and fun little game. Itâ€˜s pretty short as rpg, but youâ€˜ll have a fun time playing it. Itâ€˜s simple and pretty easy. You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad. When the fight starts youâ€˜re being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesnâ€˜t need to be different. Seriously go and buy it, itâ€˜s really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)
6003	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute, creative, charming, simple to play, easy to master RPG set in Halloween. There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.  Speaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.  In battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.  The combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.  When the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.  The enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.  When you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.  You can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.  When party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.  Every battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.  On the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.  Every costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.  In all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.
6005	1	a	Yet again Double Fine surprises me and yet again they manage to make another rather unique and great game. Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween. You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes. Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat. The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle. There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn. You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest. Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny. Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining. In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say. You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this. Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game.
6007	1	a	Overall: Costume Quest is a cute and adorable game about the complicated relationship siblings have with each other, set against the backdrop of one of my favorite holidays: Halloween. While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it.   Rating: 9/10 - Details below  Story: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in.   Graphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it.   Controls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.  Sounds &amp; Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.  Gameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the 'Trick' aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up.   Final Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children. If you can afford to pay full price and want to support a good game, do so.
6009	1	a	Be a kid. Collect candy. Save the world. Fun game if you are looking for something short and sweet.
6011	1	a	What to say? This game is definitely a classic. You play as either the brother or the sister trying to save the other, who is kidnapped by monsters on Halloween as they try to invade this world. You use the power of various costumes along with the powers of friends you meet and have join your party as you progress along to the end. You also collect candy (money) and complete various quests for various people along the way.  It's arguably the cutest RPG out there and also happens to be a lot of fun. Although Double Fine has somewhat fallen from grace of late, this game remains a shining example of the sort of excellent games they are capable of producing. Definitely a game that shouldn't be missed or passed over by anybody. Make sure you play this on Halloween, and at least turn it on Christmas Day for a few minutes (you will know why if you do it).  A classic, one of the best games out there, and an easy 10/10.
6013	1	a	When monsters invade to disrupt the sacred trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween, kidnap your twin, and attempt to steal all the candy that is yours by right, there's nothing to do but turn your costume up to eleven and kick them back into the netherworld from whence they came. Thus is the setup to Costume Quest, a hilarious and creative RPG-lite from Double Fine that is as sweet as the candy you so eagerly collect, despite its gameplay being highly simplified.  You spend most of your time exploring the world, collecting costume pieces, and of course knocking on houses with the hope that a bundle of candy will be waiting for you on the other side. There are also a handful of side-quests to complete, most in the form of hide-and-seek games or typical fetching errands. Though in most games I find quests such as these mundane and uninteresting, here they are full of so much humor and charm that it was hard for me to keep from smiling the whole way through.  But supposing someone not so nice and full of candy answers the door, then it's time to for some Persona like turn-based combat to occur. This is where gameplay hits a snag, as while fully functional the battle mechanics are extremely basic, revolving almost entirely around quicktime events with little to no variation or strategy to speak of. They are also terribly easy (I failed all but once, and on the final boss no less) which made the few options you are given for altering your character's attacks even less noticeable and necessary. That's not to say battles are completely devoid of fun, as I did enjoy them to an extent, but after only a few hours the repetition becomes grating so much as to have me actively try and avoid encounters (as if the Ninja costume wasn't already awesome enough). Thankfully with the story clocking in at 6-7 hours, it never got so bad as to greatly degrade the experience, and so long as you keep play sessions to short bursts are little more than a minor annoyance.  The big head celshaded look works surprisingly well with the theme of the game, making transitions between the lighthearted character models to the much more intricate (and in some cases suitably creepy) characters used for battles seamless, on top of simply being cute. The fixed camera is at times a hassle, but for the most part works well for the style of gameplay and stays out of your mind where it belongs. I do have one odd complaint about the presentation, which is the lack of any music or sound effects for most cutscenes. Even a simple text scrolling sound would have helped, as the way it is now made them feel awkward and drawn out, not to mention greatly reduced the impact of significant plot points.  Regardless of any problems I mentioned, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Costume Quest to anyone who has enjoyed a Double Fine game in the past. The writing is comedy gold, the characters lively and likeable, and its concept is completely unique. If you are looking for a complex and involving RPG then you won't find it here, but if you can look past the simple mechanics for the heartfelt adventure underneath it is greatly entertaining and worth playing.
6015	1	a	Absolutely adorable game that oozes Doublefine charm. You play as a bunch of kids who get wrapped up in a halloween monster plot to steal all the world's candy. The gameplay is somewhere inbetween the Mario RPG games (Superstar saga, Paper Mario) and South Park Stick of Truth, with your kids actually turning into their costume for the battle. There's a heap of unlockable costumes which act as character classes and a few other clever ways to customise your guys. It's just all round fun.  I really wouldn't be surprised if the guys that made Stick of Truth were inspired by this. They're ridiculously similar, in a good way! It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Definitely grabbing the sequel :D
6017	1	a	 A very fun and cute RPG
6019	1	a	A great game in all aspects. It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :)   What's to Like ?    1. Good story, involving for both young and old. 2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests. 3. Relaxing style of open world gameplay, with exciting battles. 4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily. 5. Addon 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game) 6. Great cartoonish graphics remniscent of old games such as XIII. 7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.  What's not that exciting ?  1. A little more length of the game would have been nice. 2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievments for some more of them too. 3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.  What's to hate ?  Nothing :) No major flaws.   Costume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3.   Though this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the addon DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that cany you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.  The game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game.   In all, a recommended buy. Do not hesitate if you get it on sale.
6021	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game.   Story: Funny. Search and rescue. Fight the evil one and monsters on a turn based fight .  You will dress up as a robot, a vampire... and each of them will have powers to use against the monsters.   Music: Not the best I have seen but... it's ok.  Game: Isometric view except the fights.   When to play it? Halloween will be the best moment xD   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552931418 
6023	1	a	An unexpected style of game with a funny creative innovate. The combat is really fun and the costumes are amazing. Overall, the game fits together very well.  Game: 8.0/10 Graphic: 8.5/10   100% Achievement  : Easy |  Medium  | Hard | Very Hard
991	0	a	Unfortunately, I really can't give this game a good review.  I tried to enjoy it, I really did, I mean its Double Fine right?  The gameplay is almost non-existent and all three of the chapters have the same bobbing for apples minigame over and over again. There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?  The variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.  The supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well. It also hurt that the dialogue is not voiced.  If you are looking for a cutesy little game for a young child who has 6 hours to burn, I say go for this as long as itâ€™s under 10$. Otherwise unless you are a Double Fine fanboy (which is not necessarily a bad thing, they make good games) then just walk away.
992	0	a	Costume Quest isn't a bad game. But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.  The thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.  Apart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.  But it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.  The game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.  [After a bunch of 'unhelpful' ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]
6025	1	a	I'm going to start this out by saying this: I loved this game. It is absolutely adorable. You play as one of two siblings out to collect candy on halloween. Alls not well however, when they discover that the neighborhood has been taken over by evil doings.  Artistically, Costume Quest is great. Interesting graphics with a FFVII-esque transition between the cutsy overworld and the combat scenes. The music fits the game well, but isn't outstanding. The story is silly and fun, and not super serious.  Mechanically, the game is solid. Combat and overworld controls make sense and everything is easy to pick up. Combat is menu based, but not overwhelmingly so. Each costume has different strengths and weaknesses, and different combinations can make for a very different combat experience.  If you're looking for a quick, uninvolved RPG, you could do a lot worse than Costume Quest.  If you liked this review, please have a look at   my other reviews!  
6027	1	a	It's another great game by Double Fine. It's got the same humorous dialogue, good story on a smaller scale as compared to some of their other games. Graphics are simple, music has that Halloween feel as it's perfect for playing something like this around October. Gameplay overall is a turn based RPG, it's easy and recommended for beginners of the genre. It does get repetitive but like a said, it's basically an RPG for beginners. My only complaint is that this game needed a map badly. Especially in the first part of the game. It's real confusing and almost took an hour just to find a house I did not go up too. Also the framerate is sort of locked at 30. I disabled the vsync and got it going up to 40 but for the most part this game is locked at 30. It's a 7/10.
6029	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute game where you are the brother or sister (Depending on whom you picked) and during trick or treating your sibling gets taken by a troll monster thinggy. So, in all great games you must go rescue them! It isn't easy but not hard, I was running about for about 20 minutes a little lost ;D But other wise epiccc graphics! It also had a pokemonish styled battle thing which I actually dislike. It's a fun game where you can just go trick or treating, you ever get sweets or you have to battle! :Poverall, a very cute and detailed game. I would buy it for the halloween season / if its on sale!
6031	1	a	This is the first and best game to ever truly capture the spirit of why Halloween is the treasured holiday that it is. From the childlike fantasy that costumes are a transformation rather than a mask to the currency systems of candy and collectible stamps, the nostalgic whimsy is endearing and addictive.  Every year I look forward to playing this game (I have it on PS3, thus the short play hours on Steam) and whenever I need a little dose of Halloween but it's not October, this game scratches that itch.  If you love Halloween, this game embodies it like no other.
993	0	a	Did I hate this game? No, but I can't say that I liked it either and therefore can't recommend it.   Things I liked: -The artwork is adorable -the plot isn't bad  Things I disliked: -Combat quickly become repetitive and contain lots of QTEs. -Repetitive gameplay. Every area you enter has you doing the same tasks -Limited combat strategy. Every character has a normal and an 'ultimate' attack and that is it.  I didn't dislike the game enough to stop playing, but I can't say that I liked the game either. Towards the end, it felt like I was dragging my way through because I had made it this far and might as well finish it. With that, I can't say that I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 12. 
994	0	a	This game tries to give you an insight on the kidsâ€™ imagination at best time possible: Halloween trickâ€™orâ€™treating, with all the costumes and funny games (until someone loses an eye, and oh boy they do!). And it is designed just right to do so. Game also offers a solid amount of exploration, a few side quests and some level-upping to do. All of those would make me definitely recommend the game, and for those qualities I do, but the repetitive and unnecessarily combats make me not. Because there plenty of repetitive unnecessary combats, and I cannot recommend only half a game.
6033	1	a	Costume Quest is a RPG from mithy Double Fine Productions set in the halloween theme, you combat the evil that had taken over the land, it's style is just like the old final fantasy's games, overall it is a fun and original game!  Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… 
6035	1	a	Costume Quest is a cute little game worth goofing around with in October. Once you get into it, it's pretty fun. I find myself really eager to try out whatever new costume I come across just to see its special abilities.  Combat is pretty much nothing but quick time events, which is somewhere between disappointing and frustrating. Each costume has its own different take on the quick time event though, with some asking you to get timing right, some asking you to hit a button before its too late, and some asking you to mash keys. It does keep it interesting I suppose. At least defending is always the same thing.
6037	1	a	I'll admit I'm a sucker four Double Fine games since I first played Psychonauts nearly a decade ago. But this game definitely is worth a look. Their take on a JRPG but charming as hell. Loved it and so did my kids. Collecting costumes and utilizing their unique powers was possibly the best element of this game. Sprinkle in that Double Fine humor and you got yourself a winner.
6039	1	a	It's a cute game. It's fun. The art style is nice. The writing is funny. I will admit that the game is fairly repetitive, but I think it is worth playing. It's fun.
6041	1	a	A sweet little seasonal game that, despite infuriatingly repetetive QTE-based fights with unskippable animations, may just be able to keep your attention for long enough to remain enjoyable throughout.   I'm not from a culture where Halloween is celebrated much, but the design and mood of the game made me kind of regret that I never went trick or treating as a kid, which of course speaks all the more in Costume Quest's favour.
6043	1	a	To be Honest I Love This game But,Yeah The levels 3 level + 1 bonus level ( forget the name :p ) to short  Why don't you play ? Play this on fall would more great .  (-) : I said above , the levels to short and isn't pretty good .  65% Postive and the rest is negative . Overall Graphic : 6.5/10 (not bad) Gameplay : 5.6 ( enough ) Character : 7.6 ( Well,Done)  That Just my Opinion , if you don't like it just ingrone it .
6045	1	a	Costume Quest is another great game made by Double Fine Productions. Set in a Halloween setting, this game brings forth both RPG elements and strategy, while not making the game too hard. This game isn't too long, but it isn't too short either, with the game duration being around 5-6 hours for the main story. The goal of the game is to rescue your sister from the clutches of an evil witch, and stop monsters from taking all the town's candy by trick-or-treating door to door. Along your way, you'll pick up allies and use many costumes with different abilities in and out of battle to progress through your journey. Completing side quests not only help you, but everyone else as well as you strive to finish your journey. Watch as your Halloween costumes come to life in Costume Quest.   Pros
6047	1	a	A charming and cartoony JRPG about kids saving Halloween, bogged down by a a battle system where the best three costumes are the first three you get, and where combat boils down to everyone attacking normally for two rounds, suing their special ability on the third, and repeating until the fight's over. There's no real reason to use any of the other costumes because none of them have as good stats or as good special ability as an all area hitting massive nuke with follow up DoT damage, a powerful shield capable of turning hits into 1 or 2 damage, or the only heal in the game that doesn't require the target to be dead first to revive them. The combat system is incredibly repetitive, although active due to needing to do timed button presses. Ultimately, though, literally every fight becomes attack -&gt; attack -&gt; special -&gt; repeat. Battle Stamps, the game's only equipment, don't alleviate this issue at all - some of the stamps offer side abilities that Stun or Slow enemies, but you're still doing the same attack/attack/spell trio the entire game.  I'm giving the game a positive recommendation because the repetitive and dull combat system ultimately wasn't enough to dissuade me from completing the (relatively short: 4-6 hours) game. It's still fun running around, collecting candy, and trick or treating, and seeing what the costumes look like in fights. If the game was any longer, the combat system would start to do real damage, but thanks to how short it is, it's not that big a deal.
6049	1	a	If you don't want to play as a battle unicorn, I don't want to know you as a human being
6051	1	a	 Costume Quest  is a Double Fine RPG set around Halloween where by some magical intervention, your character and his or her friends gain the ability to transform into super powered versions of their costumes to save your sibling who has been mistakenly kidnapped as a result of dressing in a terrible candy costume.  It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.  It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having 'random encounters' limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood. It fits into the game's world organically, so I can appreciate that.
6053	1	a	If you don't want to play as a battle unicorn, I don't want to know you as a human being
6055	1	a	This is such a cute game. I got it as part of a bundle I purchased in order to get another game I wanted and never really intended to play it. But I did. And I ended up loving it.  It's definitely a pretty casual game and you can breeze through it pretty quickly so it might not appeal to the most hardcore of gamers but I thought it was a blast. The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.  Since all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.  There are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.  The only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level. The top tier of that level just looked all the same to me and I kept getting turend around. At least your main costume comes with rollerblades so that you can just zip right along.
6057	1	a	This game is so much fun to play, especially at Halloween. On sale now for 0.99 cent !! Get it now !!
6059	1	a	This game is one of my favourite games. It's a cute game that I enjoy playing every year during the Halloween, but not only. I could say the game became a tradition for me :D
6061	1	a	This helps me deal with the trauma of not being able to trick or treat as an adult. I love this game.
6063	1	a	Costume Quest - unusual game with RPG and quest elements in the entourage f Hellowen and cartoonish design. Gameplay is divided into exploring, collection and fighting. Here the protagonist turns into a powerful robot that solves all the problems of apostates. Overall, not bad. Fans of the genre can take on any given day.

6065	1	a	Costume Quest is a great fun game! With a feel much like Psychonauts in the ilumination and backgrounds, I could really tell it was a Double Fine game. The only one missing in this game is voice acting on the characters that would make much more epic, besides that I loved it!! I love it has a continuation on the main story in the same game. A must have!
6067	1	a	THIS GAME IS SO CUTE, I WANT TO THROW UP AND KILL MYSELF!
6069	1	a	Costume Quest nails the 'atmosphere' of Halloween night; I can't really explain it, but it gives me those warm, fuzzy, autumnal feelings inside :)  The RPG (the actual game part) stays simple in a good way; the childlike-ness is appropriate to the setting and characters. And the length allows it to be one of those games you can play every year.  (I originally played it on Xbox 360; this PC port has some minor technical issues, but it's not that big of a deal)
6071	1	a	sticks and stones may break my bones but NERDS will never hurt me
6073	1	a	fun game, nice turn-based combat, interesting story, very fun I must say.  although, no game is 100% perfect, and for me, there`s a little too much combat, and it`s very hard to block. also, the screaming spider and yodling black widow are a bit OP.  the developers aren`t exactly humble or generous (reccomending their own games, putting an add in a secret area) but their game is very fun 8.5\10
1000	0	a	well, everything seems fresh when you start, and then it almost immediately become rinse and repeat. It's pretty terrible for a game this short to be so repetitive, also for the style of humor this game presents, they really should have sprung for voice actors.
1001	0	a	Let's see... Costume Quest is one of those games that you may only enjoy if you're 13 yo. or younger, or you just have some serious nostalgia going on... I do hate to not recommend this game, but you can probably tell if its for you by looking at the screenshots. Thats about it.
6075	1	a	 Quest to obtain Costumes   I got this game of double fine humble bundle and was the first among the three games that I played. I have to say that the game is quite short and the depth of the RPG mechanism is shallow. It might be one of the easiest RPG game that I have ever played. The total playtime is around 5 hours and the plot is simple, you basically just   save your sister  .  I would recommend this game if you just enter into RPG scene but to those veterans, you might just pick the game up for the cuteness.  Verdict: 3 out 5

6079	1	a	it's addictive!
6081	1	a	I had some good fun with this game. You can either play it casually or just dive into it and go full Costume Quest. I like the idea of the game and the different costumes that they used. With the first area you also get a very nice Halloween feeling.  The game looks pretty for the size of the game and the animations are nicely done. It obviously repeats very often and you might find that more variety would have been good but its not the case here.  The normal fights are not that hard and you should be able to win them with not much problems. Except if you are like me and forget to use stamps. The bosses can be tough without a strategy but are manageable.  All in all I liked playing this game and can recommend it.
6083	1	a	Costume Quest is a really wonderful and fun adventure for kids and adults, who still remember how it's - be a kid. It's simple, funny, touching, it's make you laugh a little and smile a lot and there aren't many things, that can do so, so I appreceate the experience. You should know though that the game is very repetitive: rob some shop, fight with monsters, do it again and again. Still, it doesn't mean that Costume Quest aren't enjoyable - quite the opposite actually, but I just give you warning. Now for the main part: it's a Halloween adventure and we have two siblings, who want to celebrate and take all sweets for themselves. They are boy and girl, it's your choice who you want to play with (hint: the choice happens, when your mother decide who will be in charge). But quite quickly events become much more difficult - the big green monster steals your sibling and now you HAVE to find him\her. Or take the wrath of your mother. Monsters just don't look so scary now, come to think of it... Gameplay is very simple: you must take sweets from shops and homes, you must fight monsters that come your way and take some side quests and exploration if you like. It may sounds boring, but actually it's pretty fun because of battle system, story and dialogs. Battle system looks like a Dream world, where your nice costume (i didn't mention this? Come on, the game has a 'costume' in title!) becomes a powerful weapon. Like, robot costume transforms into actual fabulous robot. There are also ninja, Statue of Liberty, Space warrior, magic unicorn... and french fries. Where else you can fight with your enemies, using your french fries powers?! Okay, to actual battles. Little warning: you need some reaction for this, because you will need to quickly press some buttons while you attacking or defending to make better results. And yeah, each costume have it's own special powers for battle. Like, healing allies or making a powerful attack, or shielding the ally or yourself. It's your choice what combination to prefer (hint: you aren't all alone, there will be friends, some from the very beginning, some later). As for the story, I just don't want to spoil it for you, but it's wery fun and enjoyable with all jokes, references for popular culture, dantists's twist plots... You'll see many absurd situations and many exapmles of wonderful wrinting. Seroiusly, it's good and not only for child's taste. I highly recommend to complete every quest and talk with everyone - dialogs are pretty hilarious here, really, you will have a good time.  So, if you are kid in your heart or at least can be, try the Costume Quest. Despite all its humorous self, it tells a story about siblings, about people, who may fight and tell a pretty bad things, but they're still family. They still love each other, even if it take a monster invasion to understand such a simple fact.  And if you still wondering: of course adults don't help children to fight monsters. When they ever did? *sigh* Adults.  P. S. If you encounter sudden perfomance problems (characters move very-very slow), try to reboot your computer. Strange advice, but it helps me.
6085	1	a	A fun, accessible, bite sized 'RPG' with a creative concept and a beautiful artstyle. I would say don't play for the gameplay, it's basically a 'Fisher-Price: Babies first turn based combat system'. There's actually more strategy in trying to not win a battle, as the game makes it extremely easy for you. Instead, play the game for it's hilariously written story and enjoyable feel. A great way to blow off some steam.
6087	1	a	When a game has as much charm and attention to presentation as Costume Quest does, you don't really mind that the RPG mechanics are incredibly rudimentary and simple. The only thing I really found irksome about this game were a couple of moments where DoubleFine let its history of creating Adventure games show, and the player is forced to perform tasks in particular sequences or in ways that nobody in their right mind would think of. While it's probably the easiest and shortest RPG I've played since Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, it's a really fun and light-hearted way to kill a few hours while getting into the Halloween spirit.
6089	1	a	This game is cute, fun and appropriate for all ages. The writing is witty and full of puns. 10/10 would recommend :)
6091	1	a	So, I watched the video, looked at the screenshots and figured this might be a good game for the kids but I'll never get around to playing it....boy was I wrong!   Upon giving it a go I was stunned to find an incredibly simple yet thoughtful and FUN (remember when games were more fun than work?...well that is Costume Quest in a nutshell) game that provided a good few hours of entertainment and the closest the kids made it to the controller was watching Dad play as this is a game that I just had to devour all of the content for.  The combat system is ridiculously simple for all bar a couple of big boss fights (which had me thinking about team dynamic and offensive/defensive strategies) but it was only starting to feel too repetitive as I was nearing the end of a full play through for 100% in a day. A great game, well worth the money, love changing costumes - it's fun &amp; I even found myself taking screenshots to look back and enjoy the costume battle transformations :)
6093	1	a	Pros +Very charming graphics, characters and setting. +Dialogue is very cute and nice to read, you may or may not like this but I loved it. +The overall feel of the game reminds me of when I was a kid on Halloween, so it has a very nostalgic feeling.  +Outside of the DLC (which comes free with the steam version) mission, the game never really drags.  +Nice variety in costumes.  Cons -The actual battle system is unplayable with out an Xbox 360 controller. -Even then it's not that great of combat, though some of the bosses can be fun. -The dialogue is the same and doesn't matter which kid you chose, this almost made the character development feel pointless. -Even then it's not really that fun.  A pretty fun game, has a lot of short comings but still a pretty solid game.
6095	1	a	A funny light-hearted take on the RPG genre. Very enjoyable.
6097	1	a	well written and cute, casual RPG. COME ON
1003	0	a	Double Fine is a bit like Pixar. They bring a certain magic and charm to all of their products. Most of their games are quite humorous and the stories are creative and unpredictable.  So if Double Fine is Pixar, Costume Quest is Double Fine's 'Cars.' It's not a bad game. The premise is nifty and the jokes will make you grin, but there are just better showings if you want the Double Fine experience.   Costume Quest takes place on Halloween, and you are a kid who has to rally some friends to trick-or-treat your way through town to save your sibling. It's colorful and delightful, like playing an old-school Nickelodeon cartoon. But after about an hour the old school Nickelodeon is overshadowed by the old school RPG game mechanics, which are repetitive and don't provide much actual decision-making or challenge. The story is divided into three beautiful set pieces, but again, the game play in each set piece is identical. Same main tasks, same exact sidequests, and the costumes you collect for monster fights aren't varied enough in their abilities to matter.  If you love Double Fine and you're very tolerant of JRPG-style gameplay, you'll probably have fun, but I wouldn't make this your first Double Fine game. Psychonauts is the one to go with.
6099	1	a	A cute Halloween-themed RPG game with a good story, turn-based combat, a mixture of painted and cel-shaded graphics, and good music (and sound effects in general). Kept me entertained for hours. Well worth the price.
6101	1	a	if you like halloween this is perfect
6103	1	a	Simple yet addictive game!!
6105	1	a	Great fun! Always give this one a replay during the Halloween season!
6107	1	a	4th favourite RPG of all time. I said it before and I'll say it again: 'Originality' is the one word that describes DoubleFine. How many games do you know that are turn based combat RPGs where you change your classes depending on which costume your wearing? Did I mention it's halloween, the dialogue is charmingly funny and the game's currency is sweets?
6109	1	a	Cute, though a little tedious at times. I played it through once, but probably wouldn't repeat. Worth it even as an adult, particularly if you like DoubleFine-style games.
6111	1	a	Simple old school style turned based RPG strategy fun.
6113	1	a	Utterly charming. I grinned like an idiot throughout much of the entire, just-long-enough experience.  Broken down, you and your annoying sibling go off trick-or-treating until suddenly, MONSTERS! When your brother/sister is nabbed, you must retrieve them at all costs.  Set against the backdrop of a neighbourhood on Halloween, you travel across a town battling no-goodniks in a modified turn-based battle system. The powers you have in each fight are determined by the costume you're wearing. Costumes are acquired through standard adventure gameplay, but some cool ones are secret... can you find everything the game has to offer?
6115	1	a	Great fun! Always give this one a replay during the Halloween season!
6117	1	a	A game about the fantasy of children who can use 'special abilities' and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented. Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy. The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at. You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.
6119	1	a	Costume Quest is a good game and definitely worth $10. This game reminded me A LOT of South Park Stick of Truth to the point that I actually wondered if the South Park team had used Costume Quest as an influence when they created their game. That being said, obviously the actual story and dialogue is very different to Stick of Truth. For one, the kids aren't swearing constantly, for two nobody is getting anything shoved up the rear region and for three there is no  spoken  dialogue. I was really on the fence about there being no voice actors in this game. What I enjoy about Double Fine Production games is that their characters are really likeable and they take the time to show you a little bit about everyone in your world, even the guy that you see for one second will have a funny line and a nice costume. Here I felt that was not necessarily absent but not as prevelent when compared to other Double Fine games like Psychonauts. I wanted to hear the kids voices especially in cut scenes where the dialogue is bouncing between 5 different people. It just would have made it easier to follow. Obviously it's not like you're constantly reading, this isn't a visual novel, it's just something that I would change. The characters are still likable and the story keeps you motivated to continue to the end.  What I liked the most about this game is that it's funny! It's fun! It's lighthearted! The art style is great. The world is detailed and immersive. The turn-based fighting avoids becoming repetitive because every now and then you get a new costume and a new set of awesome moves that come with it. Everytime I got a new costume I would call my boyfriend over so we could watch it's ultimate ability and high 5 afterwards because 90% of the time it was FREAKIN AWESOME! Heck I even took one of the ultimates and put in on 9GAG because it rocked my world.   http://9gag.com/gag/aLPeW75   What's more, you get Grubbins on Ice which is about an extra 1 - 2 hours of gameplay after you've completed Costume Quest. It's equally as fun and provides a great ending leaving you wanting to purchase Costume Quest 2 so you can see what happens. To complete both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice should take 7 - 10 hours depending on how into unlocking achievements you are. It's also the type of game that you can play again after a year or two. Oh and also, if anyone from Double Fine reads this: Thanks for adding the Psychonauts music in the Camping Store at the Mall. It made me smile &lt;3  7.5/10
6121	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those games that you get from a bundle and it just sits in your library for months on end. That happened to me and then I thought that I should probably play the game. So I did and I found it to be an immersive RPG that should not be over looked. The whole concept of this game is great its something original combining turn based strategy with humour and Halloween. It is something that is definitely worth playing.
6123	1	a	If you're expecting an enthralling epic, don't look here. It's fun, it's simple, and it's reasonably amusing.
6125	1	a	Firstly It's looks childish, but It's absolutely not what you think! This game is one of the best Adventure-quest game I ever played! It's so much fun and characters looks good, also the fights so enjoyable, and it's actually not that easy everywhere, but It's truly a Fantastic Adventure. Add the Dlc and you get +Adventure and Fun! 10/10 :)
6127	1	a	A game I enjoy replaying every October. Filled with heart and wit, this game reminds you of what it was like to be a kid on Halloween night, which, if you were like me, was a magical, mysterious night full of wonder. The battles can get a bit tedious, but otherwise, it's nearly flawless fun.
6129	1	a	Costume Quest is a carefully distilled J-RPG with a well written, light hearted story and solid gameplay. It's a good pick-up-and-play game in a genre that usually requires days of investment, with likeable characters and just enough depth. Normally, quick-action sequences ruin the pacing of a game for me, but they are well implemented here in a way that feels almost intuitive, if still a bit repetetive, after a few battles. When the main storyline wraps up, the included Grubbins on Ice add-on storyline lets you start with all your stuff from the main quest, and includes new costumes (character classes) and stamps (bonus abilities). I'd recommend this for kids or adults who don't need dimension-spanning save-all-of-time-and-space plots, ridiculously complex leveling systems, or spiky-haired, ambiguously gendered anti-heroes in their J-RPGs.
6131	1	a	Adventure RPG about a halloween night where your sibling was kidnaped by evil monsters and you &amp; your friends have to trick-or-treat your way till the end.  - Simple &amp; easy turn-based battles with quicktime events - Casual story, funny dialogues &amp; quests - Different halloween costumes with special abilities which help you in and outside battle - Very childish graphics - Good variety on levels   The perfect game for your children =3 
6133	1	a	This gem is a great example of what games can be at their best: funny, charming, creative, unique, and short enough to enjoy over a weekend or three. Very highly recommended.
6135	1	a	Funny and interesting game suitable for any age and short enough so you (or kids) are not bored... Combat is pretty easy, but that is to be expected, because it's pretty much aimed to be played by kids...  Recommended...
6137	1	a	Super linear with the illusion of choice and control. It's like an extremely dumbed-down version of any of the Final Fantasy games. Plays like a game made for kids but designed for grown-ups. But you like this one not for the way the game plays. It's about the story and the atmosphere. (I mean, this is a Double Fine game after all). But it's a very good time, definitely. Don't get me wrong. I love the trick-or-treating atmosphere. The fighting. The odd humor. And the fact that there is no voice-acting, just silence and text (this is really creepy, in a good but unintentionally Lynchian way). Get the expansion/DLC too. It's loads of fun!
6139	1	a	The rpg aspect of this game is so beautiful and the cartoon like graphics aren't too hurting to the eye neither. This is definitely a buy and 100% that ish. The DLC ain't that bad neither.
6141	1	a	This is a very cute little game. Nothing special or brilliant, but definitely mindless entertainment. Very sweet.
6143	1	a	Costume Quest is a really cute, short, turn based RPG set on Halloween. Your sibling has been taken by monsters after they mistook her candy-corn Halloween costume for real candy and you set out on an adventure to get her back.  On the way you unlock various costumes which transform into the â€œreal thingâ€ in battle. Each costume has a basic attack and a special attack. There is a surprising amount of costumes, which keeps the game varied and you can also add battle stamps to your characters to give them bonus effects.  The perfect Halloween game if youâ€™re not into spooky stuff.
6145	1	a	A game about the fantasy of children who can use 'special abilities' and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented. Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy. The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at. You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.
6147	1	a	I've been enjoying Costume Quest! It's cool, and puts me in the Halloween Holiday Spirit that is fast approaching. &amp; I can't wait to play Costume Quest 2! :)  This game is an Epic Deal on Sale and even worth if when it's not on sale!!
6149	1	a	One word: 'AWESOME'.   That's just because I can't spell out that Supercalifragisomething word though. That and I'm too lazy to look it up.   I could not stop once I started the game. Costumes that turn into the real deal, a really cool excuse to hoard candy (Costume Quest: 'Saving the World One Candy at a Time'), and an adventure with little to no adult supervision? Who wouldn't want some of THAT for even just a single night? Count me in! Hygiene-wise, the whole rummaging garbage bins and picking up candy from dirty floors was kind of questionable, but I'm guessing nobody gives a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about these things. Candy is candy and it's love.   By the way, I 've never tried trick-or-treating. I know, I know... I had a really boring childhood. This game made me want to turn back time and give it a try for even just once though. But then again, who said only kids get to trick-or-treat? I'm adding that to my bucket list.
6151	1	a	I enjoyed my play through of this game. The run took me about 6 hours trying to complete all the quests I found in the game. It doesn't have replayability. What it does have is a nice atmosphere, great tongue in cheek humor and a story line that is fun and didn't were out its welcome. I'd say I was only a slight bit bothered that you are unable to skip the combat intro's, which get somewhat repetive after a while. Definitely give it a try when you can get it in a sale!
6153	1	a	A Halloween adventure that combines classic RPG elements with silly humor and turn-based fighting. Costume Quest is a fun, short, humor-full adventure, where you journey to collect different costumes (with different skills and abilities) while unfolding a halloween vibe anyone can enjoy.    +  Fun and charming costumes and abilities to collect  +  Puzzle-like storyline and missions  +  Easy Achievements   +  Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)  -  Very simple fighting/exploring mechanisms  -  Repetitive mechanics to some extent     Personal Ranking:   6/10 
6155	1	a	Costume Quest is awesome. If you're a fan of any of Double Fines previous games you will love it too. South Park the Stick of Truth reminds me a lot of this game. The development team probably looked at this game for inspiration. Fun story with fun mechanics.
6157	1	a	A fun and cute turn-based RPG. The battle system is simple yet effective and fun. So it's the story. It's not very deep ir long, but fun nonetheless.
6159	1	a	Such a cute laid back game. Worth a play through. I finished everything. It was fun and worth a try for a simple RPG.
6161	1	a	Costume Quest is a simplifyed turn-based RPG where you must trick or treat the various houses in the levels in order to advance, gain different costumes with abilities and stats of their own and buy special skills for your party.  The title isn't that challenging nor requires an intense grinding: if you fill your candies buck on a regular basis and buy the right abilities you will have no problems in any of Costume Quest's battles. Being able to answer well to the various combat QTEs (which you can use both to defend yourself and inflict extra damage per attack) is however mandatory.  Beside fighting in random battles and collect candies and equipment, there are also several side quests in every area: the majority of them is recycled once per level, but without feeling that repetitive. Given this is a Double Fine game, you can also make a personal quest out of witnessing the various NPCs chatters and reactions.  The main appeal of Costume Quest is the writing: the story is simple enough, but the humor of the various NPCs and situations make up for it quite nicely. And of course, there are various videogame references for your to find.  The Steam version of Costume Quest also comes with the only DLC for the title, Grubbins of Ice. This new chapter doesn't add anything new to the overall game's formula (save for three new costumes) and doesn't last that long, being worth an average of two hours or so. However, as with the main campaign, the new jokes and characters make Grubbins on Ice a worthy add
6163	1	a	This game has fun characters and a simple combat system that is appropriate for younger players. The humor is mild and the themes are Halloween-y but not scary. Some of the animations in combat can feel repetitive after awhile, but overall it provides a good experience.
6165	1	a	This fun little RPG is worth a few good laughs and an interesting world to explore and play through, although it may seem like nothing this obscre gem is sure to keep you captivated in its small time with you.
6167	1	a	The combat gets repetitive very quickly(a lot of the cutscenes can be canceled by pressing shift key - thank god) but the other stuff is preety good. If the game is on sale it is definitly worh buying.
6169	1	a	Man, this is such a great game! Costume Quest is a really fun playthrough! It brings back the excitement of a mission on Halloween knight (Eh, eh, get it?) with a turn-based fighting style of gameplay! I really loved this game and all it's additions such as battle stamps and different costumes and the DLC! During your adventure you'll acquire different costumes and stamps that aply different advantages for your team in combat! Costume Quest might seem childish, but it's really hilarious and a must have for anyone who loves the turn-based fighting combat style.
6171	1	a	Firstly It's looks childish, but It's absolutely not what you think! This game is one of the best Adventure-quest game I ever played! It's so much fun and characters looks good, also the fights so enjoyable, and it's actually not that easy everywhere, but It's truly a Fantastic Adventure. Add the Dlc and you get +Adventure and Fun! 10/10 :)
6173	1	a	I love this game! I was looking for something to get me in the mood for Halloween and this was perfect- cute, spooky and full of little details and secrets. There are lots of side-quests and things to collect along the way, which appeals to me a lot. The costumes and battle opening sequences for each costume are really well done. The one thing I struggled with initially was the mechanics during battles; you have to press the specified key at exactly the right time to execute a successful attack or defence which took me a while to get my head around! After a while, though, I found this aspect to be enjoyable and the difficulty curve was just right, I think. All in all I loved playing this, and would definitely recommend to those who like cuteness, collecting things and really well decorated Halloween scenes :)
6175	1	a	It'll definitely put you in the mood for Halloween. However, it's fun to play regardless, even if it isn't near the holiday. It's a weird, yet funny little game.
6177	1	a	'It had a concise story paired with inventive puzzle mechanics that challenged you to be creative' A quote from Charles Onyet's Portal 2 review on IGN.  Costume quest has nothing mentioned in the above quote, Portal 2 is far better.
6179	1	a	Cute, fun, &amp; quick game with some pretty easy RPG elements to it. Good for kids or casual play or anyone that likes Halloween.
6181	1	a	Like Taking Candy From a ... Weird Green Monster Guy.   10/10

6187	1	a	The Paradox's review on:  Costume Quest   NOTICE: Verdict on bottom of this review.   My quick notes to the devs  Where to start... first, I must say that I got this game by a coupon and stumbled apon it quite randomly.   I MUST   say that this game is   AMAZING!
1007	0	a	I bought the Costume Quest 1 &amp;2 bundle on sale, the trailer made it seem like so much fun. However, it was just so repetetive I wasn't able to enjoy it very much. I like the concept and I found the sense of humor amusing at fist, but then it got a little over the top with repetition for my taste and the limitations of exploring made me feel bored after about 20 minutes. It's a matter of preferense, and this just wasn't for me. Haven't tried the 2nd one yet, and I don't think I will either. If you don't mind doing the same thing over and over again, then why not. I'd get it on sale, though.
6189	1	a	Did you like Bugs Bunny or Crash Bandicoots? How about Monkey Islands? Costume Quest is like a modern hybrid of the aforementioned on steroids, and you should definitely give it a try. It's adorable, it's got humour, and most importantly, there's that sort of quintessential innocence like it came straight from the heart.
6191	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&amp;2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!
6193	1	a	Really cute game.  The aethestics and gameplay and simple and sweet.   Unfortunately, the gameplay is overly simplified. Press a button, then an attack happens.  The game is short enough that the simple gameplay and story kept my attention, but if you're looking for some deep and meaningful gameplay, you're in the wrong place. Like most of DoubleFine's games, this is short, stylized, and solid enough to hold up to this condensed experience.  Enjoy the experience! ... but don't dig too deep.
6195	1	a	This game is Halloween perfection. Super easy mechanics, love the overall simplicity of this game, and it is so easy to pick up. I can definitely see myself playing this game every october. Cute, funny dialogue at times, and cutscenes/dialogue IS skippable. Such a beautiful feature &lt;3 BUT not needed for this game. The cutscenes were interesting enough to want to watch every time. Some of the costume transformations were hilarious, others just epic. Towards the end of the game, however, the fights started feeling super repetitive, so I kept switching the costumes up to keep some interest. Overall, this is a pretty laid back, easy game and definitely hit the spot for the type of game I want to play around October. I bought the Costume Quest 1 &amp; 2 bundle on sale for about $4. So beyond worth it. I cannot recommend this game enough, especially if you are new to games. Just do yourself a favor and get this game &lt;3
6197	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&amp;2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!
6199	1	a	Probably the cutest game Double Fine has ever made, with a fantastic premise and decent execution. It's short but the length is nice for what it is, there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments with the dialogue, the environments are detailed and look quite nice, and the plot, while simple, is pretty enjoyable. That game is very easy in terms of its turn-based battles, so if you're looking for a challenge, look somewhere else. I do think it works very well as an 'introductory RPG', though, and can be used to teach newcomers to the genre about basic RPG tactics like prioritizing enemies, diversifying your party's classes, making strategic decisions about abilities, and choosing when to use special moves so they will be most effective. A solid game that makes for a fun Halloween night.
6201	1	a	Let me just say that I am a massive fan of Double Fine. I love that they push as far as they can in the game medium to see what they can do.  This game is fun. Especially if you enjoyed the SNES era RPG battle system.
6203	1	a	I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge.

6205	1	a	CQ is another great game from double fine.  The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt to save their little town from monsters at halloween. It is all told through the use of 'speech bubbles' around key characters.   The game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs.   I've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.  The 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the 'feel' of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.  The soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.  This game includes both CQ and it's DLC 'grubbins on ice'. GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.  CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.
6207	1	a	A clear love letter to JRPG masterpieces of the past (console) generations, mixed with a pinch of Double Fine's weirdness and a great sense of humor. If games like Earthbound the Persona series are on your personal all-time favorite lists you'd be doing yourself a massive disservice in passing up this title.
6209	1	a	A cute, fun little RPG. Not too complex, and a bit repetative, but its only 6-7 hours long to complete everything so it doesn't hit you too hard. Fun story, some interesting mechanics, but if you are looking for something challenging or deep look elsewhere. A good RPG for kids, and a simple fun game otherwise.  Very simple, bit repetative, not much to it. But fun and interesting and silly. Pick it up on sale, or in a double fine bundle.
6211	1	a	This game is awesome! You play as a child who dresses his costume for halloween and goes to the houses of the neighborhood to trick and treat. In the middle of this, you lose your brother and your journey to rescue him begins.  This game mixes simple elements of RPG and action game, the graphics are lovely, as well as the soundtrack. The battles are per turn and quite dynamic, recommended!  And the achievements worth the try, for those who like those kind of things. ;)
6213	1	a	I originally played this on xbox 360 when DoubleFine first released it. It was interesting and I loved the atmosphere then. Now, I still love every second of it. The combat isn't ever boring and the game has great personality!
6215	1	a	So, I'd like to say I've been putting off buying this game for ages. Literally, ages. What happened was with the recent summer sale in June, I bought the bundle of both games for 6$. Heres what I have to say,  ++ GREAT humor and storyline, ('Gus from section 5, your wife is worried SICK.' and the kid in a banana suit who said, 'This is a total banana-fest'. LOL. ++ really lovely backgrounds,  ++also you get to choose if you wanna be a girl or boy, which was not what I was expecting when I saw 'your sister does this' and etc.,  The game itself is really short which is a bummer to me. It has four levels, but they're all long in their own way. You have to trick or treat and solve an issue in each level, and you can play hide-and-seek (well its optional actually), and they'll upgrade your trick or treat bags to cuter and cooler things, you can make optional costumes in the game which can have a big effect on your battle; (I'm not a battling kind of person, but this game was fun and cute.) Battle stamps are the best.  The Grubbin's on Ice was really interesting too, its an add on to the game's ending.  I just feel sad its a bit short for me. Just a bit over 8 hours and I've finished it with all with all achivements to boot with no guide. You shouldn't need a guide for this game! It's fun and good like that!
6217	1	a	this game is really fun!!!!!
6219	1	a	This is a great game, with two story lines and multiple ways to play it's just great. The only thing I would have to criticize is that some of the controls are a little wacky and when you cange then they go back, this may be just my problem. Even though you should defiantly buy this game.
6221	1	a	It's adorable, hands down. It's pretty darn cute as well as being engaging and keeping you interested. Every time you have a new opponent or get a new costume, BAM you need to reconfigure your strategy, even if it's only to see 'what does this unicorn costume do?' Great even for younger kids.
6223	1	a	Gotta thank one of my besties, gogostar, for getting me this game. Because of it, I love Double Fine Productions and will definitely be keeping an eye out for future projects. It's supposed to be a children's turn-based RPG but only informed teens and adults would understand some of the more subtle humor. I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas (you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin) but less deranged. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, good feels, nice art style, and it's adorable as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. What other game would let you duke it out as a vampire, unicorn, and a pirate (my favorite in-game trio)? Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to relax with a nice, cute story about sibling bonding and friendship.
6225	1	a	Nice in resonably small doses. The novelty of the combat and the variation in the costumes keeps it interesting, pretty much for the whole game. It's quite short and I think that's probably a good thing as it was rather starting to grate by the time I hit the bonus content. It's cute, funny and occasionally touching and you should definitely watch a gameplay video to see how it plays before you decide if you want it....
6227	1	a	I didn't know exactly what to expect when I installed Costume Quest. I was a big fan of Tim Schafer games when I was a kid (Grim Fandango and Full Throttle are some of my favorite 90s video game memories), but found Double Fine ventures like the much-loved Psychonauts to be marred by either clunky gameplay or hideous art decisions. But Costume Quest proves that Tim Schafer's still got it, and within 20 minutes I was a fan again.  Sure, the game doesn't employ high-end graphical techniques, the traditional JRPG style combat moves can take too long, and the game is quite short. It doesn't have a 'deep' story, and doesn't really try to say much, either. But the subtley perfect art, the cute-but-not-sickeningly-so character designs, and witty dialog overcome any shortcomings.  It's not complex, but it's one of the most 'perfect' games I've played in years.  Recommended to anyone with good taste, and essential to any gamer who remembers what the 90s was like.
1008	0	a	It's a children's game. I got bored with it very quickly, despite the art style, background music and animations (which are all done well). Combat is turn-based, and consists of attacking and defending. It's a very very simple turn-based RPG. You have quests, you have an item slot and you can level-up but it's all so very shallow. Would not recommend for anyone over the age of 15.
1009	0	a	While I love Double Fine Adventures, this was not worth the time or money to me personally. It is a bit repetative and it lacks the ability to save wherevere/whenever I want. I quit playing after I kept starting from the same point after a while when I'd only want to play for about 20 mins or so (then again, I can sometimes be a slow gamer, so the checkpoints may arrive earlier for you).

6229	1	a	Clever and tons of fun!
6231	1	a	This is one of the few games I've played through multiple times and enjoyed the ride each trip.  It's a short, turn based RPG with quirky characters, Psychonaut-esque graphics (yay, Double Fine!), and a fairly entertaining story.  The combat system isn't all that exciting and if you're a person that doesn't like to switch between costumes/character builds, odds are it'll grow tiresome quickly.  Still though - if you like Double Fine, weird characters, good humor, and decent gameplay, you can't go wrong.
6233	1	a	When I first bought this game I'll be honest, I didn't think it was going to be too good. Just bought it on sale beacause it was cheap. However I ended up getting really into the game. It's fun and quirky and really great to play plus I ended up making my personal mission to discover what each costume does.   Nice causal play.
6235	1	a	I highly recommend this as a childrens game. It plays like a really simple stripped down JRPG, just set around halloween instead of around the coming of the great big evil that wipes out the world. You pick up party members, extra outfits that change play style, and it's a nice simple story with some half-decent mini-games. If you've already gotten a few RPGs under your belt you'll likely be bored out of your mind, but as I said a great 'my first JPRG' for kids around 8-12 yrs old.

6239	1	a	'You guys, can we make a pact? Let's do this every Halloween!'
6241	1	a	Everyone should play this game during Christmas like I did.
6243	1	a	great animations, and fun, until it gets repetitive, still good though 7/10
6245	1	a	Costume Quest is much like Halloween candy: fun-sized and sweet. Though itâ€™s not a long game, itâ€™s very enjoyable and it doesnâ€™t overstay its welcome. It employs JRPG elements that are reminiscent of the Paper Mario games and the mechanics are simple and accessible. But the big draw is the charm that is stuffed into every aspect of the story and characters. I thoroughly recommend joining Reynold and Wren in saving Halloween no matter what time of year it is.
6247	1	a	I've first played Brutal Legend, and now Costume Quest. Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings. Costume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid!  Essencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister.  So, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way. That sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.   The game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat.  In combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks.  Each costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them.  There are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle. You have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.  I didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow. To its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.  Outside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests.  There are quite a few 'secrets' and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!  Besides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat. The various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!   The graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for. Music was up there as well, really enjoyed it!  Most of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!   So... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well. But that's my biggest complain with this game.  Other than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.  It looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively.  It's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist! I'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!
6249	1	a	Pretty fun game with quirky humor. Sadly it does not have any replay value and I cannot recommend it at more then $5. But if you enjoy fun dialog with unique characters it's worth a shot. The expansion adds.. some? But it's still very linear and pretty repetative after awhile, the main appeal is def unlocking the costumes and the fun dialog/plot.. the combat does get a lil stale
6251	1	a	        My Playthrough
1012	0	a	I didn't ejoy too much this game for some aspects of it. First of all, this game is the same always, turn-based battles, looking for sweets, but battles are always the same. i haven't completed the whole game but I'm quite sure that if in 4 hours it doesn't change, it will not change after that... Also for me is frustrating that sometimes even thought you do everything well in a battle you cannot win in any way because enemies are too high level. Apart from that, I loved how this game is designed, graphics are beautiful, costumes look great and abilities and powers from these are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend this game just because I felt so frustrated playing it and i quited. Maybe some day i will finish it but i think i will not do it at the moment...
6253	1	a	Costume Quest is a classic RPG with turn-based combat mixed with Double Fine style. You play a child out on halloween teaming up with other kids and fighting monsters, all while trick-or-treating. Instead of the usual RPG equipment, the halloween costumes you wear transform into full size versions during combat, providing their associated powers to your characters. It all meshes together perfectly, as you would expect from a Double Fine game.  I'm not sure what else there is to say. It's cute, charming, and a solid RPG experience that doesn't feel dull and repetitive like many of these types of RPGs do. My only complaints are that the controls are a bit sluggish and the game is locked at 30 fps which will hopefully be addressed in a patch now that Double Fine has the rights to the game back.
6255	1	a	This game is like, awesome, with like costumes and stuff and you're on a quest and you get to do cool RPG stuff.
6257	1	a	It's a fun little overlooked game, especially for people who would enjoy exploring and collecting items in a colourful Halloween setting. Get it on sale and you can't go wrong.
6259	1	a	Costume Quest is a 'small' INDIE RPG Game with a  huge lovely atmosphere of Halloween .  The game is short  (you can enjoy it around 6~8 hours for both stories) but  the story and the quests  are so  well made  that you don't mind the shortness. Only the battles are boring after playing awhile, but for a INDIE RPG game they are still enjoyable - and you can press the animations away if you have seen it a 100th time.   So if this game goes on  STEAM Sale 75%  you  must buy  it! Even for the full price (8,99â‚¬ at this time) it's worth of its money.  Best INDIE RPG Game I've played so far

6263	1	a	There was no DLC for new costumes so not really a good game for the stupid gamers
6265	1	a	Fun and cute little rpg game. Recommended for those who just want to play an rpg without the huge time investment.  Pros: -Cute -no grinding required (unless you want to 100% the game, and even then very little grinding is required) -short -lovable cast of characters -interesting dynamic where you're not really pigeon holed into making each character follow a specific role, lots of room for variation and you can always switch up your stats/abilities.  Cons: -short, only took me 9 hours to 100% the whole game -movement can be a bit janky, I got stuck on the environment a lot -dialog is slow.  Overall I recomment this game to anyone who just wants a short casual style rpg with a cute factor.
6267	1	a	  Trick or Treat! Done! 
6269	1	a	Cool game. :P Hah.. Halloween. :P
6271	1	a	A classic in my opinion. This made me excited for Halloween probably more than decorating or getting my own costume and such. A great little game with RPG elements, but a unique style of its own.
6273	1	a	This game is sooooo cute and I love it! There's so much to do and its so fun! ^.^
6275	1	a	Trick or Treat Simulator 2k10
6277	1	a	Somewhat of a children's game but I had fun anyway.
6279	1	a	If Pixar could ever make a good game, it would be like this; nothing awe-inspiring, but a cute, fun little game that'll probably make you smile.
6281	1	a	A classic in my opinion. This made me excited for Halloween probably more than decorating or getting my own costume and such. A great little game with RPG elements, but a unique style of its own.
6283	1	a	Really enjoyed this game.  Nothing amazing on the mechanics front, combat is essentially quick time events (not so bad as a core mechanic), so the skills is choosing a decent load out with your parties costumes. However, one will already be chosen for most fights due to it's main screen ability. This doesn't become much of a problem though, as nearly all the fights (bar the final) are rather easy.  This joy of this game is that it's cute and funny, and enjoyable to play. Not the longest game, but I wouldn't have finished it if it had been, so is a welcome length.  And that came off REALLY negative considering how muched I loved this. Let me stress, the style of this game is fantastic, and well worth a look. Will be more enjoyable if you enjoying hunting in corners for candy and costumes :)
6285	1	a	This one is truly a GEM, with it's intriging and brilliant storyline and its cartoonish grafics you can't go wrong with buying this game, and honestly it's original price is a steal for this game.  this is one of those games you can intreduce your kids to gaming with, thoiugh you propertly have to play with them and help them a littel do to the game being text based, but all in this game is good for any adult that have but the smallest part of child left in them, and any child that is 5+  The game takes around 7-9 hours to complete and if you buy the DLC you will get additional 2-3 more hours of gameplay.   I highly recommend this game!
6287	1	a	Costume Quest is a Halloween-themed and RPG-ish adventure game with adorable graphics, detailed levels and thoroughly humorous dialogues.  The story is rather simple: Your brother/sister gets kidnapped by candy-stealing monsters, so it's all up to you to rescue him/her and save Halloween.  Over the course of the game you collect various costumes, each with it's own special ability, which you can equip on any of the 3 characters of your 'squad' to be as efficient as possible during the combat sequences.  By collecting candy that is scattered throughout the levels you can also purchase battle stamps, which work as perks for your costumes and can enhance them with various abilities to make you even more powerful.  The quests lack quite a bit of variety so, even though the levels vary, the quests themselves feel pretty repetitive after a while, but all in all it is a widely enjoyable game which sould keep you entertained for a solid 7-8 hours. I recommend to play it with a Xbox360 pad.
6289	1	a	A great introduction to the JRPG genre. Very high accessability while not being too shallow means anyone can get into it. Fun, fast paced battles are spaced out with minigames and level exploration. Even contains a nice class system much akin to FF3.
6291	1	a	I have so much love for this game :D

6295	1	a	Somewhat of a children's game but I had fun anyway.
6297	1	a	It's simple, addictive, short and sweet (pun intended) If you're looking for a compelling story, raw challenge or innovative game play... please look elsewhere.  This game is meant as an introductionary game for RPG noobies. It takes elements from Mario RPG / Paper Mario with timed attacks, so the game tricks you in to thinking you're doing more than selecting 'Fight' from a menu. The costumes are fun to change up, half of them are useless and impractical but they look cool.  The challenge does ramp up a bit at the very end and the final boss can be very obnoxious if you don't bring a healing costume in with you. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy for it's job system and Paper Mario for it's timed button strikes, you'll enjoy this game.  Only downside is how slow the game can be at times, having to watch repeated animations over and over before a battle begins... also it can be a tad clunky especially when using the dash feature from the Robot costume...   This brings me to final point that it was bad game design on Double Fines part to allow this costume to dash and none of the others... It makes it manditory for you to utilize this first costume at all times meaning it doesn't give you much in the way of variety... Thankfully this was fixed in CQ2 with an actual dash button.  The DLC Grubbin's on Ice is around the same length as one of the in game core chapters, 2 hours in length. Worthy addition to the game and links the events of CQ1 and 2 so it's basically manditory to play if you intend to continue your Costume Quest. :P
1013	0	a	After going through 3 hours of the same, repetitive fights, missions, candy-collecting, and mini-games... I just can't get myself to launch the game again, although I'm the type of gamer that just has to see the ending at least once. Since I've regretfully spent money on buying this game, I just don't see the point of even spending my precious time on it.
6299	1	a	A basic turn based rpg with a heaping dose of charm.
1015	0	a	Ugh I didn't pay much money for this game but even that wasn't worth it. I thought this game would be good and at stages it is but I don't like it too much I had to use a tutorial for the first area because it was so confusing. The combat is okay but I was expecting Final Fantasy style fighting not button pressing fighting. This game dissapointed me and I kinda wish I didn't buy it or this game was free.
6301	1	a	A short, but very enjoyable game that is perfect to play around the Halloween season.
6303	1	a	If you would have asked me if it was possible to turn trick-or-treating into a fun video game, I would have laughed. But after playing Costume Quest, I'm simply left in awe. It is so clever, witty, and charming--a perfect game for kids or just the kid in you. The look, feel and gameplay is somewhat similar to On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness. There's a lot of thought that went into the costumes, quests, battle stamps, and the special attacks. I challenge all doubters to say they can't find an enjoyable game in here. Two thumbs up.
6305	1	a	A basic turn based rpg with a heaping dose of charm.
6307	1	a	Very enjoyable small adventure game with a Halloween theme.
6309	1	a	A great little Game from DoubleFine! The graphics are simple but the style is one of the best with its cell shading-look. The Fighting-system isn't too complex but it is enough to keep you away from boredom. The story isnt complicated but well told. If you like action_adventures with level-you-character-up and collect-some-things mechanics AND with humor, this is for you!
6311	1	a	A great little RPG game with a candy bag full of character and charm, if your looking for an RPG but don't want to spend 60 odd hours to finish it then this is not a bad choice.
6313	1	a	Costume quest is a fun game to play and has a interesting ambient to it.  Pros: Cool story, funny characters and fun rpg fighting (to some point)  Cons: extremely repetitive at some points
6315	1	a	Ooh ooh We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand    
6317	1	a	it was pretty spooky
6319	1	a	Play it on Halloween and Christmas (or October and December for festive reasons). Why not? Straightforward nothing-super-special-but-still-nice turn-based RPG.
6321	1	a	Very Good game 7/10
6323	1	a	this is a good game 
1021	0	a	Just a very boring game. It lack any real depth. Combat gets stale very very quickly. Story is just mediocre, tried-and-true.   Items, a staple in any RPG, for whatever reason is omitted, where Double Fine could have added some 'tongue-in-cheek' elements. The only faint sense of utility or customizations is from the 'Battle Stamps', which are 'added bonuses' like an extra skill or stats, which seemed meaningless other than the counter-strike or stun skill -- the only one which would give me a chance in battle.  The costumes did not offer any stat changes other than the obvious battle mechanic changes. Personally, I was expecting the 'knight' to have a more 'tank-like' role in addition to the 'shield' ability like More HP and lower attack. I'm expecting some differences.   You can find yourself very easily overwhelmed in a 2v3 battle with no 'usual' / 'crutch' mechanic to swing the battle in your favor like Items or some OP one-time use ability. Instead you are greeted with persistent in battle costumes (which could have been changed like that of FFX-2 dynamic) and 1 every three turns 'super-skill' that aligns with the costume chosen. Oh, and the battles consist of you pressing a button to do more dmg or take less damage.  I got as far as the mall and just couldnt careless. The story is unique-ish, but the gameplay is just boring and rather... lame.
1022	0	a	Ummm... The game could be alright if you enjoy nothing but quicktime events and colectable hunting. Personally, not worth the money.  Edit: It's an adventure game though. This is what adventure games usually are. I should have also added, the Linux experience is flawless so don't worry about that. Still not my cup of tea though.

6325	1	a	I usually try to stay away from stuff that is cute and kidsy, but this game is actually not really like that. It is a charming little game with really great graphic design and a good turn based rpg combat system like Final Fantasy style. You go around a town map doing quests and it is so far a lot of fun. Double Fine â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up Iron Brigade bad which was really unfortunate, but they have a gem on their hands here with this game. The huge flaws in this game though is that it is very short (I beat the main game + the dlc in 7 hours), there is no replay value: once you beat it there is no reason to ever play it again, and it could also be more difficult. One of my favorite short playthroughs that I have played in a long time. I don't know why exactly but it just strikes a chord with me and I love it. I think because it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time, Earthbound on the Super Nintendo. A very good game, just way too short. Catch it on sale and only on sale.
1024	0	a	One guy turned into a giant robot and that was kind of cool. But for reasons I cannot articulate, I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate this game.
6327	1	a	Cute as heck. A+
6329	1	a	Costume Quest is a charming, fun take on the turn based RPG genre. Sort of condensed. Instead of individually swapping weapons, spells, attacks, and actions you choose costumes that change your appearance, battle abilities and attacks, and help solve free roam puzzles with various actions. On top of that you can choose one additional action or buff for each character and swap them as you choose. Instead of finding and swapping party members you can instead choose their costumes. It really is sort of a 'My First RPG', which may sound dull to an adult but it works well enough to engage. My one issue with this system is that there wasn't enough difference between the costumes to incentivise change. You are forced to change to solve some puzzles but I would always switch back before a battle. The battle system is turned based and pretty simple with only a few options each turn. This style lends itself to a little repetition but I tended to enjoy them since they typically don't drag on. One twist (Maybe, I don't play a lot of turn based RPGs) is that to land more powerful attacks you have to complete a QTE. There are several variations but each attack only has one. Things like press at a certain time, wiggle a stick, or repeatedly tap a button. Personally I didn't find that it detracted from the experience and actually makes sure you're paying attention to the battle and lets you contribute in some way. In true Double Fine fashion the writing (literally because there is no voice acting. Not a problem, just a statement) is top notch. Funny, witty, and endearing with jokes for both adults and children. Don't write off Costume Quest because of its apparently juvenile theme, you'd be missing out. It's fun, funny, and really is a nice departure from what you've probably played last. It doesn't over stay it's welcome and is well worth your time.
6331	1	a	A charming halloween themed adventure game. I originally heard about this game through Zac Gorman  (http://zacgorman.com/  /  http://magicalgametime.com/)  and how he has made it a tradition to play the game on halloween. I thought that was a neat idea as well and made it a part of my halloween celebrating. Cute little game, lots to do/collect, good Double Fine humor.

6335	1	a	This is such a fun game. It is perfect for either someone who likes cute, fun, casual games or for kids. Really, this should be a must for every child to play because it's a good blend of puzzle working, RPG, and imagination. Great game! =)
1027	0	a	Cute graphics. A game I can play with my kid and that she can play by herself (more or less) . Gameplay is repetitive, the battles are boring and the only real thing (other than graphics) saving the game is the battle stamps you can use to add effects.  I also ran into the game breaking bug in the fry quest where the solution from TS was to restart because they don't plan a fix. Well, it left a bad taste in my mouth that a major game breaking bug is known and nothing was attempted to fix it. I am not sure why anyone would want to replay this whole thing and risk running into the bug again.
6337	1	a	Adorable halloween story with turn-based RPG+QTE battle system.
6339	1	a	Good game, took me 3 hours to finish, you should buy this when it's on sale. 9/10
6341	1	a	Highly entertaining Halloween based adventure/RPG game. Turn based combat is simple to grasp and there is a good selection of costumes providing different bonuses and abilities during combat. Basic equipment system (Battle Stamps) allow for minor tweaking of your characters. Story is highly entertaining.
6343	1	a	Very strong story and very fun to play. I suggest this game to anyone who wants to have general fun in their gaming experience.
1030	0	a	The combat mechanics are overly simplistic, the plot is as cliche as can be, the general theme is goofy and lighthearted, but mostly in a boring and predictable fashion... All in all, it mostly reminds me of a kids game. In that regard, it fares well - the tone seems kid friendly, the humor is harmless, and the controls are intuitive. But, if you've played even a single RPG and enjoy RPGs with even SOME level of complexity, I'd give this a skip.
6345	1	a	A fun game to play around Halloween, or if you're in a Halloween mood. It's an RPG of sorts, but much simpler and straight-forward than most others.  This is one of those games that I got from the Humble Double Fine Bundle a while back, which is still one of my favorite Humble Bundles that I've purchased.  7.8/10 Try it out if you'd like; it's a fun RPG.
6347	1	a	Just got 100% achievements for the game (and GOI) ;3   +  -Cute and visually appealing graphics. Nicely atmospheric -Adorable and well-written dialogue/ story -Collecting is fun -The battle system is simple, yet enjoyable -Music is fitting -Love the halloween theme; a perfect halloween game   -  -Battles can get a little repetitive  Tl;dr : I played this all in a few days, really enjoyed. Definitely pick it up in a sale.
6349	1	a	Simple RPG, with a simple but yet well implemented plot and combat mechanics. Greate humor. I completly recomend.  8/10
1032	0	a	I don't want to hate on this game. I love the story. I love the characters. I love the dialogue. I love the art style.  I hate grindy JRPG combat.  Where 75% of your game time is spent in combat, it should be engaging; not a throwback to the NES era. After my fourth fight, I found myself avoiding enemies whenever possible. Not because of the difficulty, but because each fight is another 2-3 minute delay from that quest item that I was looking for in the game world. I challenge anyone to convince me that this style of combat makes the game fun.  If there were a quarter as many enemies, and you used puzzle-solving to overcome them, this game would gel a lot better.
1033	0	a	I like the ideas behind this game, but the combat and quests were a chore and I stopped playing in the second area.
6351	1	a	I usually despise JRPGs, but I really enjoy the concept, story, characters, dialogue, and graphics of this game. The battles have enough for the player to do that make them better than typical JRPG battles. Basically, if you don't like JRPGs but are intrigued by the trailer and screenshots, this game might be worth a try.
6353	1	a	Really captures the feel of halloween during the 90s, back when people cared about halloween  
6355	1	a	This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters &amp; setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.  As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control &amp; others are defensive. It may sound unique &amp; interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal &amp; damage battle over.  I'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits. This game is fun &amp; charming &amp; I would recommend it, but I would say wishlist it &amp; wait for a sale.
6357	1	a	Charming RPG
6359	1	a	Where to even begin with this one... Costume Quest is something special. The setting is superb and the RPG elements are interwoven brilliantly. The dialogue is really fun to read and I found myself laughing aloud quite often. All of the costumes are really creative and super fun to play around with. This game just gets so many things right that you really owe it to yourself, especially if you enjoy RPGs, to play it.  
6361	1	a	This game looks great. It's a really simple RPG and probably a very short one, but it looks cool.  Fighting monsters are a little bit annoying because of quick time events. I hate quick time events.
6363	1	a	I love this game! Its cute, Its funny, and just plan FUN! Not to hard for kids and just fun and funny for adults!  I recommend this game WHOLE HEARTEDLY!
6365	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those unusual games you either love or hate. It is quite original, as is the trademark of Tim Schafer and the great Double Fine Productions, and offers a mixture of RPG and Adventure quite unseen in all the role-playing games I have played so far. A possible problem is that it merely brushes the surface of the genre and never goes in-depth. Don't expect neat level up and careful customization of your party, Costume Quest need to be played for the taste of its storyline, full of humor and for the cool gust it blows on a game market filled with clones.  I also continued to play this game for its atmosphere, despite the repetition and the boredom that may occur after the too many similar moments of gameplay: the combat system barely evolves throughout the (short) story and the items hunts sometimes break the rhythm. To conclude, I would recommend it only to those who are ok with playing a game for its particular taste and the polish of its storyline rather than for the mechanics of its gameplay. Once again, Costume Quest is a very short game (I maxed it out in less than seven hours) but it is definitely a great pick for those who are looking for a bit share of originality . 
6367	1	a	Hilarious for the kids. Just ok for the grownups.
6369	1	a	Short but wonderful, only a handful or so hours long, you won't be playing Costume Quest for ever, but its still a great treat.  A traditional JRPG at its heart, CQ really nails the comedy of Holloween as well as any nostalgia for it you might have.   The characters you play as and meet are more than interesting and its a great story that makes you want to see it through.
6371	1	a	A very enjoyable little game to play around Halloween. I played this on the PS3 sometime ago and I LOVED it. This is one of those well made games by Tim Schafer that is endless fun.
6373	1	a	Where to even begin with this one... Costume Quest is something special. The setting is superb and the RPG elements are interwoven brilliantly. The dialogue is really fun to read and I found myself laughing aloud quite often. All of the costumes are really creative and super fun to play around with. This game just gets so many things right that you really owe it to yourself, especially if you enjoy RPGs, to play it.  
6375	1	a	'Costume Quest' is a fun little RPG. It's not terribly complex or difficult, but that's fine with me, since the complex, difficult RPGs are the ones that have been collecting dust while I don't have time to get into them. It doesn't have quite as much humor as Psychonauts, but it does have some, including a number of sly references to other works of fiction. The costumes all have pretty cool battle animations, even some that I didn't expect. There aren't any bad costumes, either. They are all useful in one way or another. It took me about 8 hours to complete the main game, finding everything, and I still have the 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC to play. Highly recommended.
6377	1	a	Adorable, actually decently challenging, simple to follow, great controller support, just the right amount of silliness, and just generally an incredibly fun game. I've played for hours now and the only reason I've stopped that I have to go to work. Highly recommended by this VERY picky gamer.
6379	1	a	Charming RPG
6381	1	a	I played CQ intitially on XBLA, and when it became part of a Humble Bundle, I had NO hesitiations grabbing it again.  A PERFECT game for Halloween, and worth EVERY PENNY of its full $10 price. That's why it's listed as #1 on my YT channel's list of 'Top 5 Games To Play On Halloween'.   Simultaneously spooky and delightful, and a ton of fun. BUY IT! :-)
6383	1	a	Great fun, not at all what I usually play. I got it discounted and thought I'd give it a try. Funny and engaging dialogue, simple (but more complex at later stages) and customizable combat, and baased in a world of puzzles, secret chests and exploration, Costume Quest excels itself as both a children's game and one for adults.  I am six hours through at the moment and just finished the main story. There is an expansion so I'm expecting total playtime to be about 10 hours. Not bad at all for the price.  If you are a fan of RPGs, levelling up, area exploration, turn-based combat, or completionist gaming, there will be something here for you. I highly recommend it.
6385	1	a	Got this in the Halloween Sale and loved every minute. Charming platform fun and ridiculous JRPG-style battles combined to keep me hooked.
6387	1	a	Costume Quest is an amusing, anime style, adventure game with some unique dynamics. Firstly, costumes you pick up become useful in the game world in two ways. One, they each have a unique ability, like the robot costume to boost your speed and let you jump off ramps, and secondly, they become genuine fighting equipment, changing your character into what the costume represents. Be it a knight, or a fancy big robot, the costumes have incredibly power in this fun and quirky game by the creators of Psychonauts. Definelty a fun little game to play, and a get a fresh taste of Double Fine on PC.
6389	1	a	Fun little budget title with lots of charm, but its nowhere near Psychonauts. Plays like a Paper Mario game with extremely simple rpg mechanics and timed button presses. It does get repetitive after a while but its not too long. Definitely worth $5 or so.

6395	1	a	Fantastic double fine writing, great design and strategy. Do yourself a favour and buy the double fine humble bundle if it's still available!
6397	1	a	A very pretty game, I found it a bit slow paced and drifted off after a few hours, but I'll return to it one day.
6399	1	a	Costume Quest is the journey of a few kids to find as much candy as they can on Halloween (and maybe save one of their sisters along the way... if they feel like it).   It's innocent fun that conjures up feelings of nostalgia that I'm sure we can all relate to, while positively radiating with a pristine aura of charm and joy. Now if all that doesn't already sound appealing to you, there are also a ton of innuendos and jokes that only adults can connect with strewn throughout.  This journey should take you around 5 hours to complete, even if you seek to obtain every single collectable. It's definitely pretty brief in terms of longevity, but I still really enjoyed my experience.  If you're willing to let the kid inside of you out for a bit of fun, I'd say this game is worth at least one playthrough.
6401	1	a	One of the best games that i played in my life. Alot of adventrues and fun.
6403	1	a	Refreshing, original and completely Schaferian. 5/5!
6405	1	a	A bit repetitive, but cute and fun for the short time it lasts.
6407	1	a	A damn fine piece of candy.

6411	1	a	Cute little game which does not take it self to seriously. Really enjoyed playing it, except battle becomes a little to repetitive.
6413	1	a	Funny and charming. Really nice art style. Gameplay is pretty simple throughout but as the game itself isn't too long I never got bored. Really love the idea of the gameplay and characters being brought to life by these kids imaginations and their costumes. Just a sweet game, would recommend checking it out.
6415	1	a	A fun RPG/Adventure that's a funny too.
6417	1	a	Fun and hilarious, yet the actual gameplay gets fairly repetitive after a while of mash keys and occasionally hit Q, get it on a sale
6419	1	a	Hey, Gabe.. if i was in charge, we were already have  plenty of candies  all those trading cards been sold with profit!
6421	1	a	One of the best games that i played in my life. Alot of adventrues and fun.
6423	1	a	  This game is funny, fun and cool. I'm really lucky to have gotten this as a gift ^^.
1036	0	a	I like the idea for costume quest. The visional style fits very well with the game. The game has some fun characters too.  What I don't like with the game is that it is extremely repetitive. The first area you are in was pretty fun. But it feels like the game might as well has ended there. Because you then get to another area where you have basically the same quests again, just at a different location. The quests aren't very fun either. The combat is very repetitive because only have one normal attack and a special attack that you get after two attacks. So every fight is: regular attack which follows with a quick time event to get the maximum damage out of your attack, do this for every character. Then quick time event to reduce damage from the enemy. Then repeat this to get special attack, do special attack. if the enemy isn't dead do it again.   The concept for the game is very good. It could have been an awesome game. But sadly it's too repetitive and it kind of falls flat. Even though the game is very short is feels far to long for what the actual content of the game. It feels like they made the game longer by just using the same quest again with a new background texture.
6425	1	a	A good casual game, nice graphics, good story. Controls suck though and makes the game somewhat un enjoyable. Get it on a sale. This is when I wish Steam had a neutral recommendation cause the game isn't bad, but those controls makes it not worth playing, but for a few minutes.
1038	0	a	What do Tim Schaefer and Adolf Hitler have in common? They both burned millions and never accomplished their end goals.
6427	1	a	This game is just fantastic! It's a fun little halloween RPG by the amazing team at Double Fine, which are responsible for masterpieces like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend.   This game does not disappoint at all. It's a short and sweet game that i enjoyed from start to finish, even though the combat can get a bit repetitive in the start of the game, Once you get out of the first area of the game the combat becomes fresh again. Introducing new enemies, new costumes, and new abilities.  It also has quite a bit of challenge, i didn't die a lot, but nearing the end of the game it really gets difficult.  Overall it's a really good game. 9/10 
6429	1	a	I want to suck Tim Schaefer's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
1039	0	a	Costume Quest is certain a BBB game: Boring (you keep doing the same things over and over again), Basic and Buggy. From a promising prototype to a disappointing game. I suggest this for younger players...
1040	0	a	A game with lots of wit and humor, that could have been great. However, the combat is just brain dead boring. It's basically a much worse version of Paper Mario. At no point did I need to do anything other than hammer the A button at the strongest enemy, and press Y for a super when it charges. I want to finish the game but I simply cannot sit through any more of the combat!
1041	0	a	Apparently, people found this game actually humorous? And the battles anything but boring grinds? Gosh, I AM surprised!  Okay, okay, it probably is good for those of you who haven't heard the sort of jokes before, or aren't super interested in battle strategy in your RPG, so instead I'll say this: If you do consider yourself a veteran super-l33t gamer who has invested far too much of their time in comedy, you won't enjoy this one. At all.
6431	1	a	Very nice short JRPG. The biggest minus is that it gets monotonic after sometime (the problem is that its only 5 [!!!] hour long). Buy it on promotion.
6433	1	a	Odd, yet strangely addictive. The art/graphics design reminds me of the game Fat Princess. Don't go looking on Steam for the game because it's not there. I saw you about to do it.
1042	0	a	Tedious, repetitive combat system with very little innovation. Got tired of fighting the same battle over and over, sitting through the same unskippable attack animations again and again. Would be more tolerable if it could be sped up.  Sequel should probably be avoided too.
6435	1	a	I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this game but I'm glad I did. It's Halloween night and your twin gets captured by monsters. It's up to you to saved them by trick or treating, questing, gathering new costumes and stomping monsters. The game itself is very easy to play yet still lots of fun. The only downside is it was too short. As there are very little bug in my whole playthrough.
6437	1	a	Loved it!  Yes its cute, yes its simple, yes it falls into the category of casual. But its easy to play, doesn't take a lot of thought, and if you need something to take your mind off of the daily grind this game is for you! Plus with the DLC it gets even better. Now you're in a world where Robots, Pirates, and yes The Statue of Liberty get to join forces and save candy from monsters.   Great Game!  
6439	1	a	Witty, dry, and full of good gameplay, Costume Quest portrays children as serious, intelligent creatures with a bit too much wisdom for their age. The turn-based combat is easy to learn, and the customization options work great. Combine this with a fantastic second, Chrismas-themed story (Grubbins on Ice) and the fact that it works flawlessly with a gamepad, and you get one very well polished and high quality game.
6441	1	a	Go trick-or-treating but the trick is bombing the neighborhood.
6443	1	a	Awesome fun. Great for anybody who misses old school RPG's ^_^ Just wish it was longer.
6445	1	a	This is a really well-done game with a unique game mechanic, as you'd expect from Tim Schafer and Double Fine. They've clearly gone over the gameplay with a fine-toothed comb, and it's largely free of any serious annoyances (unlike, say, Psychonauts). I can't recommend this game enough.  After you finish the main game, make sure to play the included sequel, Grubbins on Ice, as well.
1044	0	a	It's rare to see a game made by double fine with bland characters, obnoxious gameplay and boring story however this game has all three. The combat system in this game is turn based with no strategy, that however I can stand I enjoy games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon, however Double Fine decided to 'innovate' by mixing in Real Time Events which just completely ruined it for me. Similarly to Psychonauts and Brutal legend this game features collectibles, however unlike these 2 games - collectibles are not a side-quest but are the main quest of the game and you cannot proceed until you have searched every last corners for those collectibles. I don't know what happened to double fine but their earlier games were much better.
1045	0	a	Do you like classic JRPGs? Yes? Then you will surely like the innovative reaction games, quick-time events and whatnot, that are required for actually winning the battles! Costume Quest really requires the hard tactical experince of a person that can understand the difficult concepts of 'a monster that heals other monsters' and 'a monster that deals high damage'. If those terms sound difficult to comprehend and you cannot understand why they should be the primary targets, you might be more at home with some lighter strategy games.
1046	0	a	Here is another beauty that I got thanks to that Double Fine humble bundle. Every time I start thinking of going back to console gaming these bundles and steam sales just drag me right back in the glorious world of PC gaming and the silly and serious experiences it has to offer.  Costume Quest is a game that I read and saw a decent amount of before I played it from the various videogame news sites that I follow. As a result I went into the game with a certain amount of expectations which were not entirely met if I am being honest.  Costume Quest is a pretty mediocre game. Its definitely not bad, but its not that good either. If you are hoping to find a game that can be used as an eight to ten hour distraction then you should be fine getting Costume Quest. If you want something that is more than a distraction then you need to look elsewhere. Because while this game has a lot of charm, its very superficial in some major parts of its design leaving the experience of playing this game feeling boring and repetitive in more than one instance. This is something I feel pretty strongly about, to that point that I'm not looking forward to the sequel that Double Fine recently announced. Unless there are some major changes being made to the gameplay aspect of the game which I don't think is going to happen to be honest.  If you feel like reading a more detailed review you can find it here:  http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/costume-quest.html .
1047	0	a	I feel like this game would have been much better without the level scaling. I absolutely detest level scaling. That noted, I also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing loathe it when a game comes out with an expansion (in this case, Grubbins on Ice) that literally follows the same plot and storyline (someone gets captured, have to go save them, same costumes, etc) but just in a different location and differently dressed monsters. That's pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in my honest opinion. Why you would try to make an exact clone of the last game and try to pass it off as dlc/expansion is unforgivable. Come on Double Fine, you're better than this.
6447	1	a	I have been enjoying Costume Quest a lot actually. The cartoon look is visually appealing and when you can play in 1080p it makes it even better. It is a quirky kind of RPG yet it does not fully present itself as an RPG, you can roam around and complete quest without even looking at your quest log. It's battles are fun and attacks involve timing and require you to think fast on which key to press when blocking attacks. I strongly recommend this game, worth its money, you may want to wait for a sale if you are money conservative.
1050	0	a	Just a poor game. It crashes constantly and dosen't have a good story either. I do not recommend this game and it's most certainly not worth the price.
1051	0	a	Does not work at all on mac, DF is making it hard for me to love them.
6449	1	a	Fun to play, simple and has a certain charm to it. Totally recommended.
6451	1	a	  7.5/10 TJBs
1063	0	a	I bought this because a game based on trick or treating sounded really great. However, trick or treating has never been so lame. The game gets off to a good start and is plenty of fun, but there's nothing to keep it interesting. Going door to door collecting candy even got horribly boring after a while. The combat system was easy but it was also a snore. It was so over done that I started just avoiding enemies. The whole thing is so tedious and repetitive, performing the same actions again and again (trick or treating and fighting enemies), that by the time I got to what would be considered the first boss, I was sick of this game and thoroughly done with it.
1064	0	a	I wanted to be a sexy lion. This game doesn't have sexy lions
1065	0	a	this game sucks its so bad all you do is get costumes and kill the same old enemies. you play as 2 little kids who have no idea wat they are doing. its a rlly bad game and u shld nvr buy it. flappy bird is better                                                                                                just kidding this game is awesome i love it!
1066	0	a	This doesn't work on MAC. Don't buy it.
1067	0	a	 This review explains how Double Fine's  Costume Quest  is a shallow, repetitive, featureless example of the RPG adventure game genre.
1068	0	a	The whole game concept/idea with the different halloween costumes and the fluid turn based combat system is great, nevertheless, this game fails in many other aspects.  Short game, beat it in 5.5 hours with all quests completed. Very easy battles. Missions are very repetitive. The story is lame and boring. The atmosphere is quite sad and dead, not much is going on around the different levels. Music and sound effects are poor.  I had higher expectations from this game.
1069	0	a	I thought this game was pretty dumb...
1070	0	a	Biggest waste of my time, makes me sick.  &gt;20 minute download time. &gt;3 minute to get into story mode. &gt;8 minutes watching the boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ intro.  All that to find out its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrible turnbased game (after getting excited at the Cute characters turning into awesome â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing robots, major let down). &gt;alt f4 took 2 seconds. &gt;uninstall took 10 seconds. Waste of 31:12 of my time.  Dont make the same mistake as me.
1071	0	a	Unfortunately, personality cannot save this game's bland and repetitive gameplay. 2/5
1072	0	a	Couldn't stomach it past the intro.
1073	0	a	fryman costume doesn't even transform into frylock/10 i went in expecting something, but after beating the game (both grubbins on ice and the main costume quest) i was given nothing
1074	0	a	double fine does it again. this game is one of the worst rps's i have ever played. secound worst i would say. the combat system alone is enough to strike up a laugh but when you have spent money on it than its no laughing matter. this joke of a game belongs on IoS for 1 dollar.
6453	1	a	Fun rpg-like but falls prey to repetition. Could have been a great game with a little more depth and variety.
1076	0	a	NOOOOOO GIRJGIRUJGIRDJIOHGRDIOGHD9HGR[EAHGUERHGIUEARHGIOERJH[IOETJHIETJHIETJHIEJKHITHKTIHJPIETJHT WORST GAME EVAHHHHHAHHHAHHH
1077	0	a	1 good game doesnt make up for all of your transgressions Tim Schaefer.   Dont give this developer any more money for the love of god. Go look up DF-Spacebase 9 and Broken Age and see how he's been abuaing the fanbase.
6455	1	a	Awesome game, it plays just like Final Fantasy VII (7) and reminds it by every aspect, even dialogs have no voice overs and you need to reed comic baloons, just like in old good FF7. The only difference - this is a parody and funny game, while FF7 was pretty serious and dramatic. Must buy!
6457	1	a	I loved it, a simple and charming RPG. I could say this game is made for kids but no matter your age you will probably enjoy your experience remembering the good old times. The only bad thing on this game is that it is short, i completed it in 7 hours with no help but still worthed my money. 8/10
6459	1	a	I am a huge fan of Double Fine Productions. This game sure as hell delivers halloween goodness in a small but impactful package.
6461	1	a	Solid, fun game. The combat is very lacking and boring/repetitive (though the costumes are INCREDIBLE), but if you can push through that the rest of the game is very enjoyable, cute, and actually does a decent job of being reminiscent of going on adventures as a kid.
6463	1	a	A simple and satisfying game for young or old. Quest for candy, destroy monsters, and watch as your Halloween costumes spring to life in battle.
6465	1	a	Fun little RPG with a great atmosphere. Combat is a bit shallow but fun nonetheless. Like getting better damage or less received damage on button press. Give it a try.
6467	1	a	It's the only way I can trick or treat without being arrested. So I love it.
6469	1	a	Costume Quest is a kid's game that even adults would enjoy. The action battle sequences are visually impressive and fun with the different of attacks/costumes you can use. Good story, great visuals, creative characters, sound effects are top notch, and just generally enjoyable to play. This game is actually two games in one, you can choose the shorter quest from the main menu.
6471	1	a	Pretty cute yet simplistic turn based rpg centered around halloween and candy collecting. Not bad fwiw.
6473	1	a	So cute! So addictive! A must play! &lt;3 ^^
6475	1	a	A fun and cute turn based adventure with a lot to offer for the $10 price tag! Whether you're an avid rpg player or simply someone who wants to try it out, this game is a great one to own!
6477	1	a	
6479	1	a	I recommend this game to certain types of gamers. It's very charming and sweet, but it is a little formulaic and tightly scripted and linear. As someone who only started playing video games again a year or two ago, this is really in my wheelhouse and I can totally see others would find it somewhat tedious. It's a pretty standard but minimal RPG: every encounter is planned, there are no truly random encounters, there is no way to grind and there are few real choices, except finding out what costumes and battle stamps work best together. But there are all kinds of neat stuff, such as the trick-or-treating aspect and all the cute themed side quests like bobbing for apples and trading cards with other kids. The dialogue and the whimsy are its strong suit. I loved finding out what costumes would look like in battle and what their special abilities would be. I personally loved the collecting candy aspect. I could pail-bash as many garbage cans as they put in front of me! After completing Grubbins on Ice, I highly recommend you play it after Costume Quest because I think the story works better that way. I liked that environment especially.
6481	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
6483	1	a	What's not to love about Costume Quest? 1) It's Double Fine. 2) It's related to Halloween. 3) It's epic! If you love well written turn-based combat adventure games with a twist then you'll love this. Played it originally on Xbox 360 and it was awesome, played it again through Steam and it's still awesome! Really pleased the Grubbins on Ice DLC was included too, a nice addition!
6485	1	a	I keep playing it over and over so much fun, But I wish there was A 3rd. If your looking to buy it and don't know GET IT. GREAT GAME I RATE IT 10/10
6487	1	a	At times you'll wonder when the game will end because the combat doesn't reinvent the turn-based wheel.  That, though, is really the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The adventure game sensibilities kept me interested between fights which are the times during which most games lose my interest. Also, I read through all the dialogue even though it's skippable because I thought the writing was witty.  Overall I liked the game but it was short and probably had a few too many battles. If I could go back I'd buy it again.
6489	1	a	This game is adorable. Regardless of one's age or gaming genre preference, this one is worth checking out, especially when it's available for under a couple bucks.
6491	1	a	Warning: contains one of the most precious, adorable sights in the known and unknown space/time and alternate dimensions.
6493	1	a	This is a great SNES type of RPG. It plays exactly like Earthbound, but graphically updated. It isn't a long game, but it is worth the price. There are some side quests, but there isn't anything to do, once you beat the game.   Rating: 8/10
6495	1	a	Addictive and cute game from Double Fine. Turn Based RPG in a simple, fun package.
6497	1	a	Very entertaining and fun to play.
6499	1	a	This game is short and sweet, much like my attention span!
6501	1	a	Pretty repetitive and can kind of drag but if it's the halloween season and you're feeling festive you'll enjoy it.  A good, safe, game to give your kids.
6503	1	a	NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit  http://microfloppy.net/2014/08/12/costume-quest/   Costume Quest is an adventure game by Double Fine Productions. It takes place during Halloween and you are either a twin sister or a twin brother who has to save your sibling from evil trolls.  Unfortunately, when you start the game you can instantly tell that it's made for console. I gave it two minutes of wobbly movement using my arrow keys until I gave up and plugged in the Xbox-controller. You can also tell from the gameplay that this is a definite console game. One part of the game is basically to smash as many objects as possible and to solve easy quests to collect candy, the currency used in game. (And, for me, that becomes hopelessly monotonous.)  The other part is to fight enemies, which is done with a classic turn-based fighting system. There's quick-time events here and you have to be fast on your xyab-buttons to get bonuses when you fight. (Something that also enhances the feeling of this being a console game.)  In the end I can summarize the experience with saying that the graphics and the story gives some charm to the game, but that the gameplay becomes repetative. On the other hand, with an Xbox-controller, it would work great as some casual entertainment on a sickday or when you're a little hung over.  Costume Quest will also be great if you can't get enough of collecting stuff in games. There's a long list of quests, achievements, halloween clothes, trading cards, and stamps that you can try to collect.   4/10 candy corn 
1080	0	a	I hate this game. I tried, I really did. Good story, nice graphics and interesting concept. The game play is reptative and annoying. I read the reviews and I understand that most people breezed through this game. That makes me hate this game more. I feel like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ now! Why? I simlpy SUCK at this pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off.
6505	1	a	A very cute and fun game. Lighthearted and funny, an excellent October Halloween game. Just the right length too.
6507	1	a	Alright so I just finished this game and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this from start to finish. The combat system feels a lot the Paper Mario series, so timed attacks were pretty simple to figure out on the fly. The costume battles made me think of Ultraman in a way (except that our heroes didn't need a Beta Capsule to grow) and well it wasn't a long game, the trek itself felt like it was though. I mean considering that what I did was a 100% blind run and just kept going with it, well..it brought the kid in me and this game really was an experience. I'd say get this game for those who want a good laugh and something that makes us remember the good ol' days of Halloween and for the sheer reason that all we wanted for that day was CANDY!! So at this point in time, go check out my LP of it over on my channel and enjoy, I'll be taking the rest of the day off! TENKAI MUSOU!!
6509	1	a	Super cute, reminded me a bit of Earthbound :)
6511	1	a	SO cute and fun to play. I love this game!
6513	1	a	Short but sweet RPG. Worth your time.
6515	1	a	I love this game, give it a try, you won't regret it!
6517	1	a	A fun little RPG hidden in children's clothing. There's more depth to the battle system than is initially evident (finding just the right combination of party members, costumes, and battle stamps can eat up time), but can still be rather shallow when actually in combat. This combined with a lack of variety of enemies can lead to some redundancy, but nothing too aweful. Good humor and likable characters keep the player invested through to the end. Virtually no reply value since most collectables can be found in the initial play through.  Recommended for fans of: Simple RPG combat, cute and child-like humor, kids who have grown old but never grew up.
6519	1	a	Absolutely brilliant and adorable. Quirky perfection as usual from Double Fine. Highly recommended!
6521	1	a	TRICK OR TREAT ALL DAY
6523	1	a	A very charming turn-based RPG that reaches out to most. Probably more geared toward a younger audience with it's simplicity, but as a gamer that grew up on turn-based RPGs, I can still respect the game for what the devs pulled off. I loved the concept of the costume battles, and it was very well executed.  If you're a hardcore RPG gamer, don't go into this one with high expectations of challenging combat or a deep skill tree. Definitely a great 'intro to RPG' game for the youngins :P
6525	1	a	Cute little game! It's not very challenging, but it has a nice story. Nice way to spend a lazy afternoon.
6527	1	a	SO far so good. easy to play. good story. but no map.. you need to remember where you are in the game.  7/10
6529	1	a	Love this game. Its like penny arcade meets halloween
6531	1	a	It's like Bioshock but with a better story
6533	1	a	Great game from DoubleFine. Met all my expectations and more.
6535	1	a	Short game, but super fun!!  The game itself is very simple and easy to play. The story is interesting in it's self and I found it entertaining. The gameplay of silly little costumes was very interesting and I enjoyed the game a lot, though it was very short and very easy to finish the game. I don't know if it's worth 10 dollars, but it might be worth to just buy it when it's on sale.
6537	1	a	A simple and fun, not too long, not too short, game. Just what you need to kill a few hours.
6539	1	a	For once, I'm not going to talk about hats. Although this game does have them. Lots of them. God I love hats. Uh. Anyway. This game...it's the most fun I've had with an RPG in a loooooong time. I feel like some may argue that it lacks depth, but that's kind of why I like it so much. It's got this air of simplicity, but still maintains a sense of style. Of course a weakness of the simplicity is that battles get slightly repetitive, though they are short and not abundant to the point of frustration. Overall, it was a great experience and I loved it.  9/10
6541	1	a	This is a great little game by Double Fine, and when I say little, I really do mean little. It took me about 6.5 hours to beat the game, plus its free (on steam) continuation of the story, Grubbins on Ice. There will no doubt be another added on continuation of the game, sometime in the future.  The combat system is very similar to Super Mario RPG's, in that you time a button press to both do extra damage to an enemy, and to take less damage from an enemy. But this also has the addition of Battle Stamps, which act as battle-enhancing items. Stuff like applying a poison DoT to an enemy, or recovering some hp after each round in combat.  All in all, even though I bought this the day before it went 50% off for halloween, I am very glad with this purchase, and still have the next chapter to look forward to. Buy this game, especially while it is on sale.
6543	1	a	An adventure through the eyes of a child. Great story, good writing, decent enough interface and controls to get the job done, and a lot of overall fun. A tad short, but sweet.
6545	1	a	Although it becomes predictable with its trick-or-treat segments that end being repeated multiple times and very straightforward pacing with simplistic combat system, Costume Quest still succeeds at being extremely funny thanks to sharp yet obviously aimed at children writing and nostalgia it may invoke with the player... provided you ever participated in the custom, of course. It's also a bit on the short side when compared to similar games, but the overall package is very likeable.
6547	1	a	Another quirky game put together by the Double Fine team. This time they put together a solid turn based rpg with some more of their well known humor. It's relatively short clocking in around the 5-6 hour mark but it was definitely worth a playthrough.   9.0/10.0
6549	1	a	An RPG with combat similar to the paper mario series and some clever mechanics: your costume descides what class you are, and almost all of them have some out of combat ability. While it's not very hard or complicated, It makes up for this by being very cute and a lot of fun, with a very silly sense of humor.  Not much else to say really, If you want a nice, quick game to play to get in the mood for Halloween, this would be it.
6551	1	a	Boils down the standard RPG formula to its bare bones for even the most casual of players to digest and then throws in some collection elements. It only lasts about 6 hours or so and the combat will get a bit stale with the lack of a deep progression system, but the writing will keep you laughing and it's definitely a good $15 spent. I especially reccomend it to anyone interested in game design or development. There's a lot of interesting experiments with opening up the genre to casual audiences here that I'd say succeeded.
6553	1	a	This is a great little game.  You can finish it in 7 hours easily. 3 hours for the Grubbins on Ice add-on. This is not a con.  In fact this is proof that a great little game with lots of personality can be a good product. Not everything has to be a 50 million dollar epic 100 hour RPG! Don't let this fool you though, there are lots of cool things to find, collect and do as you play through the story.  This game has all the great traits of a Double Fine game. - well written - personality - good mechanics - highly enjoyable  It is the perfect length for the story and mood of the game. Any longer and the mechanics of the fighting would have been too repetitive.  This is good example of a smaller downloadable game executing really well. Check it out for some light hearted fun!
6555	1	a	One of the few really good Halloween themed games.
6557	1	a	This has become my wife's favorite video game of all time, giving a new meaning to Halloween. Gameplay is simple, with just a few mechanics that are repeated almost to the point of boredom, but the story is what really sells the game. Everything is cartoonishly fun, down to little touches in background characters. Quick reflexes help in combat situations, but aren't strictly essential, so even kids will be able to play. (Those who can't or won't read might need help understanding what to do, though, particularly in the first combat.)  It's short and fairly easy to complete fully, so the replay value is limited to perhaps once a year. Fortunately, there's a fairly obvious time of year to play it.  Oh, and yes, don't try to enter the tent in the camping store. The multitude of waist-high fences can occasionally be annoying, but only there are they truly game-breaking.
6559	1	a	Pretty fun game. Worth getting
6561	1	a	The only game I have ever played that is Pure Halloween so it was Made for me ^.^ Best holiday ever!! Played the game and beat it, it is a Great game and I can't wait till Costume Quest 2, it has a lot of re-play for me, I mean who doesn't adore Halloween? (If you don't you are soul-less!) I gotta give this a 9.8/10 cause it was to short but other then that it was GREAT! &lt;3 Costume Quest
6563	1	a	My girlfriend likes it and it's better than watching Hocus Pocus again for Halloween.
6565	1	a	It's a little slow at first but once you're used to the game (when you're in the mall) it's a lot better. It's a well balanced turn based fighter with an rpg adventure side, good visuals and well optimized. Plenty of humour too, shame there's no voice acting as it would be a very brilliant game if it had voices too.
6567	1	a	Not the type of game I usually play but it came in Amazon's Double Fine Bundle and I gave it a go. I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls &amp; combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.  Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game &amp; DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.
6569	1	a	Short but sweet (Get it?).
6571	1	a	I actually at first wasn't that interested to play this. I got this as a part of humblebundle, which bought cause of Brutal Legends. But Brutal Legends disappointed me( that is a different story). So I tried out this game.  And to my suprise, the game turned out to be quite fun that I completed it in the same day. The game is cute and fun to play. Although I think there isn't much replayablity in this game, unless you want to unlock full achivements.  However to make long story short. This game is quite enjoyable.
6573	1	a	Really fun.
6575	1	a	Very charming RPG, with a heart and sense of humour. It's a must, specially for the price.
6577	1	a	This game, in a word, is ADORABLE. I just love it. Creative, highly entertaining - the only downvote is that it's clearly a console port as it makes you go through keyboard acrobatics during combat, but the special abilities, gorgeous graphics and great music make up for all that. Perfect for all ages, get it!
6579	1	a	It brings out the inner child in us. Very short, but fun. The bright colours during the battles hurt my eyes over time. Play it in the dark or at night for better ambiance. B-
6581	1	a	Costume Quest is an extremely charming Halloween-themed turn-based battle adventure. You collect candy, fight monsters and complete quests and it is really a joy to play. While the world you travel through is quite varied, the gameplay mechanics are not. Especially the fighting can become tedious. The saving feature here are the costumes that make your characters use different attacks. If you switch the costumes around a bit before entering new battles you can make it a little more interesting. Each character just has one basic and one special attack and you can only alter the damage you do a little by successfully pressing a certain button or button combination, in short: a quick-time event. I enjoyed it nevertheless.
6583	1	a	one of the best game's i've ever played. and i don't know why.
6585	1	a	Collect Costumes, Complete Quests and Engage Enemies in Battle using your newly acquired battle suits.
6587	1	a	Costume Quest is a light-hearted adventure with great ambiance, fun gameplay, and funny dialouge. It's reminiscent of EarthBound.   Walking around is a little choppy but otherwise I have no complaints.
1081	0	a	Cute game. Maybe a decent one for very, very young kids.  Mostly cons: No difficulty: You can't lose. Combat is child-friendly.
6589	1	a	I really liked Costume Quest. I liked that it met my till now unknown need for running around collecting things and RPG fights. It's not high on variety but it's nice in the sense that you hit an area and you know what to do and there are mini quests for variety.  I did think the final boss battle was a pretty steep curve, but that's me.
6591	1	a	Funny game from Tim Schafer. Behold: quick-time-event haters better stay off.
6593	1	a	It's certainly rough around the edges, but a streamlined RPG battle system and really consistent humor make this a fun light, nostalgic romp. Plus, I just love fetch quests. It also occupies a unique niche in being a true Halloween game without horror elements -- it's a game I'd love to share with my kids one day.
6595	1	a	From the makers of Psychonauts, Costume Quest is an interesting and creative Halloween-themed RPG. You play as a group of imaginative children trying to stop the monsters of Repugia from stealing all of the candy on All Hallows' Eve. The battles are turn-based and simplistic enough so that even those who are new to the genre can get a hang of things quickly. The Cartoonish visuals are well done and perfect for this style of game. The writing is also quite humorous and exactly what you'd expect from Double Fine Productions. As long as you don't go into Costume Quest expecting a full-fledged RPG with a deep combat/inventory system, I think you can have quite a good time playing it. It's a fun and original game with entertaining battles and a lot of charm.
6597	1	a	A fun little Halloween Theamed adventure featuring some Fun Costumes,Great Dialogue and all around a good time :3
6599	1	a	An awesome little game, full of humor and smart dialogue that provided me with a very enjoyable gaming experience. Would definately recommend picking this up.
6601	1	a	Game is fun. Best part is humour and worst is repetitiveness. It plays very quick, puzzles are easy, boss fights are OK until you do QTE right(beat all of them+expansion at first try). Achievements are done almost right - beat game 100% you get =100% -1. No need for second play-through, but you have to fire game during Christmas period :( Overall I recommend it
6603	1	a	It's a fun game would and will play again.
6605	1	a	Double Fine Productions does it again with this adorable and silly adventure role-playing game. Its gameplay mechanics are a lot like the Final Fantasy series but for children. However, don't judge a book by its cover because Costume Quest is filled with fun dialogue and clever references. If you want to fight your way as a mech, knight, rainbow unicorn, or even a vampire, then Costume Quest is definitely a lot of fun.
1082	0	a	Nice charm to it, but this game performs terribly. I can max out Dark Souls 2 and BioShock Infinite, but not this game? If the devs fixed this, I'd recommend, but not until then.
6607	1	a	Costume Quest with its add-on Grubbins on Ice is a nice Halloween-themed almost-RPG. It's, in one word, candy. I like candy.  I highly recommend using a controller with this game. Keyboard controls felt pretty odd.  Achievement Hint:   The game doesn't know the date. It asks your machine for the date.    + Creepy Treats (collectibles) design + Non-irritating but forgettable music + Back To The Future discovery sound + Costumes with exploration effects in addition to battle effects + Costume battle action design 0 no map 0 Mostly inconsequential Battle Stamps (buffs) 0 Level caps - Incorrect Battle Stamp descriptions - Pretty linear - Almost consistently no challenge - No description on save slots when loading - After the main game we see the credits headlined 'Grubbins on Ice'  Technically the game is about quasi-isometric exploration with battle intermezzi. The battles are similar to those associated with RPG-Maker games or for example Final Fantasy 7 but instead of action meters there is simply a battle order. Without fail, first your up to three character attack, then the up to three enemies - repeat until defeat.  Although this may sound dry, the game is surprisingly fun. I played the game for maybe 11 hours, got stuck twice for a total of about 90 Minutes (misunderstood game mechanics in the beginning + final boss in the add-on) and it was entertaining enough to feel like around 4 hours. This is mostly due to a number of good design decision. For me, the game wasn't so much about the main storyline but more about your party of characters speaking with each other, other inhabitants of the area and enemies, and it was about the battles. For some reason those things made me think, I'd like to play this in a Spongebob Squarepants world, at one point.  In order of relevance the advancements in the game are: gaining companions, completing new costumes and getting Battle Stamps. Ultimately progress in the game requires the player to win fights (actually you go trick-or-treating but half the time that results in fights) but there are a number of obstacles that require you to explore beforehand.  *Companions* Companions come with a new costume and provide an extra action per round in battle.  *Costumes* You get costumes with characters or you are given a blueprint which sort of tells you, by way of a somewhat indiscriminate outline, which three components/materials you need to complete the costume. Components are unique and can be found in more or less hidden treasure chests, given to you by inhabitants of the world, and maybe, I don't quite remember, be part of battle spoils. Once a costume is complete, it can be assigned to any of your characters. Half of the costumes come with an Exploration Ability, i.e. an ability that can and (with the exception of one costume in the add-on) must be used in the exploration part of the game. The most important ability is the Boost that you get with your very first costume. The Boost allows your party to speed across the area and is essential to the pacing of the game. At one point or another, the player is likely to miss something plus there is a little back and forth in the game anyway. Without the Boost ability that could have easily turned into a chore - very good design decision. All of the costumes but one have a Combat Ability, i.e. a special that needs two battle rounds to load and can be executed instead of a normal attack. Apart from having an effect on game-play the costumes just look cool. Even if there wasn't an achievement connected to that I'd still recommend to take every costume into battle at least once. I simply like the progression of the costumes from the materials you have to collect over the (not really) crappy 'not quite there' or 'Dad did the best he could' design of the costume as the characters are wearing it in exploration mode to the awesome 'this is how the kids see it' (or maybe 'this is what adult think how the kids see it') design in battle, character design and attacks.  *Buffs* Battle Stamps are buffs that can be assigned to your party's characters, one each. Buffs include boosts to health, defence, dodging, counter-attacks, the over-powerful stun and the underwhelming auto-revive - usually buffs are passive. I basically stuck to the same buffs throughout the game, occasionally upgrading when a better version of the buff turned up. Unfortunately, some of the buffs have misleading descriptions, most irritatingly the auto-revive is supposed to revive a character after one round. While this is technically correct a more apt description would explain, the character is revived after two rounds (one round after one round, see?). I only ever tried the buff when I had trouble with the final boss in the add-on and having a character inactive for two rounds is just unacceptable in that fight.  *Collectibles* The Creepy Treats are mostly just nice-to-have. You collect them mainly as battle spoils and sometimes trade them with inhabitants. I guess they are mostly original ideas, e.g. Licorice Cables, Chocolate Hamburgers, Coconuts &amp; Bolts, Misfortune Cookies.  *Battles* As said before, each round in battle has your character(s) act first, then the up to three enemies. Usually, rounds go on until one side is defeated. In theory, there is an option to run away but I haven't tried it yet. Each round each character chooses one of standard attack, the costume's Combat Ability (if ready) or the Battle Stamp buff (if active). Standard attacks have QTEs connected to them. There is a number of different QTEs, i.e. hitting a specific, dynamic button in time, hitting a specific, dynamic button on time, moving the left analogue stick around, and repeatedly pressing a specific, dynamic button. The type of QTE is dependent on the costume. If you pass the QTE, the character deals 50% more damage. Combat Abilities need two rounds to load so they can be used every third round. They are usually a tactical option and it's not always useful to use them right away. For some reason, attack buffs do not affect Combat Abilities. This may even make the standard attack a preferable option overall. Some Battle Stamp active buffs can be executed instead of a standard attack. Of those the most powerful are likely the different stun abilities which can take a single enemy out of the fight for up to two rounds. Except for bosses, the later game can be played without ever getting hit by an enemy. This is very powerful since even a 'failed' enemy attack can take as much as 25% of a characters live away. Some Combat Abilities can prevent almost all damage to characters. Enemies mostly do standard attacks which lead to a defensive QTE which, on success, prevents half of the damage to the character. Magically inclined enemies can heal, buff attack or defence of one of the enemies. Battles are pretty short and easy but fun, largely because of the costumes.   *Game Experience* A few more words on the game. One of the rather negative aspects about the game is its linearity. Bring me this and that or you cannot go on, fight those guys or you cannot go on, complete a costume or you cannot go on. But this is well compensated by the entertainment factor. Even though of limited use, I'd have liked a map to come with each area. This was sort of addressed in the add-on where you gain the ability to zoom out a bit with a costume. The game was a bit on the easy side. When loading/continuing a previous savestate the game doesn't tell you anything about the progress made. The game simply lists 'Slot 1', 'Slot 2' and 'Slot 3'. There isn't even an indication whether the slot actually contains any saved progress. This is a minor ugliness.  I had a lot of fun with Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice and highly recommend the game. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.
6609	1	a	Going back through this game with my son before playing the sequel. Forgot how much fun this game is and the little man absolutely loves it!
6611	1	a	Game is fun. Best part is humour and worst is repetitiveness. It plays very quick, puzzles are easy, boss fights are OK until you do QTE right(beat all of them+expansion at first try). Achievements are done almost right - beat game 100% you get =100% -1. No need for second play-through, but you have to fire game during Christmas period :( Overall I recommend it
6613	1	a	Fun Halloween game how it works.  Your kids trick or treating, You sometimes run into goblins when you do. You will enter a timed based combat that is a staple of old RPG style. But what the cool part your character you are is whatever costume you and your party is wearing.  So it gives you some minigames and exploring to do to find pieces to make new costumes while you race around to find your captured sibling.  Fun Halloween Game.
6615	1	a	A quick and fun game, extended play through feels a bit repetative but enjoyable for run-through-and-finish play style. More aimed at a younger audience but fun none the less.
6617	1	a	Fairly easy game but it is rather fun to play if you like turn based RPG's. The game plus the DLC will probably take you only 7 hours to beat and 100%
6619	1	a	Wonderfully charming and addictive. A pleasant game for completionists too.
6621	1	a	I wanted to like this game, but unfortunately it was a bit of a let down. The main story is good enough, but the game play is boring and repetitive. Maybe if you could change the difficulty level things would have been better, but as the game stands you can defeat 90% of the monsters without using any battle stamps whatsoever. I was sick of trick or treating and all its monotony by the 2nd level. Cute game, but it's probably best left for the kiddos to play.  6/10
6623	1	a	Short but sweet RPG. Worth your time.
6625	1	a	An adventure through the eyes of a child. Great story, good writing, decent enough interface and controls to get the job done, and a lot of overall fun. A tad short, but sweet.
6627	1	a	Costume Quest is one of the best games I've ever played. While it may look childish and corny... Well it is those things, but in such pure awesomeness it becomes a must own in my book. Anyone who likes classic turn based RPGs and/or loves all things that involve Halloween, like myself. I give this game a 10/10 5stars what have you.
6629	1	a	Funny, cute, clever and, above all, fun! Not the most complicated game you'll ever play, but it has a lot to offer to all ages of casual gamers.
6631	1	a	A ~6 hour adventure/RPG that's fueled by a Halloween setting and the cutest of art direction. Enter combat by trick or treating or just by approaching enemies in the world as they stroll. Combat takes place on a battleground where your costume 'comes to life'. Due to how hackneyed and simple the combat is it does get repetitive quite quickly. In saying that, some of the abilities are hilarious. The costumes are fun and interesting but shout-out to the American costume for having one of the best abilities i've ever seen which gets a giggle out of me every time. All in all it isn't a revolutionary game. It's repetitive but it's one of the most endearing, charm oozing games out there.
6633	1	a	I bought it because the graphics reminded me of Animal Crossing. The game itself is nothing like Animal Crossing, but it's a neat and fun game with adorable graphics.
6635	1	a	Costume Quest is a pretty damn good game. It has some amazing scenes, the story is pretty nice, and the overall mechanics of the game are really enjoyable. The charactereres are really well designed some can give you a really good laugh the first time you see them. But now we get to the worst part, the gameplay. I was really into the storyline of the game but a part of me didnt want to end it because of the repetitive mechanics it has. The game is pretty much divided in 3 parts and the overall missions of each one are basicaly the same. i only did half of the things i did because i really had to do them in order to complete the story. Overall a good game if you like repetitive games and games were you need to explore every single place in order to get everything but expect a gameplay of around 5/6 hours to fully complete it. And dont forget you can only do one of the achievs on christmas.
6637	1	a	Such a cute little halloween game. Only annoying thing is the lack of maps.
6639	1	a	Cool game with JRPG mechanics.
6641	1	a	super fun and very addictive. can't wait for the sequel this autumn!
6643	1	a	A fun, casual game. Lots of make you smile moments packed into an adorable presentation that screams PLAY ME. The combat very rarely feels dull or drawn-out. If you're an adventure game or RPG fan at all, you really should treat yourself to this lovely experience.
6645	1	a	Really fun game. Though the actual playthrough feels pretty short, this little RPG has a lot to offer to anyone missing a taste of older turn based RPGs. There are secrets to be found, Costumes to unlock, and Aliens to destroy. At $10, this game is worth it. On sale, it is a MUST.
6647	1	a	This game was really cute! I picked it up because it was a Halloween-themed game, but only just recently started playing it.
6649	1	a	Very cute fun game with a simple enough battle system.
6651	1	a	A Fun game for when Halloween rolls around, a unique premise for an rpg to be sure and it is full of funny and cute moments. It comes with the christmas dlc free 'grubbins on ice'. If you are too old to trick or treat this is a nice game to play while eating a big bag of discount candy on halloween and again during christmas with the dlc.
6653	1	a	After trying Stacking and being disappointed, I wasn't sure if I'd like Costume Quest. Psychonauts was good - if not limited by platforming - and Costume Quest is right up there with it.  The style is a charming, delightfully-quirky one that puts you in the role of a child on Halloween, trick or treating with their sibling. The pace spirals beautifully until you're facing off against giant monsters in a twisted maze, firing rockets.  One of this game's seeling points is its fantastic humour; like Psychonauts it puts you in the position of a child and throws referential and meta humour at you, barrelling on whether you get the jokes or not. This is one of its strongest aspects as it's funny to those who get it and doesn't slow down those who don't.  The combat is surprisingly deep considering the simple controls and is very balanced...except for the final boss in the extra adventure, Grubbins On Ice. The final boss of that doesn't follow the rules established in all the rest of the combat. Despite this little hiccough, it is a easy to grasp, QTE-based combat with scope for personal preference.  One last thing to note is that it isn't very long; 9 hours to 100% it with all the achievements. There are shorter games out there and there are certainly longer games, but this is one of the funniest.
6655	1	a	8/10  Nice little casual game.  This is a cute halloween story. Even though it is aimed at younger people I still thought that this was a fun little game. The combat is turn based and the rest of the game is open world made up of smaller areas. This game has a cutsey and cartoony art style which makes the game look as though you are playing through a cartoon. There are multiple halloween costumes each with their own special abilities in both the open word and combat.   The story itself is very simple. You have to save your sibling from monsters by collecting halloween candy. It really incorporates the festival into it's gameplay. It's not just set during halloween, but there halloween activities to do: knock on doors for candy, apple bob puzzle and more. There are also some collectables to find which adds some extra play time. The characters are fun and engaging. At the beginning you can chose whether to play as either the brother or the sister.  Overall I enjoyed this game. It was short and it was casual. Pleasent to play when you want to relax. I reccommend this to younger people and children, however I believe that you can still get fun from this game, regardless of age.
6657	1	a	A very fun and light hearted game with awesome soundtrack to motivate you to complete the game (:
6659	1	a	.
6661	1	a	I am an achievement hunter and this game while having simple gameplay game me my fix!
6663	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
6665	1	a	Great game!
6667	1	a	2 words : Simple, but charming. Very easy to beat. A very, very simplistic combat system. The RPG-style progression (if you can call it that) is extremely simplistic. ..... It's gameplay is *very* simplistic, I dont think I need to spell it out for you any more than this. Now, on to the aesthetic... It's quite charming, it's nothing high-tech, it's very simple (noticing a pattern here ?) but it fit in well with the game as a whole. Condensed : It's a charming story about kids being the heroes of Halloween on a quest to save a maiden in distress. Battle evil goblins, trolls and... birds?... and acquire oh-so-precious CANDYYYYY!!!,,, oh and there's also some witch-spanking (inapropirate?) and Bone bashing (you'll get it) battles... 2 of them (but enough for the lame jokes!). I'd definitely recommend (even harder if it's on sale).
6669	1	a	I saw this game on PSN Store like 3 years ago and always wanted it since, it is great for its time period and i love the story line and idea of the halloween selection. The cons of it is glitchy rollerblades (Top lel m8) and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ voice overs, like terrible, hopefully you can read subtitles. 7/10 -IGN
6671	1	a	Picked this up in a humble bundle a while ago but am just getting down to actually playing it. The controls are a bit clunky initially, but overall it's been an extrememly enjoyable experience!
6673	1	a	Very entertaining and fun to play.
6675	1	a	Pretty repetitive and can kind of drag but if it's the halloween season and you're feeling festive you'll enjoy it.  A good, safe, game to give your kids.
1083	0	a	On MAC - The text is to fast to read. its like read a paragraph or 2 in 1 second. our whole house could not read it. theirs no option to slow down the text and sadly their are some parts of the game that you can wait to read the text and press next but then the rest of the game theirs no option and its not understandable. I got this game for a kid to help with his reading for halloween but I canâ€™t even read it to him. If this is fixed I will delete this as soon as I notice and write a good review.
6677	1	a	Little fun game, but the battle system could use some more complexity.
6679	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those rare games that you get out of a $1 bundle and just kind of forget about. It's one of those surprise delights that you didn't know you had in your library. Such is Double Fine's track record with game's. But it's Halloween and nothing gets you in the mood for Halloween better then some good ole fashioned trick or treating.  Costume Quest is very under-rated in my opinion. At first glance it's a childrens game. A simple, brainless game created for the young one's. That's where you're missing out. The game is incredibly fun. You get to go door to door trick-or-treating, collect candy, collect costumes and it doesn't matter what costume you wear, it's up to you! You want to be a pirate? Sure! You want to be a ninja? Why not? Throw in the statue of liberty and you got yourself a team! All while completing quests, collecting cards and finding yourself oddly intrigued in a somewhat predictable story.   If you like games like South Park: The Stick of Truth and don't mind a much more toned down sense of humor, give this game a try. You won't regret it.
6681	1	a	Very easy and charming Halloween themed rpg. I really enjoyed this game and played it in one sitting today. I liked the story and aesthetic. My only big issue with the game was how repetitive it was. Towards the end the battles just got super boring. By the time I finished the main game and started the bonus content called Grubbins on Ice, I was bored with the gameplay and just didn't have it in me to play through the dlc. Other than the repetitive battle system and some other minor complaints I have, I enjoyed this game and can't wait to sit down and play Costume Quest 2 next Halloween!
6683	1	a	I really liked this game! It was quite easy but also fun. The story and art/music are super cute, too! The battles do get incredibly repetitive after a while, but you can try to switch it up a little by using different costumes in battle. Some of them have VEEERRRRY interesting special powers. (Lady Liberty's patriotism heal is fantastic, LOL) The overall game was actually a lot longer than I thought it was going to be, which I think is a plus. Even more, I got this game off of humble bundle, AND it technically includes a second game within it (Grubbins on Ice), so heyyyy for bonus stuff!
6685	1	a	This is a nice short game that gets you in the Halloween mood. The gameplay is nice and even though it is turn based you are still a bit active in having to push certain keys at the right time. It can get a bit repetative but switching up costumes and stamps can change it up a bit. If you looking for a game to play on Halloween this is a good one to get.
6687	1	a	A great game well worth the money that I paid for it. Definitely an interesting set of gameplay challenges and quests.
6689	1	a	Terrific Halloween-themed RPG (Final Fantasy style) with a free Arrested Development reference included.
6691	1	a	
6693	1	a	Great to play around Halloween. An entertaining halloween action-rpg of sorts. Very fun and halloween-spirited.
6695	1	a	10/10 GOTY. The campaign plays out simmilar to that of a classic Final Fantasy game but better, with dank unlockable costumes like the Statue of Liberty and Robots. With the turn based battle system Its great to get people interested in bigger turnbased stratergy gaming.
6697	1	a	Pretty good game, well...according to the reviews. I never actually played this game. I forgot about it and just let it run for 100+ hours.
6699	1	a	A too-easy RPG themed around Halloween. It's very cute and quite short. Fun to play at Halloween time for sure!
6701	1	a	For some one who doesent really like the RPG genre it's weird that i would put COSTUME QUEST in my top 20 games of all time. But it's True it's a masterpiece i love the halloween setting the quirky humour and characters everything about this game is charming and magical, i have still yet to play through the sequel i need to
1084	0	a	Fun at first but then becomes very repetitive. The game isn't all bad it deffinitly gets points for style and writing. If there was a little more depth and less repetitive this could be a better game. Stopped playing when I realized I was doing the same thing over and over.
6703	1	a	This is a funny and adorable story, its a must play on Halloween, the game is simple but fun to play.  10/10
6705	1	a	I've only played this game for about 45 minutes.  kek.
6707	1	a	Cute little game that is fun to play through. Plus, Halloween!
6709	1	a	simple, fun, and long enough that the charm of it remains with you after finishing the game. pick it up if you want to play a short but fun RPG even if you only have a little spare time,. This game is totally managable and affordable!
6711	1	a	Battle system can get a bit repetitive, but otherwise I really enjoy it! Love the art and environments especially :)
6713	1	a	Charming casual game with Double Fine's signature humour.
6715	1	a	I get to be a robot.
6717	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. I don't even know where I got it. I think I got it from a friend or from a Humble Bundle or something. But when I decided to boot it up the other day, I was really surprised. The overall feel is charming, the graphics are aesthetically pleasing, and the costumes/monsters are interesting.  Am I going to go back and play it? Probably not until Christmas, because of that one achievement that requires you to play it on that day. But am I glad I played it? Absolutely.   I'd give this mysterious game a 7/10
6719	1	a	This game was really enjoyable and surprisingly challenging at times, I do have to say I had to retry the last battle a couple times in order to win. The story line was cute, you play as the brother or sister, and you have to save your twin who was taken by monsters who thought they were candy. The combat was interesting, using turn based events as well as quick time events. All the character designs were really adorable, but the costumes turned honestly badass during combat. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and can't wait to play the next one.
6721	1	a	Gives true meaning to the infamous phrase, You're a kid now, you're a giant robot now! 10/10
6723	1	a	Costume Quest: 7/10  Whilst it feels like a chore, CQ can be enjoyable if you have the patience for it's repetition and 20fps.  DLC: 2/10  Literally nothing new and a really unintuitive end battle (insta-kill attacks much?).
6725	1	a	The game is better than what it looks like at first sight. May get repetitive in the second half.  I liked it.
6727	1	a	I was expecting much less about Costume Quest... When I first saw it, I thought it'd be something childish, but I gave it a try, so I bought the CQ1&amp;2 Bundle for a low price. I couldn't have been more wrong... Costume Quest was  awesome ! When I realized it, I was extremely immersed in the story and the gameplay... Though I thought some maps and objectives were a little repetitive, but no harm done. One of the things that made me really like this game was the costume system, the need-to-get-that-costume feeling is really engaging! This game is really good for those who want a not-so-difficult but fun and good RPG experience. The achievements are very easy to get, too.  Extremely recommend it.
6729	1	a	Fun game to pass the time just enough of a story for the battle system not to get old. Kind of nice concept of candy collection feels like the old school ps1-2 games of item collection to upgrade.
6731	1	a	Costume Quest is a role-playng adventure game from Double Fine Productions, where you play as one of two siblings on a mission to rescue the other who has been kidnapped by candy-grubbing monsters on Halloween night.   The game is centered around exploration, item collection, turn-based combat, and minor puzzle-solving. Outside of combat, trick-or-treating is the predominant method of accruing candy, which is spent as currency to purchase 'Battle Stamps'. Battle Stamps enhance your attacks during the combat phases of the game, and a successful battle in turn leads to more candy and other rewards. Also up for collection are the multitude of costumes which give you new special abilities, both in and out of combat. The player can also collect the aptly named 'Creepy Treat Cards' which span from amusing to hilarious to downright disgusting.  The real charm of Costume Quest however, lies with its sole ambition of placing you in the shoes of a child on Halloween night and successfully recreating the atmosphere of magic and spooky fun of All Hallow's Eve. The setpieces are well-chosen, including the oddly familiar haunts of a suburban neighbourhood, a shopping mall, a sleepy village on the outskirts of town, and even a Halloween-themed carnival.   Costume Quest is a labour of love, designed to invoke the memories of Halloweens past, and celebrate them. You can't go back and reexperience Halloween through the eyes of a child, but you CAN play Costume Quest, which is almost as good.  Highly recommended.
6733	1	a	very cute and surprisingly addictive! Combat does get a bit repetitive after awhile but overall still a fun and light-hearted game!
6735	1	a	Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.  And the long one: Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.  9.8/10
6737	1	a	An absolutely FANTASTIC casual/action-adventure title, heavy on the adventure (with a bit of turn-based combat in there, to great effect). For the price, you'll get over 6 hours of universally-appealing gameplay for all ages out of just CQ, and even more from the included DLC.
6739	1	a	Cute, cute, cute! Absolutely adore this game, from start to finish! Combat style is fun, even though it does get a bit repetitive getting closer to the end, but generally is very enjoyable. I actually kind of wish there were more bosses that were harder, like the end bosses. I'm very satisfied with this game, though I would really like to see Costume Quest 2!
6741	1	a	A game for kids and adults. If you want to have a laugh while playing a great game, Costume Quest is what needs to be in your games collection!
6743	1	a	Gameplay is a bit too easy, could probably be a bit better optimised for PC. However, the cutest graphics and characters and story!!! Not too long, it is definitely worth a look in!
6745	1	a	I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.  The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.
6747	1	a	A sweet and incredibly entertaining game; a bit on the short side, which I don't think is bad. The fights can be a bit annoying sometimes, but the experience is totally worth it.
6749	1	a	I really enjoy playing this. It looks childish and it kind of feels childish too but its a nice adventure and not as easy as you'd expect.
6751	1	a	An annual Halloween season staple. I play this every year
6753	1	a	A really fun and relaxing game. Just the end bosses are a little bit difficult. Usually sold with a massive discount, but is worth the full price. A must-have.
6755	1	a	Minimalistic, funny and weird, just the way I like it, a bit hard at the beginning it grows on you.
6757	1	a	Interesting rpg
6759	1	a	If there's one game series that should be annualized, it should be this one.
6761	1	a	Cute game suited for younger audiences. The combat system is simplistic, dialog is entertaining.
6763	1	a	The art, story, atmosphere, and combat in this game are great. It's overall good.  However, I have a few gripes. When something is in the foreground it's at just the wrong level of transparency to hurt your eyes. The level of difficulty is a little low for my liking. The gameplay gets progressively more and more linear as the game progresses, especially in character progression. Which isn't a good thing in a psuedo-rpg.  Overall it's definitely fun and I find myself pretty addicted to the combat system. Worth a buy.
6765	1	a	Fun, easy and laid back. Funny story and cool characters. Only problem with this little gem: no voice dialogue, it's all text bubbles. Good, qwirky, and Tim Burton esque Halloween game. 8/10
1085	0	a	i did not enjoy it, the gamestyle isnt interesting and the plot is just plain old boring, played it for 10 minutes and just had to run away.
6767	1	a	Really adorable. Really fun. And has an interesting kind of combat system that is a mix between pokemon and quicktime events. The quicktime events can get tiresome but still the game is worth it when its on sale.
6769	1	a	GREAT GAME WORTH THE BUY ' AND PLAY TIME
6771	1	a	Good game, lots of fun. I could only wish for more levels.
6773	1	a	This game is really fun, and easy to play. The plot is interesting, as well as the different costumes your character can wear. Each costume serves a purpose for - and out of - battle. The dialogue is simple, and the humor is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who'd like a Halloween-based game.
6775	1	a	very nice little game, not too long, difficult or complex but fun. Definately a casual game.
6777	1	a	A fun and light hearted game - the combat gives enough depth to warrant a few hours thrown in to it (which is all the games lasts) but definitely not enough to make me want to complete every single quest. It's a funny game and I loved the art direction, but a lot of it was much of the same repeated. Still, I went on and enjoyed it through to the end.
6779	1	a	An absolutely FANTASTIC casual/action-adventure title, heavy on the adventure (with a bit of turn-based combat in there, to great effect). For the price, you'll get over 6 hours of universally-appealing gameplay for all ages out of just CQ, and even more from the included DLC.
6781	1	a	Awesome game! Quirky and cute as hell! Made me LOL many times.
6783	1	a	Cute game that will make you wish it was Fall any day of the year.
6785	1	a	This is a funny little RPG. There's not a lot of depth to any portion of it. The combat is very repetitive, there's not much for customization besides the costumes themselves. One thing this does have is charm. It's a fun game which has its moments and never drags on. Unfortunately it offers nothing more than a quick game. For a couple of dollars it may be worth the experience. If you don't think you'd enjoy it from any of the screenshots, you probably won't.  2.5/5 Completion Time: 5.5 Hours
6787	1	a	This is actually worth playing if you got it during that one Humble Bundle long ago.
6789	1	a	A cuddly, adorable, heartwarming adventure that is certain to make you nostalgic for your childhood. To anyone who has a soul, this game is a must play.
6791	1	a	Looks like its for little kids...is for little kids. However, there's a little kid in all of us. Rather fun.
6793	1	a	Costume Quest takes a novel idea that breathes some life and originality into the JRPG format. Top that with a ton of personality and witty dialogue and you have quite a sweet treat of a game.
6795	1	a	Cute, cute, cute! Absolutely adore this game, from start to finish! Combat style is fun, even though it does get a bit repetitive getting closer to the end, but generally is very enjoyable. I actually kind of wish there were more bosses that were harder, like the end bosses. I'm very satisfied with this game, though I would really like to see Costume Quest 2!
6797	1	a	A great little game with adorable characters and an endearing Halloween-themed story. The combat gets a bit competitive once you figure out what works for you, but fun nonetheless and the different costumes provide a solid amount of different combinations to play around with. Definitely going to play through it again!
6799	1	a	Fun little time. Double fine makes such good games!
6801	1	a	So much fun! Great idea and fun twist to RPGs! Plus they are freaking CUTE!
6803	1	a	If the thought of children in Halloween costumes, parading around for candy is your kind of thing, then you should probably get some help. On the other hand, if you're just bored and fancy a Final Fantasy-style game by the makers of Psychonauts, then you're in luck. This game is more fun than a clown on ecstasy.
6805	1	a	I thought this game was pretty stupid at first but after about ten minutes it became better and pretty fun. Repetitive as hell though.
6807	1	a	I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.  The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.  Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!
6809	1	a	Fun little baby RPG. Double Fine brings its trademark humour to keep it interesting for all despite a childish theme. Were it any longer, it would be unbearbaly repetitive, even at this length, the feeling creeps in. Animation of the battle costumes are are quite likable, especially the patriotic powers of lady liberty. Good Intro to RPG for newbies, and fun to kill a few hours if you're in for a family friendly adventure. Decent overall.
6811	1	a	Great game. Tons of fun. The included Grubbins on Ice expansion is great fun as well.
6813	1	a	I don't fancy myself a guy who calls things 'cute' but this game definitely was. While so simple someone with an IQ of 10 could play, I found myself engrossed. Maybe it was my mind harking back to a simpler time and the premise of kids just simply trick R' treating.   The battles were very simple, they had some interactivity but not much. They were the standard JRPG style battles we all know  and...love/hate .   There were a good selection of costumes, all fun and simple. My favorite had to be the ninja...for obvious reasons. Not to mention the decent selection of power up cards that helped you along the way.  If you enjoy simple fun and miss the imagination of your childhood then this could be the game for you.
6815	1	a	Everything I wish Halloween Was rolled into one game and its Fun One of Double fines Great games its humorus, Adventurous and FUN
6817	1	a	This is a very cute and charming game. I'm finding I like games from this company I have fully played two of them now (this one and Stacking) and I love them both. I used the older bratty sister, so I may play this again as the younger brother. The art style is cartoonish, but that works for this game. I like the idea of these kids dressed up in broken down boxes and pretending to have superpowers. It's not overly long, but I enjoyed it. I even found some of the fights hard at times.
6819	1	a	Tons of fun. A good game to spend a Saturday (in October) playing. Not too involved, but engaging and funny.
6821	1	a	This game is really fun, as soon as I started playing it, I could not put it down until I had completed it. For the small cost of the game you get hours of fun, I would recommend that you buy this game.
6823	1	a	Costume Quest is one of those games that shows what Tim Schafer and the rest of Double Fine are capable of pulling off time and again: a fun, child-ish game with intereseting mechanics and crap-tons of easter eggs and references for fans of the studio.  The Good: -The storyline is genuinely funny -Character interactions are decent -Easter eggs out the â™¥â™¥â™¥  The Bad: -The combat is fairly bland. It stays at just about the same level of complexity throughout, and it's almost impossible to lose against any enemies outside of maybe the final two bosses -Lack of a map means that, for objectives like trick or treating every house, you can get stuck for a long time trying to figure out which spot you haven't visited yet.  Overall: This game is well worth the 10 dollars.
6825	1	a	I had so much fun with this game the story is fun and the costume mechanics are awesome. Really looking forward to Costume Quest 2. Don't think twice get this gem of a game.
6827	1	a	HOLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, THIS GAME IS AMAZING! IF YOU LIKE TRICK-OR-TREATING AND GETTING CANDY, THAT'S FINE, BUT IN THIS GAME IF YOU PICK THE WRONG â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DOOR YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥ IS THRUST INTO A BATTLE FINAL FANTASY STYLE TO THE DEATH WITH GOBLINS THAT ARE STEALING CANDY FOR THEIR EMPIRE. DID I MENTION THAT DEPENDING ON YOUR COSTUME YOU CAN TRANSFORM INTO A 30 FT TALL BADASS VERSION OF IT TO KICK THE GOBLINS IN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? WELL WE GOT EQUALITY ALL AROUND UP IN THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. YOUR FIRST PARTNER IS A BLACK KID WITH A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥IN' KNIGHT COSTUME THAT TOTALLY WRECKS â™¥â™¥â™¥, AND YOUR OTHER PARTER? YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SISTER THAT'S WHO, THE WHITE MAN WON'T GET YOU DOWN IN THIS GAME, THAT'S FOR SURE. BUY IT.
6829	1	a	A cute, turn-based adventure from Tim Schaffer's company Double Fine, known for humor-ful games like Psychonauts, Monkey Island, Brutal Legend, etc.  While a bit short, it is just the right length for what it is. The combat is a mix of standard turn-based RPG fare, with a twist. You can make different costumes with materials you find which alter your fighting style.  If you want to relive your days of trick-or-treating, playing make believe, and grabbing all the candy you can, try this one out.
6831	1	a	Costume Quest is a cel shaded RPG with a sense of humour. The game is short and gameplay is fairly linear, though the game's style and dialogue are entertaining to keep you playing the game. The story, while seemingly childish, works well for a game where cardboard costumes morph into towering avatars during the turn-based battle scenes. The game takes a certain appreciation for silliness to fully enjoy, otherwise the lame jokes and outlandish characters might become grating. The battle sequences are repetitive and not particularly challenging, but the real fun is in exploring the world for costumes and hidden items. Definitely worth a playthrough.
6833	1	a	Another good game by Double Fine. RPG game that keeps things simple and not overcomplicate the mechanics, but is still fun to play.
6835	1	a	I'll be upfront. I completely adored this game. I love, LOVE Halloween and this game gets the atmosphere so...right. Don't be put off by the cartoony graphics or simplistic turn based (with some QTE mixed in) combat. Yes, there is a quite a bit of said combat and some may find it repetitive but I found the need to finish to see where it goes with their adventure far outweighing that small issue. MSRP is $15 and I'd totally pay that but when the Double Fine bundles roll into a Steam sale it turns into a theft.
6837	1	a	Everything about this game is amazing. All the costumes are amazing and change up your strategy in battles. Difficulty level is just right and the game is hilarious.
6839	1	a	This is an easy, quick, and fun Halloween themed game. I would recommend it.
6841	1	a	Loved this game from start to finish. Not a lot of depth in the battle mechanics but very fun none the less!
6843	1	a	Actually found this game by chance, got the discount voucher after crafting badge and *wham*, i bought this game.  I really love this game! Even though the story itself is short, but it's refreshing! I've never play this kind of casual RPG before so it's so good to know that there's a game like this.  The game itself is like JRPG with turn based element, but the whackiness of the game is the element in it. The puzzle is good, not hard (well it would be somewhat hard for kids) too. The graphic is 3D cartoonized. For the story, if you want to know how kids feel in Halloween, then you must buy this game.  I really hope that there is another type of RPG like this in European game, simple but make you refresh to play it.  Overall 8.5/10. I really recommend it for the casual or hardcore gamer out there to play this game!
6845	1	a	This game has become a seasonal staple for me around Halloween. It's art and music is perfect, and engenders that nostaglic feeling of being a kid in a costume. You're not wearing a cardboard costume, you ARE a spaceman, or a ninja, or a robot.  Really fun, and memorable.  
6847	1	a	Costume Quest is a lot of fun. The gameplay is pretty simple, yet it sucked me in. The Double Fine sense of humor makes me want to see what happens next in the story. I am happy to own this game.
6849	1	a	Costume Quest is so much fun. Probably one of-- if not /the/-- most fun small-ish games I've played in 2013. It's just so charming and witty and it never failed to make me smile the 8 or so hours I put into it and its little expansion. A fun little distraction, its cuteness betraying its deeper gameplay mechanics and secrets.
6851	1	a	This game was so much fun in a kiddy kind of way. Not uber difficult but entertaining nonetheless. Last time I had fun playing a cutesie game was with Psychonauts. Highly recommend this game when it's on sale. Cheers!
6853	1	a	When buying this game I was unsure what exactly to expect, but I am very satisfied with the game. Every zone may seem repetitive, but with the new challenges and quests, it makes up the same act of going door to door to receive candy or engage in a battle with a monster. I would recommend this game as it provides hours of fun gameplay while still keeping it fun to play through.
6855	1	a	I love the concept of this game.
6857	1	a	Bought Humble Double Fine Bundle as an impulse buy last week. I knew what to expect from Psyconaughts and Stacking, but did not have a clue was Costume Quest was even about. To my surpises it's a solid game with mixture of quests, collectables, and solid combat. Basically the combat is baby's first Final Fantasy, yet for a person that never really played a Finaly Fantasy I had a blast playing Costume Quest. The each costume changes your abilties idea is done well and loads of fun. Only sad thing is that the game is a tad short (9 hours with all achievement unlocked) but hopefully one day it gets a squeal. Would recommend and I give it a DEN OUTTA DEN!
6859	1	a	Quite fun, some tactics involved in the fights, however questing- running around looking for stuff - can get a bit tedious after a while, although the system works good... Fun story! ~8 hours to complete
6861	1	a	I bought this game during the christmas sale and by far, it is a really fun game. Although there are no voiceovers, the witty humor, battle system and exageration of the combat is very entertaining. It is a game that never takes itself too seriously and will keep you entertained for a good time. Hopefully, it will go on sale again!
6863	1	a	Very cute game! Love being able to become the costume!
6865	1	a	the game is actually pretty good don't let the style and childish look deceive you .
6867	1	a	Brilliant, albeit short. Highly recommended.
6869	1	a	An adorable blend of JRPG gameplay and cartoon-style adventure.
6871	1	a	This game captures the feeling of Halloween perfectly. It's also a great RPG where your costumes are your classes. Some of the attacks - such as Statue of Liberty's National Anthem - are hilariously over-the-top.
6873	1	a	What a great little game! With light RPG elements this is probably better suited to younger children but its still a really unique game. Worth picking up and playing if you have 5-10 hours to spare!
6875	1	a	This is a great little game, fun from beginning to end
6877	1	a	This game is adorable, and if you've got kids, they'd probably love it. The combat isn't very difficult, and the stat building isn't too very important, but significant enough to give you a boost if you pay attention to it. It's a great intro to turn-based combat, and fun enough to hold your interest, even if you're a seasoned vet.
6879	1	a	A short, cute, and funny adventure game with some jrpg-lite combat elements. The humor is excellent and there is little out there that gives such a great feeling as the first time your character turns from big-eyed kid into a giant war-robot.
6881	1	a	Very cute and addicting game. Story is very nice.
6883	1	a	Now that I've beaten Costume Quest and the Grubbins on Ice DLC expansion I feel that I can review it properly. This game was fantastic! I don't beat many of my games because of time constraint, so it speaks a lot to a game when I actually finish it. This game was a fantastic nostalgic trip. Its an awesome adventure game by DoubleFine (those guys rock). In this game, whatever haloween costume you are wearing you transform into for battle. Great game! ~PR0XIDIAN
6885	1	a	I liked it. It's kiddy but still made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed the game play, which would be a school-age and up difficulty. The only downside for me was not being able to skip battle animations, which got a bit repetitive.
6887	1	a	It's a perfect little RPG with all the humor you'd expect of Tim Schaffear, but sadly few mechanics to make it stand out. This isn't Persona or even Final Fantasy, rather it's another twisted tale of Tim's that goes down with ease. A lovely little story with some fun in between, perfect for a present, but underwhelming as a game.
6889	1	a	A mediocre RPG propped up by the considerable charm of the writers of Double Fine Productions. Combat is often agonizingly boring, with almost no options but requiring timed button presses that doesn't let you just blur it all out like you would Final Fantasy or Pokemon battles. Still, the game is adorable and features wonderfully written dialogue all the way down to the NPCs, making you want to explore the world and all of it's crannys, even if the battles frequently make you want to put it down. Hopefully some depth will be added to the upcoming sequel, but until then this is a cute, if slight, addition to the rich Double Fine canon.
6891	1	a	I wish I'd waited a week - this was 11.49 when I got it and now its 5.74. But, didn't know it was going to happen. In relation to the game itself, its probably worth more like the 5.74. The characters are adorable, the premise is clever, but the gameplay is bad. I appreciate that this was done during studio downtime to waste some time but knowing how awesome Double Fine are, it surpised me just how bad the gameplay was. I got it because I love Tim, I love Double Fine, and I ADORE Halloween. But this is pretty painful. I can't tolerate it anymore and I am afriad that I have wasted 12 quid. Shame. Maybe nearer to Halloween I can give it another go but I doubt it.
6893	1	a	Double Fine magic. Short and sweet and not harmful to your teeth.
6895	1	a	Best quality stuff from Double Fine, as usual... :-D
6897	1	a	A game for kids and adults. If you want to have a laugh while playing a great game, Costume Quest is what needs to be in your games collection!
6899	1	a	RPG elements rolled into a fun little package. Very happy with my purchase
6901	1	a	This game is great for those that are looking for a casual experience. Even better is that it's suitable for all ages, so don't let the name or theme fool you. I particularly liked the humor in this game. The variety of costumes and abilities however, is offset by the fact that soon after you get the basics of the game, battles become very tiresome. The game also offers a bit of strategy... no seriously, combining the correct costumes with the correct abilities (battle stamps), and choosing who attacks what and with what is pretty enjoyable, challanging, and evenrewarding once you reach the harder enemies.  All in all, this game is casual, so if you're looking for adventure or action, you've com to the wrong place.
6903	1	a	Quite a fun puzzle game with interesting mechanics. Definitely recommend for puzzle lovers.
6905	1	a	I am completely in love with this game. It's rather fun and just enough challenging to make you think a little without being realy hard or trying.  The main game has all sorts of chances for achievements and the costumes you aquire are really neat.  I enjoy the battle system. It's a straight forward turn-based system, very old school RPG. There's a little strategy involved, deciding what costume to wear and some are on by necessity along with what 'battle stamp' to use.  It's also nice that losing in a battle kicks you out of the battle, you're not 'dead' and go back to a previous point.  Only exception to this are boss battles but they point they send you is more to give you a chance to rethink your costume and stamp combos more than making you re-play levels.  My only real frusrtation is the graphics. While fun and interesting, the level of detail lags my computer like crazy. Even turning off shadowing and other features, navigating the leves and timing events in battle.
6907	1	a	Nothing I could say would prepare you to this wonderful game. Those kids have humor &amp; attics so charming you will fall under their spell. The entire package just oozes style &amp; show how much Tim Schafer loves to create games. Simply a must have for any gamer who wants to have pure fun.
6909	1	a	I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.  The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.
6911	1	a	It is a very good halloween turn-based battle game! i have had this since christmas because i had like $2.50 in my steam wallet. I would recommend this alot! 10000/10000 Thumbs up!
6913	1	a	Perfect example of quality over quantity. Nice fun little RPG that has you battling monsters as super versions of your costumes. Simple but entertaining and made by Double Fine Studios. What more could you ask for? Unicorns, Yetis, and Flying Space Warriors you say? They have those too.
6915	1	a	All right, Costume Quest was a fun little game. To sum it up in three words: 'Baby's First J-RPG'  The strongest point of Costume Quest is the writing. The banter reminds me of old Cartoon Network shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. It pretty much carried the game for me.  The gameplay itself is familiar from Chrono Triggers and Final Fantasies. Turn-based hit point reduction. I don't see anyone who has played a turn-based game being challenged by the combat.  But in the end, the game is clearly developed for children. And unlike most children's games, this one has intelligence and wit behind it. I would recommend this to people who would like to give their child or child-like entity an easy and painless foray into the wondrous world of turn-based games.
6917	1	a	Awesome game! Addictive!
6919	1	a	An awesome RPG from Double Fine.
6921	1	a	Bought this for my daughter- ended up playing it myself to completion. Awesome title that I didn't know anything about until I picked it up on sale. 9/10
6923	1	a	Short and Sweet. While the storyline isn't much more than a pleasant buzzing noise that filled the space between running around for quest objectives, Costume Quest pivots on a single charming idea and does it extremely well; what if little children could actually become the things they were dressed up as for halloween? The amount of enjoyment you will derive from this game is largely influenced by how much you'd like to have a ninja, a unicorn, and The Statue of Liberty form a ragtag tagteam against hoards of derpy looking demons.
6925	1	a	The most hardcore murder simulator out there. Not recommended for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥es.

6931	1	a	Nothing I could say would prepare you to this wonderful game. Those kids have humor &amp; attics so charming you will fall under their spell. The entire package just oozes style &amp; show how much Tim Schafer loves to create games. Simply a must have for any gamer who wants to have pure fun.
6933	1	a	RPG elements rolled into a fun little package. Very happy with my purchase
6935	1	a	Absolutely adorable. A timing-based game with a wonderful adventure story. Captures exactly what children probably imagination their costumes to be. Beware, the mini-game is fairly easy and can get boring. There's no consequences to failing a battle. The game is probably targeting younger children. Despite this, the story is fun and the animation is a treat. Definitely recommend.
6937	1	a	A really great and imaginative game. Never played anything like it ( Well, besides the RPG part).   You must choose betwee a brother or a sister, Reynold and Wren, and save the one you did not choose from Evil monsters tryng to steal candy from Halloween! Luckily you have super powerful costumes on your side!  I've had this game for years but I wanted to play it during the Halloween season. Finished it in about less than a week, but I'm sure I could have finished it in a day. Not too much content, but I feel its worth it. At the time of this review, I have not played through the DLC that came with the game, Grubbins on Ice ( Saving that for Christmas).  This game shows that Double Fine are kings of imaginative games, and even in gameplay they know their stuff.  
6939	1	a	A great turn-based strategy RPG that has the soul of a point-and-click adventure. The costume mechanic is particularly fun.
6941	1	a	Ever wanted a Mario &amp; Luigi-style RPG from the geniuses of humor at Double Fine Productions? Well, look no further. This game is definitely worth the 5-6 hours of your time that it will take to complete, and getting 100% isn't some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like some other titles I know (looking at you, Assassin's Creed.) Also, Robot costume is the best costume.
6943	1	a	Great game but too short even with the DLC it's less than 8h. I suppose some of the Trick or Treating aspect could've got a bit dull going forward but otherwise more costumes would've been ace.
6945	1	a	Fun little quarky, text based RPG.
6947	1	a	Tim, I love you, man, but this got real old, real, real fast.
6949	1	a	Addictingly fun and easy to play RPG. 9/10.
6951	1	a	If you crazy kids like Halloween and RPG games, then this would be a great game to pick up and play in a breeze! You can't go wrong with Double Fine either, since they're the indie company behind Psychonauts. This is also a good game to play if you want to experience what an RPG is like upon a smooth and easy-to-play surface for all ages!
6953	1	a	this feels like a kids game where the power of candy rules all, but it is great fun even for adults :-P All the little details make this game good, and its balance of reward versus penalty is very well done.  A nice calming game experience, where you need to consider your tactics well.
6955	1	a	Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage. It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads. Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.
6957	1	a	Surprisingly Fun! It has a paper mario turn base feel for the battle, and a different feel than your average game!
6959	1	a	Worth your time. Decent game, however it becomes rather boring after a while as the game mechanics don't evolve.
6961	1	a	As expected it is easy but there are plenty of fun costumes to play around with as well as exploring for collectables. Worth buying purely for the humour and charm which is even found in the background characters.
6963	1	a	Fantastic writing!
6965	1	a	Fun little RPG. A bit linear, but otherwise excellent. Buy, buy, buy.
6967	1	a	This game to many RPG buffs would probably be considered a casual game, but that being said it's actually really fun. I enjoyed the light-hearted story paired with an intuitive and amusing battle system revolving around collecting a variety of Halloween costumes with different abilities. The writing for this game is excellent as well. I found myself chuckling a number of times at things the little kids around town say. Recommended if you're looking for a fun little adventure without too much of a challenge.
6969	1	a	This game has all the quirks and charm of a typical Double Fine game! The combat and RPG elements may not be complex enough for hardcore gamers, but I think the simplicity helps keep the atmosphere light and casual. This game gets a strong recommendation from me!
6971	1	a	This game is adorable. Regardless of one's age or gaming genre preference, this one is worth checking out, especially when it's available for under a couple bucks.
6973	1	a	It'sooo cute and full of lovely details. It's funny to check out all the sweet costumes and play with the possible fight marks. I missed a bit a game mode where I can have endless fights to play with the costumes.
6975	1	a	Simple, but fast-paced Final Fantasy clone, with a touch of Zelda, its own colectibles, a few mini games, but, most importantly, the charm of a heartfelt Halloween story for kids.
6977	1	a	'Best single player fun i've had for a while. If you like Halloween,trick or treat,dunkin' for apples,then this is for you. Good humour.'
6979	1	a	Pretty great game. I love anything made my Double Fine and this is no exception! Fantastic gameplay and I seem to always be laughing from thegame's humor!
6981	1	a	Grubbing on Ice expansion has best ending ever Double Fine sure does know how to make the end of the game feel very epic
6983	1	a	A triumphant, if slightly low budget, return for Double Fine.
6985	1	a	Double Fine at its best. A creative and funny game about halloween. Finally, a game where character selection isn't just male or female, but the choice between two different personalities altogether. I cannot reccomend this game enough.
6987	1	a	I play through this game every year to practice trick or treating
6989	1	a	Fun, Cute, and a cheap Quick game that is kinda repetitive, but lots of fun. The story is unique, and the costume and powers are individually unique and clever. It's a game from Double Fine so in the game there a hidden references to other games and the company themselves. I love this game, and as soon as I am able plane to get Costume Quest 2.
6991	1	a	Do you enjoy being happy? Enjoy smiling and being filled with that warm fuzzy feeling you get after laughing for 2 and a half minutes straight? Well then you should buy this game. If you know someone who also enjoys these things, then you should buy them a copy too. If you don't smile while playing this game, you can personally add me on steam and I'll send you a gift copy of Pyschonaughts.
6993	1	a	Fun game in the style of a classic rpg.
6995	1	a	Addictive and cute game from Double Fine. Turn Based RPG in a simple, fun package.
6997	1	a	Buy and play this game. 10/10 would reccomend.
6999	1	a	It's been a long time since I truly enjoyed an rpg, and Costume Quest was no disappointment. I'd been waiting a long time to play it and I'm glad I finally did. It took me about 10 hours to beat the base game and then the dlc. The best part of this game was the imagination of the kids that allowed them to use their cardboard Halloween costumes as amazingly deadly characters in battle. Truly a unique game. I recommend this game to ANYONE of any age, whether you like rpgs or not.
7001	1	a	Costume Quest is a short burst of fun, with the typical witty yet earnest writing that Double Fine make seem easy. It's not a very taxing game, but is fun to play and is over before it becomes too repetitive. Definitely worth a go.
7003	1	a	Really fun.
7005	1	a	This is a cute little game about three friends who set out, not to save the world, but a friend and sibling. It's cute, funny and very easy. Do you wish you could just finish a game for once? Do you mind if there's a slightest taste of JRPG? Whatever you answer, give Costume Quest a chance, don't let the monsters win and destroy halloween.
7007	1	a	Actually fun, think like paper mario but simpler and halloween and possible hidden undertones of child â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
7009	1	a	i don't even like RPGs and yet i totally got into the RPG aspect of this game.  i 100 percented this on the ps3, and i don't normally take the time to do that.  highly recommended. another fine game from double fine.
7011	1	a	One of the few really good Halloween themed games.
7013	1	a	Great game to play during Halloween.
7015	1	a	I love the way this game looks and the theme works so well. I really enjoyed the storyline and fully got lost in the game. At times I didn't know what I was supposed to do and it was a little frustrating but overall the game was totally worth it. I'm so excited that there is a second one!
7017	1	a	Great little turn based rpg. If you see it on sale, get it.
7019	1	a	This is just a cute game to play. If it is on sale, check it out.
7021	1	a	A relatively short and simple game for an RPG, but has a hint of Earthbound's charm to it.
7023	1	a	It's a little slow at first but once you're used to the game (when you're in the mall) it's a lot better. It's a well balanced turn based fighter with an rpg adventure side, good visuals and well optimized. Plenty of humour too, shame there's no voice acting as it would be a very brilliant game if it had voices too.
7025	1	a	Not the type of game I usually play but it came in Amazon's Double Fine Bundle and I gave it a go. I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls &amp; combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.  Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game &amp; DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.
7027	1	a	Solid, fun game. The combat is very lacking and boring/repetitive (though the costumes are INCREDIBLE), but if you can push through that the rest of the game is very enjoyable, cute, and actually does a decent job of being reminiscent of going on adventures as a kid.
7029	1	a	A simple and satisfying game for young or old. Quest for candy, destroy monsters, and watch as your Halloween costumes spring to life in battle.
7031	1	a	This is a really fun turn based game. I love the story and the animation for the fight scenes.
7033	1	a	Boils down the standard RPG formula to its bare bones for even the most casual of players to digest and then throws in some collection elements. It only lasts about 6 hours or so and the combat will get a bit stale with the lack of a deep progression system, but the writing will keep you laughing and it's definitely a good $15 spent. I especially reccomend it to anyone interested in game design or development. There's a lot of interesting experiments with opening up the genre to casual audiences here that I'd say succeeded.
7035	1	a	This is a great little game.  You can finish it in 7 hours easily. 3 hours for the Grubbins on Ice add-on. This is not a con.  In fact this is proof that a great little game with lots of personality can be a good product. Not everything has to be a 50 million dollar epic 100 hour RPG! Don't let this fool you though, there are lots of cool things to find, collect and do as you play through the story.  This game has all the great traits of a Double Fine game. - well written - personality - good mechanics - highly enjoyable  It is the perfect length for the story and mood of the game. Any longer and the mechanics of the fighting would have been too repetitive.  This is good example of a smaller downloadable game executing really well. Check it out for some light hearted fun!
7037	1	a	Fun times RPG with whimsical adventure!
7039	1	a	An RPG with combat similar to the paper mario series and some clever mechanics: your costume descides what class you are, and almost all of them have some out of combat ability. While it's not very hard or complicated, It makes up for this by being very cute and a lot of fun, with a very silly sense of humor.  Not much else to say really, If you want a nice, quick game to play to get in the mood for Halloween, this would be it.
7041	1	a	You can fight monsters as a Giant Cardboard Badass Robot ...or as a Fabulous Unicorn  no really. it's a really good game. If you like turn-based strategy games. you gotta check this out :)  10/10
7043	1	a	Trick or treating is now at your fingertips year round in Costume Quest! This absolutely adorable games leads you on an adventure to save your sibling from monsters. Collect gross treats, buy powerups with candy, and change out your team's costumes for special abilities.   However, there are faults. The game does get tediously repetitive after about an hour in. With about four different areas, you are performing the same side quests every time and battling similar monsters in a different arena. With the amount of constant battling, I wish combat would be a bit more interesting but unfortunately it just got painfully boring after a while and became a chore. The only redeeming factor of battles is the cutscenes when performing a special ability relative to the costumes your team is wearing. The design of costumes in battle was really well done and unique. Gaining new costumes to see in game was the only thing keeping me going after about 5 battles.   All the faults and boredom aside, it's still a cute and fun game that's definitely worth the sale price! I wouldn't buy it at its full price but it is festive fun nonetheless for all ages.
7045	1	a	Great game!
7047	1	a	I am an achievement hunter and this game while having simple gameplay game me my fix!
7049	1	a	Great game. Simple (a bit repetitive...) gameplay, but super cute setting and characters.
7051	1	a	This game is short and simplistic. The RPG combat is kinda like Paper Mario, in that you do QTEs to deal more damage. However, you usually only have the option to do a basic attack until your special is charged up (always after 3 turns) or you have a special stamp equipped. There are about ten costumes in both the normal game and the DLC, and only about half of them are worth using in combat compared to the others.  Outside of combat, there are four enviroments to explore and solve puzzles in using costume abilities. You can hit basically anyone and anything with your candy pail, which is amusing. The dialogue isn't laugh out loud funny, but I smiled from time to time.  The game really shines graphically. The characters are cute, the environments are given a lot of detail, and the battles look amazing. It's all very colorful. Music is average, however.  All in all, playing this game is like playing a cartoon from Cartoon Network long ago. Worth buying if it's on sale.
7053	1	a	Not a bad game, but only get this if you have a joypad, else its unplayable at times! Seriously unplayable. You can do most stuff fine, but certain parts of the game are just too much cos you can't go diagnolly or other directions properly using keys, else this game would be pretty sweet.
7055	1	a	Absolutely frakkin ADORABLE. The kid in you will love it for the costumes and cuteness, and the adult in you will love it for the tactical rpg gameplay. Lovely game, start to finish.
7057	1	a	This game is adorable, and if you've got kids, they'd probably love it. The combat isn't very difficult, and the stat building isn't too very important, but significant enough to give you a boost if you pay attention to it. It's a great intro to turn-based combat, and fun enough to hold your interest, even if you're a seasoned vet.
7059	1	a	A short, cute, and funny adventure game with some jrpg-lite combat elements. The humor is excellent and there is little out there that gives such a great feeling as the first time your character turns from big-eyed kid into a giant war-robot.
7061	1	a	Very cute and addicting game. Story is very nice.
7063	1	a	Now that I've beaten Costume Quest and the Grubbins on Ice DLC expansion I feel that I can review it properly. This game was fantastic! I don't beat many of my games because of time constraint, so it speaks a lot to a game when I actually finish it. This game was a fantastic nostalgic trip. Its an awesome adventure game by DoubleFine (those guys rock). In this game, whatever haloween costume you are wearing you transform into for battle. Great game! ~PR0XIDIAN
7065	1	a	This game is fun, but the fights are all the same which makes the game a little repetitive. But the environment is great, the story is funny, although really short (a few hours to finish the game, a few more to finish the DLC and/or get all side quests).  If you can buy it in a bundle or on sale, you should try it. Otherwise, wait for steam summer/winter sales ;)
7067	1	a	Another fun title from the folks over at Double Fine. Costume Quest has a lot of charm, as well as some fun silliness just in overall premise. Quite nostalgic to play this game and look back at the Halloween costumes the kids are wearing, Halloween parties, and trick or treating... while trying to hunt out actual monsters/demons who have entered our world. A fun 8-10 hour play through.
7069	1	a	If you crazy kids like Halloween and RPG games, then this would be a great game to pick up and play in a breeze! You can't go wrong with Double Fine either, since they're the indie company behind Psychonauts. This is also a good game to play if you want to experience what an RPG is like upon a smooth and easy-to-play surface for all ages!
7071	1	a	First Steam game i ever 100 percented and it wasn't a a pain at all. Even though it stars kids, do not be fooled into thinking this is a kid's game. It requires a quick-time event with every attack so it keep you more involved than ususal turnbased RPGs
7073	1	a	Just an afterthought when I bought the Double Fine bundle, but turned out to be an awesome game. Simple, not that difficult, but is just plain fun. Kind of makes you want to be a kid again when all you needed was an imagination.
7075	1	a	Very charming RPG, with a heart and sense of humour. It's a must, specially for the price.
7077	1	a	super fun and very addictive. can't wait for the sequel this autumn!
7079	1	a	I've heard that the designers wanted to make this like playing through a Pixar movie, and it really shows. It's got a charming and whimsical atmosphere that makes you feel like a kid again, and while the barrage of timed hits can sort of be annoying, the game's forgiving enough that it rarely becomes problematic. Besides, who wouldn't want to be in a world where you can don a few cardboard boxes and turn into a rocket-punch-firing robot?
7081	1	a	What a cute little game! My friend suggested that I try this game and it took me forever to find time to do so. There are just so many games to play! So, I finally tried it last night and it's actually starting to get a little addicting... Better stop while I'm ahead and get back to my schoolwork.. Fun, even for guys! ;)
7083	1	a	i love the atmosphere of this game. story telling is charming. i like the shell shaded art direction. i love the dialogue sometimes, its so witty. i love the world this game is placed in, its a short game, and i wish this game was longer. on the other hand the game battle system is TOO repetitive. VERY simple battle mechanics which is like a double edged sword. every battle in the game is very similar and it gets dull after awhile. dodging attacks is dead simple. as long as you get the timing right, that's all that matters. that is way too simple. but once you get the hang of the battle mechanics, the battles flow in and out of the world map very quickly which i likecontrols on the kb and mouse plain SUCKS, use an xbox controller.the last boss final phase is horribly over powered, they could have designed his moves better instead of a cheap 'wipe out the whole team' move. with all that said, this game was still loads of fun you should chekc it out!
7085	1	a	It is ok.Can finish in about 5 hours or so 
7087	1	a	Great to play around Halloween. An entertaining halloween action-rpg of sorts. Very fun and halloween-spirited.
7089	1	a	This game is downright adorable; and at only $15 which includes the expansion this is very much worth the price. Bursting with humour and creativity this game shows what Halloween used to mean to us 30 year old kids.
7091	1	a	The game is better than what it looks like at first sight. May get repetitive in the second half.  I liked it.
7093	1	a	This game was really enjoyable and surprisingly challenging at times, I do have to say I had to retry the last battle a couple times in order to win. The story line was cute, you play as the brother or sister, and you have to save your twin who was taken by monsters who thought they were candy. The combat was interesting, using turn based events as well as quick time events. All the character designs were really adorable, but the costumes turned honestly badass during combat. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and can't wait to play the next one.
7095	1	a	The premise is clever and the art style is charming, but this game is probably best suited for little kids as battling gets repetitive and the controls are slightly awkward.
7097	1	a	This reminded me of the fun I had playing Psychonauts, granted this doesn't have the same depth, character development, or even voice acting. It was still great fun.  Gameplay is essentially going around trick-or-treating while fighting off monsters that the adults can't seem to see. Imagination kicks in when the battles start, and this is where it can get a bit hilarious. You can form powerful teams with different focuses for each enemy type, or boss type, and it'll either work or fail.  The one thing that frustrated me about this game was not being able to equip your team before a fight started. I found too often that my fights accidentally engaged with the costume I was using to travel with.
7099	1	a	Little kids transforming on Halloween night to beat up monsters for candy. Fun for everyone. Another good Double Fine game.
7101	1	a	I LOVE thisgame. It's a perfect RPG for young kids. I can't wait for Costume Quest 2!!
7103	1	a	Straight forward RPG fun with a nice look to it. Only thing that lets it down is the fight mechanics, which are basic and mean that replay isn't on the books. Around 8 hours of gameplay total (including all of the side missions and hidden achievements)
7105	1	a	One really great achievement of Costume Quest is the combination of childhood fantasy stories filled with knights, robots, pirates and such ; the classical gameplay of japanese adventure rpg and the whole spiced-up with humor.  Sure the game might seem short for a grown-up, even too easy or too linear, but that's the kind of game I'd have loved to play when I was a child and one of the most enjoyable I've played recently. Costume Quest was so refreshing after a trail of damn-too-serious or damn-too-hard-core games, I just can't wait to play the second one !  Thanks Double Fine !
7107	1	a	-finishing Grubbins on Ice -wonders about corner over there -falls out of world into the void of uncoded -finds bad guys just being there along -nearly laughs to pure death  9001/10 would IGN again (not realy in IGN)
7109	1	a	I keep playing it over and over so much fun, But I wish there was A 3rd. If your looking to buy it and don't know GET IT. GREAT GAME I RATE IT 10/10
7111	1	a	wrapped myself in toilet paper and called it a mummy to play this cult of a classic video game guess thats just good old fasioned imersion kickin in
7113	1	a	What's not to love about Costume Quest? 1) It's Double Fine. 2) It's related to Halloween. 3) It's epic! If you love well written turn-based combat adventure games with a twist then you'll love this. Played it originally on Xbox 360 and it was awesome, played it again through Steam and it's still awesome! Really pleased the Grubbins on Ice DLC was included too, a nice addition!
7115	1	a	It was really fun to play
1087	0	a	A charming way to kill a couple of hours, especially if you decide to marathon it on or around Halloween. However, the repetitive nature of quests and combat combined with the game getting increasingly dull the more you play it keeps me from recommending it. Not bad by any means, but not something I'm sure I'd play again.
7117	1	a	I don't know about other people, but I think Halloween got me more excited than any other holiday, even Christmas. There was something fun about 'being' something else for a night. Also, the pails full of candy. Double Fine does a wonderful job portraying the things I loved about Halloween as a kid while also giving me things to appreciate as an adult.  The art direction is top notch. There is a very consistant design aesthetic that carries through the entire game, one that would look right at home as part of a Halloween cartoon special. The character design eschews realism for expressiveness - not quite to the completely distended extremes of Psychonauts, but still not aiming for 'realism'. The main characters are kind of chibi, which is great because it allows for a remarkable expressiveness. Par for the course in a Double Fine title, the dialogue (all written, no voice acting) is really sharp and loaded with humor both obvious and subtle. The background music tends to be fairly repetitive, but it's atmospheric and compliments the visual design. Shades of Danny Elfman, which is a *perfect* choice for Halloween.  The game itself is a turn-based RPG but with active, timing based offense and defense boosts. It's very similar to Super Mario RPG (which, if it didn't innovate that style definitely codified it) in how it plays out. Actually, of any game to compare the gameplay to, I'd compare it to Hothead's Penny Arcade Adventures. It's funny, Ron Gilbert came over from Hothead just a month before the game was released - he didn't actually have any direct impact on the game, but given Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert's long-term association, I can't but help think he cribbed from his friend's design. Which is fine because it worked then and it worked in this game. Add in a dash of Earthbound, in being able to engage with enemies on screen before the turn-based battle begins, and you've got a tried-and-true formula.  The costume transformations are fun and the special powers associated with the costumes are anywhere from 'useful' to 'hilarious', in the case of the Lady Liberty costume. One thing the game could be dinged on is a lack of variance in combat. There's only one special power per costume, and a handful of optional 'third powers' that can be added. In actual practice, a lot of combat could be completed by just attacking, waiting for the special attack to power up, unleash the attack and if anything is still standing repeat the process. The combat is thankfully fast-paced for a turned-based RPG, but it can get somewhat repetitive.  I could harp on a few other things. The game is short - even if you explore and find everything, expect 5-6 hours at most if you're able to win most battles (and you probably will). Of course, as an adult with a job, short isn't a crime for me, but those who hear RPG and expect 99 hours of playtime will be sorely disappointed. The story is simple, which fits a game about a bunch of kids on Halloween night turning into their costumes and saving their sibling and their candy stashes, but there could have been a little bit more meat on the story's bones. Characterization was strong and it goes a long way, but the world of Costume Quest is charming enough that I felt like I was missing something to not get more. The environmental 'puzzles' are barely a challenge and the solutions are nearly flat out stated by some NPCs who might as well add 'GET IT?' to their obvious, pun-based solutions. Then again, it's a great entry level title for children. For adults, you'll probably find the puzzles and their solutions too, too easy.  But those are quibbles. Costume Quest is one of the most charming games I've played. It's got a great atmosphere and great idea for a game that ends before the shtick gets old. The game also, I might add, is fairly diverse in its characterization and does not limit costumes amongs the PCs by gender. Yes, Double Fine, I noticed, and it's an awesome thing to see game designers implement.  I definitely recommend this game to people tired of gray-and-gritty, guns-and-guts gaming. The game will make you smile. It's no challenge at all, if that's how you want to measure 'worth' in a game, but the wit of the game and the clever concept will make the game worth the price of admission in my opinion. It's a perfect compliment to the season and if you have even the barest interest in RPGs - or have never played one before and want one to try that isn't going to overwhelm you with entirely new gaming concepts - you'll enjoy the game. And just like Halloween candy, don't rush the experience. Savor it instead of gobbling it all down at once. I get the temptation, but you'll just get a tummy ache if you do!
7119	1	a	A fun halloween tradition.  Costume Quest is a short RPG that is a bit over 5 hours. Its fun and interesting. I highly recomend giving it a playthrough during the halloween season. &lt;3
7121	1	a	Short, fun little RPG. pretty similar to Mario RPG. Though the last boss is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to the entire game up to that point.
7123	1	a	Another quirky game put together by the Double Fine team. This time they put together a solid turn based rpg with some more of their well known humor. It's relatively short clocking in around the 5-6 hour mark but it was definitely worth a playthrough.   9.0/10.0
7125	1	a	If I could title this review, it would be titled 'Fun Sized Fun' You and your twin are trick-or-treating on Halloween when a bunch of goblin-like creatures take your sibling because they can't tell between real candy and a kid wearing a costume. You have to trick or treat to get more candy and fight the creatures. The trick is that when you enter combat, whatever costume you're wearing gives you crazy powers. This isn't a particularly difficult game. I only died a couple of times throughout and that was because I made some boneheaded mistakes. The difficulty doesn't matter though: this is a clever, simple, fun bite-sized RPG that has a chewy nugget of heart at its center. It's a wonderful treat for the Halloween season (and the Holiday season with the included 'Grubbins on Ice' DLC).
7127	1	a	Great game for Halloween! Super fun game with tons of charm that has elements of exploration and turn-based RPG battles.
7129	1	a	Way more fun then I expected it to be, solid RPG elements and cool costumes make up for the mediocre story. Another reason to love Double Fine, now I just need them to make a sequel!
7131	1	a	I was genuinely shocked at how good this game is. The combat is Final Fantasy style, line up in a row and take turns poking each other, the dialog is goofy, and the situation absurd. That being said, the game is actually a hell of a lot of fun and has some memorable moments that even a jaded and cynical gamer like myself found reason to smile at. Worth the price of admission - and if you don't like it know that you are helping Tim Schafer afford to make more games.
7133	1	a	Costume Quest is a great little game with cute characters and quirky quests. If you're looking for something casual but still a lot of fun, I'd definitely recommend it.   Sometimes it crashes though so be sure to save often!
7135	1	a	THis is such a great game for playing around October. It brings a sense of nostalgia to the table, and is super easy to pick up.
7137	1	a	This game is awesome! If you're looking for something fun and casual to play around Halloween you should definitely try it out.
7139	1	a	I spent 8 continuous hours playing and completing this today. Going to play GOI next and then make sure that I get every achievement, which will be a first. I wasn't expecting to like this game as much as I did. I had it on my wishlist for a while and was excited to playt it. But I read beforehand that there's battles in this game and that put me off a bit because I don't like hard games but this was a super cool and casual play. It's got the kind of easiness as the Lego games.   10/10  One of my new favourite games, Can't wait to play the next one!
7141	1	a	Don't really know what to say... It's funny, it's cute and it's very fun to just play and chill, forget about things. It has a 'warm' feeling to it, just purely enjoyable.
7143	1	a	Awesomely cute...
7145	1	a	Its got an amusing story and fairly good combat.
7147	1	a	Best game to play for Haloween time, i enjoyed this game a lot.   the art styling was coo to see, kind of like an older game. the gameplay is fun with all the different costume abbilities, and the games makes you want all the costumes to see what they all do :)  i would give this about 8/10  the soundtrack was kind of dull.
7149	1	a	It's about a 5 hour game and it's fun to play. I found my self beating it in one sitting.
7151	1	a	at first it was hard and then it was too easy. enemies couldn't make even one attack before death. but it's cite game for 1-2 evenings.
7153	1	a	Simple yet great RPG to spend two evenings on (if you have the DLC). Controls are fairly good on DInput controller, but setting them up is a bit more difficult (only left thumbstick is set by default). Storyline is nice, nothing complicated, just kids playing and fighting. Graphics are also good, but video settings are poor. In some ways, CQ is simmilar to South Park: The Stick of Truth. Not in the use of profanity, but in an all round feel when playing.
7155	1	a	Very cute and super fun. If you want a cross between Nightmare Before Christmas and Invader Zim, you should play this!
7157	1	a	Costume Quest is a nostalgic rpg/adventure game hybrid with a great art style and aesthetic. The combat is similar to South Park: The Stick of Truth or any of the Super Mario RPGS (SNES/M&amp;L/Paper Mario), with timed button presses integrated into traditional JRPG mechanics. The costume system is fun, but the difference between certain costumes is minimal. Good fun, and with the DLC it will last you around 7-8 hours. I'd reccommend picking it up during the next sale.
7159	1	a	Something about this game really appeals to me. I think it's the atmosphere. It makes you feel like a kid, yet most of the dialogs are written with an adult player in mind. I usually struggle to complete games because I get bored quickly, but with this one I didn't put it down on the PS3 until I found all secrets and got all achievements. Now I picked up the PC version and looks like I'm going to play it till the end once more before the Costume Quest 2 comes out.
7161	1	a	Easy to play, made me laugh, and helped me to introduce a friend to the RPG genre!
7163	1	a	For a game designed for younger players in mind, I still found this rather enjoyable to play. The combat is rather simplistic, but still felt challenging in some of the boss fights. For most fights, chain-stunning the foes turned out to be the most effective play to buy time to build up your costume special attacks. The story is rather predictable, and the quests are more or less repeated in each location, but it didn't seem to be that much of a turn-off as it should have been. For the price of the game, I really felt like I got a good deal of value from the game, considering the 'Grubbins On Ice' DLC that comes with the game is effectively another few hours of content that expands the story of the game (or can be a hard-mode if you just start it w/o using a save that had main game data). I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to play a fairly easy RPG to kill a few hours between more serious RPGs.
7165	1	a	Cute and charming game. Reminds me of Earthbound, Paper Mario, and American holiday-movies. There are some technical issues of framerate-drops and stuttering, but they seem to pass. Also, it's forgivable when the game is such a delight.
7167	1	a	A fun halloween tradition.  Costume Quest is a short RPG that is a bit over 5 hours. Its fun and interesting. I highly recomend giving it a playthrough during the halloween season. &lt;3
7169	1	a	Short, fun little RPG. pretty similar to Mario RPG. Though the last boss is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to the entire game up to that point.
7171	1	a	Cutsy game that is easy to play if you're not feeling well and want to feel better,
7173	1	a	Recommended because it's one of the funniest games ever. Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst battle systems ever. Although you can change costumes (effectively classes) outside of battle, once one starts you're stuck with what you went in wearing. And that's where the problem begins. Each class only has one attack and a timed special ability, none of which are particularly interesting. Worse, because there are only two costumes in the game with healing abilities, every battle had to be designed around the possibility that the player would be totally unable to heal. The end result is that every battle is exactly the same thing whether you're fighting a boss or a basic encounter. They tried to add a bit of variation with equippable Battle Stamps. Unfortunately, you're limited to one per character, can't change in battle, and some of them are objectively better than others. They don't solve the problem.   If you're willing to put up with the awful battles for fantastic writing and some unique scenarios, it's worth the sale price of $5. I'd struggle to recommend it at much higher of a price, unfortunately, because this is a game that hits its peak early. It's a fantastic first 90 minutes, a pretty good second 90 minutes, and a third that I didn't finish because it had become primarily battles rather than laughs.   Minor note: This game has terrible mouse acceleration that can't be turned off. It doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it makes menu navigation annoying.
7175	1	a	Fantastic game, great to play on Halloween. Love the rpg aspect, comedy and completionist feel. Gtg, gonna go play the sequel!
7177	1	a	Really, really loved the game. A tad bit short, but it was so fun. The 2nd one was great, too
7179	1	a	This game is filled with charm and humour as well as being a really enjoyable, if basic turn based RPG. I would highly recommend it for anyone but especially if you are a fan of Halloween or cute stories, Costume Quest will not let you down.
7181	1	a	Much Costume   Such Quest Much Candy  10/10 IGN   So Halloween  Much kids    
7183	1	a	This game is so simple, but yet I had a ton of fun. It's short, yet I couldn't stop playing it and beat it within a couple days of starting. If you got it in the humble bundle, it is def worth checking out.
7185	1	a	This game is great. There, that should do it.
7187	1	a	Very fun, would/will replay.  I like the design, the music, the story, the gameplay... the whole thing.  I only wish I didn't have to uncheck every special FX for it to only 'sort-of' run smoothly on my 1-yr old MBA that runs other games without a hitch...  Took me a while to understand I just wasn't *that* bad at hitting a button at a specific time but that it was lagging as heck. Curiously, it's kinda 'better' when played on a huge videoprojector (3m large image) than on my 27' Cinema Display screen as it doesn't lag so much.  Also pad support is good... except when the game 'loses' your wireless pad that disconnected while you were away peeing for 2 minutes and you have to manually (read 'ctrl-q') quit the game because it won't recognize the pad when it reconnects... but it won't recognize your keyboard either. Got used to taking the pad with me for bathroom breaks ^^  Other than that, controls are spot-on and the whole thing is just really fun and just easy/hard enough that you're not discouraged or, at the opposite, feel like a kid.
7189	1	a	Got this game just before Halloween. The whole family curled up on the couch and passed the controller around all weekend long. Imaginative, family friendly, fun, and funny. What a wonderful experience to share with my kids!
7191	1	a	Collect Costumes, Complete Quests and Engage Enemies in Battle using your newly acquired battle suits.
7193	1	a	-finishing Grubbins on Ice -wonders about corner over there -falls out of world into the void of uncoded -finds bad guys just being there along -nearly laughs to pure death  9001/10 would IGN again (not realy in IGN)
7195	1	a	Costume Quest is a child's fantasy turned into a real game. You follow the protagonists as they have to fight a menacing threat on Halloween and their costumes will help them. I will give a short explanation concerning several aspects of the game.  Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty solid, though it can get repetitive after a while. Each costume brings with it a certain power or ability that can be used to get past certain obstacles (Such as entering a location, passing an object and more). This means that every new costume you unlock will be used, one way or the other, to acquire new adventures, enemies, candy and secrets.  The combat is turn based, but it works. The idea behind it is simple. You have to press the attack button (E for keyboard) and then time the same button again at the right moment (A small bar appears) to gain an effective attack. After you have attacked, the enemies will attack your group. Defense works the same. The enemy goes into slow-motion, you get a chance to press the right button to defend yourself. Succeed and you get less damage, fail and you get more damage. On the third turn of the battle you unlock your costume's special abilities. And last, but not least, you can augment your costumes to enhance your performance in battle or cause status effects to your enemies by battle stamps, which you can purchase. Candy is the currency in the game.  Story: The story is simple, but fun. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, it's pretty much a child's fantasy turned into a game. You have to fight monsters, your Halloween costumes give you super powers and you get to save the world. There's not really much to tell in this part.  Sound: Same as with the story, the music is simple, but it works. It's not the type of soundtrack that starts to get annoying after a while and it does give you the proper atmosphere for the game.  Style: The game has a very colourful appearance and you'll see this in-game as well. From the small houses in the comfy neighbourhood to the big, shiny, blasting super costumes, everything just screams fantasy.   Total: If you're looking for a fun game and you don't mind a bit of repetitive combat, a simple story with a rich fantasy style attached and you can miss a few bucks/ euros, then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're looking for a game with engaging gameplay, a rich story, a good challenge, this game won't be for you.  Personal: I recommend it, I liked it, finally got around to finish it shortly before writing this review. A thumbs up from me.
7197	1	a	great game for any age and lots of fun
7199	1	a	There's almost nothing to it, but it's still a terrific game. Funny, well written, looks great and I'm glad the option for a female protagonist is present. Someday in the future around October I'll *make* my kid play this.
7201	1	a	Very quirky, but it plays really cool. Pretty casual, but the fights need to be done with good timing on button pressings.
7203	1	a	Easy to play, made me laugh, and helped me to introduce a friend to the RPG genre!
7205	1	a	very cute and enjoyable game. exactly the type of quirky fun I've come to expect from double fine. The combat is simple and satisfying, the art style / atmosphere are excellent. There's plenty of humor sprinkled throughout the game that reminds you what it's like to be a kid again and just go trick-or-treating.  and for anyone concerned, i used an xbox controller and the game fully detects / supports it as far as i can tell, i played through the entire game + DLC without a single issue.
7207	1	a	THIS LITTLE GAME IS SO CLEVER! I first played this when I was a young one, and now playing it again I've realized how many little jokes there are. Gameplay is very simple and fun, I love the game's graphic style, it's kid friendly, and really cheap when it's on sale. Can't wait to play the sequel, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!
7209	1	a	  Excellent little game had a lot of fun playing it most enjoyable.
1092	0	a	I liked the concept of the game. Different costumes gives you different tactical experience in battles, but Costume Quest is so boring that I can't recommend it.
1093	0	a	Fun at first but then becomes very repetitive. The game isn't all bad it deffinitly gets points for style and writing. If there was a little more depth and less repetitive this could be a better game. Stopped playing when I realized I was doing the same thing over and over.
7211	1	a	Sweet as candy!
7213	1	a	Mario &amp; Luigi rpg's meets Double Fine. Is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good mayne.
7215	1	a	Simple and fun. Was a great laid back game to play, also SWEET A** B**CHIN' AS HELL RAINBOW MOTHER-EFFIN' UUUUNICORNS!!!! YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHh!!!!
7217	1	a	I loved the game. A bit repetetive but really well made and funny :)
7219	1	a	This games got costumes, quests, monsters, and candy. What more do you need? This is truly a fine game, Double Fine infact.
7221	1	a	Fun game. .... Ok, fine, here's more about it. In this game, you pick either a brother or a sister. You fight enemys that stole your brother or sister. Transforming costumes are involved. Threads the line of silly and dramatic
7223	1	a	Best game in my library tbh
7225	1	a	    What better way to spend a few hours than pummeling monsters as a giant rainbow unicorn?      Costume Quest is a fun, youthful, and humorous adventure that utilizes overworld exploration, puzzle solving, and a simple turn-based combat system. I would recomend it to children, people looking for a not-scary halloween game, and anyone who would like to nostagically relearn some of the magic of halloween.  This game does a lot of things well and a few things not so well.    Good Stuff:
7227	1	a	A fun game, despite itself.  The combat is boring, the quests are repetitive. You will only end up using a few of the costumes once you've figured out a good build...  But darn it! This game is just too charming! I want to hate it! But it is just so loveable!  So, my recommendation: Buy it on sale. (Last sale it sold for $0.99)  
7229	1	a	Costume Quest is hillarious!  + Good story (Halloween themed) + Adorable game design  + Funny dialogues and scenes + Awesome battlemode i(It reminded me of the classic Final Fantasy ganes I-IX)  Truely a hidden gem and can be recommended for any RPG enthuasist or just someone looking for some entertainment for the weekend!
7231	1	a	A simple and short game but one that was extremely fun!
7233	1	a	Adorable, fun, AND addictive. What more could you want from a game?
7235	1	a	fun and entertaining story.  A very good way to kill 5-8 hours.  The battle system is unique, but rather too easy.
7237	1	a	This is a funny and adorable story, its a must play on Halloween, the game is simple but fun to play.  10/10
7239	1	a	A great RPG made with the iconic style and humor of Double Fine. If you enjoyed Psychonauts and also have a soft spot for turn based battles, then this is the game for you.  For a more in-depth review, visit  http://fovgames.com/2015/11/08/costume-quest/ 
7241	1	a	Not much to say other than â€œThis game is awesomely fun!â€  If you love the classic turn based RPG's and comical adventures, then you will like this game. As the name implies, the game is about costumes. You and your sibbling start out Trick or Treating when these monsters kidnap one of you mistaking you for candy. You must go on a quest to recover your sibbling before the night is over.   The game works on two levels. The first is the main view (or town) where you solve simple puzzles and go door to door Trick or Treating. When you meat a monster you go to the battle level.  In the town you are in a cheaply made costume that looks like a kid made it. The streets have other kids walking around in various costumes and adults that have quests that need completing in order to pass by. Once you have visited all the houses, you are allowed to go to the next part of town.  In the battle section, your characters transform into whatever costume you had on. Each costume has normal attacks, special attacks, stat benefits, and/or a special ability outside combat.  The graphics for this game are in no way realistic. It was designed to look cartoonish. Not saying that the graphics are bad. On the contrary, for the style they went with, they look awesome. The backgrounds are highly detailed, the characters look smooth, the costumes really look like they were pieced together with cardboard and various things around the house.  The combat is probably the only place I would have any complaints with. When you begin, you can only do a normal attack unless you have a â€œbattle stampâ€ that allows a secondary attack. On your third turn you will be allowed a special move. You can use it then or save it for later. The problem is that you have to wait 3 turns to use it again. Additionally, when you go to do your normal attack you have to press the corect sequence or yo will do about 1/2 to 3/4 damage. This is also tru with defending. If you fail to hit the proper button on time you will receive full damage. â€œBattle Stampsâ€ will help with the combat but are limited to 1 per character. This is all there is to the fights. Granted there is a bit of strategy involved with the combat, this is very limiting.   All in all, this was a very fun game and the DLC was also fun. Neither are super long but are very fun to play...
7243	1	a	Great game.
7245	1	a	A bit short for my tastes - finished it in one night, both the main story and the DLC. But the reason for that is that it's a pretty fun game at the core. Collecting costume pieces to get the whole suit calls out to the collector in me.
7247	1	a	Adorable, fun, AND addictive. What more could you want from a game?
7249	1	a	This game is brilliantly nostalgic, combining engaging mechanics with the essence of Halloweens of yesteryear - before sugarphobia, when a bit of duct tape and cardboard could fire a kids' imagination, when All Hallows Eve was a time of innocent play and kids above a certain age were temporarily allowed out of the sight of their parents (who, in that ancient time, lacked the built-in helicopter blades which today eviscerate children's marrow). Relive the magic of days gone by with this game - or, if you are too young to remember that glorious era, discover what you missed.
7251	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game.  
7253	1	a	I was hesitant to buy this game since it looks like a childs game. When it went on sale I bought it on a whim and started playing it. This game has since become awesome in my opinion! It takes the passion and the creativity of a childs mind and personifies it. As a child when we dressed up for halloween we really made ourselves be that character! This is what this game brings in a awesome turn based combat rpg!
7255	1	a	Straight Forward. Simple. Addictively Fun.
7257	1	a	As a fan of Double Fine's earlier efforts, especially Psychonauts, it's no surprise Costume Quest drew my attention with little effort. Given I'm also a fan of costuming and Halloween, this was pretty much an instant sell. Having fully completed the game, I can assure you it did not disappoint.  Right from the get-go, Costume Quest shows efforts to include every possible player, as you can choose to play as either the boy (Reynold) or girl (Wren) of a pair of twins. Soon after the twin you didn't select is kidnapped by monsters for dressing like a delicious-looking candy corn, you meet up with other trick-or-treaters your age that match your level of imagination and your desire to get your sibling back.  Costume Quest feels like an RPG stripped down to its essentials, with timing-centric, turn-based combat and set amounts of spawns in most areas. This, along with the enemies' leveling along with you, eliminates the need for experience grinding. Wiping out everything is still necessary for 100% completion and makes getting costume upgrades and some secrets easier, but you can get by if you stick to story-necessary encounters.  The game itself feels a bit small, area-wise, but there are plenty of tasks in each section to keep your party busy and searching for hidden items and secret costumes. A great balance is struck between backtracking through each section and forward progression, so it rarely, if ever, feels like a slog.  The variety of costumes is also nice, especially their in-combat forms. Due to the children's imaginations, whatever costume they're wearing transforms into a majestic, towering version of its mundane representation, all featuring beautiful animations and unique, often hilarious special attacks. As touched on before, combat is straightforward, with timed button presses coming into play on top of the base mechanics to lessen incoming damage and stack combos with your own attacks.  All in all, Costume Quest is relatively short, super sweet, and great for any time of year. Just remember that a couple of achievements (for the game and for the Grubbins On Ice DLC) are time-associated, so be ready to fire the game back up when more seasonably appropriate. You could just wiggle your PC clock a bit, but that'd be lame.
7259	1	a	I am new to gaming, and I kind of suck at it. I received South Park SoT for PC as a gift, and really enjoyed it, and am now hooked on games. What awesome stress release! I needed a game that was fun to play and attainable for a newbie. This one does the trick. I was able to beat the game and had fun with it too, plus, it helped me gain controller skills. It would be a great game for a kid who is starting into games, or even an adult (of which I am one). I really enjoyed the turn-based combat style that is like South Park, but it wasn't TOO easy. The bosses are challenging, but not impossible. I purchased this game as a package with the 2nd game, and have moved on to that one now. Highly recommend!
7261	1	a	Combat mechanics are a bit bland and collecathon nature of parts of the gameplay aren't my favourite BUT I love everything else about the game. Really happy, joyous little thing.
7263	1	a	Game Mechanics are boring, but if you're looking for abnegation, this is it.
7265	1	a	WHY WOULDN'T YOU BUY THIS GAME  YOU CAN PLAY AS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY  MURRIKA
7267	1	a	This game was a lot of fun. Very clever, pretty funny.
7269	1	a	Costume Quest is a fun, cute game about trick-or-treating and is short in length.   My full review  [mygamebacklogprogress.com] 
7271	1	a	Fantastic gameplay with amusing dialog and entertaining battle that never get stale. Fun costumes keep you wanting to find and collect them all. I highly recommend buying this game!
7273	1	a	If you liked Halloween as a kid, exploration quests and simple combat system, this is a great game. There are actually two games inside one. The keyboard controls take a bit to get used to, although you can remap them. PC gaming pad would work the best. I only wish that everyone decorated their houses for halloween like in Costume Quest!
7275	1	a	Very short game but full of gladness in every moment of playing. Recommended to everyone who loves RPG and Halloween.
7277	1	a	I get to be a robot.
7279	1	a	Fun and beautifull little RPG Worth grabbing if you're an achievementhunter
7281	1	a	One word to describe the whole game : CUTE  Just finished literally a few minutes ago and I LOVED every second of it. Costume Quest is an adorable game about kids on adventure in their Halloween costumes which give them super powers. This is the dream of every little kid (and grown ups) that ever played make-believe.   Plot : really straight-forward. Team up with the neighborhood kids to save your sibling. A classic good vs evil in a comedic way. Grubbin on Ice is like a mini-sequel or a spin-off and it's highly recommended to play it AFTER the main CQ.  Gameplay : I highly recommend using a controller. I can't imagine the battle sequences using a keyboard and mouse, but if you're comfortable with them then maybe it'll work for you. The walking around was a bit tiresome, but worth it.  Quests : all the quests are really well-thought, and a good way to grind, though   you can't get past level 10 for the main CQ and not past level 14 for GOI  .   Puzzles : it's not as frustrating, as long as you're EXTREMELY thorough in searching and walking around.  Graphic : I love the character designs, the monsters, the battle sequences.. The backgorunds are pretty smooth. I didn't enjoy the dark areas, but I generally don't like dark areas in game anyway so I guess it's a matter of preference.  Sound : it's fun and adds up to the atmosphere of going on an adventure.  Characters : I really like how all the characters have names, even the NPCs (though not the monsters). The enemies are not EVIL evil, and as lovable as the protagonists.  I give this as 10/10. Just need one more achievement to fill but that'll have to wait.. literally..  MOVING ON TO CQ2 !!!
7283	1	a	Need a game you can complete in under 10 hours and have fun? Costume Quest fits the bill nicely and it's so sweet and adorable you may get diabetes.   You control a group of trick-or-treaters that gain strength and powers based on the costumes they wear to battle evil candy stealing monsters from another dimension. You roam around the world, looking for candy, collectable cards, pieces of your costumes, and others things on a quest to save your brother or sister (the game changes based on if you play as a boy or girl).   The combat is a turn based affair with your kids gaining a special ability every 3rd turn, that based on their costume will either deal massive damage or heal or protect other teammates. It is very easy to master, and you get even more power-ups with the various stamps you collect. Towards the end game I felt the combat got slightly repetive and boring, maybe too easy for older gamers.   Even though the game is rather short, I can't really call it a negative in this case. If it went on to a 20+ hour game they would have to make a whole lot more additions to every aspect of the game. This tight little bundle of gaming is the perfect length and pacing for its content. Costume Quest is a fun and funny game to play.
7285	1	a	I absolutly love this game. I really hope they come out with another. I would love to see where the story goes from here. The costumes are super cute and the story is awesome. I love how the costumes transform into epic versions for battle. If you haven't played this game you should because you're really missing out!!!
7287	1	a	This is a fabulous but short little game that kept me entertained from start to finish.  My only complaint is that the battle mechanics can be a bit tight, and the game can be somewhat unforgiving due to its lack of an easy ability to grind out levels when youâ€™re up against a hard fight. Unless I just really misunderstood the strategy
7289	1	a	If you like Psychonauts, this is the game for you! Double Fine does a fantastic job creating a world that is funny, full of opportuinities of self-expression and is extremley addciting!
7291	1	a	For some one who doesent really like the RPG genre it's weird that i would put COSTUME QUEST in my top 20 games of all time. But it's True it's a masterpiece i love the halloween setting the quirky humour and characters everything about this game is charming and magical, i have still yet to play through the sequel i need to
7293	1	a	beat this game multiple times still love it, simple, easy, fun!
7295	1	a	Very fun.  The combat is overly simplified. It uses a combination turned-based battle system with QTE boosts. The story is really basic, and explanations are few and far between.  The dialogue is where its at though. The character are very funny, and even the NPCs are good for a laugh or two.
7297	1	a	Quirky little game that my kids enjoyed more than I (I sent them to my consoles and phone to play it so I could play grown-up games like...Long Live The Queen). Has a variety of costumes with different effects, neat combat system, and story is definitely fun.
7299	1	a	Nice little RPG, is short (around 10 hours) and the combat system is very simple, however it has a good setting and some humor.
7301	1	a	This is very good, good plot, good gameplay, good everything. Overall i'd reccomend buying it
7303	1	a	Around Halloween I am always incredibly nostalgic. Every year I go back and watch the most childish of Halloween programs to relive some of the feelings. Costume Quest brings those emotions up! It's a fun, little game that will instantly take you back to being a kid on Halloween night.   It is a short and childish game; however, I think it's a solid,little adventure RPG. If you like having feelings of nostalgia or you want something to share with young Halloween fans in your home, this game is a treat. (And that's no trick.)
7305	1	a	Pretty good game, well...according to the reviews. I never actually played this game. I forgot about it and just let it run for 100+ hours.
7307	1	a	Costume Quest and it's sequel are colorful rpgs, with the usual mechanics. Press - here and such. However, they also have a sense of humor (And as always humor is subjective) The games are generally fun to play, the writing is funny, but there are a few reundancies in the script, as well as some sloppy writing. But that will only bother you a little (Or not at all if you're not a person particularly attached to grammar, and spelling. (I didn't notice any spelling issues)) The designs of the costumes, and of the in-fight character designs are pretty cool, though out of battle the costumes' design is more cute than anything else. The control scheme is a little difficult compared to console versions, but not so much so that it ruins the game. (Unless you have bad arthritis, than get a controller.) I got these games for a two for one sale for a dollar ninety-nine. Frankly, I think that this is terrible. These games aren't bargain bin garbage, they truly are worth playing.  Mechanics: Pretty much the usual, costumes offer new methods of traversal. -+  Graphics: Cartoony, but generally this improves the game. +  Story: Written with humor, and generally enjoyable. Although, there were times where the script could've been refined, I quite enjoyed the story as a whole. +  Gameplay: It was quite fun to play, maybe a little tedious if you can't find all of the houses, but this didn't bother me. + (That said this is the second game I ever fully completed, more commonly phrased as one hundred percenting)  Controls: A little difficult to use, compared to console versions, but this doesn't ruin the game. And you could always get a controller. -  Miscellaneous: The game was cute. But not overly cutesy, so you would have to punch a bear to get your manhood back after playing it.
7309	1	a	Love it! Childish, but fun. You have to defeat 'real' monsters using your halloween costumes.
7311	1	a	This is one of my favourite games since joining steam.
7313	1	a	Charming game. Very simple combat. It's a short game, about 6 hours. If the combat was more complex then the game could sustain a longer journey. Fun for a Halloween night.
7315	1	a	I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after. If you're wanting a mature in-depth game with vast arrays of landscapes, character development and difficulty this is NOT the game for you. This game is more of a kooky sweet family-friendly game to pass time with.  I'm a bit of a completionist and so I found this a fun simple game for completing the cute quests and unlocking the different outfits- it's not particularly difficult/complex but it can keep you engaged for a good 5-15 hours. I'd recommend it for when it's on sale at about $5-$10 as a cute game to whittle some time away with- but it's not something I'd want to pay $15+ for (as there are other more in-depth engaging titles for around that price instead).  People have complained that it involves childish jokes; however, to me it was no more childish than some of the original Dragon Quest games and so if you can put up with some of those jokes you can easily put up with (or even appreciate) these ones.  I found the premises of the game (go door knocking at houses, fight monsters, collect candy, unlock outfits to progress further through), unique enough. It is somewhat repetitive, however I feel that they've balanced this by making the game a short one with three parts taking place in three different areas. To me the game length is perfect - you wouldn't want it to be much longer as you'd get bored of the lack of variety but it has enough different elements to keep you entertained for the length of the game. I'm someone who really likes playing side-quests and mini-games so I appreciated the card collecting, bobbing for apples, finding the hidden children quests, etc they had. And I appreciated playing Grubbins on Ice as whilst you could see it was made off of the same kind of gameplay ideas it was different enough to keep my interest.  I thought the battle graphics were endearingly sweet- although it does involve turn based combat and unskippable animations which may frustrate some players. So- if family friendly games aren't your thing I'd recommend skipping this game. If you're after something short, sweet, unique and like mini-games then this might be the game for you.  But if you're really not sure if it's your kind of game maybe watch a bit of a playthrough or a few cut scenes on the community board. I did like this game, I would recommend it, but I'm also wanting to write this review so that those who wouldn't find it appealing can be more likely to leave it alone and not come here complaining about having 'wasted their money on a kids game'.
7317	1	a	This is a really silly and charming little game aimed mainly at kids, but just as fun for an adult. It's easy and relaxing, perfect for playing while home in bed sick - or if you just want a change of pace - since it doesn't make too many demands of the player besides some simple quicktime responses, and doesn't drag out with too much grinding or pointless sidetracks.  The humor is a bit klichÃ©-USA, but if you don't take things too seriously the warmth of Costume Quest gives it definite replay value, especially around the later parts of the year. Both this game and its sequel are worth a chance!
7319	1	a	Cute game plus you can turn into a UNICORN and NAIL someone with your horn :) or turn into a robot its really a cute game the storyline is pretty good too for a game under a gig. I'd rec this to any casual gamer
7321	1	a	A simple turn based RPG that has barely any depth, except there is a charm to the game that keeps you playing.
7323	1	a	this Games is so Cute and with a very cool mechanic the costumes are really cute and cool.
7325	1	a	Cute and cuddly
7327	1	a	  Very Fun casual game, was really surprised how much fun it would be, behind all the kids graphics, it's a good paced action. The characters are also really interesting, without any vocal voices, but subtitles
7329	1	a	Great little game for the holiday season. cute and quirky. i enjoy the graphics and gameplay. complete with a unqiue battle system. tons of laughs for me and my little ones. good win for pc for family.
7331	1	a	Short but sweet game coming from the creative mind of Tim Schafer, who is best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts and The Secret of Monkey Island. This game is a perfect play for Halloween (and the grubbins on ice during the holiday seasons). This turn based RPG is good for all ages. During the 6 to 7 hour game you go on a quest to save your brother/sister that has been mistaken for candy by monsters. The only way you can save him/her is to go around town trick or treating, getting candy and build costumes.
7333	1	a	Every Halloween
7335	1	a	Darla just needs a hug and you win the game.
7337	1	a	One of the cutest and funniest games ever made! Keep 'em coming Double Fine!
7339	1	a	A cute, funny, dorky game about Halloween (objectively the best holiday). The dialouge and interactions with npcs alone were worth it.
7341	1	a	This is a great game for newcomers and veterans alike. I think it is a great twist on a concept that we all know as kids, both trick-or-treating and the wild imagination of children.
7343	1	a	I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after.

7345	1	a	Costume Quest is a really nice little RPG based around halloween with the costumes each having unique powers which are required for both combat and to advance through the games levels. Like most other Double Fine games i've seen the graphics are cute, cartoon-style and well suited to the atmosphere. Gameplay isn't particularly challenging but it is enjoyable, if you are struggling at any point then you have most likely missed some upgrade or other.
7347	1	a	great story with an awesome RPG-like fighting style
7349	1	a	This is a game I would honestly play and do play whether or not it's halloween.
7351	1	a	Great little game for the holiday season. cute and quirky. i enjoy the graphics and gameplay. complete with a unqiue battle system. tons of laughs for me and my little ones. good win for pc for family.
7353	1	a	A light hearted but worth while play.
7355	1	a	 This is the best game I have ever played!
1096	0	a	Get the uncut version on Adventure Gamers instead. Steam should tell people before they buy if their games are censored.
7357	1	a	The best adventure since Blade Runner for me. You do not use your mouse to check every pixel for that one thing you miss. Instead you have to decide how to talk to people, what to mention, what to hide, how to proceed. You don't have to find *the* right solution. You find *your* solution. I got hooked by this one.
7359	1	a	'The best adventure since Blade Runner for me.' Gotta agree with this guy. This game is amazing. Great story (based on a book, if I recall correctly), nice characters, interesting puzzles, multiple endings (based on our choices). World Union (where the game takes place) reminds me a lot of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.   As for the graphics, for a game that old I don't even think they're bad. Just a warning: see those black bars on the screenshots? Game doesn't run in widescreen. But the story is so amazing that, believe me, you won't even remember that after playing it for 30 minutes  If you're a fan of adventure games and a good, solid sci-fi story, give this game a chance. I don't think you'll regret it  For those wondering about those merely 4.4 hour of gameplay on my profile, Steam version is cut (it lacks a few sex scenes, like Fahrenheit), so I grabbed the full version elsewhere, and that's the one I've been playing
7361	1	a	Public Notice: I made an uncut patch for Steam (the original uncut version is no longer available for sale) which adds full subtitles, decensors the game and has bonuses, here:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697262043   My playtime is low even though I finished the game because I played using the uncut version executable.  Now the review: Culpa Innata is a fantastic and quite unique adventure game, it does a lot of things most games don't and really deserves your time and money.  Many adventure games are set in criminal investigations but none succeed in actually making you feel like an official investigator going through actual interviews non-sequentially and piecing together the evidence like Culpa Innata. You have a limited amount of time - in the game that translates to the number of people you can interview based on travel time to location - and must choose wisely whom to interview, what to ask and which leads to follow up (and report) in the game's many locations. You also have a well developed private life after the day's investigations in which some other plot threads are explored. The game is non-linear and major reveals therefore happen in a way that is specific to how you chose to advance.  Another great success is the game world in which characters' scripts, motivations and way of life feel very lived-in and set in the new world order established by a subtly totalitarian regime very different from the one we live in. The main character herself sometimes says questionable things as she is an active part of the system up to a point. This does make you as the player explore this world on a deeper level than if you were controlling a detached completely-different-from-everyone protagonist meant to make you empathise with a corrupt society that cannot be accepted. The story is very interesting and while the game suitably ends the main plot there are some secret threads set up for a sequel that hopefully sees the light of day sometime.  For its age, the visuals are great and the facial animation is solid. Faces having an almost photorealistic feel at times due to the way it uses film grain without being excessive. The soundtrack is nice too, fits the mood well. The voice acting is also very good. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or crashes when playing the game (Note: I was using the uncut version patch shared on top of this review).  All in all, a fantastic adventure game I'm glad I played and highly recommend it to you all!
7363	1	a	This is a pretty good futuristic adventure game. While I did play it with a general walkthrough you could definitely finish it without one. The thing I liked most about it is that unlike the old-school adventure games (King's Quest, Space Quest, etc.) you can't really bork your game by not picking something up that you will need 5 hours later. Definitely one that I would recommend to adventure fans, and depending on your patience, a pretty good one for others as well.
7365	1	a	At first glance it is just an ugly adventure game from some unknown Turkish developer. So why is it in my recomendation? Because of that world, which is presented. This isn't game for kids. In fact, it's really grim game full of politics and distopian visions and if you give it a chance, it can definitely surprise you...
7367	1	a	Strengths: - interesting storyline - thought-provoking sci-fi context in which people are in a hierarchy according to their health and wealth and children are brought up in child development centres to prevent 'neurosis' - characters were individuals, voice acting was good - linear gameplay meaning that you can do what you want when you want to do it - your gameplay choices affect outcomes  Weaknesses: - got headaches from squinting at the overly dark scenes - moving Phoenix around was sometimes difficult - graphics look poor due to the age of the game 
7369	1	a	Open-ended detective drama about a libertarian dystopia. Some of the puzzles are awful, but it's one of the most unique adventure games you'll ever find.
7371	1	a	Great adventure game. Perfect storyline and characters. Graphics are a bit outdated but if you're really an adventure game fan, you probably would not care for that. 
7373	1	a	This was a really fun and interesting game - the main character's naive dialogue and British accent makes the game. It was really fun. If you've played the Nancy Drew games from HER interactive - it's very similar to that, but it's third-person and takes place in a future. Save often and interact with your makeup kit when you're pressed for leads.  There were a few annoyances, however. -clunky gameplay. While your curser usually becomes a hand when hovering over interactive items, items sometime have a small soft spot so it's hard to tell what exactly you can and can't interact with. Also, when moving between screens, sometimes you aren't in the exact spot to move so you're effectively stuck on one screen until you can get your character to activate the next screen. -while on the topic, the graphics are reminiscent of older Tomb Raider games. If you can't handle older graphics, take a pass at this game. -confusing passage of time. The game itself will tell you your location and the current time when arriving at a new destination, but you don't have a clock or anything telling you how long you're at a location - sometimes you can visit three people in a day, other times you don't have enough time. But this was a minor inconvience - at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how long it takes you :) I ended up beating the game twenty days into the investigation.  -Sometimes it is hella confusing what you're supposed to be doing. There's no small map telling you where you can go, but your character is good at being like 'nope I don't want to go there.' Diary prompts can give you some idea of what to do. Definitely glance through a UPS-Hints walkthrough to give you a better idea of what to do. -Dialogue. When asking questions, a small prompt gives you a small glimpse of what your character will say, but it can be hard to steer the conversation where you want it to go.  All in all, it has a few annoyances, but a kick-butt female lead character who is charming in her own right makes the game totally worth it. I ended with a 93 HDI, Nix would be so envious ;)
7375	1	a	pros  - story is intriguing and well written. you re investigating a russian immigrant's murder and conspirancy behind it and you re also talking and get information from many interesting characters about victim. game s story very similar Demolition Man's (1993) story.  - characters have very realistic facial animation. developers did pretty good job.  - good puzzle variety. they are not so difficult or easy.  - realistic and sympathetic main and side characters. protagonist has a daily social life and close friend for gossip. she s not just a robotic game character.  - good sci fi atmosphere.  - it s an very long game (uncut version)   cons  - game's graphics dated  - gameplay turn out to be repetetive after a while. you re doing mostly goes around and talking to everyone about victim's private life.  - game s non linear. some people may think this is good but i found very confusing.  - voice acting hit or miss.  -controls and camera angles little bit clanky. you ll have trouble moving on the corridors while playing in door areas.  - ending that leaves a lot of questions unanswered about story.
7377	1	a	After finishing my first playthrough, I wanted more! Would've definitely played the sequel if there was one (for real, what a bummer it was to find out the follow up just died in production).  The game has many good points, as long as your expectations are reasonable. The setting and story might seem a little lack-luster, but that's only because it was supposed to be something of a introduction into this world. Still, the plot is juicy enough to keep you invested, and the characters within quite enjoyable. Sometimes you want to interact 'incorrectly' with them just to hear what they say next.  Another plus for me was the difficulty level of the puzzles. Some of them were quite tricky, and I admit to looking up a few pointers online, but not frustrating enough to make me stop playing. There was a genuine sense of satisfaction that I got when figuring things out that triggers even more interesting facts and possible scenarios in the game. Being a detective in this quirky but cool Sci-Fi world is actually fun! Who knew?
1099	0	a	after up grading my computor to window 10 this game just flickers and Steam is unwilling to refund or help with this issue. do not get this game if you are up grading your computor to windows 10!!!
1100	0	a	Great story background but with a very slow and unsatisfying progression. Amazingly long dialogues, most of them useless, minor gameplay issues and technically way below average.
1101	0	a	It doesnt seem a bad game but, looks and feel really odd. Too odd for nowadays.
1102	0	a	A conspiracy theorist's wet dream. Your worst nightmare.  Charming debut vibe though.
1103	0	a	for a mystery adventure game it was boring coridors were two long everything was too far away from each other and you spend more time walking and running half the time in circles rather than solveing the case only those who the patiance of a saint can put up with this game personal rating 1/10 and thats being generous
7379	1	a	An extremely interesting game. I definitely recommend. Too bad the planned sequel was scrapped.
7381	1	a	This game is different. Although it is a dated game, the visuals are good and the story is excellent. Is there some truth in this? Can it be possible that the world will become like this?  Just play the game. ;-)
1136	0	a	It doesn't actually work. Don't buy.
7383	1	a	So bought this game years ago for a buck or something like that. I gotta say it's pretty sweet. I don't have any of the bugs other users reported, game is fluent and i can play for hours without a crash what so ever. It is only one table yeah, but you get to choose between four characters if you will and therefor you get some different objectives during the game.  For the price i bought it for it is defenitely a good game and like every good Pinball game a real timekiller.
1137	0	a	This game is fun. But the controls do not make sense. Like if you have Windows 8 the windows button if you press that it will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. Plus this game is horrible I don't even know why i won this I should've let someone else win it You'll press each single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing key.
1138	0	a	It bugs... Nice...
1139	0	a	Picked this on up a while ago on the cheap. Havenâ€™t had any trouble running it (Win7 64bit) but is pretty underwhelming compared to some other pinball games. You might say they're going for an old school look and feel, but it doesnâ€™t quite get there and just feels cheap. 
1140	0	a	Just DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ...........Stay away from it
1141	0	a	What the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥???
7385	1	a	One of the few pinball games on Steam (might be the only). Luckily, It's a great game! I am pretty critical of pinball games and this one delivers. For an extra treat look for the youtube video of this game and the smashed keyboards from people playing this game to death.
1142	0	a	A very poor table.
7387	1	a	I love slamit pinball. You can play the game two ways. First time you go up a colored ramp you are picking that side to play for. Either cop or robber. The table took some slight adjustments in the editor till it was the angle I am comfortable with but after that it is a very deep game when it comes to unlocking the vault and breaking into the bank. The safe combo has sweet effects to it too and multiball gets nuts. Great table for the price.
1143	0	a	Game runs slow and choppy on my high end system. Total fail in my book. Give it a pass.
1144	0	a	Steam hasn't addressed the fact that this game will not play on Windows 7 or Windows 8. There is no support for it. The home page for the game goes to a Japanese 404 site.  YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY IF YOU BUY THIS GAME! SHAME ON YOU STEAM FOR SELLING IT!
1145	0	a	I have never been able to get this game to work on any of the systems I have tried (desktop or laptop). I was really looking forward to a 'realistic' pinball game that simulates a physical machine. Fortunately, I probably bought this for a significant discount. I don't know why/how I did not look at the reviews before buying this.
7389	1	a	The tables look great, but the ball physics are bizarre. The game seems to run fine, but the ball shakes ansd seems weightless.  Wouldn't even recommend to try even out of curiosity.
1146	0	a	Avoid this game, still has a lot of bugs some of which make the game unplayable. Company has gone out of business so don't expect any patches.  Feel free to flag this game as broken (click the icon near the Metacritic score)
7391	1	a	Works great/smooth for me on Windows 10 64-bit in 1980 by 1080, albeit I am using a Radeon HD R9-390 video which runs everything.  Played multiple games no crashes.  Read that it's a dead title because the main programmer was killed in a car accident in 2010.  RIP   This thumbs up for you!  I enjoyed the table, not pinball snob though.  
7393	1	a	Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords is an addicting puzzle game with an added roleplaying element. The title was developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Namco Networks America. Anyone who has played Tetris, Bejewelled or any similiar game will be quite familiar with the puzzle portion of this fantastic title but for me, as a heavy R.P.G. fan, it was this part of the game that really makes it stand apart from the others in the genre.   As in the start of a typical roleplaying game you select your character and class before the terrific story sends you traveling across a vast fantasy world in search of quests, battles and loot. I found the story to be extremely compelling and at times humorous. It definitely keeps your attention and makes you want to wander about and converse with any person or beast that would cross your path. The combat, of course, takes place in puzzle format and tasks you with matching pairs of colored gems, skulls and other items while casting spells as well as a variety of other attacks and moves against your opponent. As you battle you earn experience points which you can spend upgrading your skills as well as accquiring gold and loot with which you can better outfit your character. You also have the option to capture opponents and hold them in your dungeon. You can then learn new spells and combat tactics from your prisoners as well as use the captured beasts as mounts as you traverse the world.   The game is presented very well with a combination of fantastic hand drawn manga-like art for the cut scenes as well as an old school top down 'Legend Of Zelda' like world map. Shockingly one of the best parts of the game in my opinion is the music. I can't stress how great the soundtrack is in this title as it expertly captures the fantasy theme of the game. I fell in love with it after just a few days of playing the title. The sound effects during the puzzle battles are terrific as well. You never get tired of hearing the explosions, coin drops and other tell-tale effects when you successfully connect a line of gems and cause a cascade that devastates your opponent bringing them to their knees in defeat...absolutely priceless. I never thought I would be a fan of puzzle games but the Puzzle Quest series has, no pun intended, cast a spell on me. Highly recommended! I think I like this one better than Puzzle Quest 2 which I adore.
7395	1	a	Simple game with a simple premise, line up the gems (Think Bejeweled) However it adds a whole new twist through an RPG element introducing a new level of strategy. (Do you line up skulls to do damage, or certain colors to get the mana you need, or to deny your opponent the mana they need?) Didn't look like it would be fun, but its amazingly addictive and provided me far more hours of entertainment than I would have anticipated.
7397	1	a	Great little game. I originally played it on the Nintendo DS, and it was so good I bought it for PC.  It is best played on a touchscreen.  Best one of the series. Avoid all the other versions, as they are HELLA boring!
7399	1	a	Once you start playing you are sucked in. One of the best matching games ever made. A unique and fun game that crosses RPG and matching elements very well. The story is also interesting. 9.5/10
7401	1	a	I was planning to do stuff this weekend, but apparently I played 22 hours of Puzzle Quest in two days.  ...okay okay fine, I'll write about the actual game.  There are 4 classes, each have their different set of default spells, and you learn spells as you level up. This is an RPG after all, albeit a linear one - with quite a lot of sidequests and the main quest is lengthy, my game play time at the moment is pretty much an indicator of a single playthrough, which was ~36 hours.  So what's the quirk of this game? The battle system. The battle system is based on Bejeweled, and as you match pieces, you get mana, gold, exp or deal direct damage. With mana, you can cast spells. And if you put 4 in a row or stun the enemy or the like, you can get extra turns and it can get quite crazy if you have a Frozen Rod, have 1% chance of stun for each of your blue mana (so with 41 blue mana you have 41% chance of stun on every instance of dealing damage), and some other stuff. As you can tell, there are items that manipulate the gameplay on both your side and the enemy's.  You can also capture monsters and use them as a mount (and gain an extra stat based on their level and get an extra skill to use in combat), or you can research their spells. You can also craft your own items with runes you can collect. Each of these uses a system that is a variation on the base battle system.  VERDICT: If you like strategic gameplay and you're oddly addicted to Match-3 puzzle games, and enjoy a decent (even if not the most unique nor the most complicated) story, and decent music, then this is definitely a good game. It really depends on whether you enjoy the combat or not: because you'll do a LOT of it in this game. But hey, I enjoyed it.
7403	1	a	I've bought and started playing this game like 3-4 years ago and then abandoned it until recently. It was something new and fresh in the field of 'match 3 gems' games. It had story, fantasy background, skills, spells. And then it got even overwhelming. Too many stuff to know, handle. Too many side quests, too many spells, skills, items, town management, mounts, followers, etc. Yeah, you didn't have to do all, but if you wanted to be good and fight even more powerful foes, you had to improve on all fields. So i've got tired and didn't want to launch it again. Even more annoying thing was, that while traveling through a huge map of a world you didn't only had to confront creatures tied to the quests, but on those paths between towns and towers there were same creatures and they were constantly randomly respawning. So if you wanted to go across the map to solve some quest, you had to fight them over and over again and then on your way back.. It became boring and frustrating very fast.  But after completing Gyromancer and not liking it much i've decided to give this another try and finish a story. So i did. Though the last boss was haaaard. And i had to go to the map and grind for more experience, doing every side quest i could and improving skills, getting better items, etc. And finally i've beat him!  The story was fine. Mechanics are interesting. So i give it a Yes, but i won't be getting back to it, and i hear that sequel is even more boredom and grinding without a decent story, so i'll probably pass.
7405	1	a	A true classic game that has never really been improved upon though many games have tried. A very good blending of genre. Its getting pretty old but holds up to the test of time very well do to the solid gameplay and mechanics. A 10/10
7407	1	a	I played hundreds of hours of that game on DS. It's one of these games that people generally looked at and passed on, but kept influencing other games until it was recognized as the classic it really is.  If you like match-3 games, this one is the only real choice. It's beautiful, incredibly deep and lasts for ever. A true gem.
7409	1	a	It's basically Bejeweled with RPG elements thrown in. Every colored set of gems is for a different element, and you have to spend these element points to cast spells to damage the enemy. Otherwise you can match 3 skulls and damage the enemy directly.   Winning a combat round gives you experience towards your next level which in turn grants you access to new spells, and gives you some skill points to distribute towards making certain elements more powerful, or to give you an overall boost in the game. You also have equipment that adds certain effects such as reducing the amount of damage you take, increasing the damage you can do, or even reducing a certain element from your enemy when you fulfill certain conditions.   In a way the game reminds me a lot of 'Gyromancer' except you do the matches directly instead of doing the 'bejeweled twist' style matches. The only thing not 'bejeweled' about this game is that there are no special exploding gems created for doing complex matches. You do get a free turn if you match 4 in a row, and if you match 5 in a row you get a free turn + a wildcard piece added to the board.  There's also some gold pieces to match for more money, and 'purple stars' for experience. In addition, certain stats increase the likelihood of these non-element matches giving you a free turn, so sometimes it's worth giving it a shot even if you'd rather be collecting the elemental pieces (red, green, blue, and yellow).  The music is decent, the graphics are kinda flat but it does the job, and the story is.... there. I mean, so far it hasn't added that much extra to the game but it's not cheezy either. If you're a fan of Bejeweled and puzzle games it's worth checking out. If you're dying for some real action or deep strategy, you should probably look elsewhere though.
7411	1	a	A truly addicting and stimulating game that sucks you in the moment you start playing. Good RPG elements with an interesting story, giving the player the opportunity to choose whether to be 'good' or less so. My only complaint is that the expansion pack isn't available for the PC version, withholding 4 additional classes (available on the PS3. Yes, I have this game on multiple platforms, it's THAT good.)
7413	1	a	You like bejeweled? That's it, with a story, and a grinding approach. But MAN is it long! Never reached the end so far, after tens of hours! I wonder when I will start the second one... It is a nice little game, nothing more. Smartphone game like. Do recommend.
7415	1	a	Essentially RPG title with lots of things going on, there's even ability to craft gear or you can besiege cities to get tithes from them. Enemies can be captured for mounts or to learn new abilities/spells from them that are not available to your selected class (a mount comes with an ability of its own, too). And of course besides the main quest to get rid of Big Evil you get plenty of side quests, helpful companions, and there's even some gossip in taverns to enrich the lore.  Except the core game mechanic of resolving any kind of challenge that pops up is... a puzzle game of the type 'match 3+ pieces in a line', possibly best known from Bejewelled.  During standard combat you go in turns with your enemy, gathering different pieces for mana and executing special moves if you have enough, or there's a type of piece to deal direct damage (skulls). Some challenges slightly differ, like training mounts has time limit for turns, capturing enemies is a static puzzle to clear up the whole board, and learning spells is about matching enough different pieces (sadly for the latter it's a failure when you're out of moves, so the hard spells are pretty much impossible to learn from captives or at least not really worth it).  This mashup works pretty well and is quite addictive, you always want to have just one more battle to advance the story and maybe okay just one more... and the time flies.  Game has some balancing issues though, designers maybe get a bit carried away and some choices of gear/mounts/spells are clearly superior than others, whereas some even work against you if you use them. But of course you don't have to play with a min-maxer attitude for one, and secondly it doesn't really impact the game just makes it bit less complex than you'd think if you decide to ignore most of the choices. But you still have to get to proper levels to use some, and figuring out the real deal is part of fun too :]
7417	1	a	Great game, I've spent lots of hours playing it. The RPG mechanics make it my favorite match three game. Helps time go by faster. 10/10
7419	1	a	Why people play Candy Crush in a world where this classic exists is beyond me.
7421	1	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!   Your grades will suffer. Your friends will disappear. You'll forget to eat, then ultimately DIE.  If you're willing to risk the above then go ahead, GET THIS GAME!
7423	1	a	OK, so this one is a true story. When I was younger, I had an affair with a married woman. She was late forties, and I was not yet twenty, and oh, man, was she hot. She made Mrs Robinson look like a hippo and made Marie Curie look like a dowdy housewife. She taught me so much, not just about sex, you understand, but about EVERYTHING. She had such verve, and she wanted it all - nothing stood in her way, and if she wanted something, she just took it. That wasn't even her best feature, that was her insatable curiousity. Once she got into something, she got into it and didn't rest until she worked everything out about it. 'Course I realised I wouldn't have her for long, but that was just about the best time of my life   One thing'll always remind me of her. And yes, it's a sex story. Well she liked to live a little dangerously, let's say. She rarely wore knickers, like, ever and nowhere was too risky for a quick one, shall we say. Anyway, we were shagging in her family home, and her husband was due home in about 10 minutes. Needless to say, we went a bit 'overtime' and we were barely finished when in walks her husband. I was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ myself of course, but she just purred - and she really purred - 'Doesn't matter, keep going'. Well, what could I do? I kept going.  When we finished I was really wary about how to make a dignifed exit. Turns out, I didn't need to worry. I should have expected it, but her husband was a beaten man. His expression was blank and empty, and his whole posture just seemed to say oh, another affair? Well, I shoulda guessed a perfect tigress like his wife wouldn't settle with just me. I mean, I don't have self-esteem issues, but she was just something else. So as I walked out, head held high thinking I was just really amazing, like I just invested sex and all, and brimming with afterglow and he said some words to me. Words I'll never forget.  He said 'Puzzle Quest is a pretty amazing mash-up of match 3 and RPG, shame we never got the DLC the consoles did though'. And you know what? He was right. But I had just banged his wife, so, y'know, I win.
7425	1	a	One of my favorite puzzle games. Back when the PSP first came out, this is mainly all I played. Ridiculously hard at some points, but the colors are art will make you happy on the inside.
7427	1	a	if u like connect 4 then this gme if for u
7429	1	a	Take a classic puzzle game (think Bejeweled), add RPG elements and a plot progression where all battles are carried out through that puzzle sequence where both players alternate while sharing the board, and you've got the general idea of what Puzzle Quest is.  Puzzle Quest is a silly wrapper around the puzzle game which ends up strangely compelling - you get special abilities your character can use which use 'mana' depending on which colored jewels you combine. You collect experience and money by matching those, and deal damage to your opponent via lining up skulls. Victory is defeating your enemy before your own health runs out. It manages to take an already addictive formula and make it even more addictive.  I was first exposed to this game via the Nintendo DS game, and honestly think that the game is more suited to a mobile platform than to the PC, but the game is still a lot of fun here. Check it out if you haven't.
7431	1	a	Do you enjoy puzzle games, but also like action/adventure? If you have an eclectic taste like me, then this game is for you! Create your own fantasy character, then venture out into the world, battling monsters by matching-3-or-more to directly attack, gather gold and experience, or gain mana to cast different spells and abilites that can even change the boards and turn the tide of battle!
7433	1	a	awesome mix of puzzle and RPG. storyline is good. reccomend if u like games like candy crush and final fantasy, this is a best of both worlds.
7435	1	a	Ah yes, the classic match 3 puzzle game. There's a lot i liked about this, but... holy hell, I didn't expect such a massive amount of grinding in a puzzle game!  Just about anything you want to do involves the puzzle grid. Want to make an item? Battle. Want to research a spell? Battle. Wander around the world map? Battle. Talk to a person who only says 'who are you?' Battle.   My first game completion showed 300 games won. Considering some matches can last 10 minutes, this gets old painfully quickly. Whereas Might and Magic Clash of Heroes felt short on battles, this game is the exact opposite. It really is obnoxous, especially when some quests will perpetually throw battles at you until you decide a different option. It almost sickens me to think that there's a bunch of other character classes I have yet to complete.  As the game goes on, you'll swear that the computer cheats. It almost always does an optimal move, and it finds ways to crank up its mana in few turns. Fortunately you can also become pretty godly, but it takes a long while to reach that point.  Annoyingly, most of the enemies scale to your own level. This basically means you aren't getting stronger, if your enemies are keeping up with you.  Note that there is an expansion available on the Steam forums for the game. Since the original company basically no longer supports the game, you can grab it for free.  Overall, fun at times, frustrating in many others. I'll give it a 8/10. It certainly kept me busy, and one day if I'm bored I'll probably revisit it for the hell of it.
7437	1	a	Good game to pass the time away,a must have if you like this sort of game:)
7439	1	a	The greatest puzzle is who the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ would buy this?
7441	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THIS CHEATING GAME. I LOVE IT.
7443	1	a	Incredibly tough at times, but as interesting as it is intense. To those who want some casual fun, stay away, but to those who want a challenge and are willing to be patient, it's addictive fun.
7445	1	a	Much like Final Fantasy, they keep trying to remake PuzzleQuest, but they just cant make a better puzzle game. This is the Bejeweled version of D&amp;D (Baldur's Gate) with a Final Fantasy Tactics inspired storyline (FFT was the best FF related game you didnt play other than Ehrgeiz ;). My second time buying this game and sixth time playing it through. (A+) 10/10 Killed Lord Bane in three moves, WOULD CRUSH DEMI-GODS AGAIN.   Ironiocly the fact that PuzzleQuest: Warlords is almost abandoned is a good thing. It isn't greedware spamming, intentionally trying to get you addicted or advertising anything. Its a relaxing casual game that will both challange and fustrate you in all the right ways. You can play this game for six months on one character campaign, and you still will be willing to play through a second time.   There are six Puzzle games by Infinite Interactive. This is still their best one. There is an X-pac (Revenge of the Plague Lord) currently not available on Steam at the time of this post, but there is a PC mod for it out there somewhere. Firemint now owns PQ so don't expect it to go on sale anytime soon and marval made its own version which is considered the best version since this one, but SCREW THAT GREEDY TEEN-POP NOISE.
7447	1	a	Great mix of 'Match 3' game and RPG.
7449	1	a	My absolute favorite puzzle game of all time. Deep, addictive, fun, absolute must buy.
7451	1	a	love it a good game just feels like game is cheating sometimes :P
7453	1	a	Probably the best entry in the Puzzle Quest series. This one also happens to be the first. I will also note, that at the time of this review I only have 5 hours of gameplay, however have played the first Puzzle Quest on numerous platforms.  I has been ported many times, and has not suffered at all from it.   The game blends classic RPG elements like leveling, stat building, parties, main and side quests, shops with items and more with a simple match-3 puzzle game concept. It executes it very well.   The colored gems represent mana, aside from the purple stars and stack of coins which yield experience and gold upon matching. There are also skulls to match that damage your enemy. In puzzle quest your objective is to damage your enemie's health down to zero by either matching skulls or using the mana gained through gems with offensive spells. There are also other types of spells, meant for healing or a form of crowd control so the pace and complexity rises there and can add some fun gameplay and combinations to your moves. There are also the mechanic where if you match more than 3 of anything in one move, you gain an extra turn. The combination of all these makes for exciting, strategic gameplay.  The cons are that the story is rather stale, but this is firstly a puzzle game before anything else and can easily become overlooked. That is the only negative thing I can really come up with. Clever game; good fun. Highly recommended.
7455	1	a	Arguably better than PQ2. Still looks great and is tons of fun, if you like RPGs and puzzle games its a no brainer.
7457	1	a	This game can be extremely fun to play if you can just get over the fact that this game hates you. I don't mean that the game is designed to go against you. I mean the game hates you with a passion. The designers of this game created the first artificial intelligence system designed to mimic the actual emotion of hate. When you are sleeping, the game is plotting your downfall. Other than that, it is insanelly addictive and mimics the Civilization style 'just-one-more-turn'.
7459	1	a	Classic that started the genre. Graphics are dated compared to Gems of War, but the gameplay is still there.
7461	1	a	I love Bejeweling â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to death.
7463	1	a	I like this game so much, but now I have a mac PC, by the way I play this game at iPad &gt;.&lt;
1147	0	a	I give this game a 5 out of 10. It is a good game, fun, interesting, etc. HOWEVER, it would be a great game if the AI did not cheat so much.  It cheats....BLATANTLY... and it is very annoying. So much so that I am almost ready to just not play it again. I understand that some players need the AI to cheat because it is the only way to challenge them.  I don't play for a challenge, I play games to relax and unwind. I DO NOT LIKE TO BE FRUSTRATED OR ANGRY FROM THE GAME.  However, this game cheats so much, so often, and in such obvious ways it really makes you upset when you are playing the game.  Get it on sale, do not pay more than $2 for this game. It is fun, but it is broken.
1148	0	a	The AI will screw you over; this is truth. At times, it will feel like every move you make sets up the AI for a nice, fat combo. Then you'll start analyzing the consequences of each possible move; that's when the AI just matches 3 blocks ANYWHERE, and tells the game to drop whatever it needs to get extra turns/wildcards/4&amp;5 of a kind/skull row (sometimes all of the above in one turn).  This WAS a good idea for an RPG; unfortunately, they screwed the pooch somewhere along the way.
7465	1	a	I hate games of chance/luck. The only games of chance that should be played are games like Poker. At least with Poker you have a chance of making money. With this game you have a 100% chance of losing money, and as a bonus, 100% lost time.
7467	1	a	Best game i have! Awesome Puzzle game with great RPG elements. Hours of fun gameplay, a real winner this one.
1151	0	a	In the beginning, the game feels like a rather fresh and interesting take on a simple puzzle game, inserting RPG systems and a story into it. You might have fun with that. But then it keeps going. And going. And going.  Then the game tells you to collect a dozen mcGuffins to progress further in its story, probably getting a laugh out of you because you think the developers are joking, and a character will reveal that they've already collected most of them.  They are not. And they won't.  Even if you decide to play this game, drop it and don't force yourself to finish it once it becomes repetitive.
7469	1	a	This will ruin Bejeweled for you forever.
7471	1	a	puzzle quest was like lightning in a bottle, the devs have proved they will never make a game this good again
7473	1	a	One of the best games ever made. I probably have hundreds of hours logged on it before I re-purchased it for my steam library.
7475	1	a	Great oldschool RPG Puzzle game. Time waster
7477	1	a	The match three game that started a revolution. RPG and Match 3 what is not to love. Well worth your time.
7479	1	a	Coloured quest of the puzzled gems. Brilliant as the second one.
1152	0	a	Will not launch in Windows 8.1. There's a long thread on the Steam Community Forum of users with the same problem. No solution has been found and no tech support is available.
1153	0	a	The game has some nice music and artworks, a lot of content. Really it could be a really nice puzzle game. It could be. It isn't because the AI: - It cheats in such an obvious way that you'll feel like playing a game with your 3 years old brother. It could be fine if at least it was subtle but it's nowhere near subtle. - It will gimp itself only to ensure that you won't get the mana related to your class.  To keep it short it seems it has been designed with the sole purpose of ruining the fun. Sadly ruining the fun does not increase the difficulty it only ruins the fun.
7481	1	a	i play this sometimes
7483	1	a	Awsome time sink 8/10
7485	1	a	Fun game, took me nearly 50 hours to complete my first run through, including side quests. Lots of replay value, as you can chose to be good or not so good. :P
7487	1	a	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords review    1) Essential - buy it NOW   2) Recommended - buy it on sale
1157	0	a	As a game PuzzleQuest: Challenge of the Warlords falls into the category of 'fun enough' gameplay. There's enough pleasant reward based feedback loops to keep a dude interested. But the story, the dialogue and the art direction are all so bland, so generic, so throw away that I can't /look/ or /read/ anything without wanting to smash my head into the wall. There is not /one/ thing here that hasn't been stolen, cribbed, cannibalized and copy/pasted with no real original input from the developers. I felt like I was playing a simulation of like... a world created by taking ever description of a fantasy realm by Salvatore, Brooks, and Anthony and blended together into the most homogenized word soup before being doled out to the artists and writers with a stern 'Do this' issued with each spoonful. Puzzle games are ubiquitous enough that you can find one just as fun as this deal without having to read the worst that nerds have to offer.
1158	0	a	Was interesting for the first few rounds. But then got ultra annoying because the enemy always gets better gems. Felt massively unfair and frustrating.
7489	1	a	Fun game. Go play Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, instead, though.
1168	0	a	Please just don't waste your money on this game, the overall game play of it is horrid, there is no real functionality to this or anything.
1169	0	a	i can't get this game to install or launch anymore so you probably shouldn't buy it.
1170	0	a	CPU blatantly sets up multiple combos, reducing much of the game to luck.  Not worth $10 at all.
1171	0	a	Kicks me out and forced my computer to restart.
1172	0	a	It's bejewled with a fantasy plot of sorts. If you enjoy that kind of puzzle game, then go for it. I ended up losing my taste for it after so many hours though and never ended up finishing it.
1173	0	a	At first it's really great. If you like Bejeweled you will like this for the addictive gameplay. But every match you play is exactly the same as the last and it gets real boring real fast. I should have spent my money on something better, like a better game or hookers and coke.
1174	0	a	HAHA, YOU PROBLY GET DIS GIFT FROM FREND AND YOURE LIKE 'LOL PUZZEL QUEST? MORE LIKE FAERMVILL CANDY CRASH GAAAAAY LOLOLOL, ID RATHER GO PLAY COD'   BUT WHEN U GET BORED OF PWNING NOOBS (HAHA #REKT AMIRITE? #YOLO) AND U PLAY YOUR GONNA BE LIKE 'WOW SUCH PUZZLE, SO STARTEGY, SUCH RPG TATACTICS' FOR LIEK 3 HOURS   BUT AFTER LIKE TUTORIAL AI ENEMIES WILL CHEAT AND GET WOMBO COMBO INSTA KILL YOU IN 2 TUIRNS OMFG SO OP YOU HAVE TO LIEKE RELY ON YOUR PURE  LUCK  SKILL TO ACTUALY WIN A GAEM, SO STUPID WASTE OF TRASH TIEM Y WOULD I PLAYH A GAME TO LOSE R U STUPID?

1175	0	a	This game has an absuletly great idea. Puzzle solving in a battle style an RPG elements. On top of that it uses the Warlords Franchise, with a graphical assetts and music. One would think this game would onvole a lot of grinding, but gaining lvls does not make that a huge difference, since it is extremely luck based. On top of that the AI cheats. In a very obvious kind of way, which leaves u speecheless. That pritty much sucked out the fun for me. I tried to play this game three times, this time I got the furthest but I cannot bring myself to finish this potentially good game, since I do not like to get cheated on.
1176	0	a	This game cheats.
7491	1	a	Majorly repetitive but many addicted hours of fun!!
7493	1	a	This Puzzle Adventure game can get very addictive; go on quests around the world trying to defeat the big boss and levelling up your hero (different classes available) with awesome gear and spells/skills. Combat is turn-based and makes use of a Bejeweled-like grid, through which you must strategically collect mana points (to cast your spells) and punish your enemy without taking too much damage yourself. Overall, quite entertaining. ****
7495	1	a	Obviously, I really like this game. I have logged 80+ hours. It is a fun little puzzle game similar to Bejeweled but with a decent story line to go with it. If you like puzzle games I highly recommend this, especially since it is decently priced. Worth every penny.
7497	1	a	It can be a bit slow in progression at times but it's a very interesting twist on the match 3 genre, managing to fit in a lot of depth and options that are well worth checking out for puzzle fans.
7499	1	a	Bejewelled meets RPG!! Well kinda .... In my opinion they really have merged the RPG elements very well with the various match-3 style games which make up most of the play. It has all you'd expect from RPG .. weapons/items/stats/levels/character classes/mounts/spells but instead the combat is played out through match-3 style games which rather than blindly matching colours it does require thought/stategy and sometimes even specific items/spells to beat your opponents.  Picked it up in a steam sale for just a few pounds and at that sort of price its a bargain that has lots of hours of play.
7501	1	a	Bejeweled plus D&amp;D style gameplay, while a very frustrating and sometimes difficult game, makes this a very fun game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or puzzle games.
7503	1	a	Wow this game is far longer than it appears. Basically it is a match the color game with RPG concepts. You level up, gain skills/stats, collect items to add passive traits, and by all accounts the story mode is at least 30 hours long (I played 9 hours.)  It has quite a bit of depth for this type of match the color puzzle game: You basically battle AI or a person to cause damage to each other by matching skulls or casting spells by matching colors.  The reason I am not finishing it... 9 hours in and I do not feel like playing anymore because it feels like Color Match Grinding. Interesting but the random aspect can someone skrew you over or make a boss a joke. The random stuff can be frustrating that actually makes it boring after a few hours.  Worth it if you like this sort of thing!~
7505	1	a	An RPG with a gem-matching game as combat. It works too! There's quite the range of RPG elements.You have quests, you level up and spend skill points, there is gear, crafting, companions, you can tame enemies and make them your mount or learn their abilities, you can capture cities and collect taxes from them, there are taverns where you pay to hear gossip, as you progress through the main story you unlock other areas of the map, etc. There's also some amazing music. The only downside is the endless wandering monsters, which you run into every few steps when you travel, and even though there's no question you will defeat them, you still need to play the gem-matching game. But this is an annoyance that many RPGs with turn-based combat have. If you like RPGs AND gem matching games (you've got to like both), and you don't mind old school 2D graphics, then this game will be worth it.
7507	1	a	An interesting match-3 type game where you actually level up your character like an RPG. Lots of fun and it is easy to get in a quick session here and there without wasting too much time.
7509	1	a	Bejeweled plus D&amp;D style gameplay, while a very frustrating and sometimes difficult game, makes this a very fun game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or puzzle games.
7511	1	a	This scratches too many itches to list.
7513	1	a	Unfairly good formula. Makes bejeweled even more addictive.
7515	1	a	Edit: My husband wrote the original review. This is my review. I've actually played the game.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING!   First off, the MUSIC! The music just gets you right into that 'match things' mood. If you are kicking behind, it ramps up with your adrenaline and you push yourself to an epic win. If you are losing... well, let's just say you'll know that tune and when the announcer chimes in that your hero is near defeat it's totally okay to start sweating.  Next, the actual game play is so smooth! Some matching games can be kind of jerky or have a slower response time. Puzzle Quest does not! It is smooth and seemless. The battle load screens don't last too long and walking about in the RP world isn't cumbersome or annoying. You can even rapidly click through dialoge if you don't care and just want to fight!  Did I mention the music? Because this is seriously some of the best music.   Also worth a paragraph is the strategy aspect. If you play correctly and put some thought into it, this game can be as intense and engaging as a game of chess. I have logged my 600+ hours on almost exclusively my druid, who should be one of the wimpiest in the game. However, using tactics and planning, she can whoop any enemy. Pick your skills, items, spells, and mounts carefully. Know your enemy's weaknesses. Know the board mechanics. Manipulate everything to your will and you will surely master Puzzle Quest.  Of course, after 600+ hours you would think I would be bored with the game, right?  NOT AT ALL! I return to PQ faithfully on a regular basis when I want a respite from the world of MMOs, MOBAs, and RTSs.   So go on, what are you waiting for?   The original sucky review by my husband who has NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: It's like Bejeweled except you fight and the music is way more epic than it should be, but it's still a wonderful game.
7517	1	a	This is a Great Game for you fantasy Fans and/or Puzzle Solvers. its got alittle something for you guys.
7519	1	a	i have play this game before on my 3s as a dsi app and i enjoyed it to a point untill the music and sound got glitchly but over all i enjoy it on the 3ds so i was happy to see it on steam so i instanly jump to the chance and buy it.  And i am impress that the sound and music run perfectly! i love the way how the game forces you to think about what move you should play either for mana or gold like coin or purple star which gives out exp to make shure your mess up your oppents stragy
7521	1	a	If you like the match 3 games, and you like RPGs, you cant go wrong with this
7523	1	a	This game is a mix of match 3 and traditional rpg gameplay. It doesn't look great, the enemies can be cheap, the puzzles are almost nonexistant, and I can't seem to stop playing.   Worth checking out if its on sale and hate having a life. I actually had a dream about playing a match of this game last night. I think that should be a warning, but I'm reccomending this game anyway.  
7525	1	a	A very nice puzzle game for a casual session in between. Also check out puzzle quest 2.
7527	1	a	4/5. 'Match 3' with RPG elements and a good story. 
7529	1	a	I can stop playing it, help!
7531	1	a	Great and addictive game. Started playing this on my DS when it first came out. Playing it all the way through again on the PC brings back memories. This game added an RPG style element to the bejeweled formula that made it much more fun. If you want to play to get into the story and craft every item, or just kill a few minutes this is a great game to pick up.
7533	1	a	If you're serious about your match 3 and like crunchy RPG mechanics, Puzzle Quest is for you! A massive, sprawling campaign with an abundance of interesting and still surprisingly innovative approaches to the genre await. It's a deep rabbit hole that marries two time-destroying genres with significant success, so don't be surprised if it ends up dragging you away from your current playlist for a good solid week or 3 once you fire it up for the first time.
7535	1	a	Must play. Loving it, loving it, loving it. Addictive, I tell you, Addictive. :)
7537	1	a	My wife loves killin' Nazzies with the power of gem puzzles. I say, hey, whatever kills them Nazzies is alright in my book.
7539	1	a	Still as awesome as ever -- actually, better on PC. Played it to death on my DS handheld, but it's one of those evergreen games that never grows old. There are still some minor quibbles with the sound and music (they're great, but they seem to cut off abruptly after combat, etc.), but all in all this is still the deepest puzzle RPG I've ever played. The writing is also better than the games that followed. PQ2 didn't quite live up to the first in that department, though it did add some fun, new gameplay mechanics. Going back to this, though, it still holds up like it was brand new. Highly recommended.
7541	1	a	Good game. It's difficult to say what is so good about it, but I would say it combines the complexity of an RPG's combat and equipment with the interesting (and frustrating) battle mechanics of Bejewled.
7543	1	a	Dis game so good it make me want become a real puzzle champion fo real
7545	1	a	Still the best match 3 game ever.
7547	1	a	Game of The Year. Every year. Play this with a friend and you'll hate each other as much as any other Mario Party. Single player is pretty awesome, too.
7549	1	a	It's a match 3 puzzle game, but it's also a pretty damn fun and addicting RPG. Highly recommended.
7551	1	a	A very unique blend of match 3 and RPG mechanics makes Puzzle Quest a standout game; The two genres meld together to unexpectadly provide an engaing title thats hard to put down. The story is well written with excelent dialect. the battles are appropriately lengthed, the amount of available spells provides plenty of options suited to different play styles and the variety of 'mine game' activities are enough to keep you occupied for hours.  The only negative feedback is the music doesn't loop very well, it can break your imersion suddenly when the music jumps to the begining of a track halfway through a note.  All in all this feels like playing a grand D&amp;D Adventure while playing competitive Bejeweled. Well worth it.
7553	1	a	A surprise gem for puzzle lovers. It's a must buy title.  Skip all the spin-off titles and even Puzzle Quest 2. They aren't as good as the first one. At least start from this particular one. I insist!
7555	1	a	Unfairly good formula. Makes bejeweled even more addictive.
7557	1	a	Bejeweled with RPG elements, an attempt at a story and a surprising amount of things to do. Actually a pretty decent game, but prepare for the AI to cheat... a lot.
7559	1	a	This is a Great Game for you fantasy Fans and/or Puzzle Solvers. its got alittle something for you guys.

7563	1	a	Final fantasy meets Bejewelled meets crack addiction :P
7565	1	a	A laid-back, yet addictive puzzle game. Lots of fun and very easy to learn how to play--but challenging enough to keep you interested.
7567	1	a	This scratches too many itches to list.
7569	1	a	Fun, casual puzzle game, with lots of replay value if you enjoy trying to become as overpowered as possible with each class (or at least, from what i've seen XD)
7571	1	a	Bejeweled mixed with a RPG and surprisingly very addictive. Recommended.
7573	1	a	The only thing missing is customizable textures. If only it had that...
7575	1	a	Puzzle-rific! I'm addicted to the simple gameplay intertwined with well-thought RPG elements. Pure fun and found on sale for only a buck!
7577	1	a	i think i enjoyed it for a short while some time ago i dont remember too well, something about shinies....
7579	1	a	Surprisingly addicting game! I only heard about it after trying that poor excuse of a Marvel clone. Apart from the huge benefit of not having to wait while your characters heal, this also seems to have an interesting story where you actually can make relevant choices.
7581	1	a	Game of The Year. Every year. Play this with a friend and you'll hate each other as much as any other Mario Party. Single player is pretty awesome, too.
7583	1	a	Best Puzzle Quest game in the series
7585	1	a	Peaceful, addictive, great, good game. Just buy it, play and relax. Totally worth price.
7587	1	a	Addictive game, most of the game focus on match 3 of a kind mechanic, which could become repetitive. However, roleplaying elements (i.e. special powers and leveling up) add a lot. Moreover there are some variations to the basic mechanic which add a welcome diversity. The story also add something more than in the average puzzle.
7589	1	a	Really fun game.  Make sure you get the free expansion pack.
7591	1	a	Nice casual game. Great for procrastination.
7593	1	a	4/5  Detestable though games built upon the match-three mechanic almost always are, this title wraps that in a thick coat of RPG elements that add several extra layers of enjoyment, including a cliche though charming narrative.
7595	1	a	How do you make gem matching fun? Turn it into an RPG adventure. I think Puzzle Kingdoms is better overall, but Puzzle Quest is pretty darn good too. Just one more quest...
7597	1	a	I can understand that most people would never give this game a chance because of it's name, but honestly this game is pretty much amazing.  The combat is a mixture of the match-3-jewel gameplay of Bejewled and typical RPG gameplay. The twist is the jewels you match translate into the mana you use for skills, and many skills inflect statuses on the field itself. It comes down to a surprising mix of casual and strategy, as you wonder if you should clear all the blue tiles to make other mana easier to collect, or if you should remove all red to keep your opponent from unleashing his best attacks? Where's the best place to remove a 3x3 area? If I remove this one, will it start a 4x chain? Will doing this avalanch?  The battle system is better refined in the sequel, Puzzle Quest 2, but future itterations of Puzzle Quest (of which there are a surprising amount) all fail in one major thing Puzzle Quest nailed: The sheer variety of things to do. Puzzle Quest has mechanics for taking over cities, capturing monsters, learning their spells, acquiring allies, and several other features that future games simply don't have. It is for these varities that make Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords the best in the series.   The last point to mention is that Puzzle Quest works with mods. It is extremely important to mention, however, that Steam's support for these mods is limited. While mods for the game work fine (and are easy enough for me to make, say, a new class in a day or two) and are generally pretty neat (the new items mod adds several items, each of which can completely change the strategy you use throughout the game), Steam Cloud undoes most of this effort as any backed up modded files will be automatically downloaded sans mods to any future computer- causing frequent crashes and problems for future itterations.
7599	1	a	An RPG with a gem-matching game as combat. It works too! There's quite the range of RPG elements.You have quests, you level up and spend skill points, there is gear, crafting, companions, you can tame enemies and make them your mount or learn their abilities, you can capture cities and collect taxes from them, there are taverns where you pay to hear gossip, as you progress through the main story you unlock other areas of the map, etc. There's also some amazing music.

7601	1	a	Honestly one of my favourite games out there. I love this game.  There was a DLC for this they never released on pcbut I worked with a user named SirNinja to help get the console one on it, which surprisingly ported almost perfectly. Sadly there was a bug or two with it that broke a very very useful item in the DLC. Ignoring that you can pretty much get the full experience of it. Highly highly recommended.
7603	1	a	Great puzzle, maybe my favourite, always return to it, but there's a problem with multiplayer.
7605	1	a	bejeweled with rpg style battles
7607	1	a	Time is an illusion. Lunch time doubly so.
7609	1	a	Very addictive, though it seems that sometimes the computer is cheating...
7611	1	a	Bejeweled mixed with a RPG and surprisingly very addictive. Recommended.
7613	1	a	What an amazing title! After playing this I want it for my PSP and 3DS. I was blown away by what this is. I recommend looking up a lets play or something like that if you are curious. It is basically a cross of a match 3 game, anime/manga, and an rpg. It is fun as hell and I completely reccomend it. ~PR0XIDIAN
7615	1	a	I have not yet finished Puzzle Quest, and it's not for lack of trying. I think I've restarted this game at least thirteen times. The early game is so charming, and discovering the shiny equipment is exciting, and then one realizes the truth:  This is Battle Bejeweled, and you will be playing it forever.  Fortunately, as far as leveling up goes, it has all the trappings of an RPG, replete with sidequests and a rich story. Unfortunately, it has all the trappings of an RPG, and that includes a steady grind. The game can be frustrating to come back to after a time away, especially where the story is concerned.  But at its heart, Puzzle Quest is trying to be your friend. It's a casual puzzle game in an RPG's clothings, and they're worn well. When Candy Crush Saga's got you down, Puzzle Quest will be right here waiting with open arms. Give it a hug.
7617	1	a	ALL puzzle quest games are great Puzzle Quest II is better, but for the price you can't beat this one.
7619	1	a	I don't like puzzle games. But I love this game. It is the best puzzle match three game ever made. Screw the sequels. This is totally worth ten bucks or if you happen to catch it on sale. HOURS of fun!
7621	1	a	This game is a mix of match 3 and traditional rpg gameplay. It doesn't look great, the enemies can be cheap, the puzzles are almost nonexistant, and I can't seem to stop playing.   Worth checking out if its on sale and hate having a life. I actually had a dream about playing a match of this game last night. I think that should be a warning, but I'm reccomending this game anyway.  
7623	1	a	4/5. 'Match 3' with RPG elements and a good story. 
7625	1	a	This game has been keeping me entertained for years, and will likely continue for years to come. Think Bejeweled + Combat / RPG elements and a questing system, and you've got a fair idea of what to expect. It is highly addictive and always entertaining.
7627	1	a	A very good time waster... it's basically your typical rpg set up coupled with puzzles that you do in place of the tradtional rpg battle.   the story is okay... not that bad, but not great nethier. it's kind of medicore. basically, only get this if you like playing puzzle games and use it to pass the time.
7629	1	a	A fun and challenging game bringing together the best of Bejeweled and a JRPG.
7631	1	a	This is a great game! The sort of game I like playing apart from MMO's. You just keep wanting to play once you start!
7633	1	a	An extremely fun, highly addictive game with elements of both a fantasy role-playing game and a puzzle solving app combined flawlessly. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys either genre. It's well worth the investment!
7635	1	a	Played this before? If not, its certainly worth it. Much like bejeweled, this game features gameplay elements that are addictive and at times challenging. Although audio could do with a face-lift, this is one well-rounded game, definately not to be missed!
7637	1	a	It's ok but a little bare fora PC game, definitely better on the iPhone.
7639	1	a	If you like the match 3 games, and you like RPGs, you cant go wrong with this
7641	1	a	I cant believe this made it to steam, back when i played it on a tiny little screen, the bejeweled and rpg types together just had me playing for a long time, and even more so now that that this game has come to steam. still i just cant believe it. not for everyone of course, but im sure its enjoyable, at least to me it is.
7643	1	a	Awesome game as always - doesn't seem to change platform to platform, though, minus the graphics.. I would recommend it for on the go play, such as the DS version
7645	1	a	Recommended for those who like match 3 games with some additions. It was an enjoyable way to pass time while I was doing something else - watching TV, or waiting for people, or flying somewhere. Some replayability with the different classes &amp; general randomness.
7647	1	a	Absolutely a classic puzzle game. Avoid the sequel, it has none of the virtues of this the polished first,  This is a must own.
7649	1	a	This is the best out of the puzzlequest group. VERY addictive!
7651	1	a	Love it. I'm not a puzzle guy but I took a chance and couldn't be more pleased.
7653	1	a	Beautiful art, interesting story and gameplay. Fun and creative.
7655	1	a	One of the best games ever created. Pretty sure it was crafted by gods, and handed down through history until we developed the technology to use it.   Can't be set to 1080p, but its visuals have aged well and its great for jumping in and out of when you have some spare time.   I can also attest to its appeal among children 8 - 17 years old. Hours and hours of them staring at a screen, not talking, and not fighting. The next best thing to my idea of putting teenagers on islands, away from real human beings until they come of age. Like study camps. Camps where they can concentrate. Haven't really thought of a name for them.
7657	1	a	It's pretty good.
7659	1	a	A fun little matching game that adds just a bit of strategy to the seemingly random Bejeweled formula. You face off against a host of monsters using turn-based matching to collect color gems to use powers, to attack, etc. The story is a by-the-numbers fantasy plot that exists to simply move you from battle to battle. I'd recommend this as a great game to casually play while watching a stream.
7661	1	a	This remains the most addictive game I have ever played. Not trying it is doing yourself a disservice, no less. :)
7663	1	a	A classic game with lots of fun, but I have rarely played it since Marvel: Puzzle Quest (Android) came out. I have played this for a very long time on DS &amp; Xbox 360.
7665	1	a	Still a good game, though I am wondering why this isnt a port of the Xbox live version which had achievments and a small expansion of sorts. gameplay is still as good and frustrationg as ever.
7667	1	a	27th November 2016 I remember playing this years ago on the DS, it blew me away. Period. This isn't your average match 3 game, it has RPG elements and instead of just matching for the sake of a high score or fancy explosions like they do in Candy Crush... You match gems to be able to cast spells, and match skulls to deal damage to your opponent. It GIVES you a reason to match a specific gem type, rather than just matching the first one you see and thus offers strategy that compliments the gameplay well.   Personally I enjoy the music very much, it doesn't seem to loop, then again it might? I'm too fixated to realise. It's that great.   I will admit, the AI and board is often fixed in favour of the opponent, you will see them do many '4-of-a-kinds' in a row and their mana resources will max out in no time as a result of that. But this doesn't bother me, they're still beatable and it only challenges me more which overall enhances my experience. It get's slow around level 1-20, but once you've established a firm strategy or paradigm for your character and their particular set of skills, the game only gets better from there. I'm currently a level 31 Warlock, and in my early levels I thought this class was complete s**t but once i hit mid 20s... boy did I have fun.   BE SURE TO GRAB THE UNRELEASED DLC 'Revenge of the Plague Lord', it contains a lot of bonus equipment, enemies, quests and 4 additional classes (now 8 classes total). With the addition of these classes it adds more replayability and experimentation with other strategies.   I've been waiting for this game to go on sale for as long as I can remember, maybe almost a year? And until a few weeks ago I gave up the wait, I bought it for full price, my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner because this game is worth every cent!!!  Update: 15th December 2016 Level 50 Warlock Just finished the game, all main and side quests completed. With just over 400 battles done, I can say now that this game is truly worth my money. I plan on starting up a new class and going through another game. Warlock is definitely a very powerful class and I didn't realise this until I hit my 40s. Will always be on my favourites list of games. 10/10
7669	1	a	it is very addictive
7671	1	a	Pretty fun little mini-game game to play when you don't feel like playing 'real' games. The constant Half-Life references are a bit annoying, but it's fun over all.  Wax on wax off.
7673	1	a	I actually employ the meditation mode on occasion.  Has it helped hone my reflexes? Honestly, I'm not sure. However, it can be idle fun and the challenges are varied and difficult enough to keep some interest.  The art-style is interesting, and the music is a nice touch.
7675	1	a	Dude you can meditate in this game. ItÂ´s a little funky sometimes, but itÂ´s an interesting piece for sure.
7677	1	a	Ninja Reflex just doesn't seem to pack a ton of value, and the repetitive nature of the minigames may grate on you after a while. There's also a sense that this is probably a much better game on the Wii, since that system actually requires you to use your arms like a ninja. Overall, I would say it's 'Okay' about a 6/10.
1181	0	a	Enh... can be enjoyable, but the game is clunky, difficult to play in long settings, and seems designed to give you carpal tunnel syndrome.
7679	1	a	This is THE training gane to have if you are new to FPS's
7681	1	a	this was one of the first games i ever bought idk why
7683	1	a	More then just a game, increase your reflexes, your art of breathing, and overall body, mind, and spirit. This can be used as a tool to improve your performance in other video games and even real life.
7685	1	a	Quite fun when you are bored and relaxing music on the title screen.
7687	1	a	Keep them reaction skills in shape !!!!
7689	1	a	I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to improve their reflexes whether it's in games or the real world. It was developed for gamers, but it honestly reduces your reaction time to help with things like martial arts as well.
7691	1	a	I can only recommend this game by the slimmest of margins. It's enjoyment wears thin and the feeling of 'more of the same, only a little harder this time' is unavoidable. This can be minimized by short sessions, which is probably how it was meant to be played anyway. Another gripe is that multiplayer seems to be discontinued, just as the dev's website is also nowhere to be found. This breaks almost half of the game's achievements and reduces its overall value considerably. However, if your expectations don't rise above a series of fun and unique minigames that test your twitch skills, then you should be happy with Ninja Reflex. Just wait until its on sale...
7693	1	a	Probably the best katamari ripoff on PC, may also be the only katamari ripoff on PC.
7695	1	a	WEOTW is a very simple game at the core but the above average presentation (the music overall is great) plus the pure arcade goodness of the gameplay shine through and make it a fine diversion for a few hours if you got some spare change in the old steam wallet.  I would have been disappointed paying full price but as part of the dejobaan package or itself on sale itâ€™s a nice acquisition if the idea of accumulating mass by absorbing items until you eat up the whole level itself sounds fun.   There are 2 levels that are troublesome due to collision issues but once you get the hang of them there are optimal routes you can take so thatâ€™s not an issue (you can get stuck between tables or if you go under a surface you can end up getting stuck due to increasing your size while under it for example).  The levels are diverse and some are quite clever. It's a simple fun romp while it lasts.
7697	1	a	As many others have mentioned, this game is basically Katamari Damacy on PC... except it is not as good as the real thing. Not that it's a bad game either, actually I had a lot of fun playing it, it's just that it's very short and has a few gameplay issues. To those not familiar with the Katamari games, the gameplay basically consist of moving around picking up any object/animal/person smaller than you. As you pick up stuff you grow in size and thus are able to absorb bigger stuff. Levels are timed and the goal is to absorb as many objects as possible within the time limit. The main difference is that in the Katamari games you roll a ball around while in The Wonderful End of the World you control a walking humanoid made out of spheres. Now lets get on with the review:   THE GOOD:  - It's Katamari Damacy on PC! The gameplay is the same and, to the best of my knowledge, it's the only Katamari clone in existence, so lets be grateful for having it on PC.  - The music is good for the most part, with some tracks bearing a style very reminiscent of Katamari Damacy (although I found the track from the Word Forge level very annoying).   - Levels are varied in design, there's indoor and outdoor locations and a few themed levels (e.g. Arcadia, Word Forge).  - As you beat levels you can unlock two other gameplay modes: time attack and free exploration. The latter is a blessing for OCD completionists like me ;-)  - Controls are responsive and you can configure the mouse sensitivity. BTW mouse-look provides you with more spatial awareness in comparison with the dual stick controls of Katamari Damacy.   THE BAD:  - Levels are too short and there's too few of them. You have 12 levels clocking around 3-5 minutes each. This means you easily go through the whole game in 2-3 hours if you don't aim for all the achievements, and half of that time will be spent in replaying the levels to get the A grade required to unlock the final level. As reference, I got 100% achievement after 5 hours of gameplay.  - Level design could have been better. All levels are square areas (no around-the-world levels) and there's only a couple of them that deserve to be called big. There's nothing compared to the massive Katamari levels where you can end up engulfing cities, continents, planets and stars.  - Graphics are very simple and rough but get the job done. However, most of the objects are pretty plain, e.g. furniture, dogs, fruits, tools, average people, etc. Half the fun in Katamari was the charm and personality transmitted by the quirky characters and scenes you could find around the levels, they felt truly alive. TBEOTW levels feel more static.  - There's not enough challenge, most levels can be beaten with an A grade in one or two tries. However there's one notable exception: the Internet Cafe is a PITA, I ragequit several times when aiming for the A and A+ grades.  - The sound effects are just meh, I found the standard sound for when you pick up something lame, overused and, eventually, a little bit annoying. There's only a few objects with specific sound effects, (e.g. dogs bark, phones ring).  - There's little replay value. The alternate gameplay modes get old real fast since the levels are very short to begin with, there's not a lot to see. The main use for the free exploration mode will be to tackle a couple of achievements but beyond that there's no secrets or collectibles.   THE UGLY:  - Playing as a walking humanoid is not as intuitive as rolling a Katamari ball: it's difficult to judge your size and contact points with objects. Considering It's a time based game, it's VERY annoying and frustrating when your character gets stuck in a pass that at first glance seems wide enough to get through. Also, as you grow in size it becomes more and more difficult to pick up small objects even though you walk right on top of them, because the walking animation doesn't provide a consistent contact area with the ground.  - Unlike Katamari, in this game it's not size that matters, it's the number of objects you have absorbed what determines which objects you can pick up (eg. the object counter must reach X number for you to be able to pick up Y object). This means that sometimes you can't pick up objects that look small enough and, conversely, sometimes you can pick up objects a tad bigger than you'd expect. So you can't always trust your eyes to plan your pickup routes, you'll be forced to rely in trial and error.  - When you walk against an obstacle you just stop, but sometimes when you walk against a narrow pass you get repelled back a considerable distance. This is annoying as sometimes you get thrown against other obstacles or outside the boundaries of the level, losing many precious seconds as you scramble to get back on track.   CONCLUSION:  The Wonderful End of the World feels like a poor man's Katamari Damacy that conforms with providing the same basic gameplay experience. It plays exactly the same but lacks its charm and challenge. That said, it's a decently fun game, albeit very short and rough around the edges. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you're like me and need to scratch your Katamari itch, I think it's worth getting during a sale.
1187	0	a	This game was positively... okay. It's an amusing timewaster at best, a really mediocre Katamari rip-off at worst. If this game goes on sale for like, a dollar, if you're really interested, pick it up. Otherwise, stick to something that'll last you longer.  This game is incredibly short. I beat it in about an hour, and the levels aren't particularly interesting. The art style is unique in a pleasant way, but the game looks like a late N64/Early Gamecube release in terms of graphical quality. While there is a lot of fun to be had with collecting objects and slowly moving your way up, the entertainment value wears off quite quickly.
7699	1	a	I find it weird that not many people have this indie game. Sure it has its negative points, like unpolished, bad responsive controls and I personally didn't like the camera angle or the music much. But none the less I enjoyed it. Especially the level where you absorb as much candy as possible. The levels are fun and a big variation of objects. It will be challenging to clear the levels but if you look for a fun and casual game..
7701	1	a	It's not original or even very well implementedâ€¦ but damn the core gameplay concept is fun nonetheless. There's only a handful of hours of play here, so the 9.99 price is a bit galling. If you can buy it on sale, it's a quick and easy game to get 100% achievements.
7703	1	a	I've never played any of the Katamari Damacy games, but having seen and heard much about them I knew I really wanted to try them out for myself. Sadly, there's no new games being released in the franchise and no way for PC players to get their hands on the originals. The good news is, someone else has stepped up to fill the void.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, if that's true then this game is seriously flattering the sh*t out of the Katamari Damacy games. But it at least doesn't feel like it's doing it in a gross or cynical way, more like paying tribute or homage to something well-loved and inspirational, making a game that they themselves would want to play and trying to maybe put their own mark on it in some small way. There seems to be a lot of controversy among the community over this fact, over how much is a true display of appreciation and how much is pure shameless rip-off. But strange as it may sound, ultimately, I don't think it really matters all that much here. It's fun and it's not stepping on anyone else's toes, so what's the problem?  Anyway, as for the game itself, there's a story about the world coming to an end and a girl deciding she's going to collect as much stuff as she can before that happens, seemingly with some weird marionette creation that she's controlling, but even the developers don't take this seriously and are just as dismissive of it as everyone else will be. It's pretty much forgotten about just as quickly as it's introduced and used only as a vague excuse to justify the gameplay, which is what this is really all about.  You'll start off as a small, nebulous cloud of tiny, white spheres in vague humanoid arrangement, then gradually absorb small items that you come into contact with, everyday objects like fruit or cans or gummy bears. The more you collect, the bigger you grow, and the bigger you grow, the larger the items you are able to absorb. To begin with you'll only be a few inches high, but by the end of the game you'll be gathering up entire buildings. It's a really satisfying sense of progression you get when an object you were previously bouncing off and being completely dwarfed by, is now a miniscule triviality stuck on the side of your leg.  In each stage you'll have a few minutes to gather up as much as you can and earn a rating at the end, getting a high enough rating in select stages will then unlock further ones for 12 in total (plus 2 additional hidden stages). The short time limit and small stage number makes this game pretty easy to get into for quick blasts of fun, but the downside is it makes the full asking price a little hard to swallow, doubly so given how slapdash and primitive everything looks. It really does look like a game from the 64bit era, maybe with one or two exceptions as later stages introduce new art styles that have a little bit more finesse to them... but only just. I feel like that's part of its charm, though, that it's intentionally bad looking and really not taking itself seriously, given that you're a weird cloud man with benches and dogs and people stuck to him. But if you're a graphics nut, this will likely offend your eyes and cause your ocular nerves great distress and you should probably go elsewhere. Although, if you do that you will be missing out on some great music, which is a much greater step-up in quality over anything you'll see in the game.  If you can pick it up on sale for a price that matches the otherwise cheap and cheerful nature of everything else here, then there's a lot of fun to be had for the hour or two it'll take you to finish. But really, having a blimp for a head or a skyscraper for a leg or becoming a walking ball of panicked people never gets old and is reason enough to try it. If this is really what the end of the world will look like, then roll on, Armageddon!
7705	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is, in short, a PC clone of Katamari Damacy, so it is easy to just say if you like that style of game you will like this one, but there are some quirks you should know going in.  The idea of the game is simple, you play this walking man made of magnetic balls that when you get near objects of your size or smaller you pull them into you, letting them become a part of your body and making you grow, you keep growing bigger and bigger and your objective is to reach a set score before the timer runs out, this is the main game mode, once you beat all twelve levels you unlock endless modes and whatnot, letting you goof around.  This concept is fine and the game itself is fun but there are some mixed feelings I have for it, to start the sound design leaves much to be desired, basically every item you pick up makes the same sound save for a telephone or something of that nature, all the sounds in game were obviously done on the cheap with what sounds like people making noises with their mouths, but that is not entirely a bad thing and has some charm to it as well.  The music is very well done and as with most Dejobaan games the overall design of the game is well put together, comical and tight, though there are issues that can be nitpicked, the controls are at times quite loose, it is not a very hard game or long either, you can beat the whole game in one sitting (In fact there is an achevement for doing that) and though the levels are very well made with unique art designs, there is very little replay value.  It is impossible to not compare this game to Katamari, but if you do so you will find that Wonderful falls a bit short from reaching that charming and very Japanese series of games, however despite that I still recommend this game, it's a fun time waster, doesn't cost a lot, and has just enough charm in it to get by, not to mention that if you are a fan of Katamari you have very few options on the PC for games like it.
7707	1	a	A game where you get to walk around maps and consume everything. It is simple and fun for all ages. However it takes less than 1 hour to complete all 12 levels. More than that if you want to get all achievements which will require playing the game twice.
7709	1	a	I immediately got this game when I saw it. I have always loved the Katamari Series and I don't see why Namco Bandai just doesn't port Katamari Forever to the PC.  So this game is very much a Kamatari Clone. You pick up items sprawled around the ground by running into them and grow by picking up more items, which in turn allows you to pick up even more, bigger items. The visuals are very simple and the music is fun, just as in the Katamari series.  I payed 1,99â‚¬ for the game and finished it in 1 1/2 hours, but those 90 minutes passed without me even noticing. You could get more out of it by trying to rank A+ in each of the 12 levels, but that would be very hard. The game definitely is a lot of fun if you like different experiences. So decide for yourself if it's worth it.  One thing you should keep in mind is the technical limitations of this game. The resolution locked at 1024x768 and there's no anti-aliasing without a way to change it. It doesn't look amazing streched up to 1920x1080, but it didn't bother me after 5 minutes. The game also works fine with a Xbox360 controller, but only for moving your character. All the menus have to be controlled with your mouse and keyboard.
7711	1	a	Like a slightly worse Katamari Damacy.  ---Pros: Sucking up objects is super fun and satisfying, three modes for each level (including a notime limit mode), lots of unique sets, a nice array of music with variety and generally pretty good.  ---Cons: Gamepad support is implemented badly (using a steam controller fixes it), no graphical objects, noticeably framerate drops, and a camera that is just a little too touchy, resulting in jerky movement.  Overall, the only real problems I have with this game are the technical ones, but just sucking up everything in an enviornment is really fun and enjoyable. It's decent and if you think from the trailer that it looks fun, you should get it on sale.
7713	1	a	A fun game with very simple gameplay, simply run into small objects to get bigger so you can pick up bigger objects. A nice amount of variation in levels to keep it interesting. The fun and simple gameplay and the entertaining visuals make for a relaxing game. I would recommend it, but it is a short game so try to pick it up on sale.
1195	0	a	As much as I wan't to recommend this game, I can't. Whilst some players will see this as a game with an intriguing name, superb premise and an outstanding theme tune, anyone who has played the Katamari series will know that Dejobaan Games have made a substandard knockoff version of Namco's franchise.  Where is the King of Cosmos out of Ten?
1196	0	a	Katamari Damacy-lite that might have been enjoyable if not for all the bad collision detection bugs it has.
1197	0	a	Short, easy, boring levels. Not worth 10 dollars. Feels like a free flash game.
7715	1	a	consume everything, even dogs. seriously though this is a good game  Very similar to Katamari, I like this cute little game a lot. This one of the better games by this developer, I enjoyed the achievements in this game, and the mild frustration it took me to score an A+ on all levels. I would get this game if it were on sale.   I wish there were an option to window it, as nothing works.
7717	1	a	Fun, addictive game. It brings that 'Katamari' feeling back into your heart. It's also addictive.
7719	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a game developed and published by Dejobaan Games. It involves a marionette that grabs as many objects as he can before the end of the world. The game is similar to  Katamari Damacy  due to their similar gameplay. The objective of the game is to grab as many small objects as you can, growing bigger with each object consumed. The level ends once the player has consumed a predetermined amount of objects. There is also an exploration mode, where there is no objective. Also, The Wonderful End of the World was updated shortly before the release of  Portal 2  in 2011 as part of an alternate reality game. It was alongside several other games in the  Potato Sack . A secret level containing Portal easter eggs and potatoes was added to the game. Once enough players found these potatoes, Portal 2 was released.
7721	1	a	If you can't play any of the Katamari games then this one will suffice.
7723	1	a	Basically Katamari without the ball. You end up becoming a giant, swallowing up skyscrapers and stuff. My brother and I had a fun time trying to beat this one.
7725	1	a	Everyone says this game is bad, but fails to forget its an indie game and a good one at that.  The main thing you'll be doing in this game is walking over things that are smaller than you and absorb them, making you bigger, when you get to a certain size, you complete the level.   I can honestly say, I had a blast playing this cheap little game.
7727	1	a	I would recommend this game if you enjoyed the Katamari series and really like abortions and cancer, as The Wonderful End of the World plays like an aborted early tech demo of Katamari that clawed its way out of the dumpster in order to take up chain smoking and drinking until its little body is so cancer ridden the only humane choice is to put a bullet in its malformed head. The game sure is colorful, at least.
7729	1	a	Neat Little Katamari Style game where you go through levels collecting as many objects as possible which increases your size allowing you to pick up even larger objects and the levels expand as you get bigger and able to reach new places due to your increased size. There a demo for it so if your not sure give it a try and that should tell you if its a game you would like.
7731	1	a	Absolutely shameless knock off of Katamari, and not a great attempt at it either. It's extremely low budget, has game breaking bugs, takes only 2 hours to get 100% of the steam achievements and has pretty terrible game design oversights. However I recommend it to anyone desperate to play Katamari and lack any of the consoles it's released on, or anyone who's new to the sub-genre.
7733	1	a	A short but sweet game, similer to the Katamari games. It's very enjoyable and it's cheap. :D
7735	1	a	Really fun addicting game. If you like or have every played Beautiful Katamari then this game is for you. Kind of short though wish it was longer.
7737	1	a	Sometimes the world ends. What better way to cope with it, than to collect as much worldly things as possible, before the world goes away.
7739	1	a	Yes, it is a Katamari clone. Like other games by this publisher, it's a bit of a frankengame in terms of character and art direction. A few hours' play in this one, price accordingly.
7741	1	a	Colorful, quirky, and very fun. It's an indie title very similar to the Katamari games.
7743	1	a	I didnt think I would like this game but it turned out to be a lot of fun. Not worth the $10 price tag since it's so short of a game, but if it ever goes on sale for $8 or less I recomend geting it.
7745	1	a	This game is best played with a three drink minimum.
7747	1	a	Let's get this part out of the way - The Wonderful End of the World is a blatant copy of Katamari Damacy, and not a great copy at that. The items of the world are low-res and wildly different in style from each other, as though someone just cleaned out a free directory of 3D models and jammed them all into a game together. That being said, it's hard to do Katamari Damacy wrong, and this game is a lot of fun for the two hours it will take you to master it and get every achievement.
7749	1	a	Short but fun.
7751	1	a	this game has great visuals and is creative but i feel like it would be better if it wasn't trying to 100% be a katamari damacy clone
7753	1	a	It's like the Katamari Damacy games in that you are rolling up a potpourri of mundane objects into a giant ball. It's not like the Katamari Damacy games in that it sucks out all the charm and fun of rolling things into a giant ball. If you ever doubted that indie game developers are just amateurs using derivative concepts, this game should help clear up any misunderstanding.
7755	1	a	I actually really like this game, mainly as it remminds me of WE &lt;3 KATAMARI. It is literally a game where you pick up smaller objects to become bigger so you can pick up bigger objects so you can pick up bigger objects... Sounds crap but there is something real addictive about it.  See also: WE &lt;3 KATAMARI
7757	1	a	The pc version of Katamari Damacy. And not a bad 'inspired by' conversion either. Biggest problem? It's too short. Music and sound effects are top notch and it's quite challenging even in its simpleness. Buy it on sale! 
7759	1	a	this is a good game for these upcoming reasons:  you are a beautiful red-haired telekenesis master.  you get big really fast.  if you see something bigger, no worries mate, its time will come.  you destroy the world. you save the world. subtle rap is employed so minorities are represented (very PC!) there is a dinosaur, i think. rolling is fun and its all you do! (easy recipe for success. take notes game devs!) pick up the right thing at the right time to see an easter egg (school bus dong!!!) embrace buddha. amen
7761	1	a	This game artfully disguises the normal 'apocalyptic' chaos and terror usually associated with the end of the world and transforms it into a cute and fun experience for all ages. Running around various worlds and locations you absorb nearby objects, increasing your scale, and thus allowing you to absorb even bigger objects, and so on. The music is fun and catchy, the graphics are decent but I care far more about gameplay then photorealistic visuals. The gameplay in this game is FANTASTIC. The unique mechanic of abosrbing objects leads to fun running about and seeing more and more of the world unfold before you. Each level is a journey, a very fun and playful journey. If the world were to end, I'd very much like it to end this way. Buy it, buy it now!
7763	1	a	I have played this game. I think I liked it.
7765	1	a	OK, so it's more than a little reminiscent of a certain popular series you know and enjoy. Doesn't matter. Game is a whole lot of fun. Wonderful soundtrack, great sense of humor, charming on pretty much every level. It's pretty easy, especially if you're familiar with other 'rolling stuff up' games, but it's worth a play.
7767	1	a	Imagine Katamari Damacy made for a cell phone and then ported to the PC with haste. Its buggy and the game didn't size properly on my screen. But if you look past that, you have a decent game here.  Pros: I had fun with this game. It really is an enjoyable game. It truly is the Katamari experience. While it is not the same humor and as fluent as it's predecessor. It really does capture the garbage ball concept.  Cons: It feels cheaply made. Not many levels to offer. Once you finished it, you are done. I wouldn't buy it if I was you but would play it if you got the chance. Humble Bundles are nice.
7769	1	a	fun. If you like Katamari Damacy you'll probably enjoy this. It is short however.
7771	1	a	It's the same 'on crack' feeling you get playing Katmari Damacy, just a little watered down...But it's still BAD-â™¥â™¥â™¥!
7773	1	a	Great little Katamari clone with lots of fun little touches. Some goals are hard to get but you can easily get all the achievements in a day. Which leads to longevity, after the intial playthrough and Portal hidden levels, there's not much replay value other thant he occasional spritz around. Could benefit from extra levels added from time to time. Or DLC.
7775	1	a	like katamari..... loves it but the music sucks.
7777	1	a	It's Katamari Damacy, except the level design isn't as good.
7779	1	a	This wonderfull end of the world is indeed a good one
7781	1	a	It is a clone of Katamari Damacy. I love Katamari Damacy, so even a weaker clone is an enjoyable game.  The latest Katamari game is a F2P mobile idle game. Seriously. Your money is better spent here, where at least you get the gameplay you are looking for.
1203	0	a	this game has more bugs than a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing field of bee hives that has a migration of dragon-flies swooping over-head with ants hitching on their backs.
7783	1	a	Fun and unique little game to spend a couple hours on. Only a small handful of levels, but they are challenging enough to warrant maybe 4-6 hours of gameplay if you are an achievement hunter. Wouldn't advise anyone to purchase it at full price. Definitely no more than $5, but that's just me. Expect to 'finish' the game in 1-2 hours. At least it will be a relaxing 1-2 hours. :)
7785	1	a	I'll keep this short.  PROS - Katamari like gameplay. - Freeplay once you've beaten a level. - Decent level variation.  CONS - VERY short. I finished everything with an A score in less than 2 hours. - Pretty easy, no real challenge. - Occasional glitches with collision. Sometimes I couldn't get the puppet to go through a gap that was much larger than it. - The music is so-so.  Is it as good as a real Katamari game? No. Is it still fun and kind of charming? Yes. If you can pick it up on sale then do so, but I'm not sure you should grab it at full price unless you REALLY need to scratch your Katamari itch.
7787	1	a	One of my childhood fav's! Worth getting
1204	0	a	TL:DR this game was made 12 year old who got a hold of the graphic's departments asset collection from 2002.  This game has too many faults to list. I've 100%'d this, so I'd say I've seen everything in it.  and there are no redeeming points.  It's just the kind of game where there is something bad about  everything . I could nitpick for literal HOURS on this.    Graphical style  ignoring the fact that it only ran at a stupidly low resolution for me, I mostly mean art style. It's...bad. it's GCSE 'I got hold of clipart on the school computer' bad. everything is WAY CARTOONY(!) or semi realistic, have bright pastel colours or earthy tones.    Gameplay  aside from making me a bit sick playing, this is just wrong. you drive slightly like a car, slightly like a tank. holding mouse 1 will make you go away from the camera..but you can just no use the mouse buttons and hold WASD. when you bump into something, one of about 4 things could happen. you stop, you do a 180 and walk forward, losing all of your momentum.  speed is totally random. on some levels, you get to 100 times your original size, and roll on like a bulldozer, stopping for nothing!...then other levels, you get 5 times bigger and you're crawling. there's no momentum, there's no fun what so ever in just playing the game. unless you're into masochism. then it's fun.   Balance  Ok, so you're playing. you've gotten pretty big, you're the size of a house after starting at 2 inches. run over that car. that's 1 poi- sorry 1 Billion points, I forgot. alright, ok. oh you ran over a 1 inch tall toy? that's also one point. that tree? 1 point. The whole point of this kind of game is buildup and then catharsis of 'haha now i'm huge, i'm gunna go eat a mountain', not 'hold on, this 50ft giant made of crap needs to carefully walk over woodwork tools for some points'. There is no variety, exploration, or difference in playthrough. you want to get A+? you pretty much have to take one route through the level, with maybe 1 or 2 deviations. you can't play how you want if you want that shiny 100%. you do whichever route is fastest by trial and error, a small mistake means you may as well drop that round. you move so slowly that the slightest off-course or inefficient route means losing a chunk of time.   The fact this game was made by a child with no attention span  It's...there's so many small things. things move randomly, stuff isn't animated properly, some stuff can be picked up sometimes when you're a size, some things can't, bumping into a snake's tail (whose hitbox extends about a foot from the snakes actual tail) flings you across the room, sometimes you climb things, sometimes you don't. there are 'scenes' setup that sound like a child made them either by imagining something (a gorilla standing on the other side of a tennis net to a person standing next to a racket LOL THEY'RE PLAYING TENNIS!) or just getting bored in the editor (here's a trail of tennis balls slowly getting bigger with a person standing on the last one). none of the levels have any kind of actual sense to them. the cafe has a full size tree in the middle, a line of paintbrushes on the floor.  Why are points measured in billion? pick up a dice? OH â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THAT'S LIKE 1 BILLION POINTS! if they had made it increment; the larger you have to be in the stage to win, the more points, that could work. but nope.     little things. finally, on the level unlock screen. ok, so you can unlock a suburb level (level c we'll call it). to get this you have to 'beat either the garden (level a) or the sugar place (level b)'. to unlock level b? you have to beat a. do you see the problem? what's the point in saying 'do a or b, but b is a prerequisite to a so it doesn't matter'? it sounds small, but if anyone, LITERALLY ANYONE capable of thinking had played this before release, they would have burned the building containing the source code before it got loose.    I could nitpick down to the fact the main theme song doesn't actually work in context of the game, and how it being 'refreshing' MAKES NO DAMN SENSE, and how I genuinely felt like vomitting after playing, but I don't need to.  if you have this through a bundle, and are an acheivement freak then yeah, you can 100% this in a day, play it and bury it. if you don't own this game, stay that way.  I own another game by the devs. 1,2,3 kick it. this is a game released a while back, that was apparently so broken they're going to start over from scratch and remake it. hell, valve let them go on as an early access game! they must be committed!...they've made no progress on 1,2,3 for many months.  supposedly, these guys have been 'making games for 75 years'. aside from that being a dubious claim (really? so back in 1940 you guys were busting out hits? in a time when computers were pretty much just mechanical? even though you even state on the site your studio was founded in 1999?), they just honestly seem like the most scummy crew around. don't buy this.  actually scratch that. buy this for an enemy. who loves 100%ing games. either he plays it for the 100%, a fate I wouldn't wish on anyone, or he won't, leaving his steam account with a less than perfect game average. win-win.   while i'm here, steamstore page debunk time!  'The Wonderful End of the World takes you through 12 unique locations, with over a thousand treasures to gather before the end comes. Steal some sweets from the candy store, where gummi fish swim in a blueberry river; visit a surrealist library to find that the words have literally leapt out of their books; and explore the Megalopolis, where you'll watch a lively end-of-the-world parade and then gobble it up before making your way to grab the tallest skyscraper ever built.'  unique? so about 4 of them are just neighbourhoods/cities, the rest are just boring. the candy store? in level, it's not shown to be any kind of candy store, more a diarama with dolls staring down at you. gummi fish in the river? there are no fish in any river on that. the library is a room with 3 bookshelves, with a single line of some 'words that have literally leapt out of their books'. end of the world parade? there's 2 billboards saying 'end of the world' while a monkey and some people stand on a roof. you can't even grab all of the skyscraper, by the time you'd be big enough the score limit is reached and the level ends. and according to scale, none of the buildings are 'the tallest skyscraper ever built' by an measure from the last 50 years. just more hyperbole and bs that was written by the dev team's children.
7789	1	a	It's cute. I like the theme song, and it's an easy game as rolling around goes. Also there's a potato in the loading screen. &lt;3
7791	1	a	Two things: 1. It's a shameless Katamari Clone 2. It's a well-done shame Katamari Clone that you can play on your pc.
7793	1	a	This game is loads of fun but you will probably not play it after completing it. I feel like I spent more than 2.2 hours but the timer reset after moving onto a new machine. Expect about 10 hours of gameplay.
7795	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a grab-it-and-grow game similar to Katamari Damacy.  The story isn't really delved into in too much detail besides the song on the title screen. You're attempting to gather stuff up to save the world.  The gameplay provides for a fun challenge, but the game itself can be completed in a very short period of time. Getting all the possible A+ grades may take a little longer.   The controls are extremely basic. Mouse&amp;keyboard or a single analog stick on a gamepad. Note that the menu can't be controlled by the gamepad.  The video is restricted to a 4:3 screen size. I couldn't find any way to remove this restriction.  The music is a really redeeming factor in this game. A wide range of music for each level and gamemode.  There is a bug in that occasionally the 'puppet' will get trapped in the environment's objects forcing you to have to restart.  It's not the best game out there, but it is fun for a while. By all means get this game if it's on a sale. 
1207	0	a	In short: This game is a cheap ripoff that learned nothing from the game design decision that made katamari damaci great. And while nearly every aspect of 'The wonderful end of the world' could be criticised, from the horrible graphic design, to the confusing UI and complete lack of charm, it's probably faster to note that there is no promise anywhere in this Indie game. The Developers sat down, though really hard about katamari, and instead of trying to improve or match that PS2-Gem, found that they had absolutely nothing to say about it. No reedemable factors mean nobody should waste his time buying this.
1208	0	a	Poorly done knockoff of the Katamari games. Clunky, buggy controls; poor collision detection; and none of the story, humor or charm of the original Katamari games. You can go through all the levels in about an hour. For the $10 you can buy the original Katamari Damacy.... go do that, it's infinitely better.
7797	1	a	I see people complaining about this, but it's not like the Katamari games don't have any problems either.   It's not a perfect game and it's not as lovingly bizarre as Katamari, but The Wonderful End of the World is still a lot of fun and enjoyably strange.
7799	1	a	I must write a recommendation for this game. It is one of my favorite purchases on steam. Though it is just a 'katamari clone', the levels are unque and interesting, the sounds, music, and visuals are all great, and it is decently challenging.
1210	0	a	This game is so.. very.. boring. I bought this game because I believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS 2 game. Sadly it's far from it.   In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. but the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy.   Don't buy this game, if you really want to play something but can't get a copy of Katamari Damacy, try this link:   http://www.kongregate.com/games/dingogames/tasty-planet?acomplete=tasty+pl   shorter and sweeter. 
7801	1	a	It's a clone of Katamari, but it's charming, easy to play, perfect for casual pick-up-and-play gaming, and contains references to Discworld and Blues Brothers. Hard to dislike.
7803	1	a	let me tell you a story that may seem off track and irrelevant at first.  once upon a time there was this game called rogue. shortly afterwarts there were alot of clones of rogue and all were bunched together under the label 'roguelike' creating a significant genre of games that stood out from the other computer roleplaying games. a long long time later there was a game called minecraft, building upon the softer branches of roguelikes, it inspired many clones of itself. at first these clones got negative reviews for just being clones but later some began to get really great reviews as games in their own right. what the hell does any of this have to do with this game?  simple. it's a katamari clone. but not as good. which isn't a problem since it is an indie game. you know how indie games dont have as much of a budget so ofcourse it's going to be abit lacking. so anyways this be the first game ive seen that's an attempt to be in the same genre as katamari. and i see so many negative reviews about how it's a clone of katamari but not as good. it's like finding all those minecraft clones and seeing negative reviews just because it's a clone all while missing the point of building up the genre of epic snowballing. this game in itself is pretty interesting. and it's a pc game and not a console game.
1213	0	a	The Wonderful End of the World is a pretty simple casual game. The concept seemed very alien to me at first despite it's simplicity but I am told this a fairly populated genre although most of the good incarnations are apparently exclusively Asian in origin. Despite glowing recommendations from my friends of these games I am having trouble imagining any game in this genre ever being anything more than a shallow time sink. The kind of game that would probably be at home on a mobile.  The game is very simple. You run around a map consuming objects by running into them. You can only consume stuff smaller than yourself and as you consume more and more objects you become bigger and eventually starts consuming the very map itself. The game is timed and as such it is simply a question of choosing the most optimal route through the map to reach those required high scores.  There is not very much else to say about it. The graphics are not very impressive and the sounds are pretty mediocre. The music is decent however although that is mostly because it is unlikely that you will ever play this game for long enough sessions for it to become stale.  Not really a game that can be recommended as anything more than a simple time waster for when you're bored and only have 5-10 minutes to play.
7805	1	a	katamari damacy, without that complicated ball rolling mechanic. also without the really great music or warm sense of humor. this is still a decent budget game.
7807	1	a	It's a fun Katamari type game. Nothing all that original, but it was entertaining.
7809	1	a	First of all, they say this game heavily resembles Katamari Damacy, a Playstation 2 game, but I haven't played that one: that makes me kind of an independent reviewer.  Basically, one could describe The Wonderful End of the World as a game where you grow bigger by grabbing stuff to eventually grab even bigger stuff. You can only grab things that are smaller than you, so beginning small, you will soon discover by growing that the levels are a lot bigger than initial view grants. You move around with keys and mouse (that I used) or gamepad, the initial obstacles becoming grabbing material soon enough.  Challenge is to grow big fast enough, given a time frame, but this is easy enough after a couple of tries. There are also a couple of achievements to find and collect special stuff like dinosaurs and giant gorillas.  It looks nice and the gameplay is fun enough, but what really gets me is the music. Funky, funny verses are a very nice background. While a decent game, sadly, there's only things to do for a couple of hours before seeing it all. Because of that I'd say to get it when it's on sale.
7811	1	a	A lightweight, bright and colorful game which doesn't take itself really serious. Basically, you walk around, start small, grow bigger by collecting stuff and collect even bigger stuff.
7813	1	a	An amusing Katamari Damacy clone, with a great soundtrack. The only drawback is the fairly limited amount of levels, but it's decent for the price tag.
1216	0	a	This game is basically Katamari Damacy if you removed all the parts that make it fun.
7815	1	a	A wonderful little game that although tiny, provides an excellent homage to the Katamari series, through both visuals and mechanics.   Visuals: Nothing amazing, nothing bad though. Bright colours, simple models, a nice cheerful atmosphere. A nice effort has been put into giving each world a theme. After playing though, I can't help feel more direction could have been given to the art. Perhaps even a stylised Borderlands-like approach could have differed it a little more from Katamari.  Gameplay: Smooth with some minor hiccups. Sometimes the character can get a little stuck-ish between objects (because of the way it grows). The actual mechanics of the game work smoothly, being almost a clone of katamari. One thing I notice is its time restraints aren't nearly as strict as Katamari, so the experience is more relaxing. I did however, find it annoying that I had to pass 11 levels in order to unlock a new game mode.   Additional: Music is top notch.   Overall: A nice, small, relaxing game that's been carefully crafted. I don't think of this as a duplicate of Katamari, it's more of a game that just provides more Katamari-like gameplay that we all know and love. Not the most amazing game out there, but a solid experience none the less and well worth the purchase if you have a bit of time to waste.
1217	0	a	Hey, so that was pretty fun. A few hours spent goofing off in a silly, alternately-stylized Katamari Damacy. How much is this game going for anyway? ...TEN BUCKS? Yeah, save your money people.
7817	1	a	It's pretty cool, but I finished the whole game in 54 minutes
7819	1	a	I hope they make a sequal: The not so wonderful end of the world
1218	0	a	This is a weird sort of katamari-damacy-clone. It's kind of cool to see all of the random â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the game, but once you play through it, you don't really want to go back. It's like looking at a painting that is amusing for the first time you see it, but not worth hanging on the wall to stare at or come back to.  Plenty of way better games out there, this one just comes accross as cheap and poorly made.
7821	1	a	You walk around, stuff sticks to you, you get bigger and finally, you consume the whole world. Katamari Damacy on PC. And it's fun. And funny. Buy it. It's Dejobaan Games.
7823	1	a	This game is just weird. You are some weird thing that obsorb things smaller than you such that you can grow bigger and obsorb even bigger objects. It's a shame the game is so extreme short (2-3 to ace all levels) since it's actually a decent fun game.
7825	1	a	WONDERFUL music and it TOTALLY doesn't have anything to do with that Katamari game.
7827	1	a	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-Katamari... I'mean, The wonderful End of the world!  It plays almost like any other Katamari game, is equally sick, and is equally fun to play!
7829	1	a	This game is a PC version of Katamari Damacy, almost exactly.  Basically, you start off small, and absorb things around you to grow, which allows you to aborb bigger things and explore more of the level. It's a fun concept that's fun to play, both in Katamari Damacy and in this game.  The main downsides are the length and the map sizes. The game is way too short, and it can easily be beaten 100% in a few hours, max. The maps are also a bit too small, and most of them can be fully explored in 2-3 minutes.  If you're not familiar with this type of game, it is absolutely worth trying. Get a Katamari title if you have the right platform for one of them, and if not, try this game. I got it for half price at $5, and it was worth it, barely. I had a lot of fun, but you don't get much playtime for your money.
7831	1	a	A fun game. A lot like an amateurish Katamari port, sans ball. Worth a few of your dollars, and one or two of your hours.
1221	0	a	This is a weird sort of katamari-damacy-clone. It's kind of cool to see all of the random â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in the game, but once you play through it, you don't really want to go back.

7837	1	a	Pick up everything and never let it go, baby.   Also, Minecraft grass sound.  9/10
7839	1	a	Fun and kinda of a playful idea this game...
7841	1	a	The closest thing you will get to a Katamari game on PC that isn't emulated. It's really short but I'd say worth the money. It isn't as good as Katamari and only maybe two levels are really large.
7843	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Katamari Damacy clone, not worth money sadly. Game lasted literally 2 hours and it manages to be linear with the 'genre'.
7845	1	a	Pretty fun game - buy it if it's on sale. Like now.
7847	1	a	This is essentially Katamari methadone, but it also provides an object lesson as to why Katamari is a ball and not a towering human puppet thing. If you know the basic concepts of Katamari, it'll take you about little over an hour to beat, artificial gameplay performance grading system and all barring you temporarily from the final level. (Without it the game would be about thirty minutes long.) What might make or break this game for you is Dejobaan's nonsensical whimsy, which you'll either find delightful or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing annoying. Either way, this is the closest that Katamari has gotten to the PC.
1223	0	a	A cheap clone of PS and Xbox's Katamari. It lacks the polish and charm Katamari DID have, and I didn't even like that game. There's no real point, no goal, except for collecting all the junk in the world to become bigger. Uhm yeaaaah... no !  [Rating: 64/100]
7849	1	a	Lets be honest. It's a Katamari Damancy knock-off. And the voice acting's not that good. And it's not as good at Katamari. However, it's chaper than Katamari, and if you're out of new Katamari games to play, Wonderful End of the World can help sate your appetite.
1224	0	a	not stylish, not fun.
1225	0	a	It's just like Katamari Damacy! Except without the innovative control scheme. Or the great music. Or the charm. Or the fun.
1226	0	a	'Hey, this game is just like Katamari Damacy! I'ma buy it!'  Yeah..... No it isn't.  It plays like Katamari Damacy, but it lacks so many of the essential game mechanics that makes K.D. a good game.  Lack luster gameplay: Check Dissapointing level design: Check Very small levels: Check Very short levels: Check The length of an actual game: Nope...  Do not buy this game...  Period.
1227	0	a	I started out small. Then I slowly grew to one, Big â™¥â™¥â™¥ ball of stuff.
1228	0	a	This gmae is nothing more than a very low-quality Katamari ripoff, and no one should ever pay money for it unless it's sold in a bundle with better games.
7851	1	a	While extremely short, WEotW is hard not to recommend. The gameplay is unique on PC as far as I know, and while a few of the maps suffer from poor design (it's possible to get stuck and lose time trying to get out of some awkward corners), the only real issue I have is technical.   The game lags and stutters at points, such as when you reach a certian size (and can see more of the map) or when you've eaten a certian number of objects. The lag is never enough to keep you from playing (all you do is walk around and eat things), but it is jarring and I have to question whether the minimum specs are nough to run this game. I mean, if I get lag with 8gbs RAM, a 3.5 multi-core CPU, and midrange/getting-old-now GTX 750 NVIDIA card... I'm sure most PCs are more powerful these days, but still, it's an issue to consider.
7853	1	a	Dec 21st 2012 in a nutshell
7855	1	a	Decent enough time sink.  I can't believe it is still 10 dollars though.
1231	0	a	Alright, letâ€™s get the obvious stuff out of the way. Yes this is a katamari rip off, yes the game is short, and yes the gameplay leaves much to be desired. But let me explain my reasoning.  I enjoy the original katamari games, even to this day (Katamari Damacy is one of my favorite PS2 games). They had a feel and a style not many games had at the time of release. I am not sure how many 'katamari' rip offs there are on the PC, but if you are interested in the original idea of katamari, youâ€™re better off getting the original games.  Right from the start of this game, you get a feel for the experience you have ahead of you. I don't want to judge a game from its cover, but all the menu buttons are small spinning circles, and the options menu is just a wall of comic sans-ish text for crying out loud. Once you start a level you will find it is very much like its source material. You roll around, pick up objects smaller then you, work up to larger ones. That is one of the very first of many issues with the game though. In katamari you have a ball to judge what you can and canâ€™t pick up, and it works well. Here, when you pick objects up, you absorb them and they sort of morph into a human like shape. This makes it very hard to see what you can and cannot pick up. There are some objects that you are clearly much bigger then, however you cannot pick it up, or vice versa. You also have very limited camera control, and are only allowed basic left and right camera movement. This is not usually a problem, but in some cases it makes it hard to find objects.  Now, on to the music. The Katamari soundtracks were more than memorable, the music in this game, well, not all of it was terrible, but it was nothing great, just general stock music, some that I even recognized. Now I know this game had a much smaller development team then katamari, but it's hard to fill in such large shoes, and since they decided to try, it's only fair that I critique them on it.  Overall I do not recommend this game. I got very little playtime out of it, even though I unlocked every level. Almost every level made me feel like I was trapped in a small box, and there was little to nothing that I could take away from the game, experience wise. And for the current whopping price of $10, itâ€™s a novelty to own at best, a low grade rip off at worst. 
1232	0	a	So you're telling me that for the low, low price of ten bucks, instead of buying a used copy of We Love Katamari, I can play this cheap copy of Katamari Damacy that runs in fullscreen at 640x480, has the world's twitchiest camera that I can't even fully manipulate with my mouse, does not have a nearly as catchy and unique and awesome soundtrack, has a much uglier and less polished aesthetic, completely lacks any of the same charm, has much less in the way of content, and generally feels like it should be a free unity game?  Dejobaan games, you have earned yourself a customer for life.
7857	1	a	Fantastic little time waster if you don't want to invest to much into a game., has a great soundtrack too.
7859	1	a	I love this game. It's amazing. While yes, it is missing some of the charm of a Katamari game, it is still great.... just because it's the only Katamari style game on PC that exists in the world. Believe me, I know, I tried. It's short, it's cute, and it's somewhat unpolished, but it's still fun.  Buy it.
7861	1	a	Nothing extra, but its fun to play with.
1234	0	a	I swear if I ran into this game out on the street, I would punch it in its freekin mouth.
7863	1	a	great game, it is simple and refreshing
1238	0	a	It's ok, but go play Katamari instead; this game is inferior.
1239	0	a	It's Katamari game where you add the stuff to yourself instead of a ball, with no King of All Space.  In other words, a Katamari game that's not worth playing.
1240	0	a	I was reasonably optimistic that today was going to be a good day. really. It went well, overall. I was feeling good. ...It's ruined. Ruined forever. Because of this game. I abhor that I allowed it to occupy my attention, hard drive and senses. It's a shameless rip-off of Katamari, and lacks all the charm. ...it also involves a random, otherwise uninvolved furry character. That's pandering. That's pandering.
7865	1	a	Pls buy game
7867	1	a	Short, but fun arcade-style game inspired by Katamari Damacy.  And a metaphor for consumerism.
7869	1	a	As a spritual successor to Katamari it is not bad, if a little quick. Haven't played too much into it yet, but it filled that much needed Katamari fix.
7871	1	a	Although this game may not seem like much on the cover, it's one of my favorite games in my steam library, and that's saying something since I have over 500 games! There's something oddly therapeutic about running around and sucking everything up that's smaller than you until you're large enough to consume anything. Dejoban Games is quickly becoming one of my favorite indie devs.
7873	1	a	If you've always wanted to try Katamari Damacy but never had the opportunity, I consider this a suitable clone
7875	1	a	I actually DON'T recommend this game. I only bought it because I was hoping for a half decent Katamari clone and all I got was something that felt like they took its soul and promptly took a dump right on it. Horrible controls, glitchy and buggy gameplay and a difficulty curve that is more like a random scribble on a cocktail napkin. The graphics are amateur and inconsistent, the music is annoying and the voiceover stuff blows. This game feels more like a grade school student project rather than a product that was sold. Sometimes when you're starting out, less is more... keep it simple instead of trying too hard and maybe the game won't feel like you're trying to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ something I appreciated.
7877	1	a	You don't roll stuff up, but it covers that niche need in a good way. Nice little distraction.
1242	0	a	It's alright. Who doesn't like rolling around collecting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?
7879	1	a	I really don't know why, but I find this game fun. Well it is pretty easy but still worth playing.
1243	0	a	The Wonderful End of the World is basicly your Pc version of the Hit Playstation game Katamari. This is probably something you will play but not play again after a couple of days (if you dont care about the achievements). I actully find this game between boring and ok but i dont think you guys would want this. I got this game because it included with the potato sack so yea i decided to give this a try but it didnt work out so well. This game features: Sucking the world, Poor graphic quality, and not so good music. Dont get this game if you dont care about the achievements, if you do care then its your decision to get it but i would say no on it. Cost: $10 Rating: 35/100 Lame
7881	1	a	Fun, colourful and charming little game.
1246	0	a	A poor Katamari clone. Controls badly, looks poor, and uninspired levels. Do yourself a favor and dust off the ol' PS2 and play Katamari instead.
1247	0	a	It's like Katamari except with crappy music, lousy controls, and none of the charm. So I guess it's not much like Katamari at all.
7883	1	a	This game is a really fun and challenging game for casual players. Its also too easy. I do hope there will be more of these because the game has skill involved. and who doesnt like skill?
7885	1	a	I have no idea why I loved this game so much. Okay that is not a very good reccomendation. Let me try again. This game was.. the gameplay was... the storyline... GRRR. I guess I loved it because I had never played anything like it before. I loved it's simplicity. I just HAD to see if I could absorb every little thing there was to absorb. That is the objective by the way; to absorb everything before time runs out. You start out small and can only absorb small things, eventually you walk over a building and it becomes part of your swirling mass. The world is going to end, and you have to take as much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as you can. I played it to death. I was obsessed. Good times.
7887	1	a	Decent little Katamari clone but definitely falls short in every way when compared to the original series it tries to copy. Iffy controls and a twitchy camera dont help, also I had to replay the Internet Cafe stage so many times because of getting stuck between the walls and objects causing me to losing valuable seconds on the clock. I don't remember buying Wonderful End of the World, likely got this one in a bundle and it probably cost a couple of Â£s. To be fair I might of got this game sooner if I had know it was made by Dejobaan Games since I really enjoyed the two AaaaaAAaaaAAA!!! games.
7889	1	a	Discount Katamari Damacy. I would recommend that you get this if it's on sale and you like katamari.
7891	1	a	So many bugs and glitches but I couldn't stop playing. Don't know if it's worth the $10, but next time it's on sale you should pick it up. Although I now wish I still had my katamari games.
1251	0	a	Poorly made Katamari rip-off
7893	1	a	I really miss playing We &lt;3 Katamari on PS2 and I heard this would fill my needs.  I'd say it certainly did that, if only for a while. It's a shame it wasn't longer but it was very enjoyable while it lasted.  Roll up all the things to get as big as possible and save the world.  I'd say one to get in a sale but well worth a look if you need a fix of Katamari goodness.
7895	1	a	It's like Katamari but not as good. Worth it for cheap. Good little waste of time.
7897	1	a	If you are a huge Katamari Damacy fan like me then you will LOVE this game to death. You first start off in what appears to be a big garden. 'Woah, this place is pretty big! I don't think it can get any bigger!' WRONG! The level only gets bigger and bigger moving into a yard and then a whole suburb! Well, the levels aren't THAT big but they will surprise and impress you by how big they get compared to the start. The only down part to this game is how short it is. There is about 12 levels total and the game can be completed in one sitting.  ANYWAYS, this game is totally worth buying if you like Katamari Damacy or you just happen to find something else that draws you to this game. It's unique, fun and worth a try! 9.5/10
1253	0	a	PC-only gamers: this is your chance to play a bad version of Katamari Damacy.
1254	0	a	Poor man's Katamari Damacy without the humor or charm. It's ok for what it is but if you have the option, pick up the above mentioned game as there's just not much here.  If you can't though and need to scratch the magnet-ball (or I guess in this case, magnet-man) itch, this game is usually on sale at an already low price and will scratch that itch to an extent.
7899	1	a	A fun Katamari clone with a catchy soundtrack. Not as polished as the source game and quite short, but great if you need your Katamari fix.
1257	0	a	This game is a direct ripoff of Katamari Damacy. Only they forgot to include the part where its supposed to be fun -.- I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. :p
1258	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. BUGGY AS CRAP and I HATE IT. &gt;:C
1259	0	a	Where do I start?  As you may think, this game is similar to Katamari Damacy. However that's where the similarity ends.  The game forces itself onto fullscreen mode, you cant change the low resolution. The controls are clunky. Levels are boring, sound is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Not worth the hassle.
7901	1	a	I love this game. now, first off I should warn you to get this during a sale. it's good, but it's a game you'll 100% in couple hours anyway, this game is basically katamari damacy without the strange storyline. it's a quick game that you'll find yourself coming back to replaying every one and a while. If you like the whole 'absorb things to grow huge' style of game, this'll be a welcome addition. if not, you'll probaly find this boring.
1261	0	a	terrible mechanics â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game
7903	1	a	This game is suburb! It is quite fun in the sense that it is fast, challenging and full of suprises. The chevos are excellent too as they are just the right amount of challenge to make you want to get them all. It is a little buggy but nothing devistating just some awkward object interactions here and there. I much rather play with the gamepad then the keyboard because the nature of the game requires analog control. Worth every penny I might even buy a few copies for my friends. These guys have yet to disapoint!
7905	1	a	6/10
7907	1	a	Katamari styled bit of fun. Not a lot of content, but enjoyable while it lasts.
7909	1	a	I'm really glad Dejobaan Games exists; their bizarre alt-history meta-narrative is hilarious, and has talked me into buying a number of their products. Trouble is, the actual games they make aren't usually all that good... The Wonderful End of the World is the only offering they've provided so far that I've enjoyed enough to really keep at. A blatant Katamari Damacy clone, they've stripped out the giddy LSD-inspired galactic deity and replaced His Royal Codpiece with a nihilistic, Fiddle-While-Rome-Burns heroine seeking to loot the planet (through... ghost magic? I have no idea what's actually going on here.) as best she can before Earth just crumbles and dies. Possibly due to your actions. They're never all that clear on that point. It's stylish and fun in a low-budget sorta way that makes you ignore the fact that you've already done this hundreds of times through a wider variety of levels and gameplay modes and with better controls. Pick it up cheap and enjoy a wonderful afternoon before setting it aside forever.
7911	1	a	The graphics are very basic, which I think is fine and even give it a little bit of a 'I'm back in adolescence and creating and it feels good' vibe. The gameplay is solid, and the controls are so good that I keep thinking I'm playing console Katamari and slowing myself down thinking that The Wonderful End of the World has the same limitations. It definitely fills the Katamari craving, and if it was longer and had a bit more to the content (like achievements, ability to see all the weird items you pick up, etc) could easily replace Katamari.
7913	1	a	A very simple game that is easy to pick up with the intention of playing a quick round and then realising you've been playing for ages.
7915	1	a	A fun little simple game. It's basically a rip off of Katamari, but with so many 1st person shooter rip offs, its nice to see someone at least try things with this genre. You simply roll up small things, grow bigger, and continue to roll up smaller things. While this game lacks the charm of Katamari, one of my favorite games, it still brings something special. Cheap and fun.
7917	1	a	Pretty much Katamari Damacy but with an end of the world spin to it. It has some replayablity but not much once you finish the main goals. And the levels are short for the most part and there aren't many to choose from. All in all it's not worth it's current price tag, but if it's on sale pick it up.
7919	1	a	I love you 'The Wonderful End of the World', but damn you 'Word Forge'!
1265	0	a	There is nothing wonderful about this game. Nothing. The attempt at copying Katamari Damacy was so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor that no negative statement could even come close to describing it. What thought that went through Valve's mind to associate this black stain of an indie game with Portal 2 must have been addled by booze or magical drugs.  But seriously - This game blows.
7921	1	a	A bit like Katamari Damacy, this game was surprisingly addictive, with catchy music on most levels. A bit short, with only about 2 hours worth of gameplay to get all trophies, somehow it just hooked me in.
7923	1	a	fun but short game
7925	1	a	It was really fun and feels very much like a low budget Katamari game. Complete with picking up objects, growing bigger and simmilar level setup.  Only thing, it's really short (12 Smallish Levels) and has low replayability. I'd reccomend to NOT get this game at full price, wait until it's on sale for $5 or less.
7927	1	a	Great indie game. Basically Katamari Damashi but without the panda buttsex. Really needs some new levels though.
1266	0	a	It is like cheating on Katamari Damacy with its ugly sister.
7929	1	a	I kinda wanna say 'no' on the recommendation, but I also kinda wanna say yes.  Katamari Damacy is a great concept. It's hecka colourful and fun and wonderful and brilliant and catchy and charming... and kinda dark too maybe just a bit...  This is not Katamari Damacy. I mean... in all respects gameplay wise it's basically a poor man's Katamari Damacy... on PC. because KD is only on playstation consoles. Which makes me somewhat sad. because I never got a chance to get them or play them. Any time I saw them for sale in a shop, preowned or otherwise, I didn't have the cash on me. Now my PS2 is all hidden away somewhere, unused. Loved, but unused.  And you know, this is a great game for a little while, the music's catchy, the gameplay's pretty fun, there's neat modes, there's a couple of secrets in theg ame to discover...  Supposedly the end of the world very literally is coming. Everything's gonna ...uh.... go... somewhere? I mean it's never really explained but apparently the world is ending. So as a benevolent goddess I guess, you send an avatar of your will to collect up as much of the world as you can to save it from destruction, using a cut down katamary damacy-like gameplay. Instead of having to worry about what direction you push a ball or what things are attached where so you can still move the damn thing, you can just run everywhere. Controls are okay, but a little bound by older game making decisions, but it's not really too complex to play regardless...  The weird thing is at first everything feels reasonable, you start super small, as the worlds continue you start bigger than before, and as you collect things you grow in size and can pick up other bigger things. Her's the odd thing though... You sometimes find yourself growing, and seeing BIGGER worlds outside the one you were in... and you end up wondering how far does this go? at one point you find out a city you were in is just a diorama in a shopping centre with a model train running around it, which you then start gathreing up... only to find that this TOO might have been a display on a table... but then time runs out and you are left with SO MANY QUESTIONS.  Actually yeah just on that I'mma recommend it. It's quirky, it's silly, it's short, it's still fun as hell.
7931	1	a	Think katamari, but the controls are usable and make sense.
7933	1	a	This is a game for lunatics.
7935	1	a	Really fun indie game. It's essentially a knock off katamari, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun and a great buy.
7937	1	a	If you ever played the katamari games and liked them then this game is a must buy.
7939	1	a	I wonder what my 10 Bucks was used on.
7941	1	a	A fun game that will keep you busy for a few hours.   If this Katamari game everyone seems to be talking about is so great, why isn't it available on PC?
7943	1	a	Stupidly addicting... don't ask why, its just one of those really dumb things that you kinda gotta love.
7945	1	a	The Wonderful End of the World is hard,but FUN! I like how it's similar to Katamari Damacy. The graphics are good. The gameplay is good. Although the Word Forge music is just 'noise'. This is a great game. Like AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! good.
1268	0	a	Cheap mans Katamary Damacy, fun for an hour, not much more. Also pretty glitchy.
7947	1	a	It's a great short trip, when you need a Katamari kick. Give it a try, but keep your expectations low as the worlds are not huge, but they're still a blast to play though.
7949	1	a	Do you love Katimari? Do you wish there was a shorter low end graphic version of it? This is the game for you plus Achievements.
7951	1	a	This could be one of the greatest games for wasting time in the universe.  From the makers of AaAAaaAAA! and 1..2...3...Kick It!; The Wonderful End Of The World is a game similar in style to Katamari Damacy. Walk around, pick things up, get bigger, pick more up, play hidden levels and have fun!
7953	1	a	It's really cheap and really fun, what more do you want?
7955	1	a	This is a delightful little game. Quite short, not too hard, but plenty of fun.
7957	1	a	A great casual game when you run around absorbing progressively bigger items. People say it's a rip-off of another game; but that game's not here and this one is. Probably only worth it when it's on offer for a couple of Â£s.
7959	1	a	Now if you are a die-hard Katamari fan or just want a pc Katamari. This may very well be right up your alley.  Now dont get me wrong this isnt some straight port and its not as physicsy as katamari is. If you run into a wall you dont get bumped or anything. But that doesnt mean its anything bad.  Its possibly not for you if you refuse to play anything with very low detail or low resolutions. But really the game has no option for resolution. Bit of a problem there but i never let graphics or technical limits stop me from playing a good game.  Story wise its pretty simple. There is a girl who ive named Terra (as some images in the files are named terra_angry or terra_duck and such) who controlls this puppet who goes around sucking up stuff kinda like a tornado. The world is about to be eatan by a giant fish head and you need to save as much stuff as possible before that happens. Most people will say there are 12 levels but there are actually 12 + 2 secret levels. So 14 in total. The last level    Has sad music playing and everything is on fire and it really does look like the world is collapsing     When i wanted to 100% this game i would spend hours on end playing the same level. Sevral nights were wasted trying to get an A+ just to hear someone say 'Chips Challenge'    Yes that is a real thing    Which is really why it deserves my nomination for the 'Just 5 More Minutes' award even if im probably the only who will vote. But my answer came from the heart. And thats all that matters.
7961	1	a	Finally, a game all about 2016!
1269	0	a	First 15min Impressions: The Wonderful End of the World Verdict: Forgettable Katamari clone.  This is a straight-up Katamari Damacy clone, only you use a mouse and WASD instead of a gamepad.  I loved Katamari Damacy, but I'm thoroughly ambivalent about this game. It gets Katamari's core gameplay loop right, but it misses what makes Katamari Damacy special: - There is no delight in this game. WIthout delight, there's not much reason to play Katamari Damacy. - The level design is really uninspired. In Katamari there was always a way to grow, even if you went into an area that was too big for you. In this game it feels like there is only one way to beat a level. - It might be short. I played through half the visible levels in 15 minutes. Progressing required getting near 100% on all levels.  This might be worth 30-60 min of your time. Afterwards, you won't remember it.
7963	1	a	Planet Busters is an excellent crystal matching puzzle game. The setting, while not entirely unique, does offer the player a wide variety of strategic options. The music in particular is very well done in this title and along with the stage transitions keeps the gameplay moving forward smoothly. The Steam Overlay and widescreen options are supported, so if you are a fan of Bejeweled or Tetris, you will find a lot to like in Planet Busters.
7965	1	a	Match-3 game with extra goals. Not as involved as later titles in the series, and if you're on a post-Vista and/or 64-bit system, you'll need a custom patch to play it. I still recommend it if that sort of casual time-killer is your thing.
7967	1	a	This is the second game I've played in this series. Really enjoyed them both. Took about 4.5 hours to complete this whole game, but being a puzzle game, it has high replay value. I liked this one more than the original game. It still has the same overall game mechanics but without the rotating of the board. The original was more challenging for sure.   There's not really much to say. It's a standard match 3 game like Bejeweled. There's the 7 Wonders theme, but no story. I still find this to game to be the most fun in this genre besides Bejeweled. After playing both the original and the sequel, I will continue to play other games in the series.
7969	1	a	This is your typical Match 3 like Bejeweled. In each level, you match up 3 or more stones of the same color to reach your goal. There are also extra objectives on each level, like making a match with a certain color in a designated spot. There are different powers to get that you can charge up and use which make the game a little easier. Lots of secrets to unlock. As you progress, you get stones to help build a wonder.  The graphics are quite colorful. The music is non-offensive. No complaints about the controls.  Not a bad little match 3. These don't keep my interest for long, but this had enough going on for it that if I wanted to play something like that, I might as well pick it. Recommended if you like Match 3 puzzle games and are looking for more.  Grade: B-
7971	1	a	if you like relaxing and casual puzzle games then this one is for you.  the graphics are kind of aged and you can't even select another screen resolution but it gets the job done. however scaling the game to your actual screen resolution may cause everything to look slightly blurred.  the game starts easy and relaxing but gets more challenging later on. usually there is a time limit for each level so you don't have all day to finish the job but as soon as you get a grip on the game that shouldn't be a big problem. if you feel stuck just try another bonus ability and you should be able to make it through the game without breaking a sweat.  it takes about 7 hours to finish the game. i had to do it twice because i missed a piece of the map that makes you find the hidden chapter and sadly the game doesn't let you replay chapters. so that was a minor annoyance but it didn't keep me from having fun on the second run as well.  what can i say? i'm a perfectionist. no level gets left behind!
7973	1	a	You must know that 7 Wonders II is not the best puzzle game out on Steam. There are better ones, maybe even cheaper, but you also need to know that this isn't so bad. Almost 10 hours that i have spent playing this game is enough to say 'yup, it wasn't waste of money'. If you enjoy 3-match puzzle games then think about getting 7 Wonders II. Maybe not for full price, but on sale - why not.   Keep in mind that it may not work on modern operation systems - i'm still on Windows XP so i haven't got any problems, but if you are using Windows Vista/7/8 then you can have extra trouble getting to run this.  Remember to always check system requirements to avoid any problems.  
1274	0	a	a good match puzzle game. cant recommend cause this one does not have achievments.
7975	1	a	It's Bejeweled!
7977	1	a	Still i cant run it in 64 bit windows, 7 wonders vol. 4 runs perfect on 64 bit.
7979	1	a	Can get you to waste some hours. But nothing special.
7981	1	a	If you like simple puzzle games like bejewled or Bubbles: this try it out. Just to simple for my liking.
7983	1	a	Journey back in time with the 7 Wonders series to when magnificent structures were being built in far away lands. Enjoy challenging match-3 gameplay in a newly enhanced interactive environment where you not only learn about marvelous new wonders such as Stonehenge and Taj Mahal, but also watch them come to life piece by piece before your very eyes.  - Incredibly enhanced animation - New explosive power-ups such as the Single Cell Bomb, Chameleon and Timer Freeze - Seven all new locations to explore and Wonders to learn about - Strategically match, using a limited number, to get critical pieces down the board - Utilize a new shuffle option to refresh the board and keep the game moving - Take part in the construction by choosing what section of the Wonders to build first and visually see the progress on the screen and the game board
7985	1	a	Luxor Amun Rising is the follow up to the original Luxor.   Not much has changed since the last one; you still shoot balls and try to match 3 (+) to score points and stop the caterpillar from reaching your base.  I would rather go with one of the new(er) versions, also the price is pretty steep for a game like this.  Still I recommend the game because it's fun and addicting.
7987	1	a	Good little casual match 3 game. 89:100
1276	0	a	The follow up to the original Luxor but hardly differs from it's predecessor.  In case you don't know about this game: Your goal is to shoot the right colored balls at the at the balls in the 'snake' (so for example Red on Red), before the 'snake' reaches the exit.   It's a fun game but there are several reasons not to buy this one.  First of all the game is over 11 years old and still has the same expensive price. The second reason is that it's currently unplayable for me because apparently it doesn't work on Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.  
1277	0	a	Luxor 2 will not work on Windows 7. Two Bad becuse all the other ' LUXOR ' Games seemto2 work fine.   I can't find a work around, That works
1278	0	a	.
1279	0	a	why do i have this in my game library i dont even remember buying this   i dont want to associate my self with filthy casuals
7989	1	a	cool little casual game not very strenuous even on hard   68/100
7991	1	a	It's ok
7993	1	a	The best luxor game out of it's series. If you like games like luxor, don't pass up on this gem!
7995	1	a	The hours I've put into this game far outweights the price I paid for it. I got it on sale on a whim not know much about it. I saw from the screenshots the basic gameplay. I've put 25 hours into the game and while that might not seem like much given the gameplay and how much one 'level' lasts it is a long time. I've beaten it on easy, normal, hard and I'm now working on very hard. It is one of those types of games you can easily be playing forever.
7997	1	a	Obviously not much has changed since the first three Luxor games (Luxor 1, 2 &amp; Amung Rising). The graphics are slightly better and it's still a lot of fun to kill some time.   Is it worth it to buy this casual game for 10 bucks (normal price) ? Hell No! But I will still recommend this game IF being sold for a much lower price.
7999	1	a	+
8001	1	a	Casual ball-popping game. Nothing special. Doesn't work on Windows 7 x64.
1283	0	a	Preliminary note: As I write this, I'm done with 15 fields out of what seems like 20. I've unlocked every upgrade available and I'm still amassing money with no idea about what I'll actually do with it.  This game is definitely not bad. The puzzle system itself is intriguing, the aesthetics are nice and clean, and for a while, there's a good feeling of progression. I have some issues though: -The puzzle system is anything but relaxing. This game really feels like it ought to give you the time to think about potential moves. However, not only is there a time limit, but after a while you start seeing all sorts of critters and other things that threaten to destroy your crops. It makes the game feel frantic in a bad way, as it makes it hard to enjoy the strategic puzzle gameplay. -After you get every upgrade, the game starts feeling like a bit of a chore. There's just really nothing to aim for anymore, and it gets tedious.  I still managed to enjoy myself playing this, but I feel like I've seen all it's got to offer, so I will probably uninstall it shortly to avoid getting sick of it. Overall, not a bad game, but not one I'd go out of my way to play.  Note: This kind of game is the reason I wish the review system had a 'neutral' choice instead of a yes or a no.
8003	1	a	Very funny and kind of addictive matching puzzle game. It's easy to play and you'll learn very fast.  Little Farm have 20 levels, which one with 4 rounds to beat. You have to take care of your farm and earn money to buy improvements - each one that grants you a new tool or building - to better manage your crops, trucks and water, and deal with bugs, rabbits, crows and raining clouds. You get short comics, bonus levels and oil searching between that levels too.  The game reminds me Triple Town but with different mechanics, and a little of Plants vs. Zombies, because of the progression and shop/upgrade systems. This is very well done in this game too, you'll want to continue to play to buy that improvements and see them working. But at the very ending it gets boring, because you have to finish the last 5 levels or so, just collecting money but not being able to buy anything more. The only thing that keeps pushing me until the end was the Harvest Mode, unlockable just after finish the entire story mode.
8005	1	a	There are far better casual games out there, but this one isn't bad. It does get particularly repetitive toward the end, when all upgrades are purchased and you're left just doing the same thing over and over with no variation, but the timed element still keeps you somewhat on your toes. Essentially, it's your job as the farmer to harvest the appropriate vegetables to send to market, which you do by creating squares on the field that have the same vegetable in each corner. You will also need to deal with several different kind of pests and such along the way. So, not much of a storyline or challenge here, except in the fact that there is a timer that pressures you a bit toward the end, but it is overall quite relaxing. I did get the game in a bundle, and wouldn't have paid full price, but it is at least worth playing if casual games are something you enjoy at times. Really, it's basically what I had expected based on the description and screenshots, so I can't fault it for not being more than that.
1285	0	a	game does not run on Windows 10 :-(
1286	0	a	This game looked good for my kids aged 3-6, but you need good reading skills to play (practically no other way to work out how to play or what things mean), which rules out the younger kids, and it isn't that easy to follow what's going on. I would say it might be good for kids around age 8+  It is not good for younger kids than that.
1287	0	a	Little Farm is another one of these 'matching colour' games but this time you will have to match the vegetables. You have to draw squares on your field and in every corner there must be the same vegetable.  The game is easy to learn and not difficult so it's a nice kids game to play with for a few hours but nothing more.   
8007	1	a	You do more than farmin' with dem hoes in this game. Put on yo cowboy hat and get ready to show these redneck heehaws how real farmin' is done...In all serious businessness, this game is a realistic portrayal and simulator of real life farming. Prepare to be wow'd by the real labor of pointing, dragging, and clicking your crops to farm enough to make enough to feed your soon to be fatass lazy waifu and possibly a couple bratty kids. Experience the serious struggles of trying to make ends meet as you spray pests off your food (NO ORGANIC â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GROWN HERE BUDDY) and wonder why this toothy old man keeps eyeing your â™¥â™¥â™¥ every time you bend over to pick those tomatoes. Don't worry, he only wants to come pump your oil rig...pump it real good.

8009	1	a	The best farm game that features rabbit slapping and oil drilling you're likely to find.
8011	1	a	Fun puzzle game, not much more then that.
8013	1	a	by far the best matching game on steam :)
8015	1	a	Funny easy farming game very addictive puzzle type it dosen't require much thinking just get in there and enjoy it. I got it included in groupees bundle of games, didn't think i would play it but i was wrong and i love it.
8017	1	a	With some polish, this could have been a PopCap title. If you don't mind ugly and can grab it at a discount, this is a fun time-waster.
8019	1	a	really enjoy playing this fun puzzle game :)
8021	1	a	This game is freakin intense!
8023	1	a	Nice mini game  even the game is very simple, but.. I like it
8025	1	a	I was expecting this game to be yet another swap a jewel type but it is different with the whole make each corner have the same symbol. it makes a big difference to the game play and each level does get harder as you go through the game at a gradual pace.  
8027	1	a	Just as a heads up, this and a lot of the old Luxor games have issues running on modern Operative Systems.  You should try the demo and check if you can run it first.  In any case, if you happen to have bought it anyway and can't launch it (like me) you can workaround this issue.  Try making a Windows XP virtual machine and install Steam in it, then install the game. It's a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥, but it worked for me.  The game is great if you can actually play it.
8029	1	a	Addicting. Very addicting. Worth playing! :D
8031	1	a	Repetitive, difficult, and hella fun. Why? Well, the gameplay is repetitive as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (repeating levels every 3 stages, only to shove another new one in your face), the game's difficulty curve is reminiscent of the slope of K2, and well, at first this game seems like nothing other then the normal marble shooter. However, it has this charm the wants you to see the ending sooooo bad, or to find out what that NEXT ADDED â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LEVEL is, only to get owned by balls rolling into your base. You just can't put this game down unless you've actually finished it. Of course, this game's sequels are far better (and easier) and you should play them, but this is not simply a game you can just ignore. 
1292	0	a	This is probably the worse Luxor game out of the seven Luxor games available on steam. The Egyptian theme is very well done, but everything else feels very unoriginal and bland. I find the power-ups that do drop in Luxor to be very unsatisfactory and lacking in excitement. The map design appears to be rehashed continuously throughout the estimated ~8 hour play through. The music also doesnâ€™t change; I just end up muting the game completely and listen to my own music collection while playing Luxor. If you are a hardcore Zuma fan you may find some redeeming qualities in this game, but to be quite honest I would much rather play Zuma or the superior Luxor known as Luxor Evolved. For everyone else that is not really a fan of this genre and game type; just go buy Luxor Evolved and Zuma.
8033	1	a	I love this game! Why can't I play it on Windows 10?!?! :'(
1293	0	a	Eh, not as good as the other Luxor's. Not too many power ups. Gets really hard, some levels are really close to unbeatable. So definately not gonna recommend to anyone.
1294	0	a	Awesome game but doesn't run at all.
8035	1	a	Whatever
8037	1	a	I've played this one a lot, to engage the top level of my brain while I'm trying to figure out something else with the other parts of my brain. It's fun, a little mindless, but not in a bad way.
8039	1	a	I thought I would enjoy this game a lot, since I really like games that have you search for hidden objects, or find the differences between two pictures. But this game is hard. Objects are so well hidden, that you regularly have to use the Hint button (at no real cost). I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Probably a good thing, but THIS hard... I'm not sure.  Anyhow, I guess it can be fun with a couple of friends, but if you're playing alone, you basically have all the time in the world. That doesn't make it any easier, but it also doesn't make it any more fun. Still, you can't find a similar game like this on Steam, so if you're into these games this one is a must own.  [Rating: 67/100]
8041	1	a	Personally I would give it a neutral rating; it's not too bad, but it has its frustrating moments.  Good: - The game show idea is great - Mini games bring fresh ideas - Hidden Object fans will still waste time because, you know, we have to find all the things :)  Bad: - The graphics are very dated - Some objects are incorrectly grouped - Some objects are just a blur of pixels, good luck figuring out what they are  It's good enough to pick it up in a bundle :)
8043	1	a	it is a really good game dont get me wrong, the idea of it and the way the game is played but itsa hell of a good job you dont get timed as the graphics arent that great and at times it is quite hard to see the object you have to find
8045	1	a	Samantha could be Indiana Jones' relative (but she is not). :) I really enjoyed to play this little adventure of hidden object searching puzzle game. :) Setting is really nice, graphics are lovely. Puzzles are not too complicated, but some of them make you think of what to do next. I like the scanner option that shows you the shape of the item from the list once you click on its name. And if you make too many mistakes the scanner breaks for few seconds. I had really not many moments where I had to use the hints (which you collect by searching for a thunder symbol). I won't spoil anything, but I will just say that I really like the end of the game, so I really recommend to play it to see it. ;)
8047	1	a	This hidden object game tries to be different but it falls in mediocre category. It's fun when you want to waste time but meh, this game is only worth it when it's on sale.
8049	1	a	THey did a lot of RIGHT things in the is game. I like that i can use the hints to find the object i am looking for instead of a random object. I really like the little extra you get when leveling through game play. The game just makes sense, which is rare in some games in this genre.
1305	0	a	Very, very short and buggy hidden objects game. Really disappointing even when sold as part of cheap bundle.   This scrapes through with 30/100
1306	0	a	wont run game. says its running. but i duno where...space prolly. only way to shut it down is ctr-at-del. if anyone knows whats going on help meee.  till then a waste of 10 bucks
1307	0	a	It's quite buggy. My grandmother is trying to play it but the Gong never appeared and she cannot pick up the padded stick. So she is going to have to start over from scratch. It's old enough now they won't fix it so don't bother.
8051	1	a	Not much to say here. I enjoyed this game. I would probably play it again. I will definitely play the two sequels. It's a simple block matching game with a few unique features. You can rotate the board 90 degrees at a time as often as you want in either direction to control how the blocks fall. There are some decent boosters that can clear out an entire row or column. Once you clear the the board, a special block appears and an exit slot appears. You need to clear blocks around the special block to move it toward the exit. It can be a little more challenging than it sounds. As the levels progress, the configuration of the boards make you work around obstacles. It's a fun game. Total play time to completion was around 9 hours.
1308	0	a	Possibly the most poorly-aged of the 7 Wonders series. It's before the games began breaking things up and adding extra challenge in the form of resource management/bonuses for 'better time' or the city-building aspects, or variable difficulty, or the assistance of recharging powerups, but with the bonus irritation of 'hey, you know how you usually need to drop the key stone off the board? Now make it navigate a maze on some of the strangest-shaped boards in the series.'  The problem with that is that while you might think it's an interesting variant on match-3 gameplay (the board rotates to assist in this), the time limit is INSANELY generous. I don't know if I ever went down further than a third of the meter, and that was while I was passing out and zonking out for a few seconds at a time every so many moves. It's ludicrously liberal on time. So the game is in no way challenging, just sort of annoying. I can see reasons to play earlier 7W games, and the later ones redefine things in their own way, but god, this one's a relic.
8053	1	a	I haven't played many match-3 games so far, so I don't really know what's standard and what's considered exceptional among them, so let's get the basics out of the way first.  A gridded board is filled with stones of various shapes and colours. Switch adjacent stones around to match three or more in a vertical or horizontal line to remove them and make all the stones above drop down. In each square of the grid (underneath every stone) is a tile. For every match that's made over a tile, that tile is then removed. Remove all tiles on the board to complete the stage. As far as I know, that's the bare minimum for every match-3 game? But this has some extra features.  As you clear the tiles, you reveal a maze-like track hiding beneath the board. When all tiles are removed, a '7 block' appears at one end of the track, and a goal at the other where the block has to be moved to. Conveniently, you can rotate the board 90 degrees at any time to orientate the block to drop in the desired direction. At a certain point in the game locks are also introduced - coloured rings that cover the goal preventing the block from resting in it and a match of the same colour must be made within the same space in order to remove it. None of these hurdles are too troublesome at first, but when the size and shape of both the board and tracks start to become more elaborate, then things can get a little messy. Thankfully, though, there are special items to aid you in your task.  There are rewarded for matching more than three stones at a time. If you match four, an item appears on the board that will clear an entire horizontal line of all stones and tiles in one go. Matching five will give you an item that clears everything in both a horizontal and vertical line. And at random points a die appears, which when moved, will clear a handful of random squares scattered across the board. On occasion you'll also be given the optional objective of completing a match of a certain colour within an allotted time. If you succeed the clock will be frozen momentarily. But given how much time they give you for every stage, this is something of a none-issue and I don't think I ever even came close to the halfway mark on the timer, so you shouldn't need to worry about that.  The unique spin the game tries to put on its presentation is that all of these tiles you're collecting goes towards the assembly of a Wonder, with every stage you complete getting you closer to building it. There are nine Wonders to build, with seven stages each, the first six taking place on the outer surfaces of a cube, and the final stage being inside it, which is a nice little touch. But aside from the visuals and theme, there's nothing special or particular about it that actually adds to the gameplay in any way.  This isn't the most challenging game in the world, and truth be known, I did find myself getting a little bored and going through the motions towards the end. But I still never actually had a bad time at any point and found it was just the right length to not entirely wear out its welcome. So if you're looking for a casual little time killer and can pick it up at a decent enough price, then you could really do a hell of a lot worse than this.
8055	1	a	   Fun little Time-water   I remember playing the original 7 Wonders game and several of the follow ups in the past. I can't remember where I played them, but I do remember the art style, and building the 'Wonders'. So, let's get into it here...   Pros:  -Game is exactly what it is advertised as: A   Casual   Match 3 Puzzle game. (And by Casual, I mean VERY Casual...) -Nice music -Nice graphics -Runs smoothly on a toaster, or a potato, or a turnip... would run well on a mobile device (which is what it seems best suited for...) -Workers are still as cute and annoying as always, annoying enough to be cute or vice versa -Board rotation (allowed constantly w/o needing to earn it), and needing to move a special piece through a set path, to lock it into a specified location to finish each level is different from many Match 3 games, so a few twists on the standard. -EASY, with a very generous timer and power ups (This is both good and bad... good if you want very casual and easy...)   Cons:  -EASY, possibly TOO easy for anyone looking for a challenge. Timer allows far too much time to really ever feel any imperative to make matches quickly, power ups are almost too easy to get and too plentiful. Totally subjective. - Price - I got a key for free, so I can't complain. But I would NOT recommend this game at full price ($10 USD is way too much), would not recommend unless you get it for 75% off or more.  Game has replayability to a degree, since it does rely on random placement of the tiles you have to match. I have played for a few hours, 15 minutes at a time. I could keep playing this as a pure, casual, relaxed time waster. But it is at the bottom of my list if I want a challenge tbh.  Fun little game, but don't get this thinking it is as 'difficult' as earlier versions of the game, The frustration and challenge were removed in this version. That said, it would be a great game for kids, because the satisfaction of completing levels and successfully building a Wonder are almost guaranteed. But a possible disappointment to fans of earlier versions of the game.  6/10 Overall Would buy at 75% off or better, would never buy at full price of $9.99 USD
1309	0	a	this game isn't all bad but it's just not good enough to recommend it. i know you can hardly complain about casual games being casual but this one is really overdoing it.  you can rotate the board for a change and after you have destroyed all locked fields you have to guide the key stone to the key hole though a maze on the board. that's nice and interesting. for the first five levels. but then it gets old really fast and this game has a total of about 70 levels. there is a timer on each level but it's like 20 minutes or something. at no point there is any kind of pressure or danger of losing. some boards are so poorly designed you get a 'no more moves' message every 30 seconds. or you are stuck for 5 minutes just because the gods of randomly colored blocks wont give you the ones you need to progress. horrific!  rotate &amp; swipe, rotate &amp; swipe, rotate &amp; swipe... pretty much like a mobile game. and there is absolutely no other gameplay element in the game so it gets repetitive, boring and tedious very quickly. i finished the game in just under 8 hours and that's just as much boredom as i can take. i just uninstalled after winning and i will never touch it again.  if you want to play a game like this i recommend '7 Wonders II'. that one is actually very enjoyable to play and well worth spending time and money. but this one here is a stinker.
8057	1	a	Basically this is a pretty decent time waster if one has time to waste. I have to say though..it's pretty easy and not very challanging for me at all. The basic concept is matching gems and breaking blocks then when the blocks are cleared you have to move a master block into its slot by matching the gems and rotating the screen. With that being said I completed the game fully and just really wrote this review so I could knock it off my list of games I have played through.
8059	1	a	100% pure casual match-3 game. Good presentation, graphics and not too annoying music and sound effects.  A nice touch, compared to other match-3 games, is the fact that you can turn the board, which also is necessary when, after you have cleard all the tiles, you need to guide a special block down a path from A to B and through portals.  Great game for what it is.
8061	1	a	Undemanding little puzzle game good for playing in a spare moment  63/100   
8063	1	a	An extremely addicting puzzle game and kept me going when I had no internet for a whole month! Gets progressively harder overall, this is a shallow incline, but during an actual challenge to build the wonder its gets increasingly difficult. I've never run out of time, actually i've never passed even halfway before on the timer but it can get quite tricky and fustrating at times ;) Definitely recommened a purchase and play if its going cheap!
8065	1	a	I played this game once then again and again and again then once more.
8067	1	a	Edit: Because I have been asked and the shop description isn't really telling much:  If you haven't ever played any Luxor game before and do not know what the game is about
1312	0	a	Another Luxor game, If I'm correct this is the 5th installment in the series.   I won't explain what the game is about again but obviously 'Quest For The Afterlife' is pretty much exactly the same as it's predecessors. The main difference is the graphics are better and this time there's some kind of story but who cares about a story in a game like this?  The game is still fun and addicting but like I've already said it doesn't do much different from the other games in the series so I'd rather would've picked a 'neutral rating' but I simply do not recommend it for the price it's being sold for.
8069	1	a	not as challenging as previous versions of this stalwart casual puzzler  69/100
1313	0	a	I like this game very much, I just do not recommend this particular Steam version which does not work! The game cannot even be launched under Win 8.1 64-bit, the process just hangs and has to be killed manually.
1314	0	a	Games Crashes Everytime on Upon Loading
8071	1	a	I think Some games published by Gamehouse deserve to be released in Steam, like: Rolling idols and Rolling idols: Lost city, Stoneloops! of Jurassica and some developed by Mumbo jumbo, like: Elements and Mad caps
8073	1	a	I felt like it's kinda easier than the 'Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena'. Especially because of the scanner option change. Now when you click on the name of the item, the scanner shows you not only the shape of it, but it also changes the color to red once you are close to find the item (like a hide and seek, hot and cold child play). I still like the game. Story is very nice and the graphics put a big smile on my face. I must say that in this game you need to be more precise where to click (I got frustrated few times cause I was clicking right at the object and still the game told me that I'm wrong...and my scanner was breaking way more often than in the previous game), so it takes more time to play this game (I don't mind to play it long). You have way more dialogues in this game, you are solving more puzzles and some of them are harder than the ones in 'Hidden Roses of Athena' (especially the Zodiac puzzle, where you have to be very precise). But overall, like I said at the beginning, I felt like it's bit easier game. I totally recommend this game. You don't have to play 'Hidden Roses of Athena' first to understand this one. :) Combo of those two is really nice though. :)
8075	1	a	This is the sequel to Samanth Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, and it follows exactly the same formula: you visit different countries searching for separate components to a myserious object that will save the day. Each place you visit involves a number of hidden object scenes, finding things that are lying around, and using tools in mostly obvious (and sometimes extremely unlikely) places. Occasionally there's a mild puzzle to solve, such as solitaire, match 3, jigsaw puzzles etc. It's all very easy, the cartoony style makes the objects stand out quite clearly, although in each scene there's usually one or two objects that are hidden a little better than the others. However, the game really falls over itself to give you hints, clues and not-so-gentle nudges, so you're unlikely to get stuck for more than half a minute. Hover a tool anywhere in the general vicinity of where you have to click, and a shower of sparkles erupts from your cursor. No doubt there, then! There are an abudance of hints that basically show you exactly what to do, by the end of the game we'd amassed nearly 40 of them and didn't use one. I mean, it's all good, clean fun and best enjoyed as a group, but it was easier than the first game. It really needs a 'hard mode' where you can turn all that stuff off. Still, a good time was had by all, and I'd recommend it if you like this kind of thing. Just don't expect much of a challenge.
8077	1	a	Simple, sweet, Point and Click/Hidden Object game. Some hit detection, and rotation cursor issues. Music was good. Overall 9/10. Just don't expect an epic. It's definitely a kids game, or something to kill time.
8079	1	a	Nice little relaxing casual game. The series is really fun and well thought-out. The art is amazing and I definitely recommend it if you want a break from shooting stuff all the time.
8081	1	a	Pretty game, but short and easy. (My total hours are inflated because I kept forgetting to exit the game and left it running while not playing it.) Good choice if you like hidden object games, but only recommended if on sale and bought in a bundle with the other Samantha Swift game. Rating: 3/5
8083	1	a	Nice little relaxing casual game. The series is really fun and well thought-out. The art is amazing and I definitely recommend it if you want a break from shooting stuff all the time.
8085	1	a	I thought Iâ€™d be nice and let a 72 year old villager retire, so instead of constantly working he could do what he wanted.  Here's me thinking he'll relax, go swimming and admire the flower beds like all the other villagers do between work. I took a break from the game for a bit and came back to check the villagers before I went to sleep...  ...HE IMPREGNANTED TWELVE OF THE WOMEN, THREE OF WHICH HAD TWINS. I came back onto the game and caught him trying to 'embrace' yet another woman. NOW THERE'LL BE A FOOD SHORTAGE, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, SOLE? YOU GINGER DEMON.  This is my first attempt at this game and it was going pretty well until Sole went and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up everything. Literally.  For some reason I just had a real urge to play some kind of sim game recently. I didn't want anything overly complicated and I remembered these games. I used to watch my sister play them when I was a bit younger and always thought they looked fun. It's a little nostalgic playing this myself now, I'm hoping I can solve all the puzzles, get all the upgrades and build up a fairly good village before I lose.  I think itâ€™s pretty fun for something to check on every now and then and try and figure out all the puzzles. The Puzzles and survival element being the majority of the game. You raise a village by giving villagers jobs, making them breed and using your newly trained villagers to make discoveries. There are 16 puzzles to solve, all of which are discoveries you can lead your villagers to.   The game is made a bit harder by â€œrandom eventsâ€ that happen, which usually gives you a choice and you can either benefit from it or something bad can happen. Itâ€™s possible to gain/lose part of your food supply, your research and even be hit by disease.  Iâ€™ve been playing this in-between the main games Iâ€™m trying to complete and once I have done everything here, there are a few sequels I can move onto for more puzzles and such! I look forward to trying the others out as well.   All in all itâ€™s a fun little game/franchise. Itâ€™s nothing amazing but it kills time in a fun way I would say.   TL;DR : A fun little sim game. Itâ€™s not the best game in the world but itâ€™s a good time killer between other things.  
8087	1	a	Epic game, you get annoyed by the 'no' and 'uh uh' from the characters when you want them to do something and they won't but I already spent a good 50 hours per game in this franchize before I baught this. I've beaten the 4th game (which Steam should add *hint**hint*) and gotten close to beating the other 3.
8089	1	a	Virtual Villagers is a fun game when you some time to kill. Basically, you have some shipwrecked people and you have to figure out 16 puzzles and level up 6 skills (techs) to help your villagers prosper. You can set individual villagers to do different tasks like forage, build, heal, research, and breed, The villagers will grow old or can sick so watch out for that. It's a real time game, which means the game continues on when you're not playing.   Be warned, this game does not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around about the real time aspect. Last night I had 13 villagers (mostly females) and I set one male to be a breeder. I woke up to find I had 63 villagers ( 5 scientist adults and everyone else was a child), almost no food and a pile of skeletons. The real time can make losing easy.
8091	1	a	Cool game 10/10 would play again =-O
1321	0	a	Casual Play itself game. Not offensive but I can't recommend it unless you have loads fo time to kill (and don't want to think)
8093	1	a	land on an island, and keep the little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s alive, thats about it, all the virtual villagers are the same, fun games but kinda slow going
8095	1	a	anoyingly fun considering the game is just a bunch of simple sprites moving about a basic map. it is surprisingly in depth and addictive in the pursuit of carrying on the generations of your beloved sprites and remarkbly very few bugs.
8097	1	a	The second of the series and it is fun, I'd say a little better as there seems to be more flushed out. Great to come back to as it is in real time so you can just check back every now and then. A Great game for killl/passing time.
8099	1	a	same mechanics as the first one, just a new story and goals. still fun though. good to have running in the background or for playing in class. only have to check on it every half hour or so 
1325	0	a	
8101	1	a	I played this game as a kid with my dad. It's an old one for sure. It's fun, though! It doesn't have a ton of replay value, but the first time through the game, there are puzzles to solve and achievements to get! It's cute and simple, but can be played with any computer, and it's long-lasting!
8103	1	a	Very simple yet fun game to kill time for whatever reason if you are bored or waiting for something. The plants also grow when you're not playing but you can at anytime on the menu screen make time faster, slower, or pause it if you happen to be too busy to play or free, whice is a plus for me. If you are not into relaxing or simple games, then I wouldn't recommend it.
8105	1	a	A LIFE CHANGING GAME MAKE SURE TO WATER PLANTS
8107	1	a	A very light-weight game that brings you back to a time where micro-transactions were nonexistant and you could happily farm, plant, whatever without having to hand over your credit card, watch ads or praticipate in a shady promotion...  A little history lesson: Before tablet games saturated the video game market with free titles you could download and turning out to be micro-transaction riddled hooplahs, we had games like this. Games like Plant Tycoon would often be found on gaming websites or the game sections of popular social networking sites where you could play the game on the website as a limited demo version or download a free full version for a limited time before a timer ran out and asked you if you liked the full game and if you wanted to buy it from their service.  Keep this history lesson in mind!  My personal history with this game: I was a lonely shut-in middle schooler... I had stopped going to normal school and spent nearly all of my time inside the house because i wasn't allowed to go outside. So i often played games on the internet on my old Windows XP computer. One of them was Plant Tycoon. I played it on a website called Shockwave . com which as described above - was one of those sites where you could play the game on the site as a demo version or download a full version for free that would ask you if you wanted to purchase the title from their server after a timer ran out. I always played the demo version, but i always found myself loving this game. It was perfect when i needed to get homework done or needed to practice my typing skills because it ran on real time. No needing to worry about pausing the game and coming back to it - it's a game you run in the background while you do your actual work. So when i saw the game on Steam all these years later on a Windows 7 laptop with wifi my nostalgia kicked in and i played the demo again, waiting for a sale on the actual title to happen...  But it never did...  For some reason this game never seems to go one sale, which was upsetting... But ultimately after arguing with myself, i spent a full 10 bucks on the title. But that proved to be 10 bucks well spent as if you're the type to justify a game's price with the hours you get out of it - you may find yourself sinking HOURS into Plant Tycoon... And don't let my current amount of gameplay hours fool you. I played the crap out of this game online in my middle school days.  And that brings us back to the history lesson from before:  Compare Plant Tycoon to any similar tablet game you'll find on your iPad or Kindle today... They may be free to download - yes - but then they'll ask you to either pay for some in-game currency with real money, subcribe to a service or you try to play for 'free', but then you end up paying with time - watching ads, doing fishy promotions, ect.  So when you compare the option of a pay-to-wait game on your tablet and Plant Tycoon on Steam - you're probably better off with Plant Tycoon.  The game has no micro-transactions that cost real money - everything you can buy you can buy with in-game currency. It runs on real time - yes - but there are options to decide how fast or slow that in-game time moves and there's even an option to stop the clock entirely - a good option for if you're going to bed or know you won't be touching your computer for a while. The price may seem high but when compared to similar tablet games you end up with a better deal in the long run... This is really a 'mom' game. This is the kind of game that requires patience, so feel free to run it in the background while you work, cook or do any other time consuming activity you can't normally do while playing games.  10 dollars is still a bit much for such a light-weight and somewhat dated game, but it doesn't ever seem to go on sale... It might be one of those rare titles that only goes on sale very few times a year? If you can snag it on sale - by all means do it. But if you or your kids are sick of tablet games that are constantly begging you for money or bombaring you with ads and you need a pay once - play forever alternative: Plant Tycoon is your game.  Plant Tycoon gets 5 out of 5 from me both with and without nostalgia goggles.
8109	1	a	I always wondered what it would be like to grow pot. Thanks to Plant Tycoon, I was able to realize the financial possibilities and explore myself during a time of identity crisis. Thank you, Plant Tycoon. I would definitely recommend this simulator to anybody considering producing illicit products as a living.
8111	1	a	Played this game since I was still a kid, this brings back memories and is still a wonderful game to this day, would recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest some time in growing virtual plants and to relax, destress after a long day at school/work or after raging at a FPS game like Counter Strike or Team Fortress 2.
8113	1	a	This game is very relaxing and fun. You breed+sell plants, catch bugs, and upgrade your equipment. I had it a few years ago and put countless hours into it; now that it's on steam, I expect to put many, many more.   If you like games that you can run in the background and check in on every once in a while, you'll like this game. If you want to sit there and be doing things constantly, than it might not be for you. It takes real time for your plants to grow and finding all the magic plants takes a lot of patience.
8115	1	a	This is possibly one of my fave little time-wasters I use to chill out when I need it. The graphics aren't necessarily the slickest or most HD these days, but the premise and mechanics of growing various plants while you're away keeps me coming back after all this time. Additionally the options to change how fast in-game time passes, and the ability to pause it when you're away for an extended period is one of my fave features of the game.
8117	1	a	I love this game! Requires a lot of patience but it is very entertaining :)
8119	1	a	Nice plant simulator with puzzle. Have to stop myself from losing myself in it. Hope to retry a new level again soon.
8121	1	a	kinda cool, bread plants, crush bugs, pretty basic, nothing major
8123	1	a	Very nice if you're looking to just relax and watch plants grow.
8125	1	a	By far the best game on steam after farming simulator. God damn what a game this is, you gotta plant the plants and you have to sell them and you have to catch the bugs well you do not have to do it but you can to have fun and it is a really addictive and fun game watching and waiting for the plants to grow you can masterdebate if you know what I say haha
8127	1	a	Simple yet so fun! Only downside is that there should be an...'proactive' mode, where the plants grow super super fast.
8129	1	a	So actually this is a pretty well made little tycoon game. If you're down with keeping it chill sometimes, this is a nice little gem. While you may not be able to capture the feel of becoming a captain of industry with this title, it will melt your stresses away.  The idea behind the game is to cross-breed plants together so they create unique seeds. Plant the seeds and wait for them to grow to see if you've found a rare species you can farm &amp; sell.  Obviously this isnt a game for everyone but its a solid tycoon title if you can handle the subject matter.
1326	0	a	This game is free from the developer's website, there is no Steam cloud saving, no cards, and no achievements. There is literally no reason to buy the Steam version, unless you like spending money.  If you need a link to the website, here it is.  http://www.ldw.com/fish_tycoon.php 
8131	1	a	The concept for fish tycoon works for the man who is occupied with work and can every so often take a short break to check on things, such as social media and, in this case, virtual fish. This is not a casual experience you sit in front of and make stuff happen, this is a game were everything takes it's sweet time to do...something-anything! It does things on its own, and every so often you need to come back and make sure nothing dies. Although its not the best game, it certainly is entertaining.
8133	1	a	What an immersive game! Hour upon hour with what seems to be endless gameplay of pure fun. Whether you going for the big catch(no pun intended), or casually enjoying the company of the incredibly wide variety of fish, you are going to have a brilliant time - a must buy in the 21th century.
8135	1	a	10/10
8137	1	a	I remember playing this when I was 6 or so. This game was my entire childhood. I remember the first game I made, I over fed my fish. This game is the best. Its exactly the way I rememeer it. Im happy I convinced my mom to buy it for me. Very worth it!
8139	1	a	Restarted game until I got double the first magic fish you can have, bred them, sold them for high prices, got them their own tank, forgot to feed them, and raged. GREAT GAME THOUGH!
8141	1	a	It's an old game that I used to play and loved. If you like sim games this is a good one. Just make sure you turn off the time before you leave the game or all your fish will die.
8143	1	a	Such Fish most wet WOW
8145	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. Worth every penny...all 100 of them.
8147	1	a	so fun a little hard at first if you like fish get this game
8149	1	a	Tedious, time-consuming, but always get drawn back to playing.
8151	1	a	the game is a very good mix of adventure and thinking as well as having a nice difficulty to it
8153	1	a	very fun and has a nice puzzle..   9/10 for the gameplay 10/10 for 3 years old tribal chief..
8155	1	a	this game is pretty relaxing but you have to know what to do to get the food coming it's an enjoyable game if you like to play as god I guess also I wish the other Virtual Villager would be on steam too
8157	1	a	These games can get a little addicting, but you definitely need a lot of tips online to continue it in some parts, most things are well hidden and are confusing at best so I found I needed quite a bit of help. Good game but not my favorite in the genre.
8159	1	a	I love the series of Virtual Villagers, I do so hope they get number 4, 5 and 6 on Steam too soon! &lt;3 This one is, like the others, a real time game with some simulation and strategy over, and it can be challenging, but not so much that you can't relax at the same time. ^_^
8161	1	a	Designed to entice children, then force dad to figure it out. Boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ after a while.
8163	1	a	still love it but it seems to take a lot longer for things to happen tech point and building percentage wise
8165	1	a	Easy, fun, casual. Great to have going in the background when you are doing something
8167	1	a	Virtual Families is like Tamagotchi evolved. Think of it like sims, only that the game continues even when you're asleep. The music is terrific, you can bond with your virtual family really good, and keep them on their toes, to guide them to prosperity. Its simple yet addicting.
8169	1	a	Cute, simple, and entertaining. Not bad if you're looking for something casual or laid back with a small amount of management. I recommend buying it during a sale or just playing the app for free through Googleplay. At the current price, I would say you're probably overpaying. It could use some improvement, but overall I like it and find it mildy amusing; enough to keep revisiting it in my library.
1335	0	a	Was great for 9 generations until the game would not offer a spouse until I was 51, and then they couldn't conceive. The game is over if you don't have any children to pass on to.  All the hours I spent getting to 98% completed on 'trophies' was wiped out.   I wish I had never played this game.
8171	1	a	Now this is a casual game. You can play it for 5 minutes, not even, and then shut it off to come back hours later to find them only a few 'years' older or you can leave it for a day and it's the same thing really. I'm on the second generation and I still haven't purchased all upgrades. O_o
8173	1	a	Loving having this game again after losing my old copy years ago! Hope to see the sequel here someday!
1336	0	a	No. Just no. You can make food, make the people shower or make them pick up socks and wrappers.  There have been NO UPDATES, no new content, no improvements.  This game was thrown together for the devs to make a quick 10$.  Get the Sims.. at least its an actual game.
8175	1	a	can't make them â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, i wanna see â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ action i wanna see these little 8 bit â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s doing it
1340	0	a	This is one of the worst puzzle games Iâ€™ve ever played. I donâ€™t even know where to start.  So the object of the game is to wait for some colored dots to spawn, then click on a variety of stationary tools to get them to fly into receptor objects. Sometimes the dots will fly wildly all over the screen until you activate magnets to suck them up. Other times they will break or decay and need to re-spawn. Yet other times they donâ€™t respawn, so if you mess up the puzzle you need to start all over. There are a few good ideas, but what game doesnâ€™t have a few good ideas? Here, itâ€™s completely destroyed by a large number of issues:  * Non-deterministic physics. When I first played the game, the introductory level told me to â€œjust watch.â€ Then physics glitched out and two particles collided when they should not have, breaking the level and leaving me staring at the screen until I realized I had to restart. Things didnâ€™t get much better from there.  * Most of the puzzles donâ€™t involve planning, but having highly precise aim and timing. This is â€œI know what I need to do, but itâ€™s taking me two hundred tries to do it: the gameâ€   * Solved the puzzle? â€“ Great, now you have to do it again. Four times. For some reason, clearing most stages requires you to repeat the exact same actions several times in a row, usually four times, sometimes more. All the while, the physics could glitch out at any time and require a restart.  * The only texture in the game is the space background. White textureless models are hard on the eyes and make it difficult to distinguish between different objects.  * Twitch-reaction solutions are very frustrating when they require quickly clicking on multiple tiny objects.  * Camera controls are a joke; the camera and the game canâ€™t be controlled at the same time, and it resets at the beginning of every level.  * The only music is a few 12-second ambient loops. Sounds are unremarkable. (The voice-overs for the tutorials were decent, though)  * It is impossible to play this game in full-screen if you have multiple monitors, it will crash instantly. You need to edit a config file just to let it run.  In short, this game is irritating, obtuse, unrewarding, glitchy, and visually awful.   On the bright side, I got all of the achievements in under 5 hoursâ€¦ so if youâ€™re an achievement hunter, go for it, just donâ€™t expect to have much fun.
8177	1	a	If you like puzzle games, this is a pretty good one. My only complaint is that there are not enough maps. Although there are player made maps, it just isn't the same.
8179	1	a	A very clever yet obscure puzzle game. I would definitely try this if you are considering.
1341	0	a	No! This is not a Splinter Cell game. It has nothing do with stealth. It's puzzle game about particles and magnetism.   Your task is to make the particles reach their destination. Red have to end up at red collector and green have to end up in a green collector. That's the logic of the game. The game introduces you new mechanics and teaches how to use tools. The mechanics are based on forces of magnetism. In order to finish the map you have to use properly distributors, rotator, plarity inverters just to mention a few. Timing and thinking ahead is important. Sometimes direction you shoot particles has meaning.   The game doens't feature any rewind/quicksave/checkpoint system, so you have to finish a level in one go. Since this game belongs to the group of trial and error games you will often spend long time repeating levels. Some of them require speed, some timing and some require planning. Later levels combine all of those. Additionally you can't speed up certain actions - you just have to wait... zzz. You are waiting and waiting, and you don't want to carry on. I just don't have patience for it. Let me do it.  The presentation is average. There are very few options. Graphics is basic, so is the sound. On the other end music is pleasant. It's strange, but fits the game perfectly.  The repetitive nature of the game as well as lack of mid-level save system made me quit playing it. I found that too tiresome. Repeating things over and over. Meh... This and the fact I was stuck in a few levels with no clue how to solve them made me quit the game. It's not a bad game, but I guess I lost interest and my patience didn't let me finish. Since I can't really recommend it, so I'm giving it thumbs down. 
8181	1	a	A silly tower defense game. Fortunately, I happen to like silly tower defense games. It offers a decent variety of towers and enemies, always a key ingredient. (Although I found some of the tower types more or less indispensable, and others pretty worthless.) You get money from killing enemies, but also from building generators, so there is that tension between investing and beefing up your defenses.   Lastly, the game brings us something new: orbiting towers. All your defenses must be placed at preset points in 2-4 rings surrounding your ship/station. These rings are fixed in distance from the center, and the build points are fixed in distance from each other, but the entire ring can be rotated. This lets you move your towers into position near the enemy's attack paths (highlighted by glowy dotted lines), or even follow a wave around to keep it in range longer. Since the levels are in space, with no real 'terrain', this is a good way of doing things.  One of the game's strongest points is actually not the system itself, but the whole aesthetic. The entire thing, down to the last detail, is done over to look like a cheesy, low-budget, 40s/50s sci-fi movie/TV show. The costumes in the live-action cutscenes, the flying saucer enemies, the robots that look like they were patched together from old car parts, the towers that look like they're made of cardboard and tinfoil, and the buttons &amp; iconography on the menus all appear just like you'd expect them to. I've never played a game that did something similar, and while I wouldn't want it to become a trend, it really works here.
8183	1	a	Very good game vintage.   The rotating orbits add challenge to the normal tower defense games. Bought in a discount. Good soundtrack.  Good references to B-Sci Fi movies.
8185	1	a	I usually can't stand tower defense games but I LOVED Unstoppable Gorg. A literal twist on the genre with an awesome mid 20th century sci-fi TV theme and great graphics. If you love tower defense games - get it. If you hate tower defense games get it anyway because it's a steal and you'll be supporting Futuremark - makers of programs like PCMark and 3Dmark not to mention Shattered Horizon!
8187	1	a	funny and unstoppable game  9/10  Advantages:Many satellites with different abilities and innovative gameplay Disadvantages::Pre-defined space for your satellites may impair gameplay  jogo engraÃ§ado e imparÃ¡vel 9/10 Vantagens: Muitos satÃ©lites com diferentes habilidades e jogabilidade inovadora Desvantagens: espaÃ§o prÃ©-definido para os seus satÃ©lites podem prejudicar gameplay
8189	1	a	A middling tower defense game. Has decent graphics and cool retro-futurism designs and cinematics. Its very original concept, a tactical perimeter based on satelites and orbits around a base or planet, is ruined by emplacements restriction, the marching of foes timed to the second, and the random trayectories of asteroids that prevent get better classifications. Sometimes the weapons point to closer enemies instead of ones first of the row... Requires many patience and perseverance to pass levels at high difficultly with perfect stadistics. Worth with a great discount.
8191	1	a	An nice little tower defence game, seems fairly challanging. Not my favourite genre of game, so perhaps you should look elsewhere for a review of gameplay comparisons, but I can say I found them enjoyable. Being able to rotate the orbits of your defence buildings is an interesting mechanic, meaning the placement of your guns takes a little more spacial awareness than it would elsewhere. As far as I played, the maps seems smaller than other games, where you'd place less towers, but as you're expected to move them this is a good thing. Means you have to conisder your placements even more.  Why I love this game is the style. Playing through the story you get 50's style info clips, with a perfectly done voice over, perfect cheesy style, film of bad alien costumes and spaceships hanging from wires, It's lovely, and fits so well. It even has a couple of easter eggs in the films, which was a nice touch. Anyone who has ever smiled at cheesy 1950s sci-fi stuff will enjoy these scenes. You couple that with a like of tower defence and spacial awareness puzzles and you should maybe buy this.
8193	1	a	I absolutely LOVE this game -- it's probably my favorite indie title ever. It has a goofy retro sense of humor which perhaps some younger gamers don't appreciate, so just to avoid any possible confusion: it is NOT trying to be serious. Some folks complain that it's too hard for a 'casual' game, but I didn't find that to be true at all. True, I had to repeat some levels several times before I got through them -- but do you really want a game that you can beat in one sitting? I think of each level as a puzzle that has to be solved rather than a simple anything-goes shoot 'em up. Most of all I appreciate that this game has in abundance something that most are completely lacking: style. I periodically return to play through the whole campaign just to experience that. An unreserved thumbs up.
8195	1	a	A fun 50's Sci-Fi Tower Defence game. Cutscenes are brilliant, gameplay is good.
8197	1	a	pretty fun for the price
8199	1	a	TL;DR summary: A tower-defense game with an interesting twist and a fun theme. Recommended if you can get it while it's on sale.  This one was a pleasant surprise. I think everyone is sick of tower-defense games by now, but this one has a pretty interesting mechanic. You place your defense sattelites on building spots on orbits. Each orbit can be freely rotated, but only the entirety of the orbit can be moved. So you can click and drag your towers to make them follow the critters, but you run the risk of moving other towers on the same ring *away* from enemy paths. Similarly, you might end up moving support towers near enemies where they have no business being. So it's a bit more involved than just placing towers and clicking 'go'. So that's fun! The difficulty seems alright, too. I can generally make 'Moderate' at first try. 'Hard' and 'Unstoppable', not so much. There are a few nuisances - like having to reassign Research Points at the start of *every* mission - but nothing too grating.  The writing is pretty nice. Obviously, a game like this isn't going to have astonishing Deus Ex-esque plot - actually, the fact that there's a plot at all surprised me. It's deliberately patterned after horrible old sci-fi movies, which is nice if you like it. (I very much do!) If you don't, well, you can skip the cutscenes and you won't lose anything.   So on the overall, I'd say this is well worth it, if you can get it for less than 10 dollars. A few things made me roll my eyes - really, you don't need to tell me five times about what enemies are vulnerable to - and obviously it's a bit rough around the edges, but nothing big. I could see this do nicely on mobile devices. How about an Android port?
8201	1	a	â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Â½ Even though gameplay is an alright concentric-ringed tower-defense game, i'm a big fan of their '50s-style sci-fi art and thematic cutscenes.
8203	1	a	Lots of fun, what a blast and I loved the retro serial style clips.
8205	1	a	Quite fun, retro style video clips.  Limited placements on towers, but with spinning orbits makes it a different type of td.
8207	1	a	A Tower Defense game with an interesting twist. And the gameplay isn't the only awesome thing this game has to offer: the inter-mission cutscenes, stylized as humorous sci-fi movies from the first half of the previous century are brilliant and well-made.   It may not be very long, but it sure is worth the few â‚¬ it costs. If you like TD, definitely give it a try.
8209	1	a	This is everything right and wrong with gaming.  I lack the superlatives necessary to explain how great the aesthetic of the interstitials in this game are; Retro-â™¥â™¥â™¥ 1950s tin-can science-fiction â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with squeaky-voiced rubber aliens and spinning newsprint headlines so earnest in their zany â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t it is beyond all definitions of endearing.  ...the game is basically every tower defense game you've ever played.  Gaming, I wish I could feel fulfilled by you. I wish I could commit. But baby, you just ain't there for me the way I need you to be.
8211	1	a	A very difficult tower defence game. you can move around the orbits of satilites which I thought would make it easier, but it really didn't. It just makes it incredibly difficult.
8213	1	a	Cool Game for many hours of Fun !!!
8215	1	a	Unstoppable Gorg is a charming tower defense title with, unfortunately, some flaws. Planet Earth is your base, and you can use orbits to place sattelites (which are your towers actually). It's just that it's very limited... since there are predetermined spots where you can place sattelites. When I bought this game I was initially thinking I would be able to place them anywhere on the orbit lines, but that's just not the case. Besides that, the game can get frustratingly hard, resulting in an aweful lot of replays. Now, the graphics do look good and the sounds get the job done as well. But it's nothing special really. The movies inbetween are kinda cool though, using real actors and stuff.  But in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Unstoppable Gorg just isn't the tower defense title I hoped it would be. Still, you really can't go wrong with tower defense games, so if that's your genre I suggest you try it out anyway.  [Rating: 63/100]
8217	1	a	Tower Defense in the form of Satellite Defense. There is a high level of challenge in later missions, especially on the 'Unstoppable' difficulty level.  Many will appreciate the humorous cutscenes. There are a few game modes - Story, Challenge and Arcade, so there's some decent gameplay hours if you want to finish the game.
8219	1	a	Good RTS / Turret Defense. Plus has some replay value, with its unstoppable difficulty, challenges and arcade mode.
8221	1	a	Don't worry, the GORGs in this? They're actually stoppable.
8223	1	a	Get ready to experience a revolution in tower defense that will send you spinning. Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations.  Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world.
8225	1	a	Fun spin on the tower defense genre with a 1950's invasion from outer space narration.
8227	1	a	Nice 'Tower' Defeant Game!
8229	1	a	As a tower defense fan, this is unique and well executed. Only warning is that it's not an easy game. I like it!
8231	1	a	Just another campy-retro-sci-fi-space-orbit-tower-defense game.   I'm kidding. This game is fun, breaks the tower defense mold, and is occasionally hilarious. It's also very challenging.
8233	1	a	I enjoyed this game. It puts a nice 'Spin' on the tower defense concept, pun intended.  I loved the throwback B-movie theme and had no issues other than the credits not reacting well to a click.
8235	1	a	Tower game kinda fun.
8237	1	a	This is a great TD game itself and the orbit mechanics make it really intersting to play. great replayable value also. absolutely recomended
8239	1	a	Retro-themed tower defense game. Very fun, great cut scenes.
8241	1	a	Very Cool Arcade tower defense game, with a seperate storyline based mode as well, Fun 50's Sci-Fi silly story, movies at every level, and cool in game arcade-style 50's Sci-FI graphics. Pretty slick and polished, if not ground breaking.  Need a new arcade game, and like tower defense? Get it, its fun!
8243	1	a	Well done! They NAILED the science-fiction feel with the cut scenes, music, and artwork. I buy a lot of games, and only a few really grab me -- this is one of them. The ability to save/resume or rewind time would make it even better, but I suppose this builds more tension and sense of victory when you finally beat a tough board. Production value is really high, and the gameplay is fun if you like tower defense games. Where's the sequel and why did it take four years to hear about it?! Make another one and market it! I put this at my #3 with Defense Grid (will it ever be beat?), and Orcs Must Die (amazing).
8245	1	a	One of the best tower defense mini-game :D
8247	1	a	A unique and interesting take on tower defense.
8249	1	a	So simple and so amazing, This game got me hooked immediately. I recommend this to any tower defense genre enthusiasts. It has a very unique gameplay, the story may be a little cheesy but it is pretty much fine, it just adds extra flare to the game. I love the extra 'retro' cutscenses in between levels. HIGHLY recommended game, hurry up and get this while the 90% discount is still active! By the way, I have no idea how this game has got such a low metascore, don't let that deceive you, get this !!!
8251	1	a	Tower Defense with rotating orbits? Nice idea and perfect execution. Chalangable difficulty level, old sf movies background featuring real actors cutscenes and fine auio-video make this game interesting option for everyone looking for tower defense with some spices
8253	1	a	
8255	1	a	 At the Time of Writing
8257	1	a	If you like Tower Defense Games, this one will blow your mind. I'm already addicted to it. The game design and music is really cool. Pure fun!! :-)
8259	1	a	Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by. They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun 'Super Hexagon' way. Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah. The worst kind of time sink...  Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial. It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way. Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists. There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.  Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good. It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick. It does a phenomenal job of it too. All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off. The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be. One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking 'War Rocket Ajax'.. *cough*.. I mean 'Invincible' :) .. about 40 years too early, :)  Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final 'death scene', each level begins and ends with a 'Galaxy News' transmission. . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced. Right up to the end, the game feels 'fleshed out', there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.  The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes. As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial. The 'orbital slots' are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time. Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.   There are only 22 'single player' levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something. The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of. Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you. I never found much use for the 'sweeper' or the 'webber', they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it. Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better! I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.  One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites. Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves. Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up. So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too. The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies. It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much. I quite like it. It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).   Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games. It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.   I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.
8261	1	a	This is a great fun tower defence game. The 1950's setting and music really add to making the SP worthwhile.
8263	1	a	This is a great TD game itself and the orbit mechanics make it really intersting to play. great replayable value also. absolutely recomended
8265	1	a	At first glance, Unstoppable Gorg may not appear to deviate far from other tower defense games, and in certain ways, it doesn't, but the rotating tower mechanic as well as a challenging difficulty make it nevertheless a great game. Then, there are the trappings. The 50's sci-fi theme is a joy to behold, and the sheer polish is just icing on an already tasty cake.
8267	1	a	this game boasting its unstoppable times, but after 5 minutes i wanted it to end.. I never went back for another round of GORG. it was too pre fabricated so that you werent really doing any fighting yer self.. i guess thats what towers do, in tower defence games, i would rather play out side and get fresh air.. I was not disapointed because my standards were low when i was tricked into buying this game by its flashy video, but sadly was a fool for believeing smoke and mirrors, those dasterdly programmers making it look cooler than it really is.. 4/10 
8269	1	a	Unstoppable Gorg has a really simple mechanic, low learning curve (but is not easy), a really nice (and very fun) 50's years Aliens and Robots story, and, above of all, is fun.  The game is really challenger, if you love tower defenses, play in level medium, if not, go to easy. 10/10, I was lucky to buy that in Humble Bundle. It's worth every penny.
8271	1	a	I feel like i'm playing an Ed Wood movie. This is fantastic and inspiring.
8273	1	a	update to include trading cards
8275	1	a	Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by. They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun 'Super Hexagon' way. Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah. The worst kind of time sink...  Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial. It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way. Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists. There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.  Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good. It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick. It does a phenomenal job of it too. All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off. The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be. One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking 'War Rocket Ajax'.. *cough*.. I mean 'Invincible' :) .. about 40 years too early, :)  Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final 'death scene', each level begins and ends with a 'Galaxy News' transmission. . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced. Right up to the end, the game feels 'fleshed out', there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.  The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes. As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial. The 'orbital slots' are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time. Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.   There are only 22 'single player' levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something. The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of. Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you. I never found much use for the 'sweeper' or the 'webber', they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it. Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better! I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.  One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites. Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves. Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up. So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too. The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies. It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much. I quite like it. It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).   Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games. It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.   I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.
8277	1	a	A very interesting take on the Tower Defense genre. I found the rotating rings to provide an action like quality to the game. It'll keep you on your toes until you perfected your builds for each challenge. Aside from that the game has a beautiful retro sci-fi aesthedic that carries from the in-game elements to some very well (bad? lol) done B-movies style cut scenes to propel the story forward.   This game is well worth a try!
8279	1	a	A novel take on tower defense. Your defenses are fixed in orbits, each of which can be separately rotated as needed. In each level you must balance resources, research, and defense. Feels pretty casual but can be challenging at times.
8281	1	a	Even though I havn't played this game very long on steam, I was actualy introduced to a vertion after it came up for free on Amazon. My daughter and I played this game off and on for weeks until there were no more puzzles left. No, Crazy Machines isn't nessarily *FOR* adults but the game is enjoyable enough so that adults could get into it. Those of you who are having technical problems try this link  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-695153.html  . We got Crazy Machines 2 working on our windows 8 laptop by installing the nvidia PhysX driver.
1381	0	a	UNPLAYABLE!!! I have windows 7 and a Radeon 270. Upon installation, an error message came up saying that I have a newer version of Microsoft C++ installed and my system is incompatible. The game loads up fine. The START button in the tutorial crashes the game. In career mode the START button does nothing. I got the game in a bundle a while back so it's no big deal. Don't bother with this unless your PC is ancient!!!! I had to 'play' for at least 5 minutes before I could even write a review!
1382	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AS IT WONT RUN ON NEWER COMPUTERS AND STEAM WILL NOT HELP YOU OR REFUND YOUR MONEY!
1383	0	a	Bunch of physics related bugs making it impossible to complete some optional objectives (Level 1-4's wagon wheel gets stuck) and some main objectives (level 1-7). Didn't bother playing past that point.
8283	1	a	Seems to be working fine. But then, this machine is at least 5 years old. CPU must be 10 yo. OS is w7 32bits. Was really hyped about this game as a kid and really like playing it, because I was a simulated-physics maniac. I still am a bit*. I think maybe I even found out about it in Igromania gaming magazine and then made sure to find where and how to pirate it. *(Now I like the way computer physics grow from mathematics, thus work super similarly - yet completely different from real life. I might never get tired for the idea of simulated physics.)  Right now... I'm not so hyped. Puzzles seem to be interesting, but I'm not going to play more than a few levels, just gonna get the steam cards(though when installing I didn't know if the game has them or not). Maybe it's the fact that I already had enough fun with this, even tho it was a while ago.  None the less, I remember having alot of fun with these physics back then. That means the game was successful. Does it hold up to this day? I dunno, honestly. Probably doesn't worth the price.  The online features still work, tho, so that's a bonus. It wasn't even hard to register, I just gave login and pass and that's it. 
1384	0	a	It is an entertaining concept, but a poor execution. Level setup is always tedious, the narrator is obnoxious, &amp; physics bugs make some levels unbeatable. I tried to like it, but it's just not worth spending time on.
8285	1	a	Loved Crazy Machines since the first bunch of games came out some yonks ago, the new perspective takes some getting used to, but contains the same zany items and puzzles from the originals.  For those having issues with physics related bugs - One successful workaround seems to be to simply roll back to the original 9.13.1220 Nvidia PhysX drivers that are supplied with the game.
1390	0	a	Total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, buy the first one which is better.
1391	0	a	just like the first but with make you puke grafics (probably misstyped that)
1392	0	a	Did they even beta test this? All the puzzles are single solution with very limited tools. Some of the puzzles cannot even be solved because background ornaments prevent placing some of the objects required for the solution.  Pretty much a watered down version of The Incredible Machine with creativity replaced by bugs.
1393	0	a	Quick review:    Short Verdict  : WORKS FINE ON WINDOWS 7 (just download and play it)! Nice gadgets, but physics part falls short. Frustration ends up being so high that this game can't quite let you enjoy all the potential it has.    Pros  :    Interesting set of gadgets to work with    Online community for potentially extended play    A LOT of levels     Cons  :    Physics mechanics suck    No 'retry' button, forcing you to replay a level from scratch if you missed the golden gear objetive by literally misplacing an object by an inch. And will you remember /exactly/ where everything was? No.    Annoying tutorial Einstein    Slightly ugly and not very easy to look and immeadiately understand what's going on. 2D would have been much nicer    Almost no active community  
1394	0	a	The game was really annoying, and the tutorial in this game was terrible. The game reminded me of a bad Incredible Machine
1395	0	a	Spend more time trying to get it to work on Windows 7 than trying to make the machines in the game work..
8287	1	a	I've never played The Impossible Machine, but this game just strikes me as a lot of fun!  Well, a fair amount of fun. Not the most fun I've had in a puzzle game, but still certainly worth playing!
1397	0	a	the first had more freedom
8289	1	a	I had a game way back years ago on my Windows 95 comp, it was called 'The incredible Machine' (when it was running the game the computer just called it 'TIM') it was made by a company called Sierra. Crazy Machines has alot of the same mechanics as TIM, which is why I bought it. Crazy Machines is very lively and full of intrigue to me, I can't help but notice that it is a very precocious game, like it is ahead of its time, but still right where it should be. All-n-all it's very fun to play, I must say.
1398	0	a	A newer version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable has been detected on the machine. 
8291	1	a	My â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ actually fell off 8/10 Weiners
8293	1	a	This was a really fun game. And hard once you got to the upper levels. I enjoyed making my own.
8295	1	a	Great Game! But isn't working in newer Windows 7 / 8 Physics and machines doesn't work. Unplayable! Needs urgently a support upgrade!!!
1401	0	a	it was boring
1402	0	a	Windows XP/Vista only. Does not run under Windows 7/8 (see developer's sticky in the steam forum).
1403	0	a	Game is â™¥â™¥â™¥. Ridiculously biased phisics. Dont buy waste of money.
8297	1	a	I played the first CM since my 8th, and I still enjoy it! Really cool if you want to discover the limits and possibility's of the technic world!
8299	1	a	For those times when you simply want to build some Golberg machines (or whatever you call them in your region).
8301	1	a	For those that have the Win 7 Issue.  I just got the game, was shocked to see that it didn't work (Win7 x64), but then I went:  Where every you install steam games (Not the desktop icon) , go to cm2 and run it in compatability with XP SP3.   It seems to be working fine right now.  
8303	1	a	A fun and well designed spiritual successor to Sierra/Dynamix's The Incredible Machine series. While a few of the themed sections (lasers, notably) outstay their welcome a bit, it's still a very enjoyable puzzle game.
8305	1	a	All of the Crazy Machine games are great fun. Completing Rube Goldberg machines make excellent, practical, and hilarious good times.
1405	0	a	Does NOT work on Windows 7 machines. Wasted money.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267678404 
8307	1	a	EDIT: You know, nowadays I quite realize that the game is way too literally broken to recommend it up and I should have recommended it down. It's just that I am biased heavily toward this series that I was willing to overlook it. You may want to try some older PsyhX or something. But yea, you probably should avoid this game after all.  Crazy Machines 2 is a sequel to Crazy Machine, not counting Crazy Machines 1.5, released in 2008. It's a game of genre of Incredible Machines, where you build a machines out of many details that will accomplish the goals in one way or another. Or more exactly, you feel the needed spaces with limited amount of elements to find one of few correct solution. More of classic puzzle than anything sandboxy you see lately. Game even supported PhysX new-by-then hardware.  And now, about how it runs nowadays on Steam. It runs badly! First, many people have trouble at making this game start at all. I didn't had problem with launching it. You should check demo version first somewhere to see if game will run for sure or not. If you will have trouble then try to find and (re)install OpenAL. Then I personally had physics not work in this game. Managed to fix it by reinstalling PsyhX and then rebooting computer. Though I have feeling that rebooting was enough, after all game itself should install PsyhX drivers. Anyway. Try to reboot computer first after installing game.  Get demo off Internet and try it first!  Once you are past launch troubles (which you may not have), you still have the amazingly screwed physics in game itself, which is quite a really bad thing for physics-based puzzle. The thing is that physics are not reliable. Tweaking some elements may change the resulting behavior of other elements that aren't connected to the one being tweaked in any way. You may be changing gears around in one part of map and it will somehow make baseball miss the bucked while rolling off slope somewhere else, for example. It's quite frustrating when you got solution right, yet it may not work until you play around with objects. That, and the way that physics work in game seemed to slightly change from when it originally came out. What it means is that some solution don't work anymore. Now, it doesn't affect Crazy Machines 2 much, I enjoyed beating it fully. but there is a single puzzle in Bonus Labs, puzzle number 18, where official full (with bonus objectives) solution doesn't work. You can however get to see the full solution that community figured out in a list of high score records, by watching replay, once you rush through puzzle without completing bonus objectives. DLCes seem to have more of broken puzzles, so watch out for those.  Puzzle instructions, which funny professor with overgrown moustaches narrates (instead of being annoying by popping in randomly for some always-repeated comment like in the original CM), also have small problems. The on-screen drawings that point out objectives appear much slower than voice reads the text. Even more, I noticed that some of the later puzzles have intros where voice narrations and text have little differences. And there was even a puzzle where text and voice instructions put 'in what order it should be done' incorrectly, different from on-screen drawings!  As you can see, Crazy Machines 2 is full of technical flaws. Which is quite a shame, because it's superb sequel to Crazy Machines.  It has a much more 'high-budget' feel to it than previous title, sporting modern-by-then shiny graphics, support of more complex physics (Like, ropes can be hanged without being connected to anything, useful for just pushing objects.), even 15 themes, with their own decoration and music. Soundtrack is a bit too much of 'stereotypical local', but got nice pieces, like Caribbean theme that sounds slightly like something from Monkey Island . On bad side it's hard to understand whole puzzle system from the first look, new graphics/style are quite messy, also having useless decorations mixed in.  It also introduced new complex systems of gears and laser, making them often main focus of puzzle. There are also robots made of 3 parts and switches on which you can place switch of any given type, like button or timer clock. Instead of puzzles being one-trick physics stuff, you often will have to manipulate whole system of gears, lasers, electricity, switches. Which isn't such bad thing, especially knowing that physics are buggy here.  And every puzzle in this sequel concentrates on mostly figuring out where in the system to place each elements. There are almost no puzzles where the only thing you have to do is pixel-perfect placing of elements, unlike original Crazy Machines. I mean, not when you figure out how it should work, but when you are busy tweaking placement, being frustrated with it. I like Crazy Machines 2 approach so much more! Not to mentioning that it saves some work when it comes to precise placement after all by having a minimal step which elements can be moved by, so to say.  Game also gives you mandatory and bonus objectives, while also providing with text clues and other hints, giving it less frustrating moments. Unlike Crazy Machines, where you either figure out solution to some-super-tricky puzzles or don't progress at all.  Overall, you will get 150 main puzzles to solve, with last 40 of which being hidden until you beat all previous ones properly. There is also 10 tutorial puzzles that you should do. 20 more Bonus puzzles. And 20 more bonus puzzles that were made exclusively for PhysX hardware. No, you can't access those. So no idea what to expect in them.  You also can design your own puzzles for your own amusement or to send it to others. Yes, you can download and upload your labs in the game to the server. And editor lets you do quite a lot of things too. Though, for some reason it has some elements locked. The requirements for those is to get some awards in main campaign, by, for example, using fireworks few times. Bad thing is that it doesn't tell you what exactly you are supposed to do to unlock them, from what I know. In all honesty, I didn't try making my own labs or try using others, so I can be wrong.  Overall, I can recommend this to only those who are ready to handle technical difficulties and those who loved Incredibly Machines games. It's good sequel and I can overlook all trouble I sometimes had for all fun I had with puzzles that didn't feel unfair. Everybody who doesn't want to bother, well, eh, should avoid this one.  Perhaps I should give this game thumbs down, but at core it's real good. I had fun.  Now, I also should mention that Back to Shop DLC, that has glitchy store page so you can't review it, is way too bugged. While it's good, few puzzles don't work properly anymore, official solutions will not do. So watch out, if you are planning to get it, then you will have to live with few unbeatable puzzles and not being able to access last 10 puzzles.
8309	1	a	Great game
8311	1	a	Puzzles based on Physics, with a test button and a level reset button. Addictive for casual times

Travel, from the bazaars of Egypt to the white sands of the Caribbean, then blast off into space for an out of this world gaming experience. Check out the crazy machines community online! Post machines you've created and download those made by others. Compete for tropies and high ratings.
8319	1	a	I remember playing this game as a child back when it came out, and I love everything about it, even now. Challenging puzzles and flowing gameplay. Overall I highly recommend this game, I think kids will especially enjoy it.
8321	1	a	This is an excellent physics/puzzle game, but not as fun as the first one or the 'elements' one. For me, two dlc don't work and a few other levels are bugged and the devs don't seem to care. But it's still worth the price (i bought the complete pack in discount and played for more than 92 hours with all these crazy machines games)
8323	1	a	Crazy Machines 2 is an amplified Physic Puzzle game. Almost every Item introduces it's own weight. Inclouding a connection between Science and Magic. Anything can happen if you fill your rooster with all available DLC. With the current available puzzles, you can have fun for even an entire year.  The negative part of the game is that it requires very big performance computers to work properly, because low performance dosen't show up in lag. It changes how the scenery plays itself. Glitches, and even unsolvable puzzles may show up. And you don't have the ability to set up the game for worse cases. There are only a few settings you can set up.  In my case, when I got the game, it did not work in any of the computers in my reach. It took 5 entire years for me to finally 'play' this game. That 5 year was begin by purchasing the game. But when I finally played this... It was an amazing experience. I recommend this for sure!
8325	1	a	This is a very exciting game !!! Play it
8327	1	a	This game is simpler and not as Rube Goldberg as I expected. It does take a lot of inquisition and ideas if you don't get the games concepts when it has a lack of clear explanation. Don't think that bad, you're supposed to experiment in the game. I found that once I conceptualized every aspect of the mechanics given that after I understood each one seperately I could breeze through most of the 'obstacle' like levels that have some funny yet odd goals. I mean, some of it is common sense, some of it can be luck, and sometimes you just know or have to figure it out. The game scared me by giving me a timer, I did get stalled once and it ran out, but ignore it, for NOTHING happens when your timer hits 0. It was just an average time for most people to finish the level, don't be discouraged, try your best and if you get stuck well work through it and keep having fun! Sadly I rate this game at a 6/10 - my lowest rating to date. Maybe I'm leniant, only 'bad' games will get below 5. If I didn't enjoy it, and it was a waste of time and money, I'll definitely let you know. Go get this game series!
8329	1	a	  Crazy Machines   is a mind puzzle game. As the apprentice of a wacky inventor, complete the puzzles to achieve specific effects using a limited amount of knick-knacks.   Pros : This starts out as a fairly simple game with a low learning curve, new elements being introduced as you progress from puzzle to puzzle. You can test the effect of the solution as often as you'd like, which you'll be required to do, regularly needing to adjust your setup and check how different the effect is. The physics of the game, although not fully realistic, are close enough to help guess how most pieces work and wrap your head around it.   Cons : The difficulty isn't as gradual as it could be. You might have a hard puzzle that requires you to adjust one or more item by a pixel, over and over until it works, followed by an extremely straightforward puzzle right after. The hint system is very limited, are rarely actually help. Graphics are showing their age.   Verdict : â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† - It's up to you  All and all,  Crazy Machines  is exactly what it sets out to be, and there is no mistaking that it follows directly in the footsteps of  The Incredible Machines . If that's what you're looking for, you won't care about the graphics and this game has the cheapest puzzle/$ ratio of the franchise. This game is void of any action or excitement, but rather is meant to make you stop, think, observe and resolve the puzzle. If it's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.  â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . 
8331	1	a	I built stuff. I tested it. I blew sh!t up. I fixed stuff. I made sh!t. I took a sh!t. I was happy about my work. I completed the task. I did all the things the Professor wanted me to do. I blew everything up. I went home and gave this game a good rating because I can blow stuff up. I, as a long time buyer, bought this was first released for the PC many years ago. I have purchased it once more for no need to use the disk. I have the disk. It smelled like plastic.
8333	1	a	Nice puzzle game in the spirit of The Incredible Machine series from the 90s.  It does have a quite uneven difficulty curve, where about half of the levels are way too easy (like a prolonged tutorial), and later hits you with some quite illogical puzzles where you don't really use any skills you've picked up along the way, but instead just keeps throwing new, more intricate stuff at you.  All in all, the levels are always more fun than frustrating, but the first half of the game seems rather pointless and I wish the level progression was more inspired.  If someone held a crossbow -- tied to a 1 KG weight set to trigger once a basketball tipped over a domino brick -- to my head, I would give it 3/5.
8335	1	a	Crazy Machines - Fantastic game 8/10 Crazy Machines 1.5 New from the Lab - very good game 7/10 Crazy Machines 1.5 Inventors Training Camp - good game 6/10
8337	1	a	My childhood is on steam BUY IT.
8339	1	a	Wow! This is only 43.1 MB! Quite impressive. Anyways, this is a really fun game with both sandbox building of inventions and very difficult puzzle gameplay in challenge mode. Definitly worth picking this title up!
8341	1	a	makes you think, which is something i try to avoid when playing games as my reason for gaming is to escape from that for a few hours... however the way this game does it works, its a REALLY addictive and very well thought out game, not so much into v2 but i love this one!
8343	1	a	If you were a fan of the old game 'The Incredible Machine', then you'll find this spiritual successor a wonderful addition to your collection. While it may not have the same charms as the old TIM series (such as the wonderful music selection and many whimsical elements), its selection of puzzles to solve and gadgets to build will surely bring some form of entertainment to you and your friends and family. Rated 7.5 out of 10 stars!
8345	1	a	One of the greatest childhood games ever.
8347	1	a	Played it a lot as a kid, it's plain fun and you get to blow â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up.
8349	1	a	Fun little puzzle game, can be a bit of a challenge, but I'd say get it on sale or with a bundle package if possible.
8351	1	a	I played this game when I was younger and I still love it today.
8353	1	a	This is my childhood. I went back and played it, and it taught me much. Then the power went out and the time came to put my new skills to the test. I burned my house down.   10/10 would burn my house down again.
8355	1	a	Puzzle Chronicles is a puzzle roleplaying game developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Konami Digital Entertainment Inc. This is yet another title in Infinite Interactives growing stable of puzzle games. You are a hero on a quest through the savage lands of the Ashurin Empire in search of your tribesman who have been taken by slavers. Your hero will combat fierce beasts and battle hardened warriors during your travels as you attempt to rescue your people, raise an army and topple the Empire. This being a R.P.G., you have the ability to customize your character but sadly this time there are no character classes to choose from. As you do battle your hero will accquire experience points which will allow you to upgrade a set of skills to suit your particular playstyle and liking. There is also an abundance of gear to collect or craft ranging from mighty weapons, enchanted armor, amulets, etc. to further enhance your character.  One nice thing about Puzzle Chronicles that sets it apart from Infinite Interactives other games is that this title is not a match 3 game. The closest title that I can liken this to is some sort of sideways Tetris game. Stacks of colored gems instead of blocks enter the battlefield from the left side falling towards a wall that divides your area from your opponent's area. You can rotate the gem stacks and place them any way you choose to. Destroying these gems builds power also called 'rage' in this game for your weapons and companion warbeast's attacks. That's right...you can accquire a doge, known as a warbeast, to accompany you on your quest. As you battle, you and your opponent are in a constant tug of war over the wall dividing the battlefield between the two of you. The fight ends when one combatant has no more room to maneuver the gem stacks entering their area because the wall has been pushed too far across their part of the battlefield. The gameplay sounds simple enough but when that divider wall is steadily taking space from your half of the battlefield and the gem stacks just keep coming as your opponent attacks and attacks you really start to feel the intensity of this game. Did I forget to mention the cool little animated fight sequences of your character and your opponent that take place just above the gem battlefield? Besides the story driven battles there are also some mini-games that you can compete in to unlock items and provide even more enhanced abilities.  Graphically I like this game. It has a really nice looking artstyle to it as far as the cutscenes for the story goes and the animated fight sequences that occur as you puzzle battle are impressive and fun to watch. The musical score, like the scores in all Infinite Interactive games, is brilliant and does it job amply but none of the tracks really stand out of the pack to me. Most of the score has a middle-eastern sound to it and is executed quite well though. The sound effects, however, are very well done. Gem explosions and battle sounds are loud and crisp as they should be. The voice-overs in the cutscenes are excellent and do a great job of enhancing the story.  While not my favorite puzzle R.P.G., Puzzle Chronicles does have a nice story that I felt compelled to see through to the end and I also found the deviation from the typical match 3 gameplay to be quite refreshing as well. With that said, one thing about this game that really bothered me is something that I mentioned in another recent review for a match 3 puzzle title...the lack of a good tutorial. Puzzle Chronicles suffers horribly in this failing as you'll quickly find yourself lost after the 'so-called' tutorial ends. You'll have to search the internet for some fan written guides or just play the game and learn things by trial and error which can be quite frustrating. However, once you do learn how to play and what everything means then you can finally start to enjoy the game. This title definitely won't be everyones cup of tea but if you're looking for something a little different in the puzzle game genre then I suggest that you give this title a try.
8357	1	a	It could have been longer, but otherwise, I have no real complaints about this game. It's a very fun puzzle/RPG set in a sword-and-sorcery setting. The storyline and character development are little more than a MacGuffin to keep you playing, but at least the gameplay itself is really solid.
8359	1	a	A somewhat predictable RPG, Puzzle Chronicles suffers from some mildly bad voice acting and fairly repetitive battles - once you learn how to play it's Tetris-esque combat and mini-games, it's pretty much just rinse, repeat, get better gear. The story has some amusing moments, but do not be fooled: you need to disengage your brain to play this game. I think the Puzzle Quest series does a better job of engaging you with its story, and has similar mechanics to progress with.  That being said, it's nice to play a puzzle that isn't 'match 3' and while the combat is repetitive (and despite what some think, you  can  make a comeback from some very bad looking situations), it's different and interesting enough that while you're progressing the story and facing off against different enemies, it doesn't get tedious. It's worth a play, and will keep you engaged if you're after something light.  I think the only unfortunate thing for me is that there is little incentive to play and get the final achievement (it's just grinding), and not enough of a community to really get anything going for the multiplayer since it's a little older now.
8361	1	a	I love this practically new genre of tetris match 3 and RPG and this one is fun.
8363	1	a	I haven't played this, and you shouldn't either
8365	1	a	A colorful and fun arcade style game where you launch your Arkonaut from the bounce pad to collect DNA blocks. You not only control the bounce pad but also the Arkonaut as well which adds extra challenge. The avatars are cute and the music is catchy. This game is deffinitely worth giving a shot.
8367	1	a	The problem is, author F. Scott Fitzgerald didn't see the Jazz Age as all about hip music and sparkly clothes. He associated the entire period with materialism ('I want things! Lots of things!') and immorality. For many of the post-World War I era's newly wealthy, materialism and immortality were the name of the game. The novel's star is Jay Gatsby, a young, rich man in love with a society girl from his past. A girl who, as it happens, is married to someone else.  And that's not the only reason why Gatsby still feels fresh today. The novel's very title has become a kind of buzzword for periods of excess and fake luxury. The economic collapse of 2008 brought back distant and unwelcome memories of the stock market crash of 1929, casting the boom times of the 1990s and early 2000s as the modern-day version of the Roaring Twenties.  In both cases, though, unsustainable boom times led to devastating crashes with profound cultural consequences. In the 1920s, it had been a bubble in stocks that brought easy prosperity, while in our own time the bubble had been in the housing market. In both times, easy money meant that many people could begin to dream of living out their days like Jay Gatsby, with life as just one grand party in a seersucker suit. But as that vision of easy luxury crashed and burned (in both 1929 and 2008), newfound hard times required a redefinition of the American Dream.  And while Gatsby is a work of fiction, Fitzgerald's real life contains some suspicious similarities. (Gulp.) Narrator Nick Carraway is both mesmerized and disgusted by Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle, just as Fitzgerald claimed to feel about the 'Jazz Age' excesses that he himself adopted. As an Ivy League educated, middle-class Midwesterner, Fitzgerald (like Nick) saw through the shallow materialism of the era. But (like Gatsby) Fitzgerald came back from World War I and fell in love with a wealthy southern socialite.
1434	0	a	Terrible port and sadistic difficulty. Avoid at all costs.
1435	0	a	So I got this as part of an indie bundle of 8 other games for $1.50, and upon looking at the store page, I became worried.  Barely touched on steam for two and a half years and already had mixed reviews, I approached this game today with caution. The opening was cute. I liked the pop-art style intro. It reminded me of something like Little Big Planet.  Then I saw those things up close. Those...creepy, soulless eyes...begging to die.  Space Ark is basically an Arkanoid game (hooray for puns), where you bounce your Little Big Planet knockoffs around and about hitting objects this game calls 'DNA' and helping these creatures restore there planets to its (un)rightful glory.  I was very skeptical about how this game would be, especially with how the screenshots were kind of a turnoff. But honestly, this game wasn't too bad. In fact it got a little challenging, because not only are you controlling your yoga ball around the stage, but you also have control in navigating your sock puppets that you call 'animals.'  Granted, it's not as challenging as other arkanoid games that you can find here on steam, such as Ionball, but if you like to have color in your environment and like bouncing up and down cute...soulless...evil...creatures, then you'll enjoy this game.  Though at a price tag of $5, I say wait, look for a sale, or look somewhere else. This game is worth no more than your typical dollar app, and shouldn't be priced any higher than that.  Other than that, I (personally) can't recommend this game to anyone I know that is into arkanoid but likes this type of theme.  p.s. This game cannot be played at full screen, so that's another thing to note about.
8369	1	a	Shortly: Love a good cartoon? You're welcome :) Love a good puzzle? Close the page :(  Pros: visuals and such: stunning design, not bad graphics, nice atmosphere and jokes, John de Lancie as Professor Quadwrangle, original story, price Cons: actual gameplay: pretty short (there are some DLCs out there though), not many good puzzles, requires more jumping skills than thinking ones, freaking tons of blur  The long way: I love this game. Yeah, that simple, just as simple as the game is. It has nice design, good 3d-cartoon-like graphics and jokes which are really good (well, sometimes they aren't, but nothing is perfect in this world). The main problems are the puzzles and length of the game itself - I've run through it in ~6 hours, but I haven't got 100% completion though. Now about the puzzles. They are simple as well, but that's not good this time. You won't find any really hard-brainsmashing-cool-etc puzzles in this game - all of them are considerably easy. Also, this game has a lot of platforming. I like this, but you may not if you're looking for a brain challenge.  PS: I'm sorry if my English is bad, it's not my native language.
8371	1	a	Riding off the coat-tails of Portal, the same dev team is back at it with this first-person-puzzler. The difficulty for the base game stays between beginner to intermediate while the DLC increases it to a ridiculous difficulty that will have you banging your head on your keyboard and you punching a nearby house cat. Despite this increase of difficulty (reliance of speed, timing, and LOTS of patience are needed), the game is hilarious and beautiful with a semi-cell-shaded, cartoon feel. John de Lancie (Q for all you trekkies out there), provides a nice narrative to the environment and story as you progress through the game. If you enjoyed the Portal series, this is a must-buy to add to your gaming collection.
8373	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a puzzle game centered around a weird science contraption that switches dimensions. Players take first-person control of a young child who comes to visit his scientist uncle at a crazy mansion. Upon arrival, the silent protagonist learns that his uncle is trapped in another dimension, and it is up to him to save his relative. In order to do this, all three of the generators in the mansion will need to be restarted. The puzzles are made up of simple elements that are combined into complicated and elaborate puzzles. Puzzles are completed by moving around objects, which are mostly just boxes. Heavy weights are used to trigger pressure plates, boxes can be stacked to climb on, and there are a whole bunch of other unique solutions that are pleasing to discover. This game is amazing. Quantum Conundrum is well made, it controls well and it is almost flawless.  It is perfect for people who like puzzle games like Portal. It is definitely worth to buy.

8375	1	a	this game is my answer whenever someone ask me what my favorite game of all time is. stirring story, cosy stages, overwhelmingly entertaining puzzles, genuine humor and everything I look for havin' fun in a game. I wish there was a sequal for it. I had my best times while playin'. 4 different dimension supply a huge variety on complexity and not only that it has awesome gameplay trough with it. I always thought that could cause lots of improvement in game industry but it's been 3 years and yet all we got is 'The Talos Principle'. I really think developers should look up for this game and draw a lesson. that's the stuff we need more and more. I dont know what kim swift doin' these days but we need her back really bad zxzxzx.
8377	1	a	I really wish there was a maybe. The puzzles are fun, but later on in the game this becomes more like a platformer and I have trouble jumping and hitting buttons in time to do the stunts which is frustrating. This isn't the Portal rival I thought it would be, although the first levels definitely fooled me into thinking it would be!
8379	1	a	Until hell freezes over and the almighty Gaben decides to release the holy trinity, I guess we'll just have to settle for this game for now. It's not a bad game though, especially for its low price.  Much like Portal, this game is a good puzzle platformer game that features some very unique mechanics that is also backed up with a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, it lacks the story and environment that the Portal series is known for. Along with its over reliance on timing and platforming, this can be a hard game to push through at times.  Overall though, it's still a solid game and wouldn't be a bad idea to pick up on sale If you've got an itch for more Portal action.
8381	1	a	6/10  Overall the game is quite good. Although after a time the commentary of the 'Professor and Inventor' started to annoy me. I would only recommend it if you really like puzzle/platformer games and if it's on an offer.
8383	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is quite a conundrum to review.   On one hand, the gameplay and visuals are solid. Everything from the fluffy-iness of the fluffy dimension to the roughness of the heavy dimension is rendered beautifully. The Uncle's mansion is such an incredibly unique style. Even the only NPC you ever actually interact with looks like something straight out of a Disney or Pixar film. Gameplay is obviously inspired by Portal, but it takes the concept from that game and changes it into something completely different and incredibly similar at the same time. Three dimensions, light and soft; normal; heavy and hard, govern the elements of the puzzles you'll find in your Uncle's mansion. Along with the intriguing gameplay, are tons of hidden collectables. This makes the game a treasure trove for completionists.  On the other hand, this Quantum Conundrum is plagued by a badly voiced Uncle and a story that leaves much to be desired. The Uncle drones on while you play through each level. Either giving you hints to certain puzzles or just fumbling around seemingly holding you back by mistakes or errors comitted on his part. The voice acting is sadly bland. To be frank, there was a lack of anything. The Uncle sounded as though a preset voice created by a computer. Perhaps, that was what the game's story was implying, but I can never be to sure because there was almost a complete lack of a story. The underlying goal of the game was for me to finally meet up with my uncle, but other than that there wasn't much of a plot. The ending is equally as frustrating. Nothing is even remote resolved or answered. The ending implied a continuation of the game in a sequel, but after two years I haven't heard of anything.  Instead of implementing a half-baked story with an Uncle and his estranged nephew, I would've much rather have the game just focused on the puzzles. Trying to recreate the Portal experience of having a robot entity taunt you throughout the game just wasn't a good idea and detracted from what was otherwise a wonderful game.  I give this game a 7/10. The puzzles are definitely worth the price tag of $9, just don't expect a story-telling masterpiece.  Pros: Unique Artstyle Interesting Gameplay Addicting Collectables  Cons: Poor Story Voice Acting Leaves Much To Be Desired
8385	1	a	Going into Quantum Conundrum i expected a Portal like expierence but with different dimensions to toggle, especially because Portal's former lead designer 'Kim Swift' worked on this game. And yes, there are some similarities like going from room to room to solve 'puzzles' and a narrator making dumb but often funny jokes. But sadly the puzzles aren't as great.... I expected brain twisting and greatly designed puzzles. But what we got are puzzle like environments based more on momentum and physics than actually solving diffecult puzzles. This however is fun and original aswell, it creates a good balance between solving puzzles and platforming.  Now i really enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum. The game has great cartoony graphics and the mad scientist voiced by 'John de Lancie' is quite funny sometimes. And even though the game is rather short, this actually benefits the game in my opinion. For me the length was perfect, around the point it all got a bit repetitive the end was near. Something else Quantum Conundrum does really well is create a original and great universe. Everything is made really well, and just fits. Unfortunately the ending is rushed and just not satisfying in anyway.... And although the game has a great balance between puzzles and physics, timing certain actions can get frustrating at times.  I still recommend this game to any puzzle fan out there. It's a fun and challenging puzzle platformer with a well made atmoshpere. The game will take you around 4 to 6 hours to finish. However there are alot of collectables and achievements to get if you would like to get the game on 100%.
8387	1	a	Another great puzzle game, themed heavily on Portal. You change physics around you to solve the puzzles. I've heard it described as 'baby's first Portal' and that is a decent summary of it. The puzzles are a bit easy, though that doesn't take away from the fun. The doctor is very clearly based on GLaDOS, but John DeLancie does a wonderful job of voicing, and the script pulls it off pretty well.  If you like puzzles, physics, or Portal, it's worth picking up, especially on sale.
8389	1	a	It is a very fun puzzle game. TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT!
8391	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great game for people looking to be puzzled or just want a cute and funny challenge :3.  - Graphics/How It Plays: Now don't let the 'Childish' graphics detur you, the game plays well on most computers and looks great if all the settings are maxed out (Which any potato of a computer could do). The only complant about graphics/how it plays is that instead of using loading screens, Quantum Conundrum uses long hallways, so you get some REALLY bad frame drop inbetween levels, and some hallways are just WAY too long. I would give the graphics and how it plays a 5/5  - Level Disign: The levels are very well created and have a mix between science lab and mansion/victorian feel. Sometimes though it is hard to tell what the objective in a level is, I would have liked like a big red 'Exit' sign at the exit door so I could see it. I would rate the level disign a 4/5.  - Music and Audio: All I can say is the music in this game is just astounding, even though this game does not look to be that popular, so much work has gone into the music I HIGHLY recomend buying the Soundtrack while buying the game. Some sound effects are a bit obnoxios, but most sound fine and work well with the feel of the game. I would give the sounds and music a 5/5.  - Controls and Menu: The menu is sometimes confusing but may I just say THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU, you have to go into 'Start Game' to exit the game I mean how counter intuative can you get. Also the mouse sensativity settings in the menu had like 3 different levels, not just a slider and I would have liked to see more than 1 audio slider. The controls where great out of the box, everything you would expect, exept jump. Jump was space BUT unlike in some games when you jumped, if you weren't EXACTLY on the ground you woulden't jump and in some situations in the game, that ment life or death. I would give the controls and menu a 2/5.  Overall this game is a great game with a very easy story to follow and challenging levels. I would DEFFENENTLY recommend buying the DLCs because the game is about a 4 hour playthrough so if you are still thursty for some demention switching I would recommend the DLCs.  I would give this game a overall rating of 4/5 and would DEFFENENTALY recommend it. And it's cheep so buy it boiiiii.
8393	1	a	It's Portal.... that is, if Portal traded its dry and dark humor for a more light and laughable humor. IF it had to do with dimementions instead of portals, and if the narrator WASN'T the villan.       So the opposite of portal.
8395	1	a	It took me almost a year to finish Quantum Conundrum. I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped. I guess it didn't pull me in like Portal once did. That doesn't make it a bad game, not at all. It just lacks that certain charm. The puzzles, however, are pretty cool.   So, I decided to continue the game just recently and I have to say the game actually gets a lot better near the end, when you have access to all 4 dimensions (fluffy, weight, anti-gravity and slow). Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling. And while the game lasts only about 6-7 hours, it's long and challenging enough to keep your attention (for most of us anyway ;)).  Now that QC2 has appeared in the Steam registry I'm actually really excited again (edit: I guess this will never happen since the studio closed) !  I â™¥ first person puzzle games.  [Rating: 86/100]
8397	1	a	Somewhat along the lines of Portal, this is a puzzle game that sets you thinking! Very gentle game, very well thought out, drawn and animated, with plenty of nice touches. The four dimensions you work in offer many, many interesting possibilities. Highly recommended!
8399	1	a	It may be because I'm a huge puzzle platformer fan. It may be because of the similarities to Portal. It may be because of my love for the concept of alternate dimensions. BUT THIS GAME IS A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MASTERPIECE. The fluid and original gameplay mixed with the hilarious script and decent graphics create an experiene that I must say I've never experienced with any game since Portal 2. Sometimes the puzzles can be so complex that they make you want to tear your hair out, but that just reflexes the game's incredibly complex gameplay. I have to say, this game is, without a doubt, better than Portal.  Not better than Portal 2, but hey, what is?
8401	1	a	A fun and mentally stimulating puzzle/adventure game from one of the lead designers of the original Portal. If you liked the Portal games and want something similar, this is a great gem that you shouldn't miss. :)
8403	1	a	This game is great, I found myself laughing thanks to the writing and John de Lancie's voice acting. :D
8405	1	a	Itâ€™s a decent game, I think I Just had higher expectations for it. Donâ€™t get me wrong here, this game is still great and I still think that anyone that enjoys first person puzzle games should give it a go. For me it just wasnâ€™t as fun or satisfying as it seemed. I watched the trailer and was super excited to play this game, maybe I hyped myself up to much, I donâ€™t know, but as I got into in I found it a little meh. A lot of people straight away notice the similarities it has to the portal franchise, and I have seen a lot of people saying itâ€™s a copy or a rip off. Well straight up I just have to put that straight. That is complete crap. The person who made this worked on portal 1 and 2, so you can hardly say itâ€™s a copy, when itâ€™s their own work. Itâ€™s got its similarities but itâ€™s a completely different game all together. If you are wondering why I found it meh, I honestly donâ€™t know how to explain it. The mechanics for this game are great, the dialog is pretty amusing at times, the graphics look really good and it had a nice humour to it. I just didnâ€™t feel too great about this game, and after a little while it became a chore for me to finish. It felt like it dragged on a little bit, I didnâ€™t feel like there was any real purpose to the game, from what I remember the storyline was ok but nothing to griping.  Itâ€™s a game thatâ€™s been done fairly well, and I still like it. I just donâ€™t love it. Now that Iâ€™ve finished it I doubt I will play it again, and if I do, it wouldnâ€™t be for the game itself, it would be for the achievements. (That Iâ€™ve recently became obsessed with getting in games)  All in all itâ€™s still a good game, maybe other people feel differently about it to how I feel.
8407	1	a	I really liked it. but It is really really hard! at some point you  will  want to hit your computer with a hammer  but I would buy it again.  also I recommend playing this game with a controller
8409	1	a	A very good but short game. I'd totally play Quantum conundrum 2 if it ever came out. The puzzles where inventive, new and fresh.
8411	1	a	It's kinda like portal, except without portals, and longer.
8413	1	a	Pros: -Puzzle difficulty gets hard without feeling impossible -Whimsical look is neat -VO is entertaining -Death screens are funny  Cons: -Level design is very very very very very very(...) repetetive for the game's length. The sudden unique design of the final level would have been nice to introduce earlier. -Story is completely nonsensical and feels like an afterthought  Score: 6/10
8415	1	a	Where Portal and Psychonauts meet.  It's a quite fun first person 3D physics puzzle platformer, where you acquire up to four different ways to affect the physics and thus what you can perform on a given level (e.g. the first one is the 'fluffy dimension', which makes everything on the scene lighter so you can e.g. actually carry all the normally too heavy stuff around; alas, the physics can get wee bit random at times, which may come in your way).  Heed my warning though: the platformer part is just brutal and unforgiving. Probably 3rd person perspective would work better.  If you try to limit the number of dimension shifts, you need smarts and sometimes patience, so it's good, but I sadly don't see myself getting the time constraints achievement.  Also, seems like if you want real closure, you'll have to buy the upcoming DLCs. Looks like there are even achievements for them already in the game!  Despite the mentioned caveats, you are bound to have some fun quality time with this gem.
8417	1	a	Very Nice Puzzle Game that feels like Portal. It feels like it because it was made by Kim Swift wich was one of the lead devs to create Portal. Overall the Game has a pretty nice artstyle which reminds of Tf2 but also Portal, This Game is pretty challenging but its alot of Fun to play. I give this Game a 8/10
8419	1	a	science is awesome give it a try!
8421	1	a	fun puzzlegame where you play with the fuzzy dimension!
8423	1	a	This games holds a variety of puzzles with a touch of creativity that makes it stand out on its own. From shifting to different dimensions, to even getting timing down to a key; this games is rather entertaining even for the roughly 7 hours it took to complete.  Overall, the game left me wanting more(2 upcoming dlcs sometime soon) and that's a good thing.
8425	1	a	The first thing I can say about this game was it was charming as all getout. It's visually attractive and John de Lancie's voicework provides a lot of character. The puzzles were also sufficiently challenging; most of them had me scratching my head and wandering around the track for many minutes until I finally figured it out. That final 'Aha!' moment is what makes puzzle games interesting to keep playing, and Quantum Conundrum definitely had that.  What I didn't like about this game, however, was that it was trying  too  much to be like Portal. Kim Swift, the director of Quantum Conundrum, was also part of the development team for Valve's critically acclaimed sci-fi puzzler, and it really shows in Quantum Conundrum's story. However, it falls short of being anything interesting. The story, which is mostly told through your uncle's voice through the mansion' intercom system, is pretty bland and painfully unfunny. The final climax at the end of the game is barely a puzzle, and I remember finishing it and saying out loud, 'Was that it?'  Long story short, it's a tight, visually appealing, clever puzzler with some narrative problems that make it feel like a loosely tied together test track from Aperture Labs.
8427	1	a	The voice of john de lancie never gets old, though the story did lack a certain depth. Puzzles were just difficult enough to make me stop and think, but no harder. Often they relied on twich skills as much as thought, and a few times I knew the real answer and brute forced something silly that was easier.   I give it a B.
8429	1	a	It's kinda like portal, except without portals, and longer.
8431	1	a	It's an enjoyable and humorous experience all-in-all. The concept is good and the atmosphere rather charming. In terms of level design, it hinges more and more on pin-point jump timing rather than actual puzzles, which starts to detract from the experience as you near the end.  Overall a decent game with a good price/value-ratio.
8433	1	a	This game is a nice Puzzling game with funny humor (in my eyes), challenging puzzles and awesome physics. It's played through quite fast, but it is definately worth it. Just a little tips: Read the titles of the books and look at the pictures/paintings on the walls while shivting through the dimensions. Always good for a laugh or two.
8435	1	a	Pretty good first person puzzler, shares some similarties with the Portal games. Puzzle revovlve around dimesnions (light, heavy, slow, upside down) For example throwing a heavy object in light dimension so it smashes through glass when you switch back. Couple of nifty ideas and it trains you pretty well. Has quite a bit of platforming though, so if you hate timed based platforming then it might frustrate you.
8437	1	a	This game is an interesting concept for a puzzle game. You are a kid going to his uncle's (who is a  slightly  narcisist scientist) when something happens causing a lock-down on the house. Your uncle has a mild loss of short term memory, and can't figure out where he is so he asks you to go restore power to remove the lock-down. In the process you get access to the IDS device that he was working on that allows you to shift between dimensions (More on that soon).  The story isn't complicated, but it gets the job done and gets you going where you need to be. The dialogue along the way is cheesy, but in a good way (Though if you are not a fan of cheesy humor, I would suggest muting the voices).  The gameplay itself is quite interesting. You gradually unlock 4 (well, 5 if you count the base dimension) dimensions that allow you to modify physics. These are Fluffy (Or, light weight), Heavy (Heavy weight), Slow down (Everything moves at a near crawl, even lasers), and Reverse Gravity. You, personally never are altered (The idea is despite the fact you are going through the rifts, you personally remain physical to your dimension). Now, these mechanics lead to some interesting relationships between objects: A steel Safe becomes able to be carried while in fluffy, You can toss a table in fluffy then quickly change to Slow and hop onto the platform (That normally would be going fast) as a platform across a gap. A cardboard box can be used as a heavy weight using Heavy. Or with Reverse you can have something utilize the bottom of a conveyor belt to be carried along (or quickly switch to keep it floating). It's not as though you just unlock them all as you go along: Each room has certain dimensions availble (though they can be changed via what batteries you find in the puzzle), so they give you a general direction on how to solve it, and leave it to you to figure out how to use your tools to reach the exit.  It is worth noting this concept shines in one level in particular: You choose one and only one of the 4 and have to solve the room from there, and based on which one you start with changes the entire solution.  That said, the puzzle aspect partially comes from how well you can execute it as well (You can only 'Table Surf' if you are good enough, after all) so if you are looking for a pure puzzle game, you aren't getting that. That does not make this a fun title though.  There are also a lot of neat little features, such as how paintings and such change based on the dimension (Example is a painting of a grandmother where in fluffy her hair is insane, where in slow there is a grim reaper standing behind her). Another is that during death or loading screens you get some hilarious dialogue (Things you will never experience because you died #93487: The Zombie Apocalypse (Though this may be for the best)). There are also little knick-knacks in each level that you can hunt for, given a neat sense of exploration, even if all it does is add little dolls in the main lobby.   That all said, there are a few issues. One annoying one is the give-away hints. Your uncle will give you a hint on how to beat the chamber after a while of being in. It's a neat idea, help stumped players get through, but often times he says it after what seems 1 failed attempt (not counting deaths), which means if you don't get a puzzle right first try (whether or not you get the solution) he's gonna chime in and basically become Navi (There is one puzzle where you clearly have to go up, and he constantly goes 'You need to get higher.') If the hints were so dead give-away (Almost shouting 'HERE IS THE SOLUTION') or he didn't just tell you within moments of entering the room this wouldn't be an issue, but together it can be a bit annoying.  Another is some questionable hit detection. Numerous times I've been standing on a ledge where suddenly I just get booted off, or I hit a ceiling that still appears numerous feet away. It can cause some annoying and at times frustrating deaths.  The game itself is also rather short, unfortunately. Though it could be positive because that also means it doesn't over stay it's welcome.    On a side note I have seen this game compared to Portal. While it has a Portal feel to it, it's not going to quite get rid of that itch, though it will help satisfy it.   Overall, a really fun puzzle game and definitely worth getting if you are looking for an enjoyable game.
8439	1	a	Portal with John â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing DeLancie
8441	1	a	Loving this game. Dripping with atmosphere, interesting mechanics, and great puzzles. Highly recommended
8443	1	a	this gme is so much fun and I love the voice actor who plays your uncle. the only downfall is a lackluster end. not a sad end just sorta ok...
8445	1	a	John de lancie reprises his role as 'The Borg' in this thrilling indie produced RPG sequel to Portal 2. When a terrible dimensional incident renders a future incompatible from the right to choose burgers made Your Way, it's a conundrum of the highest order that only YOU can solve.
8447	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a first person puzzler / platformer that is based on changing the physics of your environment. My only major issue with this game is that the story was left unfinished and there is no known sequel on the horizon. Though not quite revolutionary, Quantun Conundrum knows what it is and executes excellently.   If you like games such as Portal and don't mind some additional platforming elements, you'll appreciate Quantum Conundrum.
8449	1	a	Wonderful game. Realy makes you think outside the parrallelogram. Any fan of the Portal series will love this game.

8453	1	a	John De Lancie narration and Chris Ballew credits tune!   Also, there's a game in there. It's quite alright.  Some hard-to-read puzzles and other head-scratchers.  Worth a look if that sounds like your kinda thing, especially if you get it amazingly cheap or in a bundle.
8455	1	a	As you probably already know, Quantum Conundrum is a new game from Kim Swift, the creator of Portal. And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 'dimensions' (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game. One other note - in addition to puzzles, a significant degree of platforming skill is required throughout (just something to be aware of). Great game... highly recommended!
8457	1	a	Amazing! Very unique style of puzzle, never seen anything like it before :D Totally buy it :D
8459	1	a	This game looks and feels like Portal 2, but is much longer and has it's own very unique game mechanics. If you really liked Portal, but thought it was too short or was lacking something: try this. It's very fun.
8461	1	a	If you are a sucker for 3d puzzle platformers this should be something you enjoy. Just be warned most of the puzzles are fairly easy and you need to buy the DLCs if you want something more challenging.   Rating:  Best game ever 
8463	1	a	Game feels like Portal with different gaming mechanisms. So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it's difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you're doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that's a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous. Ultimately, getting it at a good discounted price (like 75%) is a good deal.
8465	1	a	A very fun game with many interesting elements to altering reality for platforming and puzzel solving such as making safes light and fluffy so you can pick them up, reversing time and manymore fun and interesting little things to do!  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of puzzle-platform games :)
8467	1	a	This game looks and feels like Portal 2, but is much longer and has it's own very unique game mechanics. If you really liked Portal, but thought it was too short or was lacking something: try this. It's very fun.
8469	1	a	I'm loving this game. John Delancie is a great VO, the puzzles are fun even if some will take a few goes. This game CAN run on XP, despite what the minimum reqs say. The DLC is just punishing BS though.

8473	1	a	Pretty good, not 5 stars, but 4 and a half and a quarter, VERY close, but I kinda got bored after a while, still though, great game, and I love the story. :)
8475	1	a	This game is just too much fun!
8477	1	a	its a game like protal there is a story and some puzzels pretty nice to enjoy after a hard day school/work its not that hard but not very ez ez so yea for this price thumbs up
8479	1	a	Fun original first person puzzle game, go for it.
8481	1	a	Funny puzzle game like Portal, but a little bit different :)
8483	1	a	You should play the game AT LEAST because of John de Lancie's voiceacting. You know, it is kinda funny to listen to Discord's advices. AND evenmore we have an awesome trans-dimensional puzzle, that will test your wits!
8485	1	a	One of my favourite games of all time. This game in my eyes is just as good as Portal 2. It has great puzzles and a great storyline you will not regreat buying this. 9/10
8487	1	a	Wow, just wow. This is a very nice puzzle game. Unique in every single aspect with puzzles that are both easy and hard to solve. Switching dimensions was never as easy as this! It's a must-have game!  Rating: 10/10
8489	1	a	The puzzle's are great. Obviously, very Portal-esque. The platforming is AWFUL though. Still a lot of fun.
8491	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a FPS puzzle platformer. You are the grandson or uncle, can't remember, of a scientist who has trapped himself in some dimension. You need to reset some generators to rescue him.  To achieve this goal you use different mechanics like freezing time, making objects heavier or lighter and something else I never got to use as I gave up on the game. It's fun at first but I was bored with the game a littel after starting the first generator. A lot of it felt like the same old thing just different room. Plus a lot of it looks exactly alike.  The game is challenging and could be enjoyable for some. I don't care for the FPS platforming cause it can become very irritating. If you like good physics puzzles and can handle FPS platforming than try the game out. It did seem well made but it's just not to my liking.  Bear Rating 7/10
8493	1	a	I completed the main game in 9 hours and then began to suffer.
8495	1	a	Portal-grade quality. Don't miss it!
8497	1	a	A very fun and very clever game! Almost as frustrating as Portal
8499	1	a	Really fun, if you liked portal you will like this.
8501	1	a	This game is easily worth twice what they are charging. Puzzles are smart, and the polish is fascinating.
8503	1	a	An excellent installment in the growing field of first person puzzlers.
8505	1	a	Great game when your bored, have it mentioned its great? EITHER WAY ITS FUN, but boring once you beat it...
8507	1	a	Definitely worth the purchase, this is a must play especially if you enjoy Portal. You solve puzzles just like in Portal but with different dimensions instead of portals. Very fun and awesome game plus two DLCs coming out soon, what more could you want? Play it now!
8509	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is an amazing puzzle game that is so good, it might even rival the mighty Portal!  It has tons humor mixed with lots of really good puzzles. Anyone who enjoyed Portal really should play this game.  Unfortunately the game is not quite a polished as Portal, when I played, there was a bug involving the time-based puzzles, that forced me to start a section over again because the platforms were out of sync. This may have been fixed by now, but I don't know.  The only other issue I personally have with this game is that, like Portal, it is too short... It leaves you wanting more.  But, as a bonus: Your uncle (This game's disembodied voice,) is played by John De Lancie! (The guy who played Q in Star Trek!) His voice-over somehow makes this game even more fun!
8511	1	a	kind of a portal knock off but still good in it's own way.
8513	1	a	A severely underated game that is a ton of fun. It is a relatively short game, but you will treasure every moment of it.
8515	1	a	Definitely worth the purchase, this is a must play especially if you enjoy Portal. You solve puzzles just like in Portal but with different dimensions instead of portals. Very fun and awesome game plus two DLCs coming out soon, what more could you want? Play it now!
8517	1	a	A really good game. I'd say the puzzles are even better constructed than those in Portal, mainly because there is often more than 1 solution to every puzzle. It's a bit on a short side though, so pick it up when it's on sale.
8519	1	a	I actually like it more than Portal(2)...
8521	1	a	So pretty much, if you loved portal, you're going to love this game. The puzzles are very similar to the style of portal's, and the lead dev also was part of the first portal (surprise surprise). You use 4 different dimensions, which you can change at will, to solve puzzles. Fluffy,    Heavy       Slow Mo    and    Reverse Gravity   . They aren't all unlocked from the start, but you slowly unlock each one as you progress through the story.   PLUS, ITS NARRORATED BY JOHN DE LANCIE! JOHN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING LANCIE!  How much better does it get?
8523	1	a	If You A Portal Fan, Well This May Be Something You Might Like.
8525	1	a	Think way outside of the box. And then make it fluffy.
8527	1	a	Fans of portal will like a lot of this game for whose are looking for casual fun and also is good to learn about physics!
8529	1	a	This game is great but too easy and too much hint from the professor.  Get it at half price for all Portal fan.
8531	1	a	Great puzzle game that is comparable to portal just with a more positive story line.
8533	1	a	Not a Mexican game but still pretty good. Might be somewhat influenced by Mexican mythology. We have lots of bags, amulets and murder in Mexico.   All in all, probably the best non-Mexican game I ever played.
8535	1	a	â™¥
8537	1	a	Only bought it for the tf2 items, never played it before in my life
8539	1	a	Dis game is fun. Similar to a portal 2 but with very different game style. Portal has portals, this has dimensions. 4 different dimensions and sometimes,(like in portal) you need to act fast. I got this game and its a bit laggy, which makes it harder, but I got season pass or whatever. I'd get as you can get your money out of it.
8541	1	a	It's alright. It's like Portal's quirky derpy little brother.  7/10
8543	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a fantastic puzzle game with equally fantastic writing and humor. If you enjoy the Portal series or other similar puzzle games, I would strongly encourage you to give this game a shot.
8545	1	a	Fantastic little puzzle game for anyone looking for light humorous fun. Innovative gameplay with fairly straightforward puzzles.
8547	1	a	From the mind of Kim Swift, one of the creators of Portal, this little puzzler does not dissappoint. The puzzle mechanics are unique from Portal and just as satisfying. The difficulty isn't quite as high, but this game is worth any Portal fan's attention. Story is generic, the environments lack the polish of other titles, and platforming and timing are overused at times in puzzle solving, but even those flaws aren't enough to diminish the experience. A++
8549	1	a	I have to say, this game is good for it's little following... I'm surprised at least the idea has not turned into another game. A little glimpse into what f-stop was in portal 2 (maybe). All around a good game. The only thing it is missing is a little bit of a storyline. I mean, I get that I am an 8 year old, who was visiting his grandfather... or something like that, but I think that if it had some engaging plots, it would feel a lot less repetitive (and i guess it also felt a little like you had to grind certain levels, similar to RPG games). Overall probably a 7 out of 10
8551	1	a	Quantum Conundrum gives a Portal vibe in its mechanics, puzzles, use of cubes, and narrator (I'd argue the uncle is on-par or better than GLaDOS)...probably because Kim Swift, the lead designer of Portal, directed it. The game is great with building on previously-learned material, giving you a new power, then repeating. And the new powers are fun to play around with (there were many instances where I probably did something I wasn't supposed to). The uncle's monologues and the death screens provide excellent comedy. Very difficult time attack/least shifts used/no death runs for that added challenge are there when you finish the game. If you liked Portal (or Q.U.B.E.) or just like puzzles and you're looking for something new and zany, this game is definitely for you!
8553	1	a	cool!
8555	1	a	Really fun game from the dev of Portal
8557	1	a	It's an okay game, finished it in 7 hours. Some puzzles are devious, but most can be solved in less than a minute of thinking. A little dissappointing in some respects, many repeated areas (in between the puzzles).   Asthetically beautiful though, the shifts between dimensions change colours, monitor filters, even the portraits on the the walls. Hopefully the DLC will feature either some new dimensions or much harder puzzles.
8559	1	a	About 7 hours. Puzzles start pretty simple and dull, but you end up doing some cool things, even if theyre mostly not difficult. NPC's personalities may be too goofy for some to take. The ending has zero resolution, it just ends. Overall pretty fun puzzles.
8561	1	a	A pretty decent game. A bit short though.
8563	1	a	Not quite as good as portal, but still a warm feel-good game, even if the dreaded first person platform element is more fiddly than it should be.
8565	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great experience overall, but it somewhat lacks in a few aspects. First of all, if you liked the original Portal you will probably like this game, considering it was made by most of the same team. The puzzles are good, not too hard, but not so easy that I could fly right through them. I see a lot of potential here, if they are planning a sequel, they should try to do the same thing Valve did for Portal 2. If you feel like taking a trip to Quadrangle Manor I would reccomend that you wait for a sale before purchasing. But it is worth the price if you can't wait. 7.5/10
8567	1	a	I picked this up the day after playing the demo, and after reading a lot of reviews that make complaints about different parts of it. The demo is a good representation of the final product, with there being mostly just more of everything in it in the full game, including anything that annoys you.  Worst part: Whenever you are required to make very precise jumps, mostly because a lot of the objects you jump on are not simple shapes and can get in the way. Getting stuck on a sofa at a key moment and plummeting to your death is not fun.  Best part: Dimension shifting is awesome and unlike anything I've seen before and the way it alters the appearance of the entire environment adds to this. You owe it to yourself to at least try the demo.  Bonus: Take one of the batteries from Ike when in the slow motion dimension to hear him make a sound worthy of a true interdimensional beast.
8569	1	a	Let's see...  1. This is a Portal knock-off...  2. ...developed by a former Portal team member...  3. ...with John de Lancie narrating...  4. ...and a level named after a Tenacious D song.  Oh, and it's a great game, too.
8571	1	a	What was supposed to be a simple visit to your uncle, who happens to be a brilliant scientist, becomes anything but simple when you discover that he isn't there to meet you and instead talks to you via his mansion's speaker system when suddenly an explosion rocks the mansion and your uncle ends up in some odd dimension. Now it's up to you to explore the really odd mansion and find a way to bring your uncle back to the proper dimension. Of course you will be doing some dimension switching yourself, all have their own unique looks and effects on the various objects, be sure to look at the paintings in each dimensions for a laugh. The story is simple, but it has a charm to it and the whole dimension mechanic is extremely well done and the puzzles will force you to be extremely creative with dimension hopping.
8573	1	a	Good to dip in and out of, can get a bit repetative.
8575	1	a	This game will not only challenge your brain with elaborate puzzles that feel satisfying to solve, it will also give you quite a few laughs. 10/10 would buy season pass if it was available separately from the game.
8577	1	a	Really fun and bubbly puzzle game in the same niche as Portal. Storybook estetique and a good portion of black humor, a must for any fans of puzzle games!
8579	1	a	It's like Kim Swift took the concept of Portal- solving puzzles in first person using a device while you are completely alone save someone talking to you over an intercom system- and added John de Lancie. More games could use John de Lancie. Let's make John de Lancie the new Nolan North. I would like that very much.
8581	1	a	Think Portal, with more puns, and manipulating gravity instead of portals in order to solve puzzles.  Don't be fooled by the cartoonishness, its more challenging than it looks.
8583	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
8585	1	a	Reminds me a lot of Portal! Same type of gameplay, but all new mechanics! (I also love John de Lancie so it's a fantastic game all around)
8587	1	a	A physics puzzle-platformer with ties to the Portal series both in theme and production (it was directed by Kim Swift, who worked as lead designer on Portal) and though the puzzles in QC are (subjectively) better than Portal's, it lacks any of the latter's charm or personality.  The level design is templated similarly to Portal, with the main character (here a 12-year old boy) moving from room to room in a massive mansion repurposed into a research facility (that is, a mansion repurposed to look like Aperature) with the hero's amnesiac mad scientist uncle playing the part of GLaDOS, instructing him (ie, the main character) through the facility espousing hints, quips, and barbs. Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.  And though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y. I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.  All in all, I'd give it a B  If you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.
8589	1	a	Cute gameâ€”for a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
8591	1	a	Really fun game from the dev of Portal
8593	1	a	It's good, not great but good. More platformer than puzzle game. The story is a bit shallow. It's also pretty short so wait for a sale.
8595	1	a	This is certainly a very new and different kind of game. If you've got the dexterity to pull it off, and don't mind dying a lot (which, by the way, is very amusing in this game). this is a good game to get.
8597	1	a	Only needed a walkthrough twice. 9/10
8599	1	a	Everything is slowed down, but, oh, now you're upside down. And now everything is soft and squishy - what kind of game is this? Quantum Conundrum is an incredibly bizzare game that feels like it was made by the Portal team. Solve puzzles by inverting gravity, making things soft, slowing time, and making everything heavy. A brilliant game, but very short and with no promise of future updates. I reccomend this to those who love Portal and all things bizarre.
8601	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a fantastic puzzle game with equally fantastic writing and humor. If you enjoy the Portal series or other similar puzzle games, I would strongly encourage you to give this game a shot.
8603	1	a	There should be a LEVEL EDITOR that would be so COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8605	1	a	Fantastic little puzzle game for anyone looking for light humorous fun. Innovative gameplay with fairly straightforward puzzles.
8607	1	a	Light hearted, enjoyable puzzle game! The uncle's voice reminds me of Discord from MLP FIM,so its really interesting to think about discord talking to you instead of your uncle. The puzzles are many and great, the humor is plentiful and the game all around reminds me of a lighter humor than Portal. Would recommend. Would buy sequel. Looking at the DLC. If you loved Portal you'll enjoy this.
8609	1	a	Also neat.
8611	1	a	â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†
8613	1	a	Tons of fun and a great first person puzzle game! NOT THE SAME AS PORTAL! So don't pick it up if you aren't up for a challange.
8615	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
8617	1	a	A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.   Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.   The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.   Good stuff.
8619	1	a	The problem was totally visible. It wasn't quantum at all.
8621	1	a	Brilliant! Almost as good as Portal 2 :3
8623	1	a	Quite an innovative and clever game. The humour is a little bit lacking at times, and the plot is one that relies on a character having amnesia, but the puzzles are what makes this game shine. Each dimensional shift ability you gain is presented to you in a thoughtful and well-designed manner, which you then have to master before gaining full control of each, one by one. This makes the learning curve quite appropriate for everybody. The graphical style is cartoony, but it fits the theme of the game perfectly.  Definitely worth getting this game, especially for people who enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal.
8625	1	a	This is one of the best games ive ever played, it had an great story, wasnt to short, and the puzzles were painfully amazing, i would give it 8.5/10
8627	1	a	A good first person puzzler.

8629	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
8631	1	a	Puzzles are challenging, humour is great. Not to mention the main voice in the game is John De Lancie, All around Thumbs Up in the IDS Device
8633	1	a	This is a fantastic and unique puzzle game. It's challenging, fun, and pretty. It does have some similarities to Portal, but hey, you have to expect that when on of the lead directors of Portal worked on this game. A lot of pop-culture references too.  Overall, a fantastic game. I reccomend it to any lovers of puzzle games, fans of Portal, or anyone just looking for a good, cheap game. (And the TF2 items aren't that bad either, heh heh.)
8635	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.  It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
8637	1	a	A lot of people are going to compare this game to Portal based on the overall design and style of the game. Unfortunately, that is an extremely narrow point of view and completely negates many of the inventive pieces that are brought into a game like Quantum Conundrum. While its fairly obvious that QC is influenced by Portal (should that really be any surprise considering the individuals behind both games), you are forced into solving puzzles and performing FPS platforming in a way that was never introduced into the Portal series. This creates a unique game experience which has you thinking the whole way through. Admittedly, puzzles aren't as challenging as one might expect, but there is enough quality levels in the base game to keep you occupied for several hours. At a budget price, it's a pretty easy sell and with the prospect of new levels and support coming down the pipe, this looks to be a fun series to help support.

8641	1	a	If you liked Portal, this game has some fun puzzle elements do it and a great art style.
8643	1	a	If you loved portal you cant miss this one
8645	1	a	Couch surfing period.
8647	1	a	Personally, I find this game boring, but intriguing. The mechanics are very well implemented but they get slightly over-used. I found always use each different 'state' fun but the zones where you used them went on for too long. I would get used to it, love it, then grow tired of it and would rush through the rest making me frustrated and tired. usually missing many of the small jokes and story.   5/10
8649	1	a	A couple of missteps, but all in all an entertaining game.
8651	1	a	Very Fun. Enjoy this work of art from the girl who helped make portal the maginicent game it also is
8653	1	a	Such a fun game! If you love Portal you will love this!
8655	1	a	This is quite a good fun Portal imitator which has its own idea on how to make physics puzzles more interesting.  The idea being you transfer between dimensions with different properties to solve puzzles. However I have one big gripe with this and that is the momentum within the game.   Sometimes, when it suits, momentum is conserved, and other times it really, REALLY, isnt. You will remain still on moving objects and then fall to your doom. You can be blocked by certain floors, while objects sail through, etc. etc...  This game is by no means perfect, making it very much only an imitator of Portal and not a competitor. I would recommend it for a visit, but only get it if it is on sale.
8657	1	a	This game is a litte more straightforward than I thought it would be, and the storytelling and exploration was a little subpar; but switching between the dimensions was super cool, and I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game with a unique game mechanic.
8659	1	a	Absolutely great puzzle game-platformer, some puzzles are sor hard they will make you cry. 10/10 would puzzle-cry again
8661	1	a	Nifty.
8663	1	a	Absolutely love it. It makes me think, sometimes it makes me curse in frustration, and the dialog is funny and interesting. Totally worth the money for the game.
8665	1	a	I love physics games and I love puzzle games. Quantum Conundrum achieves both of these areas spectacularly with beautifully created graphics and a comedic storyline. Add to this a pretty awesome soundtrack and you get one of my dream games  Basically, it's a fantastic game and if you're at all a fan of physics games or puzzle games you really should try this out
8667	1	a	I really like this game. It's a fun puzzle/platformer with a similar feel to Portal. It's not all that difficult but it also isn't too easy. The DLC is where the real challenging levels where for me. It has great physics, which is really important, because all the puzzles are physics based. Really the only thing else I want from this game, is for someone to make a mod adding Vive support,
8669	1	a	he's in a conundrum
8671	1	a	3d puzzle games that requires you to work between dimensions, The main Story puzzles are Easy. but doing the challenges might be a bit more difficult than you think.  Did I forget to Mention the narrator is john de lancie
8673	1	a	I think this game may have more in common with Portal than Portal 2 did. The mechanics of changing dimensions on the fly feel very natural and organic in much the same way the portal gun does, and the puzzles are a joy to work through. Professor Quadwrangle doesn't have quite as much personality as GLaDOS, but his voiceovers are still fun to listen to and do more than an adequate job of guiding the player through the mansions that makes up the setting.
8675	1	a	Others will say 'if you like Portal, play this.' I'll be more specific. This is a game where you actively figure out the puzzle scenario placed in front of you using the tools you have. Your left hand will be busy (combining and alternating dimensions) compared to Portal's right-hand activity (of making portals). Timing is important, but split-second timing is not; planning is much more significant. The sense of humor tends to mad-science whimsy; John De Lancie brings his Star-Trek 'Q' personality to the player's uncle narrator. The game's plenty challenging in its short length (I spent about 6 hours with multiple quick retries in several sections). In short, I was so fond of this I bought it for others.
8677	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great experience overall, but it somewhat lacks in a few aspects. First of all, if you liked the original Portal you will probably like this game, considering it was made by most of the same team. The puzzles are good, not too hard, but not so easy that I could fly right through them. I see a lot of potential here, if they are planning a sequel, they should try to do the same thing Valve did for Portal 2. If you feel like taking a trip to Quadrangle Manor I would reccomend that you wait for a sale before purchasing. But it is worth the price if you can't wait. 7.5/10
8679	1	a	Plays like a cartooney version of Portal.
8681	1	a	It's like Portal...but not
8683	1	a	Fun little game, lots of interesting puzzles to solve and I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoyed the humour and puzzle solving of portal as this is in a similar style.
8685	1	a	Great game, definitely worth playing! The puzzles are hard enough to ake you think a bit, but easy enough so that you still have a general idea of what you need to do to solve it. There is a lot of humor in the dialogue and surrounding environment. The animation style is cartoony, similar to Despicable Me.
8687	1	a	(I had a previous review but i don't think it posted so i'll try again)  Well, I finished the game. I have to say, it was very interesting to go through. I enjoyed it for many reasons, but many others don't for the same reasons. Some people complained that it was a very slow and tedious to progress, but I thought it was very fun to have to figure out what you needed to do in order to finish the level. Many complained that getting all the new dimensions took to long, but i thought it was smart of them to add in the dimensions one at a time, making it so you understand the best way to use this dimension, instead of rushing through and never really learning the proper/best way. I agree that the puzzles weren't hard, but this game is pretty old. (Yes, 2012 is old for a game.) The puzzle industry around that time was growing, and this was a great game for it's time. The graphics were also really great, again considering that it was released 2012, and was up in the higher game quality. (Some games released at that year were Borderlands 2, Hotline Miami, Halo 4, Assassin's Creed 3, Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, MAX PAYNE 3, DIABLO 3, SOMETHING 3 JEEZ LOUIS COME UP WITH A DIFFRENT GAME ALREADY WE DON'T NEED 3 F*****G GAMES... Sorry lost my cool. :) I also agree that the ending was a little anti-climtic, making it kind of a bit hard to want to go back and get all the achivements, but none the less it was an ending that wrapped things up. Another thing would be that we never actually saw our uncle in real life, so that kind of ruined it for me too. Many people said the uncles jokes weren't really funny, but honestly, if you have a real uncle you know that all of their jokes are about as funny as your dad's. (WOOT WOOT just offended a couple orphans here! I am on FIRE!) However even though others complained that the jokes weren't good, i thought they were hilarious, maybe just my sense of humour. Another thing to was that he didn't pretend that you were dumb. He didn't go, 'The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. Oh, that means it makes two metal thingys stick together reall well.' He would go 'The quaddrople x Semi- automatic fumpwraplle 3000 acts as a negative contrary triplled definied adhesive towarsd any anti-active semi-metals. I remeber the one time my friend made it, but spilled some on workshope table and a piece of metal he was working on, with his hand stuck in between! Oh my, he had a fun time explaining that to the paramedics!' Instead of dumbing it down for you, he simply made it easier for you to understand what happened or what it does.  I think i'm nearing the end of my review now. I'm pretty sure I covered the bigger parts. I think this game would have been amazing if they had added in a world editor so you could build your own little puzzles, and steam workshop support. All in all I rate this game a good 9/10. not perfect but definitely something i would buy again if given the choice.   When i read comments that normally sways my verdict if i should get this game or not. I don't want someone missing out on a game or getting a game and not liking it because of my rating. Decide for yourself if you want to get it or not, my rating should just be something that you read and go 'Oh, He liked it. That's good for him.' That's all!  Edit: This isn't going to be short. I missed a couple things. I'll try to keep it shorter but i suck at that so... Anyways, people complained about the Physics engine not being very good. I actually had no problem with the controls and thought they were decent enough to use and not be frustrated. It may just be me being used to crudy quality engines, spending my time playing games like- actually maybe i shouldn't mention but you get the point. Another thing people complained about was amount of time it took. I got this on sale for like 2 bucks so i wasn't going to be overly 'Wow, I spent 199.99 bucks on this, it better be an amazing game or else i'll be really mad!' I thought the play time was great, and yes i know i spent 11 hours on it, but that was because i left it open for an hour or two, and i accidentaly had to re-play 2 hours worth because of steam save file crap that screwed me over. I thought that it was a great amounnt of time on a game i really enjoyed. I also probably missed something else so there may be another edit.
8689	1	a	One of the best and most fun single player games I have played. Definitely recommend.
8691	1	a	8/10
8693	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great puzzle game that had come out of its year. Sadly not many people have played this game during its release. However, this game is a good alternate portal game without portals but uses four different environmental effects to solve puzzles. Its not very easy and its not very difficult. Its moderate in my opinion. However, the difficulty is always different for different people. Some puzzles take time and some are smooth as butter.
8695	1	a	Fun and unique puzzle game that falls a bit short. While this game may look like something that will make you think outside the box, it's actually the opposite. The game is quite linear for the most part, with not much flexibility given to the player. Most levels are designed to be solved in a specific way, but that is not to say that it isn't challenging. I think it's moderately difficult for the average player and achivements are well within reach if you try.  My score: 7.5/10
8697	1	a	Quantum Conundrum came out of left field and smacked me right in the face with it's surprisingly clever setting, multidimensional puzzles and classy humor. While none of the puzzles are mind-bogglingly hard, they're still fun and give you a solid feeling of accomplishment.
8699	1	a	Not as stellar as Portal, but fun and worth the price. Great soundtrack!
8701	1	a	Great puzzle game with unique and fun mechanics. Those who liked the Portal franchise will probably like this game too as they are pretty similar in terms of level/puzzle design.
8703	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a family friendly, less narratively interesting first person puzzler with unique and fun puzzle devices. My biggest complaint would be a couple puzzles toward the end of the game that are just miserable and lazy. The rest of it is fun and engaging if only for short bursts. This isn't a bad thing for a typical puzzle game but feels odd for a game which feels like it will grip you like Portal did, and never does.  The game is often compared to Portal, a better game, to Conundrum's detriment, but it has earned the comparison. It attempts a snarky, dark humored irreverent and unkind narrator. It has both seemingly deliberate 'puzzle rooms' and behind the scenes type puzzle sections, very similar to what Portal offered. The lead designer was one of the original Portal creators and I'm assuming she figured the formula was flawless. Well... It's not flawless but it is pretty darn good. If you're a game designer, consider playing it just to see how cleverly the dimensional swap mechanics can be used for physics gameplay.
8705	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES MY BRAIN HURT IN A GOOD WAY
8707	1	a	Just, awesome. Fun with physics! Throw a safe through the wall, bounce around, fly on a couch. The dimensional shifting is the point, and good part of the game. Amazingly inventive. Also, the commentary. All in all, thumbs up. 11/10.
8709	1	a	From the same designer as Portal: A rather good first person platformer and physics puzzle game, with a good sense of humor and John de Lancie voicing the mad scientist Uncle who has been damseled and is in need of rescue. Puzzles and platforming revolve around the shifting of 'dimensions' between normal, heavy, lighter, slower, and reversed gravity leading to much more thinking through the puzzles than annoying difficult jumps. Graphic fidelity is good, style is bright and slightly cartoony with details being different in each 'dimension' allowing for some amusing easter-eggs. The game was enjoyable, fun, and not overly hard.
8711	1	a	A great little puzzle game filled with non-stop humour. Worth every penny.
8713	1	a	If they made Portal with a crazy Uncle instead of an insane A.I. with a manor house instead of an underground lab, and control over gravity/time instead of portals, you'd have Quantum Conundrum. Great game can't wait for DLC.
8715	1	a	I dont want to just say this game is Portal......but this game is Portal. Instead of portals you get DIMENSIONS. Thats right kids you can mess with the fabric of space time and other fabrics to solve puzzles! WHO DOESNT LIKE PUZZLES? NO ONE THATS WHO. Really though its well designed and has a great deal of charm and save for a few frustratiingly designed puzzles its a damn near perfect game. So give it a shot. I know you'll just wait till its on sale but thats ok. DO A THING!
8717	1	a	This game is sooo much fun! Nice challenging puzzles too.
8719	1	a	Best puzzle game since Portal (1), story not as good, but gameplay is awsome!
8721	1	a	Another clever and adorable little game ruined by inexplicable motion sickness. Damn my actual eyes!
8723	1	a	A new way of thinking out of the box! Shift through the dimensions to manipulate almost every object that you come across!
8725	1	a	Not as good as Portal (this game was designed by a former Portal creator by the way), but still a fun and lenghty game for your 15 bucks. My big complaint about it is the frustrating platform-jumping section, it doesn't work well in the first person perspective and the platform are too small and rely too much on unpredictable physics.
8727	1	a	Enjoy the portal-esque puzzles. Hate the first-person platforming. Love the art-style. Q is your narrator. Worth my money.
8729	1	a	If they made Portal with a crazy Uncle instead of an insane A.I. with a manor house instead of an underground lab, and control over gravity/time instead of portals, you'd have Quantum Conundrum. Great game can't wait for DLC.
8731	1	a	What a brilliant and fun puzzle game!
8733	1	a	have you ever imagined yourself Portal without portals? [almost] Without A.I.`s, but with mysterious alien-looking organic beings? Without Cave jonson, but with fancy genius uncle? Wihout gel, but with mysterious colorful pills? Bet you haven`t. Well, SURPRRISE!
8735	1	a	Underrated, fun, clever, and a steal at the current price. I wish the DLC added to the story, but that was only because of my expectations.   Oh, and it features John de Lancie as the nutty uncle. Worth it almost just for that.
8737	1	a	Weird little adventure in the spirit of Portal, narrated by John de Lancie. Original and worth playing.
8739	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
8741	1	a	Has some of the people behind Portal working on it; and it's similar except the puzzles are solved by manipulating the properties of objects and the rooms by switching between various dimensions. Pretty clever situations in some cases.
8743	1	a	If you enjoy Portal you will love Quantum Conundrum as it features alot of the same physics type puzzles and also if you are a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation you will instantly recognize the voice of Q John de Lancie who plays your mad scientist uncle.
8745	1	a	Portal-like physics 3d puzzle. Think dimensions, or something like that. Nice graphics, kind of story and around-gaming humour included.
8747	1	a	Some peoples say: if you like Portal then you like this game. Not really. First and most important - different puzzle 'complete mechanism'. What i mean: in Portal (at least in Portal 2) you need figure, how this puzzle must be solved (main time) and then solve puzzle for a minute; in QC you figure how this puzzle must be solved for a minute and then must do some keyboards ninja tricks (quite frequently difficult and annoying). So, you often facing with a situation, when you straight know how puzzle must be solved, but can't done it, because not so fast and not in the order press keys. And you must repeat, repeat, repeat. Plus poor level environment: just sofas, tables and cabinets with books in ALL levels. If you can deal with above, you can get fun, because this still decent game and anyway it worth a try. Also recommend 'Flip a Switch' song from QC Soundtrack.
8749	1	a	If you like the Portal games, then you'll like this one too.
8751	1	a	Had as much as if not more fun in this than Portal 1 and 2. Great game, not that hard but has a lot of fun eastereggs and details that made it look and sound good. Having 4 seperate filters that you can apply is really exciting
8753	1	a	If you liked Portal and Portal 2, if you like to challenge your physics brain and give yourself the most wonderful headaches. This is the game for you. Puzzles that feel like you have to break the system to get through are commonplace, and I frequently felt like I must be doing it wrong, only to find that it was exactly what was needed to advance. I bought this game for some first person puzzle action, and boy did I get it. Worth it/10
8755	1	a	Basically, portal. but in a mansion and instead of portals its dimensions. Not to mention an evil uncle thats played by john de lancie.  If you like either the Stanley Parable or Portal, you will love this game.
8757	1	a	really makes you think a great game for the price (if under 20$) took me about 25-30 hr's to clear all the dlc and reg game (which i did in reverse order..... don't ask)
8759	1	a	Eh. It was a good game. But honestly, I don't know how good. Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.  The one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.  Other issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.  On top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.  And to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.  The Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the 'surprise' in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.  I think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them. Worth a look if you want a casual puzzle experience and find it on sale, but don't expect too much out of it.
8761	1	a	People will try to describe this as another Portal clone, but besides the fact they both consist of puzzles, they cannot be any more different.  Able to switch between four dimensions, the player needs to figure out how best to use them together to get out.   The four dimensions are  1) Fuzzy - All items become very plush and ten times lighter. A safe or couch can be carried around and thrown as if it was a baseball. 2) Heavy - All items become metal clad (maybe even more so) and weight 10 times as much. Toss a fuzzy item then, while it is midair, turn it heavy so it can then smash through glass walls or when you need something very heavy heading very fast in a certain direction. 3) Slow Time - All items and lasers fall and zap at a snail's pace. If you jump on an item travelling through the air, it will be solid to jump on. 4) Anti gravity - All items not tied down will float to the sky. Hopefully they float to something where they are needed  
8763	1	a	imagine portal if it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
8765	1	a	really makes you think a great game for the price (if under 20$) took me about 25-30 hr's to clear all the dlc and reg game (which i did in reverse order..... don't ask)
8767	1	a	8/10
8769	1	a	Exxxxcelllent Muhha ha *cough* *cough* ha! Twist your mind around this portal like puzzler! More engageing than said other game.. Damn game drove me sane. Loooollloolllb boooff llaaa laa! 
8771	1	a	Just barely a thumbs up. This is a portal clone that is mostly well-done. It just has a feel of tediousness and samey-ness to many parts of it. The voice acting is great, but the writing feels a bit lacking. The puzzles were ok, and I didn't mind most of the platforming. There were plenty of parts though where there was so much retry-after-failure due to precision jumping that it became aggravating.  Maybe it was just because I was doing most of the game in one long run, but by the end, the game felt more like a chore than fun.  It is a decent portal-like game overall, but take plenty of breaks while playing.
8773	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES MY BRAIN HURT IN A GOOD WAY
8775	1	a	Nice physics puzzle/platformer game. Hardcore like Portal 1 rather than 2. You need brains and mad jumping skills.
8777	1	a	Great concept, nice art design, good humor, John de Lancie as a voice actor and heavily based on 3D platforming in first person. The last one isn't exactly a positive. Also, a bit on the easy side as far as puzzles go.
8779	1	a	If you've ever wanted to pretend that you're trying to escape from being trapped in a twisted children's playground while Q jabbers at you incessantly, this is possibly the game for you. If you haven't - well, it's still pretty fun. A couple of the puzzles require some annoyingly precise timing and the ending is deeply, deeply disappointing compared to some similar games which I won't name ACOUGHCOUGHPORTALCOUGH but all in all it's quite enjoyable.
8781	1	a	First-person puzzler from Portal designer Kim Swift. Features delightful narration by John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation). Do NOT bother with the DLC, which features no story or narration at all! You have been warned.
8783	1	a	Reallly Really NICE!!!! Cool ideas and nice alternative to Portal!!! If u like Portal get IT is WORTH it!
8785	1	a	Absolutely great puzzle game-platformer, some puzzles are sor hard they will make you cry. 10/10 would puzzle-cry again
8787	1	a	Complicated but fun
8789	1	a	Pros: +Interesting voice acting/characters +Well thought out puzzles  Cons -Not very well optimized  I suggest getting it on a sale if you're interested.
8791	1	a	I love physics games and I love puzzle games. Quantum Conundrum achieves both of these areas spectacularly with beautifully created graphics and a comedic storyline. Add to this a pretty awesome soundtrack and you get one of my dream games  Basically, it's a fantastic game and if you're at all a fan of physics games or puzzle games you really should try this out
8793	1	a	If you liked Portal, you'll LOVE this game. It doesn't have much of a storyline though, and the ending looks like it was thought up in two minutes. Maybe the DLCs will improve things.
8795	1	a	Amazing game. It's a unique and different physics game. Definately worth it, buy it now!
8797	1	a	As brain-bendingly punishing as you can imagine. It's a bit more linear than Portal, but you get more toys to play and experiment with and the humor, combined with John De Lancie's amazing voiceover work, makes for a HELL of a lot of fun. Definitely a buy.
8799	1	a	Great idea, you can solve puzzles in different dimensions. The game have a good feelings but the puzles going to a little bit boring after a time. ________________________________________________________  Ã–tletes kis logikai jÃ¡tÃ©k, ahol kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÅ‘zÅ‘ dimenziÃ³kban kell egy-egy adott feladatot megoldanunk. Nagyon hangulatos, de a fejtÃ¶rÅ‘k egy kicsit unalmasak lesznek egy idÅ‘ utÃ¡n.
8801	1	a	A new way of thinking out of the box! Shift through the dimensions to manipulate almost every object that you come across!
8803	1	a	Enjoy the portal-esque puzzles. Hate the first-person platforming. Love the art-style. Q is your narrator. Worth my money.
8805	1	a	the narrater of tthis game is like a pile of delicately folded sheets
8807	1	a	Not only, does this game have some of the most interesting and challenging puzzles I've seen in a long time, but it also has some of the most funny dialogue I've heard in a while. In my opinion, the puzzles have an excellent level of difficulty. I never found any of them to be unfairly complex, or tasking.  None of them caused any major frustration to me, but neither did they feel pointlessly easy. This game is a perfect choice for anyone who enjoys puzzles, or has a good sense of humor.
8809	1	a	I dont want to just say this game is Portal......but this game is Portal. Instead of portals you get DIMENSIONS. Thats right kids you can mess with the fabric of space time and other fabrics to solve puzzles! WHO DOESNT LIKE PUZZLES? NO ONE THATS WHO. Really though its well designed and has a great deal of charm and save for a few frustratiingly designed puzzles its a damn near perfect game. So give it a shot. I know you'll just wait till its on sale but thats ok. DO A THING!
8811	1	a	Didn't like the first hour or so. Then came a rather steady increase in fun, which continued through the end, and by then I was enjoying myself enough to decide it was well worthwhile and write this recommendation.
8813	1	a	Physics-based puzzle platformer in the same vein as the Portal games. Pretty fun.
8815	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
8817	1	a	Has some of the people behind Portal working on it; and it's similar except the puzzles are solved by manipulating the properties of objects and the rooms by switching between various dimensions. Pretty clever situations in some cases.
8819	1	a	Innovation at it's finest, merging physics and fun into one marvelous game. Thinking outside the box has never been this much fun.
8821	1	a	Is the aweosomness game ever 
8823	1	a	YOU GUYS OWE ME A NEW KEYBOARD
8825	1	a	Physics-based puzzle platformer in the same vein as the Portal games. Pretty fun.
8827	1	a	So much win; like being FP in a Saturday morning cartoon. Levels are spacious rooms that make you feel like the kid you're supposed to be playing as, which is a neat touch. Like others have posted, jumping can be a bit off-putting and touchy to time right but there's a rhythm to most of it that's not frustrating to master. A great way to while away a rainy afternoon or two.
8829	1	a	This game is like Portal, but without the portals!
8831	1	a	The game is often compared to the likes of Portal and on the surface that is correct. During the game you travel room to room gaining new powers and learning the game as a sarcastic narrator comments on your performance. Where they differ is on their core mechanics, where Portal is Puzzle/FPS, QC is more Puzzle/Platforming.  A great execution of 3D platforming the game is good fun, and John de Lancie makes it all the better.  DAT ENDING
8833	1	a	have you ever imagined yourself Portal without portals? [almost] Without A.I.`s, but with mysterious alien-looking organic beings? Without Cave jonson, but with fancy genius uncle? Wihout gel, but with mysterious colorful pills? Bet you haven`t. Well, SURPRRISE!
8835	1	a	The game is fun enough with physics based puzzles using different dimensions. Where it falls short is the platforming that it relies on more and more as the game progresses. It is awkward and inaccurate most of the time. Often I found myself in the situation that although I'd worked out a puzzle's solution executing the required platforming bits took repeated trials. Nothing is more frustrating that being halted by an inability to perform simple platforming tasks rather than an actual puzzle conundrum. Although I got pretty far into the game, I think the pain in the neck platforming will cause me to put the game in the 'probably will never finish' category. Someday, when I'm feeling up to the repetitveness I may return to Quantum Conundrum but that will probably not be any time soon.
8837	1	a	this game is just amazing. truly. i finished it and all dlc, don't worry about the steam time...no joke, this is even better than portal
8839	1	a	Perhaps a bit childish, but still fun. The puzzles are maybe a little too easy.
8841	1	a	if you liked portal or Portal 2 then you'll love this! (not to mention it was designed the same person)
8843	1	a	Great game, definitely a lot of fun and gives a good tug at your brain strings. I do wish the humor was more in the vein of Portal/Portal2 however, because it seems like it's trying to be funny and often falls flat--the narrator at least. Fluffy Ike is adorable and gives me some laughs.  Either way, very enjoyable.   8.6/10
8845	1	a	It took me far too long to play this game through. I pre-ordered it way back when and, like many other games in my Library, inexplicably stopped after playing a good chunk. Only in the last few days of 2014 did I finally get back to it and complete the last 2/3rds, and I'm sad it took me so long to finish this wonderful game.  Shortly after your mother drops you off to visit your uncle (Professor Quadrangle, voiced by John de Lancie who narrates the game in a GLaDOS-like manner), you find that an incident has placed him in some sort of strange pocket dimension and cut off power to his mansion. Using one of his latest inventions, the Inter-Dimensional Shift device (IDS), you push through puzzles to power the place back up utilizing four different dimensions in which the properties of time, matter, and gravity are changed. These dimensions are unlocked as you progress, and can only be utilized when the corresponding battery is in the room. The batteries won't always be plugged in either, meaning sometimes you'll have to retrieve them from another part of the room before you can go forward.  I'm not a huge puzzle master, and I'm pretty sure more than once I 'solved' a puzzle in a way that wasn't meant to happen, but I never found myself hopelessly stuck; it was always just a matter of trying a couple different things until something worked, or knowing what I had to do but having to get it right. The puzzle difficulty felt perfect, hard enough that it felt good to solve and wasn't a boring pushover, but not too hard where I could spend half an hour desperately trying to figure things out. Every time a dimension is added to your roster there's a puzzle or two to help you get the hang of what it does and how it works. I suppose if you're a puzzle master, however, it might seem like child's play.  Through the narration of John de Lancie and a beautiful soundtrack there's never a dull moment...not that things can get very dull when you're flying through the air on a coffee table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had already purchased the soundtrack...and all the DLC! I don't remember doing that, hm.  I'm a little upset at how many negative reviews are on the front page, but I suppose you can't please everyone. The ending WAS lackluster, though maybe it's resolved in some way in the DLC. Many people seem to hate the narration and the physics engine too, but I didn't have a problem with either. In fact I very much enjoyed the constant voice acting, and didn't find it annoying in the slightest. I guess I just really like John de Lancie's voice.  Overall I must recommend it. It's cute, it's fun, it's silly.
8847	1	a	A fun and challenging game! Though if you suck at timeing and platform jumpers.. you might have quite a bit fo difficulty with this game.
8849	1	a	Absolutly LOVE this game. This, besides Skyrim, is my favorite casul game. I find it much more enjoyable than Portal. Really hope the Devs make a second!!
8851	1	a	I only bought it for John de Lancie, and even that is lacking.
8853	1	a	Probably Portal's only competition. It's very much so the same game, but instead of portals, you get to mess with different dimensions. Each dimension changes the characteristic of objects in the puzzle. For example, if you can't pick up a metal safe, switch to the Fluffy dimension and it weights enough to be picked up.   Pros: -Great Voice acting from Star Trek's 'Q' -Pretty long -Fun Puzzles -Unique concepts -Difficulty curve  Cons: -Platforming is very unforgiving -Ending is stupid 
8855	1	a	Tons of fun and a great first person puzzle game! NOT THE SAME AS PORTAL! So don't pick it up if you aren't up for a challange.
8857	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
8859	1	a	Some great puzzles in this game. Yes, it's got similarities to Portal, but that's not a bad thing at all.
8861	1	a	A good bit of fun that I got for 1.50 on a Steam sale. It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.   Some of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.   The story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.   Good stuff.
8863	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.  It's only got about 6 hours in it, but for $15 you can do worse. The game is obviously a straight console-port however. There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
8865	1	a	You will probably finish this game in one sitting, but there's always 100% completion.
8867	1	a	â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†
8869	1	a	done by the creator of portal, a device that changes dimensions and a glados type character voiced by star treks Q
8871	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
8873	1	a	Let's see...  1. This is a Portal knock-off...  2. ...developed by a former Portal team member...  3. ...with John de Lancie narrating...  4. ...and a level named after a Tenacious D song.  Oh, and it's a great game, too.
8875	1	a	A nicely challenging game that will annoy you in a good way. Also, every time I heard your mad uncle speak, I imagine 'Q' from Star Trek.....
8877	1	a	Amazing game. It's a unique and different physics game. Definately worth it, buy it now!
8879	1	a	if you liked the portal games by valve you will like this, more of a physics puzzler. more first person puzzle action then you can handle.
8881	1	a	This was alright in a very (appropriately enough) fluffy way... some of the puzzles, particularly in the second and third acts, are interesting and need some thought, but the story and presentation generally are pretty ropey. Eurogamer gave it 5/10 which seemed harsh at times but having finished the game now I think it doesn't stretch much above a 6.
8883	1	a	As brain-bendingly punishing as you can imagine. It's a bit more linear than Portal, but you get more toys to play and experiment with and the humor, combined with John De Lancie's amazing voiceover work, makes for a HELL of a lot of fun. Definitely a buy.
8885	1	a	With puzzles and overall art direction set to amuse, it is quite the conundrum why many have yet to play it.
8887	1	a	Really fun and bubbly puzzle game in the same niche as Portal. Storybook estetique and a good portion of black humor, a must for any fans of puzzle games!
8889	1	a	Its lagging very bad, is there anything i could do to make it not lag?
8891	1	a	Made by some of the people who did Portal, going into it this game with very little knowledge of it, I could feel the Portal like elements seeping through the screen as I played along. Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!) With that said, I do recommend this game. It helps wake up your brain and is a good little brain worker for those than enjoy puzzles (like I do)
8893	1	a	It's a fun and different puzzle with great graphics and a good story.
8895	1	a	If you liked the Portal games, definitely check this one out. Since people are bound to compare to the portal games I'll lay some stuff out.  1. The main mechanic is shifting between 4 different dimensions to solve puzzles. This was almost as fun as thinking with portals. 2. In the game, your uncle talks while you solve puzzles. Big drawback: he's not very entertaining. At all. Seriously, this was just terrible writing. Only slightly better than complete silence. 3. You're required to do some platforming at some parts. I've read about some people getting aneurysms over this, and while I never had too much trouble making jumps, I can see why people would gripe.   Other things: + I really did like the cartoony art style. + The barfing cloning devices and cat that follows you around were always welcome sights.  - Level design was just lazy. When going between rooms, you'll pass clones of the same corridors over and over. - In the last third of the game, there were maybe 2 or 3 areas that I'm sure plenty of people will get annoyed over. Not because they're hard to figure out, but tough to execute.  This game will exercise your brain with puzzles that are not too challenging but definitely fun. It's not the perfection that Portal 2 is, but it'll help scratch that puzzle itch. 8.5/10
8897	1	a	All in all, a decent game. It's obviously heavily inspired by Portal. Unfortunately, it can't quite reach Portal's ingenuity, even though several levels were really greatly designed. I didn't care for the rather flat humour. The story was nothing special. All in all, pick it up for a few Euros if you like puzzlers.
8899	1	a	DO you enjoy the feeling that can only be gotten from a achieving your goals through science. Then this is the game for you. Mad and armchair scientist all agree that this game will help stay on your toes long enough to enjoy the fruits of an insane experiment.
8901	1	a	Pros: +Interesting voice acting/characters +Well thought out puzzles  Cons -Not very well optimized  I suggest getting it on a sale if you're interested.
8903	1	a	 www.com/Quantum  Conundrum for more help
8905	1	a	Great game, not sure what to else say about it, but you'll have to be clever ;)
8907	1	a	Mess with different dimensions of time and weight in this puzzle-platformer to save your uncle that's lost in his mansion.
8909	1	a	10/10 FANTASTIC! Extremely highly reccomended! Exactly what I expected...Clever puzzles - numerous solved with clever tricks that would have taken ages to think of..(probably) Must Get... I can't comment on this one - I don't know what to say...Yes I do....BUY IT!   P.S. Hey everyone...Puzzle games can be replayed, you know...'oh, but I already know what happens in the story!'...Puzzle games...Its in the name - you play them because of the puzzles...Not the story...
8911	1	a	An alright puzzler sort of like Portal though the story is almost non-existant.
8913	1	a	Great puzzle game. definetely pick this up at its great price.
8915	1	a	Quantum Conundrum - a game that sit somewhere in shadows of its more popular puzzle game brother - Portal. And while both of those video games are 3D puzzle games with platforming elements, the similarity really ends here. The concepts of the two franchises are different and I wish people would stop comparing them or claming that Portal will always be a better game without even playing Quantum Conundrum. If you're a fan of the genre, you will enjoy Quantum Conundrum even though it might be a bit too easy after playing other, similar titles.   But, enough of that. It might be already clear, but I did enjoy Quantum Conundrum A LOT. And I probably enjoyed it a lot more than Portal 2. Yes, the story is pretty much a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and the ending is a set up for the sequel (which hopefully will happen although I doubt it...). Yes, the puzzles are mostly pretty easy and after getting tricky they still can be solved in under 30 minutes, But I still enjoyed my time with Quantum Conundrum...  Its concept is interesting. The game gives the player the control over the enviroment instead of one particular thing (as with Portal and QUBE). It plays with physics letting you make elements weight more or less, slow the flow of time or even the entire gravity of the room. And it does so in unexpected ways such as makes you throw boxes so you can basically fly through the level using the gravity or lets you bounce on the platforms using a couch that you can make heavier and then lighter to fling yourself upwards. Those little mechanics that make the player say 'yeah, that clever' and then use those mechanics and mix them up in another level of the game. A concept of dimensions gives a bunch of possibilities for those mechanics and (again, hoping for it) there are a lot of paths that a sequel might take.   The puzzles are never too hard. Something I dislike about puzzle games is the difficulty curve that gets really high after a while without letting the player understand what he should be doing. Quantum Conundrum teaches the player its mechanics and does a good job at it also bringing back things introduced in previous chapters in the later ones. The player never gets stuck for good or frustrated that he can't figure out a solution. The levels go by pretty fast and it gives the player the feeling of progress which, of course, pushes him forward through the game. I never felt like the game is too easy. It gave me a good challenge showing me what I can do and then mixing it up and making me do it. I never felt mad at the game for having some riddiculus solution for a puzzle. It wasn't complicated. It was always a simple concept.   As for the story, well... I didn't really care too much for it and I don't think it is a bad thing either. The story was just there as a filler, the narration was okay and I see people really liking the professor. It just wasn't my thing, but it also didn't overshadow the gameplay. Everything is presented in a really lighthearted way, the graphics are bright and colorful and the overall game has a lot of character.   So what about the negatives? There are negatives. As I've mentioned previously - the story is just a filler, it doesn't go anywhere and since the checkpoints bring you back to a set spot, you often have to listen to the same voice clip over and over again. The puzzles are simple, but not too simple and Portal veterans might breeze through the game. There are also corridors between levels that act as hidden loading screens and a 'story time' kind of deal. Those get repeated pretty fast and they're mildly annoying. The fact that they are in fact just a window of time for the game to load the next map, also might result in a bit of a frame drop from time to time. Also, I should probably mention that Quantum Conundrum loves platforming a lot more than other 3D puzzle games. Something you should probably have in mind.   Overall, I had a fantastic time with the game. It wasn't anything amazing, but it has a lot of potential and character to it and I wish we see a sequel one of these days.
8917	1	a	The design for everything is like a Pixar film: bright, colourful and charming.  The gameplay is a lot like Portal: easy to come to terms with but requiring out-of-box thinking at times. The plot -- or rather, speech -- you're constantly berated with is like a bad culmination of both: unending one-liners, bad puns, non-sequiters and dissenting jabs at your ability(s).  You're treated to four different filters, or dimensions as they call it, that impact on the world around you: fluffy, heavy, slow and reverse. Naturally you can only use one at a time but require multiple in order to solve the puzzles before you. Transporting large objects, for example, requires that you make it light (fluffy), throw it, slow down time, run round obstacles, switch back to fluffy and catch it again. The ways the game has you using these different dimensions in unison may not be initially intuitive, but they certainly arent illogical.  Its got that same wonder and feel to it that the original Portal did. I dont think the gameplay elements are strictly original, but the way it handles and presents them (much like its pseudo-ancestor) provides much satisfaction that it makes a rather hard thing to dislike. It perhaps skirts a little heavy on Portals tailcoat, but it'd be a wholly different thing if it didnt.  You won't feel bad for playing it, but you may feel a little guilty for giggling at the portraits in the games when viewed from different dimensions.
8919	1	a	Jumping from one dimension to another to exploit the laws of physics has never been so fun. The mad professor Q (voiced by the same guys as Star Trek's Q) is no match for GLaDOS and Wheatley, but adds much fun to the whole experience anyway.
8921	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
8923	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out. Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.   Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform. If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game. I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception. I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.  This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, 'Daddy, don't you dare!' We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. 
8925	1	a	An amazing game with clever puzzles, a brilliant voice actor, and the worst ending to a game since Borderlands. Seriously, that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ending made me wish I had never played the game. 7/10
8927	1	a	Cute gameâ€”for a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
8929	1	a	Very nice puzzle game with an entertaining storyline and a lot of very good sometimes hidden jokes. The difficulty is comparable to Portal 1/2...you will definitly have to think while playing this game.  And besides: the graphics style is also very nice.  For fans of games like Portal and Antichamber definitely worth playing!
8931	1	a	..My only qualm is that it is far too short.  &lt;3
8933	1	a	If you liked the original Portal, you'll love this as well. Who knew couch surfing could be so mind-blowingly fun?
8935	1	a	Quantum Conundrum tries a little too hard to live up to Portal, and falls just a little too short. The mechanics are fun, but they're rarely used in interesting ways. Where portal feels like a maze, Conundrum feels like an obstacle course. Puzzles are often less about finding a solution, and more about excecuting it.

There are no graphical options outside of resolution available, making it difficult to run without a powerful system.
8937	1	a	This game is a barrel of fun. It really just hits on a whole lot of platforming challenges with inventive ideas. Completely awesome to play. The only real issue I had with the game was the wonky physics engine. There would be moments where your jumps would cause you to skate off a ledge you had just been on. It didn't make a lot of sense to have the gravity arcs of your character be so... off?
8939	1	a	This game is super uber fun with cool-tastic and funny commentary by the uncle while you do stuff. It's kinda short, which is why it's only $15, but it is $15 well-spent. Similar to portal, but the types, mechanics, and logic behind the puzzles are different. A bit easier than portal. If you like to pick up things and throw them with physics like I do, that'll give you another reason to like this game. Buy it, damn it.
8941	1	a	3d puzzle games that requires you to work between dimensions, The main Story puzzles are Easy. but doing the challenges might be a bit more difficult than you think.  Did I forget to Mention the narrator is john de lancie
8943	1	a	Great puzzle game in the same type of style as portal, but with different mechanics.
8945	1	a	Lets face itâ€¦ this is a portal clone of sortsâ€¦ the thing is, itâ€™s a GOOD portal cloneâ€¦ you fiddle about with the environment and, to some extent, the physics to solve puzzles room to roomâ€¦. Not a bad way to kill a few hours!   But itâ€™s really hard not to see Q talking to Captain Pickard :)  
8947	1	a	This is a pleasant puzzle game, like a Saturday Morning cartoon version of Portal. Please take note that it's quite short (finished the story in 7 hours, give or take time being baffled by a room), but the light-hearted sardonically humorous dialogue and art makes up for it.  ALSO, if you are a fan of the vocal stylings of John de Lancie ( voice of Q and Discord), you will adore being his nephew. Hopping over unsafe lasers and dodging falling safes while listening to your new inventor uncle advise and patronize you is a most enjoyable mind-testing experience. Definitely buy it if you've got spare cash for a few hours of wholesome fun!
8949	1	a	Although Quantum Conundrum will inevitably be compared to the Portal franchise, this game stands on its own merits due to its well developed repertoire of physics/dimensional manipulation problems. While the game does not feature a menacing and snide AI antagonist, or exploitable memes, you should give it a go if you enjoy light-hearted puzzle-based gameplay.
8951	1	a	yo dawg, we heard you wanted to hear John De Lancie tell you bad puns.
8953	1	a	Really fun puzzle type game. I need to stop trying to think with portals though...
8955	1	a	I was looking for a Portal-like puzzle fix when a friend recommended QC. Strange Facility: Yes Odd narrator/overseer: Yes (John DeLancie!) Odd 'Support' Character: Yes Puzzles: Yes and Yes Item Hunt: Yes Low Stress: Yes (time trials are an optional pain) Humorous and colorful, QC is a fun puzzle-platformer game. It is more casual in nature than Portal. Things can get quite Heavy (or Fluffy) at times. Keyboard-mouse works fine, though I did resort to a mouse side-button for really quick activation of an ability. There's also two DLC for more fun. Enjoy!   Overdue Update: DLC weren't as fun as expected. No plot or narrator, only challenging puzzles. I'll admit that I didn't get very far, but I didn't feel the same atmosphere that I enjoyed in the main game. If you're looking for challenge, the DLC might be worthwhile. Myself, I've found some Portal fan-creations for my time.
8957	1	a	A physics puzzle-platformer with ties to the Portal series both in theme and production (it was directed by Kim Swift, who worked as lead designer on Portal) and though the puzzles in QC are (subjectively) better than Portal's, it lacks any of the latter's charm or personality.  The level design is templated similarly to Portal, with the main character (here a 12-year old boy) moving from room to room in a massive mansion repurposed into a research facility (that is, a mansion repurposed to look like Aperature) with the hero's amnesiac mad scientist uncle playing the part of GLaDOS, instructing him (ie, the main character) through the facility espousing hints, quips, and barbs. Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.  And though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y. I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.  All in all, I'd give it a B  If you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.
8959	1	a	Cute gameâ€”for a first-person platformer and pre-teen audience. On par with the first Portal game.  Beware, though, there are some rage quit inducing, nearly impossible, keyboard mashing levels to get through. I only checked the walkthrough twice to get through some non-intuitive spots.  Worth a few bucks during a Steam sale and something different than shooting anything that moves.
8961	1	a	I would have to give it 2.5 stars out of 5 simply because THERE IS NO QUICKSAVE FEATURE AND IT'S SO ANNOYING D:
8963	1	a	This game is is funny and has really clever mechanics.
8965	1	a	I REALLY like this game! It's charming and witty, with a lot of nice touches along the way.   Granted, I haven't gotten to the end where some folks are saying it's annoyingly hard. But at least so far it's a great game. I wish it had seen more commercial success. It deserves more recognition.
8967	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  It's a great game and great concept, and the puzzles are well thought out. Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.   Unfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform. If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game. I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception.

This is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, 'Daddy, don't you dare!' We go ahead and do it anyway, and have a great time with it. 
8969	1	a	This is the greatest, funnest portaleque game since Portal. I had a blast, right up until the endgame levels which â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ me off A LOT by requiring 50 to 100 tries before things worked out properly. I still recommend it, just not wholeheartedly. Fourfifthsheartedly.
8971	1	a	Very much a successor to Portal. It's a puzzler based around physics, which, like portal, focuses on an idea that's simple in theory and AWESOME in practice!
8973	1	a	With puzzles and overall art direction set to amuse, it is quite the conundrum why many have yet to play it.
8975	1	a	It's pretty cool. nice mechanics, and challenging puzzels.
8977	1	a	From the original developers of Portal 1, this game is an excellent spiritual successor. It's not got quite the same character as Portal and the engine struggles a bit with some of the simplist of tasks, but the puzzles are entertaining. For those that are looking from some portal-like fun but are tired of waiting for the mythical third in the series (like all other Valve series), then I recommend playing this game (which is usually on sale in all steam sales)
8979	1	a	A great game for fans of the Portal games.
8981	1	a	Fun and puzzling game. I like first-person puzzle game, and this game delivers. Great gameplay, as you can change your environment in four different ways. Recommend!
8983	1	a	It's like Portal...but not
8985	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is an excellently made quirky puzzle game that'll have you switching between 4 different dimensions  (light, heavy, slow time and reverse gravity)  in order to complete a series of puzzles. The game introduces new dimensions and concepts at a nice pace and will take roughly 6hrs to complete. The game is very relaxed as the puzzles are not too difficult so you'll always progress at a nice pace, and the game has an excellent art style and direction. The games option menu is very good, different volume sliders, gfx options and fully rebindable keys which is excellent. It certainly feels like a very polished game. If you love games like Portal and Q.U.B.E then you're going to love this game. Thoroughly enjoyable experience and well worth the money.
8987	1	a	Now you're thinking with por-... errr, Dimensions!
8989	1	a	It has John deLancie (Q from Star Trek) doing the voices. Do I need to continue?
8991	1	a	Fun Puzzle game. Levels are fun and challenging to think through.  Although the ending was a bit underwelming.
8993	1	a	Great game, definitely worth playing! The puzzles are hard enough to ake you think a bit, but easy enough so that you still have a general idea of what you need to do to solve it. There is a lot of humor in the dialogue and surrounding environment. The animation style is cartoony, similar to Despicable Me.
8995	1	a	Fun little game that is remenicent of Portal. Challenging puzzles that make you feel good once you solve them. Story is okay but nothign special. Feels like it would be designed for kids, but may be a bit too complex for them. Might be more enjoyable with a controller, sometimes the keyboard controls are hard to use with some of the platforming elements. Overall, a good game.
8997	1	a	An amazing game with clever puzzles, a brilliant voice actor, and the worst ending to a game since Borderlands. Seriously, that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ending made me wish I had never played the game. 7/10
8999	1	a	Fun little puzzle game but to easy.
9001	1	a	Awesome logic game i really liked it.
9003	1	a	this is actually pretty cool, if a bit fiddly in parts. and it has john de lancie! whoo!
9005	1	a	What can I say? It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.  9/10 would science again.
9007	1	a	If you're after more Portal goodness, try this game. Similar style, lots of puzzles. Voiced by John DeLance (Q from Star Trek The Next Generation).  Very enjoyable game!
9009	1	a	I spent hours on end shifting colors and bathing in my uncles science juices. Like young Michael Jackson.
9011	1	a	The comparisons with Portal are perhaps too easy to point to. This too is a first-person puzzle game with a touch of humor and the use of crazy and original mechanics to move around and solve each 'room'. It too has an eloquent and at times hilarious narrator following your actions and guiding you. It too has tons of little humoristic details spread throughout the environment that you can choose to ignore or you can choose to tirelessly search for and explore. You may say that's a bad thing, for a game to piggy ride on the very effective premise that Portal pioneered. But I also think that if you're like me and after replaying Portal for the 20th time you suddenly wish that only there were more games 'like' it, then this game is definitely for you.
9013	1	a	Just got through spending a good amount of time with this game! I filmed a first impressions video and posted it on YouTube. If anyone's interested, please take a look:           YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Quantum Conundrum - Pass or Play&nbsp;
9015	1	a	John De Lancie does a fantastic job narrating this game.  Don't let the cute graphics fool you, the puzzles in this puzzle-platformer range from simple to almost fiendish, and are quite satisfying for an adult to solve.
9017	1	a	It has John deLancie (Q from Star Trek) doing the voices. Do I need to continue?
9019	1	a	A phew hours well spent.
9021	1	a	Fun Puzzle game. Levels are fun and challenging to think through.  Although the ending was a bit underwelming.
9023	1	a	Plays like a cartooney version of Portal.
9025	1	a	Great puzzle game with many layers! If you liked the style of Portal, then this game is probably a good buy for you.
9027	1	a	Pretty much got this game for TF2 items a few years back :P, but anyways it's a pretty good puzzle game.
9029	1	a	I bought this game on sale for about $4, and I would have gladly paid $15. It is a very solid puzzle platformer with a (somewhat hit or miss) sense of humor. The puzzles feel clever and require a bit of trial and error, but no puzzle really felt like a wall. The difficulty curve felt fair. Expect about 6 hours of content if you are familiar with puzzle/platformers of its ilk. This game is not overly ambitious, but it does deliver excellently on small, iterative puzzles that manage to make you feel smart for solving them. If you go in expecting that, you will be happy with your purchase. 8/10
9031	1	a	I really like this game. It's a fun puzzle/platformer with a similar feel to Portal. It's not all that difficult but it also isn't too easy. The DLC is where the real challenging levels where for me. It has great physics, which is really important, because all the puzzles are physics based. Really the only thing else I want from this game, is for someone to make a mod adding Vive support,
9033	1	a	I spent hours on end shifting colors and bathing in my uncles science juices. Like young Michael Jackson.
9035	1	a	
9037	1	a	A seemingly easy puzzle game at first, but every once in a while a tricky one comes up. Most of them can be overcome by figuring out a new concept, but a few require precise placement which can get quite frustrating at times.
9039	1	a	This game has a rather funny story and a nice environment; however, the puzzles are repetitive, the gameplay seems to be the same through the whole game, and sometimes I got frustrated with the game mechanics. I like my Genuine Quadrwangler item in Team Fortress 2 better.
9041	1	a	Excellent game, looking forward to installing it for my kids to play in a few years. Fun and challenging with good amounts of humor.
9043	1	a	Fun little game, lots of interesting puzzles to solve and I would reccomend it to anyone that enjoyed the humour and puzzle solving of portal as this is in a similar style.
9045	1	a	Its kind of like Portal but not. Anyway its good.
9047	1	a	Fun and puzzling game. I like first-person puzzle game, and this game delivers. Great gameplay, as you can change your environment in four different ways. Recommend!
9049	1	a	+ Funny puzzles + Great graphics and sounds  - Longevity (it's not so short, but it could be longer) - The finale. It seems they didn't have many ideas on how to end the story... - Ike could be used better - A bit repetitive
9051	1	a	Funny, challenging, compelling. An extremely worthy successor to Portal!
9053	1	a	If you liked portal, you'll like this game.
9055	1	a	This is a Great game, like portal but with physics
9057	1	a	p cool game upvoted
9059	1	a	Quantum Conundrum is a great puzzle game that had come out of its year. Sadly not many people have played this game during its release. However, this game is a good alternate portal game without portals but uses four different environmental effects to solve puzzles. Its not very easy and its not very difficult. Its moderate in my opinion. However, the difficulty is always different for different people. Some puzzles take time and some are smooth as butter.
9061	1	a	One of the best and most fun single player games I have played. Definitely recommend.
9063	1	a	Awesome game if you like to complete puzzles with a portal feeling to it ;)
9065	1	a	Loved the art style
9067	1	a	Better than the first one by a mile, the addition of awards made this so much better. Highly recommended to all puzzle fans.
9069	1	a	5.5/10 - More puzzles than you'd ever care to play!  The puzzles themselves are pretty middle of the road. Randomly generated; crossword, Sudoku, word find and about 15 other puzzle types. It reminds me of buying one of those cheap puzzle books in the grocery checkout line.  There are 560 puzzles plus bonus challenges on each; the total number of puzzles is said to exceed 1200! I'll never find out though; after a few hours I'm pretty bored of taxing my brain playing games I can find in the newspaper. This game is great for someone who just loves working crosswords and various puzzles though.  Worth the $5! With over 1200 puzzles you can't lose with this one.     Accidently Reviewed
9071	1	a	Sudoku, math, crosswords, art and so much more. This is a fun mix of educational activities. I believe there are 1000 activities in this game. Enough to keep you playing for many many days. At the right price, this is a worthy buy, especially for the youngens.
9073	1	a	This is more or less an reproduction of the first Puzzler World, but with a better mechanism for hint tokens, a nicer in-game trophy system and some slightly better execution of puzzles. I would recommend getting this over the first one, and as before it's geared towards a younger audience but still enjoyable for older players as well.  Only con I can see is that the developers didn't link their in-game trophies to Steam achievements, so it only has the same simple set as the first game, which are fairly straightforward to play through for those of you looking for simple puzzle games or just a few more achievements to rack up.
9075	1	a	Puzzler World 2 is, unsurprisingly, a framework for several different types of puzzles.  The Sudoku works, and lets you take basic notes, but it's not the best Sudoku game out there. The Crosswords are very difficult, because this is very obviously a UK-made game, and you would need a lot of UK-specific knowledge to solve them. Link-A-Pix puzzles are pretty neat, and the big ones get very challenging. The rest are too simple for an experienced puzzle solver, even at their hardest.  The interface isn't very good, but it works well enough. The puzzle instructions are insufficient, but most puzzles aren't that hard. The bonus puzzle/hint system is enjoyable, and necessary if you're not an expert at UK crosswords. Master Mode lets you cut right to the toughest challenges. There are definitely enough puzzles to keep you busy for a while.  This is definitely for puzzle fans only, but caters to beginners, casuals, and experts.
9077	1	a	A very good game for children in development, with a lot of different puzzles, it surely is the best puzzle game i ever saw, but the let down is the resolution, and the fact that it opens in windowed mode all the time.
1564	0	a	Not nearly as fun and Puzzler World 1.  1. There is no fullscreen for higher resolutions/screens - only windowed. 2. Somehow the whole engine is sticker/slower - the engine just doesn't seem to work as well. 3. Puzzles seem simpler somehow. For instance the Word Search doesn't have as many words to find.   Sad, really. Seems they just don't care enough. Puzzler Word 1 is great. Simple but really good fun.
9079	1	a	The Sequel to Puzzler World is just a little expanded version. Some new gamemodes are added like Fit Word which is a drag and drop Crosswords , or one like a Crosswords reverse. There are also little graphical changes. Now you earn your hintpoints after a solved puzzle on a wheel of fortune. The biggest lack of this game is that it is only in english. Very hard for people outside the UK to solve some crosswords for example. Thats the reason I must invest lots of hint points into unknown expressions. But some of the old game modes and the mathematics riddles are still fun.
9081	1	a	Plenty of puzzles to keep you going for hours. Some of the interface could do with improvements, but overall great value for money. There are also in game trophies to collect once you've got all the acheivements, if that appeals to the completionist in you.
9083	1	a	I'm too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for this game   10/10
9085	1	a	I never played the first installment, but I enjoy this one. The puzzles themselves are of middling difficulty (which I suppose means the game isn't for you, if you're looking for a challenge). If you, like me, aren't very good at sudoku or crosswords (or any of the other types of puzzles offered), it's possible to end up frustrated. The Link-a-pix needs a scroll feature, but that aside, I find the games soothing, and play this when I need to unwind.
1567	0	a	I got the game for 9 cents, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, but the puzzles never even get to the difficulty level you get in a Games Magazine or a Dell Logic Problem book, and yet are the same sort. Adding to this problem is the inexpert port from what what was clearly an iphone game, the viewing window is far to small, especially for Link-a-Pix, and it's annoying to have to point and drag, rather than more normal methods of, say, scrolling through a list, which is because it intends you to swipe.

9087	1	a	Just like the first Puzzler World but with some different added puzzles. Fun to play every once in awhile when your fancy a puzzle or two. :)
1569	0	a	The first Puzzler World was mildly fun. This one is incredibly boring and feels like a chore every second you keep playing it.
9089	1	a	Just like puzzler world one, this game has an extremely large amount of puzzles to do. However, most all of the puzzles are pretty easy and none of them will really stump you. I'd recommend this game to just tease your brain a little and help you kill some time, or if you really like puzzles like I do. I could also see this as great for some younger kids or to entertain some nephews/neices or someone young.  puzzles: 6/10 (at it's hardest)  game: 9/10
9091	1	a	Decent time killer. Get it for cheap (&lt;50% off) and its worth the money.  Don't expect anything more than what is in Puzzler World 1 or the Phone App equivalents. Its the same stuff.  5/10
1570	0	a	What should be a good game is sadly let down by some really basic bugs, not least one broken achievement, all of which have been around since the game was released. This game isn't supported so they won't be fixed. There are still plenty of puzzles to play though, although it runs at a ridiculously low res so you don't get puzzles that are too complicated (they simply won't fit....). Not sure if there are localised versions, but it is nice not to have to try to think like an american when I'm answering crossword clues.
9093	1	a	Easy game to start. Easy way to get a perfect game under your belt. Achievements are great considering you only have to do 10 of each.
9095	1	a	If you played and enjoyed the first instalment, I'm sure you will like this one even more. While it is still very basic looking, this version is much more polished. Better transition, control and variety make this easier on the eye and mouse. Scrolling is replaced with click and drag, more like tablet touch controls.  New puzzles styles, better depth in the difficulty, in game and Steam achievements kept my interest for longer. Though I have 100% in Steam achievements and will put it to the side for now (while I tackle my backlog of shame), I can see myself coming back to finish the rest.
9097	1	a	Slicker than Puzzler World 1, but can lead to frustration using the mouse for things the keyboard previously did (for me at least). New puzzle types, but essentially the same game, volume 2. Did not offer the option of 'American' English vs 'British' English, which has led to a few small instances of confusion.
1573	0	a	-
9099	1	a	A nice Puzzle game, it's ok for kids, and who wants to take a challenge, it's a little hard, but it's ok!
9101	1	a	Does what it says on the tin.
9103	1	a	Great mom-casual collection of puzzle games, some interesting and cool, and some laughably stupid and mindless, like word searches. Prequel is more of the same. Pick them up alongside Everyday Genius: Square Logic for something to keep your parents busy for hours during Thanksgiving so you don't have to talk to them.
9105	1	a	A nice relaxing puzzle game. Not for kids. 2
1577	0	a	I had issues with the first game, enough to put it into the 'not recommended' category, but was still able to put up with it enough to play the puzzles. The same cannot be said of the second game, which is readily apparent as being far inferior in quality. If a good game were equivalent to Ghostbusters, the first game was Batman Forever -- not good, but with enough redeeming values to be enjoyed. Puzzler World 2, however, is more on the level of Manos: The Hands of Fate; on several levels it doesn't just fall short of its goals, it fails to even be recognizable as making a worthwhile attempt.  The issues of the first game not only remain, they are exacerbated. The 'picture quiz' game, which has absolutely no business being in a puzzle publication on account of not being a puzzle (memorizing isn't problem solving), remains, as does the kindergarten-level Silhouette. Codeword, one of the more creative and intelligent games of the original, is removed. Hangman is still set at a level that is too easy for anybody who can read at a first grade level. The maximum number of wrong guesses one should be able to get in Hangman is 6, a quarter of the alphabet. PW2 allows eleven wrong guesses. Another irritation from the first game, that being crossword answers that have multiple viable spellings not being accepted (and not being blocked because it doesn't completely interlink the way a proper crossword should) also continues here... along with some clues just being wrong, at least by American definitions. ('Mooch' does not mean 'skulk'; it means 'freeload'.)  Still, issues of the puzzles' difficulty levels would be minor complaints on their own. What sinks this from a C average all the way to an uncontested F is the interface. There are numerous design changes in this version that are just baffling. The 'hint token' prize boxes of the first game -- mildly annoying on their own -- are replaced by a 'Wheel of Fortune' spinner, complete with requirement that you spin it with sufficient speed (remember, this is a puzzle game, not a skill game). The Fitword puzzle now requires that the words be manually dragged into their places rather than typed. The 'Sum Up' puzzle has the answers floating around aimlessly for no reason other than to make it harder to see what you're trying to click on; the actual problem solving isn't made any more difficult, it's just the physical aspect that's made irritating. The crossword puzzles skip over filled in letters while you're typing -- so for example, if you already have the 'N' in from another word, you can't type 'ORANGE', you have to type 'ORAGE'. Worst of all, the Link-A-Pix puzzles, the most fun game from the original, are rendered completely unplayable by a decision to require the user to scroll around the screen instead of showing the full puzzle.  As if these bad design decisions weren't enough, the game is also severely buggy. There's visible lag in response times, items don't always line up the way they should (the word search lines are often off-center), and worst of all, a lot of it just doesn't work. Scrolling in Challenge Mode can't be done with the mouse, but only with the keyboard. The scrolling in Master Mode and the Trophy Room don't even work with that. There are arrows there, but you can't click on them, you can't spin the mouse wheel, and you can't use the arrow keys. You're told there's stuff to scroll to, but you can't scroll to it. And to top it all off, there doesn't appear to be a 'QUIT' button for the program. I had to use Task Manager to shut this piece of crap down. I won't be starting it up again.
1578	0	a	I dont like this game, It's build for a kid!
1579	0	a	It's terrible
9107	1	a	If you love puzzle games, this one is most likely for you!!!!
9109	1	a	I like previous Puzzler World more than this one. Game interface feels like it's lazy port from tablet version. But Colour-in game is nice and I got the game for cheap so I don't complain much. It is on sale very often too.   For Achievement hunter:  100% - You play each type of puzzle 10 times. Getting All Achievement from Bonus Puzzle games can be a bit annoying because one main puzzle will lead to one of the two bonus puzzles. For example, after you finished Sudoku puzzle, it's bonus game will be either Sum-up or Add-up bonus game. You can check the guide so you won't waste too much time completing main puzzle. 
9111	1	a	Whenever I'm bored I just play a few mini-games from Puzzler World 2, and then I'm surprised at how much fun I'm getting from such a cheap game. It's really good, and quite addictive. There are easily hundreds of hours of content ahead of you, don't hesitate to get this game! :)
9113	1	a	Hardcore Puzzle   Destroy The Brain  10/10
9115	1	a	Word puzzles, number puzzles, find-a-word ... it's good fun when you only have a few minutes to waste.
9117	1	a	Puzzler World 2 is yet another collection of random puzzles, similiar to Puzzler World. Just with more of same, but more variety too.  And well, it's still a good collection of way more types of puzzle than one person would like. The interface feels a bit more of smartphone-designed, just a very slightly more, and it's still not intuitive for PC game, giving you just many pages of randomly spread out puzzle selection.  On new offer is a change of reward system. Now it's not completely random and requires a bit more of errrrr skill. You have a roulette that you can roll with a given power. Trick here is to give it less than 100% of force.  It also added Master mode, a smaller selection of much harder variants for each puzzle types. Fun.  And yes, variety got improved. It can have more of puzzles you like. And more of puzzle types that don't fit for you. Too many more crossword-type puzzles for myself.  So yes. Good game if you just want a big collection of puzzles.  While I am still using it for only Link-A-Pix puzzles.
9119	1	a	If you are looking for a traditional puzzle game for your PC, this is the sequel to Puzzler World 2. Don't expect any fancy graphics, 3D or soundtrack. This time there's 9 different puzzle types and over 1200 puzzles. Plenty of achievements to work towards to - one seems to be broken however. This will provide hours of fun for the casual puzzler.
9121	1	a	works on windows 8.1, simple to learn the rules, fun!
9123	1	a	This game is not the hardest or the best game in the world, but it is a solid time waster. If you're looking for something to kill time with that will go a ways towards numing your brain, this will do the trick.
9125	1	a	Great game :-)
9127	1	a	Hardcore Puzzle   Destroy The Brain  10/10
9129	1	a	MOAR PUZZLES. MOAR FUN. YEEEEEEAH. But really if you liked the first one, this had more of that plus some new puzzles. If you ever just want to take it easy and challenge your mind a bit, this is a nice game.
9131	1	a	A game full of variety puzzles. Of course they just repeat themselves with varying difficulty but it is a great collection of games, nevertheless. If you love puzzles, this is a no-brainer, pick this game up!
9133	1	a	Amazingly awful interface, inside the games and not. What other game assigns volume settings on a user-by-user basis? Some of the puzzles are fairly good, others are inscrutable unless you've found your way to the instructions. It's basically one of those thick volumes of assorted sudoku, crosswords, word searches and such made digital and fluorescent. Not bad if that's what you're looking for, and can get past the warts.
9135	1	a	The puzzles are good, but tech support is nonexistent and there are a couple of areas right at the end of the game that are broken. If you're OK with a nearly-completed game, then this will occupy your mind well for a while...
9137	1	a	I find this game is better than the previous one; it plays much more smoothly, there are so many more hint coin things, I can click-and-drag the words in fitword, there are ingame achievements (not just steam's ones), there's a further set of more difficult puzzles and there are extra puzzle types. The downsides are that the PUZZLER bonus isn't worth getting until after the fifth time, I miss codebreak and the wheel-of-fortune thing takes too much time. Basically, don't get this if you want to play codebreak.
9139	1	a	Eh it's an alright game, pretty simple to get the hang of. There are some cool puzzles I've never seen before, but I wouldn't pass it off as a kids game right away, regardless of all of the bright colouring and blantant simplicity to some puzzles. Drives me crazy because I'm a completionist, but its got some easy achievements.
9141	1	a	Good 'casual' gaming. Just don't expect much depth.  You might not want to play this in one go or play it all the time.  Instead you fire it up when you're bored and don't wanna play something heavy with plotlines and quests and lore. (imagine you worked overtime, the clients were terrible, you finally get home, take a beer from the fridge) You want some puzzle and it delivers and a ton of content too. Also more puzzles and variation compared to PW1.  The game is designed completely basic and was probably a mobile app. 
9143	1	a	I love this game. It really makes you use your brain :)
9145	1	a	works on windows 8.1, simple to learn the rules, fun!
9147	1	a	A fun mix of puzzles and games! Plus, since it is British, you'll learn new words and get rather confused over some answers; but that's what the hint tokens are for!
9149	1	a	Coming up to 40 hours and just completed half the puzzles. A great little casual game to play when you want something a little less zombiekilly and peoplestabby. Turn off the in-game music and put some relaxing yiruma on (or some cannibal corpse, whatever floats you metaphorical music boat).   As a sequel to the first puzzler world (hence the 2 at the end), I think it adds to the original premise of 'a ship load of puzzles' and expands on it adding new games and tweaking existing ones. Whilst some of the games have been tweaked to be 'easier' to play, personally some of them were a little annoying, such as having to drag around link-a-pix as it zooms in really close. Would really appreciate it if they had a zoom function on it to put it to how it was in the first puzzler world. Of course this allows for bigger puzzles (such as the ones featured in the master mode.  Also implemented is the tokenator, or the spinnywheeltokengame which whilst it appealed to the 'ooh spinny thing' side of me, the token animations take about twice as long as the original puzzler world, which were just a little too long for my liking in the first one. No skipping this either so, everytime you beat a puzzle, you have to spin the wheel, wait for it to stop, watch the token bounce around for a bit and then redeem and then see all the tokens pour out like a game of coin solitaire. Whilst this is flashy, and probably what most of there budget went onto, slows everything down especially if you're going through puzzles fairly fast (some of them can be done in 10-15 seconds, such as the silhouette (I don't quite understand that game either?)). One thing that is amazing and probably makes this all okay is that you can spin the wheel backwards! Yes people, backwards compatibility! (Insert new-gen console jokes here).  Some features they haven't included though such as screen resolution, it looks terrible even on my 1080p screen so windowed is the only way to go if you are a low-resophobe. I have puzzled on it full screen and it's not too distracting but it looks much nicer windowed. Also, whilst the in-game trophy system are a great incentive to actually clear all the puzzles, something the first one lacked as I stopped playing after about 200 (will return when I beat this though... probably), I feel a little let down with the steam achievements. Exactly the same as the first in requirement, I don't see why they couldn't have just linked the trophies with the steam achievements... This would've also removed the fact that there's no point in beating more then 10 of each puzzle in the original.  I got this in a bundle (with the original) and probably paid about 20p for it. For 40 hours and only halfway complete (my GCSE maths tell me that it would therefore take about 80 hours, without taking the exponetionally rising difficulty of levels in further stages and brie, tea and wee breaks (I'm so british). Adding all that in could be around 100 hours). 20p has never seen so much mileage. Even at a fiver, you'll be stuck to find a game that will last you a good 80 hours! Despite some flaws, this simple game gives you a lot for a little, you'd be mildly braindead to not see the value in that!
1581	0	a	The first game, Puzzler World, was excellent, though too easy. PW2 is just a reskin, with added annoyances, for instance making selectables floating around instead of standing still, etc. And some differences in some games doesn't make sense and isn't covered in the instructions, so you have to either experiment to make out the rules, or just blindly guess.  Other annoyances really confused me a bit, until I figured out what the heck was going on, mainly link-a-pix: it may appear to not having all the pairs - this is because it doesn't show the whole playfield, it's zoomed in on just a part of it.  They tried to make it different, but took away the fun in the process. I have rarely been so disappointed with any game before.  Avoid PW2 like the plague, go play the first game instead.
9151	1	a	Love it. Lots of fun puzzles to do.
9153	1	a	I like the word search. There are a lot.
1582	0	a	It's like they took everything about the first game and went, how can we make this less user friendly. Typing options for fit-words removed, replaced by the extremely laggy and hard to use drag interface, spot the differences removed in favor of the much more annoying and badly designed find small shapes in large squares, link-a-pix ultra zoomed in (presumably for the master puzzles) but no options to zoom out, and god forbid the arrow keys dont bug out and freeze in the middle forcing you to drag across, which just reacts badly with your already filled in squares. Illogically phrased crossword questions forcing a dragged out internet search which often doesn't help (this was in the first one also but was mildly annoying at best, and just adds to annoyance now), any typing puzzles now skip letters filled in instead of you typing out the whole word (especially annoying if you have a word wrong). Puzzles are actually quite good if you disregard above issues, with a nice gradual difficulty increase as you go, or the master puzzles are a good option for a challenge. Buy it on a good deal, I got it for 85% off which is an ok deal, 90-95% would be the best to aim for though.
9155	1	a	It's clearly designed for a tablet, so the controls could be a little more PC friendly, and it would be nice if it had an American English mode, but it's got a lot of puzzles, and I've had fun playing it, and it's cheap, so I recommend it.
9157	1	a	(05/10) - At Least Playable  Well, what should i say about this? If you like crossword-puzzles, hang man and co. there is very much to find in here. My absolute favourite was something i didnÂ´t even know before, and the 'find the error' and sudoku puzzles are fun as well. You get a ton of content, and with the master puzzles you can easily rap your head around one puzzle for hours.  A slight warning tho, puzzles where you have to find or insert words (just like crosswords for example) are rather impossible without a native tongue in english. IÂ´d say that i speak it quite well and i didnÂ´t finish any of those puzzles, as the necessary words are just unknown without a perfect knowlage of the english language...
9159	1	a	Ehhh. Some puzzles are fun. Some are terrible. Worth it if you like puzzle games and it is on sale for a buck or two, otherwise find some free apps somewhere else.
9161	1	a	This is a great little game. I bought it quite by accident and found it irresistable. Once I completed 100% of the game I died a little inside.  So many unique, but challenging puzzles, everything from Hangman to colouring in puzzles, you will find something to entertain you.
1583	0	a	Buggy and unfinished.  Good art style, but feels low quality and rushed.  DLC available for a game that should be an alpha: It has clearly been designed as cash crop from day one.  Developers/Publishers simply slapped on a 1.0 sticker and moved onto other projects.  Bugs consisted of terrible pathfinding, graphical issues and many other issues. Clunky.  Not really anything to do after an hour of two of gameplay: Literally no reason to play on.  Dug into dungeon of mobs and got absolutely massacred, had a few warriors as well.  This is not anywhere near a Dwarf Fortress 3D successor like I had hoped, nor will it clearly ever be, which is a shame as it had potential.
1584	0	a	This game tries to scratch the itch dungeon keeper and dwarf fortress have long since stopped scratching for me. (hundreds of game hours can only do so much.)  Unfortunately, where those other games are like a Velcro nose scratcher inside a spaceman's helmet, this is more of a damp sponge. You can try as hard as you want, it won't scratch.  I only managed to stick with this game due to the mild amusement of designing a very simple dwarf base, but that gets old FAST; it was pure stubbornness after the first 3 levels. You don't have the challenge and satisfaction of making something like in dungeon keeper or dwarf fortress, and it's not much fun aesthetically because the near non-existent challenge the game does provide wrecks your design.  The major problem with the game is how unfinished the final product is. The potential is definitely there, but it was rushed into final product for obvious financial reasons. Hence the cash grab DLC rushed quickly out.  The biggest clue to this being an unfinished mess is the falling animation. When your dwarves tunnel into a large cavern, or are falling for some reason, they panic, fall one Z level, stop in mid air, Panic again, Fall another Z level; rinse, repeat till the bottom. Come on guys, didn't have time to fully program that one?  The second clue is the half-hearted attempt at making your dwarves happy. You can decorate your entire dungeon with minerals you find, but this is purely aesthetic. Rough wooden walls and floors do the job just as well as Dragonite ore, the rarest mineral in the game. Come on devs, was the balancing too hard? Dwarf fortress had that coded!  If we are talking balancing, the teleporting mechanic breaks the game so hard it physically hurt me sometimes with boredom. You can teleport your dwarves anywhere on the map you have visited, as many times as you'd like, and as fast as you'd like. Sure they TRIED to nerf it by only letting you do one dwarf at a time, and by having special fields you need to send your dwarves to destroy, but you can work around them easily, usually by tricking the stupid AI.  If I send a dwarf tunneling into a unknown cavern, I should fear for his safety, or for the safety of my base, not watch bored with my hand on the teleport button to whisk him away from the slow moving enemies. (The combat AI is so bad they even take a second to spin and position in a North-south or West-East pattern before hitting each other.) I never had any fear for my main base while playing the game. You can stop intrusion by deleting a ladder. Enemies try to circumvent this by randomly teleporting around, but half the time they stood there stupidly. Depressingly, I never had the chance to use all the nifty traps they game had available for me. By the time you can afford the traps you already have the appropriately levels fighters, making them useless.  I was REALLY angry at the half-coded ending to the game. Anti-climatic, with rushed animations; even the writing was half-hearted. Did they even expect anyone to get through the entire game?  There are more problems, Terrible AI, bad animations, ETC; but this game has taken enough of my time already.  I know some of you out there are desperate for easy to play games that scratch that itch I mentioned above, but don't come here. You will leave wanting, and with less money in your wallet.
9163	1	a	Best viewed as a sim dungeon, dwarven style. There's a campaign mode where dwarves seek to reclaim their land from evil magi, but it's pretty rudimentary (I like the Dwarves-Elves angle in the story though!). It does structure gameplay a bit on each level with preset elements and gives some bonus incentive to continue playing, however it's still rather sandboxy experience, in the end not differing all that much from actual 'custom mode', which is pure sandbox without the preset storyline elements.  Otherwise, if you want to treat it as a strategy game (real time with pause), you're going to be dissapointed. It's as if creators were aiming to make something like Dungeon Keeper but in full 3D (multiple levels of dungeon not just one), changing the tone from dark lord to sort of supposedly benevolent dwarves, perhaps being inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but in the end they realized they won't make it and dialed down difficulty a lot. It's very basic, no AI to speak of, no challenge, you can do everything at your own pace without being forced to discover (always marked) rooms with enemies until you feel ready. No enemies respawn or surprise you unless you dig your own grave unprepared. Many things feel unbalanced and purely aesthetic in nature (although aesthetics do have gameplay implications of keeping dwarves happy - the more you dig, the more decorative stuff you need for dwarves to feel at home). Early game on a new level is rather slow in terms of trying to push story forward/discover random enemy rooms, because you are too weak. And then, after a bit of building up, you're totally overpowered. Especially once you realize your ability to move stuff anywhere you want by your godly player powers is overpowered on its own.  So yeah, as a sort of sandboxy doll house, err- dwarven dungeon, it can work pretty well. You dig around, gather resources, set up farm for food and wood (ultimate renewable resource that buys you everything), and possibly some shrooms for happiness (yeah.. but I usually just stick to wood for cash and get happiness otherwise :P), build some cozy place for your guys to live, occasionally fight baddies who won't be a problem at all after a bit of building up, push story forward. Can be somewhat slow, and there surely are better sim games, but the overall tone and setting here is pretty unique for such genre I think.  Doesn't work at all as a strategy game, though. And if you want to be picky, animations are bit off, but otherwise looks are sort of cute.  Bonus points for spelling 'dwarves' properly (not 'dwarfs'). Malus points for broken achievements (one mission is broken and doesn't give you full influence, required for cheevos).  Also take note there are silly in-game cosmetic microtransactions, but many are free and you can easily ignore the rest (of which only Ales DLC is separate on Steam and only gives you ale tree and kegs to increase dwarven happiness). Bigger DLC is Space Dwarves, which changes medieval tone to futuristic, but it only works in pure sandbox (aka custom) mode, not in the campaign mode. No idea about the Pets DLC.  In the end, this title isn't very strong overall, but I still recommend it for its setting, however only to people who like to mess around sandbox/dollhouse style and maybe have some TV series to watch at the same time for slower moments or something xD
1585	0	a	Basically an abandoned early-access game, A Game of Dwarves had a lot of potential, but is left poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. Seemingly inspired by the much better 'Dwarf Fortress', A Game of Dwarves sought to improve upon it with better graphics, only to fall short in every other area. It can be fun to build in, or stripmine, as suits your moods, but there's no strategic depth and any of the levels can be beaten almost blindfolded (which is how your dwarves behave half the time). Overall, it can be fun to waste some time in, but I can't recommend you purchase it.
1586	0	a	My first impression of this game was very optimistic; its gameplay was somewhat different from most games, and the games that this one is likened to are only in 2D, making this very promising.  However, after the first hour it became very apparent that this game was designed to be casual- no real resource management or needs/logistics to cover even the most sprawling of dwarven strongholds. Granted, the game IS in the casual genre, but a game like this has so much potential that it comes off as more of a half-baked idea than intentionally casual. This is evident in the lack of true challenges and very repetitive gameplay.   So, avoiding the strategy genre because there is nothing challenging, I wouldnt count it as a building game either. The number of items available arent very many for a builders' game, and what's available is most likely useless decoration, which would have been fine if the game had direction, but because of the immense amount of time it takes to make one or two decorations, playing this just doesnt seem worth the effort.   I was looking forward to this as an alternative to Towns, but I am disappointed to say that Towns is far more engaging and rewarding.
9165	1	a	I bought that game with no expectations at all. And that's probably what helped me enjoying it. In the end, I did enjoy it. I even went up to the end, which kind of took me some time. Of course, it is full of downs/cons, like, it's a casual game, it's quite bugged, it has huge slow downs when the map becomes huge and full of your constructions, it is not very deeply thought and programmed, the scenario is poor, the dialogues useless, blablabla, you could make a huge list of the bad stuff, as there are probably more of these than the good ones. HOWEVER. However. All in all, there is one huge aspect of that game that is so nice that in the end it becomes heavier or at least as heavy as the bad stuff in the balance used to rank this game: the exploration feeling and the construction features. And you know what? These two simple facts, no matter how bad all the other things are, made me feel closer than ever to the golden past of games like Dungeon Keeper, more than any other game did these past 20 years. So, if you understood the whole situation here, yes: I DO recommend this game.
1590	0	a	As much potential as this game had, it's sad to see it never actually befoming a fun game. The digging is fun, and there's good bits of crafting and decorating and other things that are fun.  But the engine the devs used, killed any modding community or content sharing.   That and the tedium of the 'story' missions ie 'where can i dig to get to the sparkly square and tell my warriors to go' sadly remove all the acutal management and tactical parts of the game.   I wish this had gotten a sequel made in a more flexible engine that allowed for actual AI.   Skip it.
9167	1	a	This is an absolutely fantastic little game. You're a Dwarf Prince, who is given control of a group of dwarves, and you build fortresses and caves underground and fight bad things who want to kill you. You go searching for materials to build furniture and decorations, and to advance your dwarven army. Once you kill the bad things, you can steal their beds and bunny rabbits and stuff to put in your fortress.  There is a campaign mode with quests which I think is really well done, and great to play. There's also a sandbox 'free' mode so you can build your ultimate fortress without any distractions. In both sandbox and campaign, I love being able to decorate my little dwarven fortress.. thing. There's a whole range of decorations and things to do, and discover.   Killing stuff and making a badass army isn't bad either, theres a fair few enemies and bosses to defeat with your military dwarves.  Theres a skill tree type doohickey that will allow you to give your group of dwarves more powers and items as the game goes on.  It's a great game to play casually and relax with (if you learn not to try and rush through, which made lead to stress and death unless you're quite focused!).   Sometimes your dwarves don't do quite what they're told, plus they're fat so they get stuck behind furniture a lot and then panic and die of starvation.. but it's okay, you can just spawn another one.   I definitely recommend it. It might take a tiny while to get used to (at least, it did me) but once you're there, it's quite addictive. One thing though - Apart from the DLC, there is an in game 'shop' to use your steam wallet to buy yet more decorations. The packs in there arnt expensive, and I think anyone who enjoys building/decorating/creating things like I do will be happy to pick them up for the price they are.. but if that sort of thing annoys you, well.. it's here.
1595	0	a	I bought this game on offer, thinking I was getting a good deal, but the save system is broken so I can't even continue with the campaign after I save and exit.  I didn't pay much, but I've still requested a refund, as it's the principle of the thing.  My advice is don't bother with this game. Even if it's in a sale, you'll still be buying a broken product.
9169	1	a	not a bad game great for those who love mining. be forwarned that the game tends to get a bit glitchy when you OCD mine
1597	0	a	I somewhat enjoyed this game but, to be entirely honest, for somebody who does not love designing their own underground fortresses A Game of Dwarves is simply a game that is sorely lacking in any form of real challenge. To add to that, even if you do enjoy designing said fortresses you are probably better off buying a game that actually has building and managing a community as its main focus. This combination only leaves a very specific group of those people who want to build a decent looking underground dwarven home without anything else going on as people whom I think should buy it.
1598	0	a	FRUSTRATED.  This game looks interesting, but have just spent 2 hours trying to:  a) understand the clunky controls b) make sense of the 'levels' its too easy to get 'lost' between levels - therefore you spend more time clicking buttons and getting annoyed than playing c) get the dwarves to follow commands! the dwarves to seem to follow commands all that well, it is intermittent.  I can't actually say I 'played' the game.  I dont recommend the game unless you like clunky management and functions..  2/10  AVOID
9171	1	a	Fun game to play. I wish there was a little bit more to do in the game. Some random events or special units or items might give it a stronger appeal to more people. All in all its worth $10.00 for a few days of good game play.
1600	0	a	It can kill some time but there's little replay value. If there was just a little more action or random events, or something to do besides diggy diggy hole.
1601	0	a	GAME OF DWARVES is just like Dungeon Keeper 2, but without voice acting, charm, fun or anything of interest really. The game is less pick up and play than Dungeon Keeper 2, because there is a lot of text that needs to be read and well supplies that you buy with gold. Supplies like wood to build stuff... you buy it, you don't chop it down. No this game is completely under ground like Dungeon keeper 2. And you play as Dwarves on a grid. Your dwarves dig out walls along this grid, but unlike Dungeon Keeper 2, you can dig up and down instead of just north, south, east and west. You hire new dwarves and assign them roles or jobs. Its just so much like Dungeon Keeper 2, but less faceted and a lot more boring. Not to say that every FPS is like Doom, with a new coat of paint, but imagine if a game released 10 years after Doom, used a modified Doom engine, yet had less interesting things than Doom. This game just feels so dull, incomplete and uninspiring. The only plus is that playing custom games will generate a random underground world for you to explore.
1602	0	a	It needed a bit more work. The game is essentially fine but it could have used an update or two with some important features; like being able to create farmable soil so you don't have plants randomly all over your build. Buy it at $5 or less.
9173	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is an attempt to make a 3D Dwarf Fortress. It is much less complex, of course. This is both good and bad. It is less complicated to play, but it has very few options compared to Dwarf Fortress. Also, I found the game to be unbalanced. Some things are completely useless, like chairs and long distance military units. The AI needs improvement too. But it is fun to play, especially if you use traps.
9175	1	a	Fantastic game that you can spend hours messing around in. Reminds me a lot of the old dungeon keeper 2 game with a good amount of humour to it. Keep an eye on the animations!
9177	1	a	'A Game of Dwarves' is a little gem, if you want to have a relaxed and jolly gamesession.   In this micro-management game, you take control of a group of dwarves, let them dig depper into the dungeons, find more resources and the most important: ensure that they do well.  That game might be not something special for everyone, but I had a great time with it!
9179	1	a	It's a good game, but not a perfect one. Gameplay is fun and flexible but a bit slow. The microtransactin store is a joke but it's easy to ignore. Overall, a lot of fun to be had if this is your type of game.
9181	1	a	Its a great game, although its farely repetitive, its still very good, but it lacks multiplayer so if you play the campaign for to long it might get boring, i would just wish there was versus or some kind of co-op campaign, i really think it would make the game more fun, and less the same, as you would have company, overall though, it only needs multiplayer then it would be perfect, except for all the micro transactions, they tend to be a litte to powerfull.
1604	0	a	Basically the young cousin of both Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.  It was fun for a few hours, that's the best I can say for it. I much prefer the similar game 'Dwarfs?!', which has worse graphics but crisper, balanced play.  You might enjoy this game if you just want to build something cute.
9183	1	a	I never did quite get in to this game. Every time I tried maintaining a colony of dwarves, they would either become depressed, or as soon as I went to explore a dungeon, the enemies would teleport themselves past my defenses, slay my level 10 soldier dwarves with ease, and be free to kill the rest of my passive dwarves. The game is a lot of fun to play, but it seems to be one of those games you are supposed to devote a lot of time to, and not rush things. Being a hasty person myself, and wanting to get right into the thick of things, I fail to succeed at this game. You, however may be a different story. I recommend you grab this game and give it a go.
1606	0	a	I reallly wanted to like this game, but its just not that good.  The Digging is fun for all 5 seconds but then becomes tedious, The Levels take hours, im not kidding it took me 4 hours to do the first mission, Its VERRYYY slow paced to the point of me afk'ing whilst they digged, theres a Skirmish type game mode, but that's more a bug fest than anything.   I got this for Â£2 so i wont complain any more but i even felt that was steep.
9185	1	a	I love this game, the thrill of watching my dwarves hustle and bustle about as they tend plants, dig holes, and kill goblins is  exciting to me! it's fun because it's simple and easy. In custom game I always pimp out my stronghold to max pimp. This game is fun if you find watching your little minions doing stuff on there own and designing awesome fortresses to your hearts desire! If you're a call of duty fanboy who thinks everything needs to be fast paced this isn't the game for you. I personally enjoy this game for its slower pace and watching the hustle and bustle of my fortress as I pimp it to my hearts desire. If you're like me, I recommend it!
9187	1	a	This is really fun. However sometimes connection to shop failed.
9189	1	a	good game but not as good as dungeon keeper 1-2
9191	1	a	This game will eat large chubnks of your life before you realise it but I found it to be creatively rerwarding. It's a bit like a very simplified Sims with Dwarves in a Minecraft world. Also there's a tech tree inside each level and one outside. The one outside does really help determine your playstyle but the one inside the level will be completely filled out about halfway through any given level. It's a good game for building floating, 3D gardens and learning how to conduct strategic tunnel sieges. But the traps are rather useless and hard to implement. Easier just to block things off. See what I did there. Play the game and you'll get pun. That's all I can promise.
9193	1	a	I loved this game, it reminded me a little of dungeon keeper and warhammer.  My campaign gliched and made me a replay a few missions and was quite short but i still enjoyed it.  I dont like the paid extras... i bought the game, i dont want to buy extra textures and items. 
9195	1	a	This game is a bit like Dungeon Keeper and a bit like Lego Rock Raiders if you can remember that gem. In the campaign you play a Prince that leads his clan to re-take lands lost to mages years ago. Each area consists of a randomly generated grid with multiple levels so the resources and non-quest specific rooms will move around if you restart. The focus is on furniture rather than specific rooms, but this allows for a player to designate their own shape and size for a 'room'. There are about 14 different resources of increasing rarity that will make better furniture to keep dwarves happy or upgrade your army. Game isn't too difficult but much of the time you spend will be mining the resources you need.
1649	0	a	If you want a good game that is what this game was supposedly trying to live up to by going off its structure:  Dwarf Fortress.  The game uses ASCII graphics, so basically its computer symbols colored to represent items.  If you have problems with the simple graphics of DF, go get a tileset. There isn't DLC as the entire game is free. Free to Download, Free to Play, Free to Rage at your noobiness. Now the game of Dwarf Fortress has the steep learning curve that makes you adapt a play style to meet survival and entertainment needs.  This game does NOT live up to it in the slightest. First up; You start with the basics of Dungeon Keeper and it kind of plays like a version of it. Now that means there is a cap for population; making you level up your dwarves you have to make them work in your favor. Now while Dwarf Fortress offers skills; DF allows you to have up to 200 drunken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s to throw a tantrum spiral over being pushed in a hallway. Also they just move in. You abandon one of your old forts to the flooded underground city it is, you can see any surviving dwarves possibly move to the new city. Second; !FUN! does not exist in this game. You get, again like Dungeon Keeper, random 'caves' that have enemies and objects in them. In Dwarf Fortress, you get caverns. These caverns contain your worst nightmares and then will bend you over and shove a broom up your â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you fail to meet the standards of defenses by that point. Not even to mention the Circus. Third; THIS GAME JUST GETS EXTREMELY BORING.  YOU KNOW DWARF FORTRESS DOES? YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE, THEN THE CARP EATS YOU. YOU SETTLE IN THE HAUNTED WOODS AND GET DEVOURED BY A HEAD OF A ZOMBIE WHILE YOUR CIVILIANS JOIN THEIR RANKS.  YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE FROM STARVING; THEN YOU REALIZE YOU FORGOT ABOUT DRINKS AND WINTER IS COMING. AND ALL OF YOUR DWARVES ARE PARTYING, THE POOR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S. THEY WILL NEVER SEE THE HILL TITAN COMING TO CLEANSE THEM IN FIRE. Oh and you ran out of food because you decided to build a storage unit above ground and you forgot about roofs and all the birds and monkeys came in and stole your pickaxes and... everything.
9197	1	a	While the game is extremely fun, it appears to be extremely buggy as well. Bugs aside, the game claimed to be completely randomized. The truth of the matter is that the maps are only semi-randomized. Maps are predefined, but clusters of blocks which most can be dug through are randomized.  As far as the bugs are concerned, I have run into 2 that bother me. The first being that pausing the game, actually isn't a full pause; the game will actually progress even when paused, but at a much, much slower rate. The second would be a bug where buildable objects will drop below an item that has been moved just for the purpose of repositioning it (even when paused), right into the same place of the item you just repositioned, making the block where the item dropped from no longer buildable on that wall; this has been enough to make me have to keep restarting the game.
9199	1	a	Goofy, fun and at times challenging. Good fun!
1652	0	a	Mediocre at best. Better to just replay Dungeon Keeper.
1653	0	a	Painfully unfunny and horribly paced. There are many other, better dungeon/city building games than this.

1654	0	a	Painfully unfunny and horribly paced. There are many other, better dungeon/city building games than this.
1655	0	a	Dwarf Fortress Lite, for those of you who can't stand tiles/text based graphics. It's dumbed down to an incredible degree, to the point that it's almost insulting to play. It's intresting for a little bit, but Dwarf Fortress has a /lot more/ replayability, I doubt you'll get through the 'Story' before it becomes too boring.  At least Dwarf Fortress is Free.
1656	0	a	Fun at start but to repetative. Every map is a restart. You feel a lack of overal progression. Even research has to be done from scratch every mission.
1657	0	a	It's like they tried making Dungeon Keeper meets Dwarf Fortress but it's all just pretty bland and dull, held my interest for a little while before the seams started coming apart. Skip this one.
9203	1	a	This game is one of those Dungeon Keeper 2 clones that's done REALLY well. There are many differences, such as being three dimensional in it's layout meaning you can mine down and up for resources. There are also no designated rooms meaning you can freely put whatever you want where-ever you want. It is a very long game and I warn you now, since the game has a huge area, especially in the later levels when building in large groups of Dwarves it'll munch on your virtual memory like it needs ever inch to survive. The story is certainly not epic, but it's definantly commedic and quite fun to play. I recommend playing it if you love games such as Evil Genius or Dungeon Keeper 2.
1658	0	a	Hugely disappointing. Having hyped this game as a simplified 3D Dwarf Fortress, the developers either had no time to polish and add game functions, or they simply didn't have the skill to execute a game of this scale. Game mechanics are often hidden or pointless, navigation and moving the camera can be very confusing, AI struggles to accomplish simple tasks often doing it the most inefficient way leading to unnecessary deaths, animations and graphics that make me crave for Dwarf Fortress ASCII art, and a gameplay that does not infuse excitement or challenge with a dash of poor attempt at comedy. Paradox have a lot to learn when it comes to making games!
9205	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yo microtransactions! but i had a beer tree so GOTY 2281!

9207	1	a	This game is great!!!
1660	0	a	Mediocre at best. Better to just replay Dungeon Keeper.
1661	0	a	Unfinished Paracux game with clunky controls, extremely buggy and laggy. Yet, better at simulating strategic and tactical warfare than HOI3.
1662	0	a	This game is NOT worth any of your money. A Game of Dwarves is a base-builder where you end up leading a small pack of dwarves and have them extend their empire deeper into the caverns, yet as you dare do so you begin to uncover caverns containing monsters and possible treasures. That is the only thing that makes you keep on playing until you realize how dreadful the game actually is. First, the game has no to little updates. You will find the game to be always the same bland pointless base-builder. Second, the game enertains you for a few hours until you simply realize you do the same thing over and over again throughout the entire game. Dig down. Discover Cavern. Kill monsters. Rinse and repeat until you discover every cavern in the entire game or slaughter every monster. Lastly, the game is simply not enertaining and does not give you that thrill every time you discover a cavern. You end up finding it actually boring upon discovering caverns as your dwarves just wave in and loot the place or kill the monster. There is no all powerful artifact or enchanted weapons in these caverns. Only gold or monsters along with some furinture! I reccomend buying another game that is worthy of your money.
1663	0	a	This game is dull and monotonous. The gameplay involves a large amount of digging which amounts to highlighting blocks to and waiting for your dwarves to dig them out. The exploration high that one would expect to get from digging is greatly lessened by the fact that there is nothing exciting to find in these underground complexes that you are digging out. The only part of the game that is fun, the design and decoration of a dwarven stronghold, requires grinding for resources by digging. The dwarves in this game are controlled mostly by the AI. When I play this game, I find that there are long periods of highlighting blocks to dig out and longer periods of waiting around for the dwarves' AI to respond. I recommend avoiding this game.
1664	0	a	This is one of those games that you buy and then wonder, 'Why the F*@# did I buy this.'
9209	1	a	Humorous and cute version of Dungeon Keeper. Only this time you'll be commanding bunch of lazy beardlings and digging muuch deeper.
1665	0	a	Total crap. Poorly implemented, oversimplified dwarf fortress wannabe. Paradox will never get another dime from me.
9211	1	a	Another beautiful and funny game from Paradox
9213	1	a	many fun hours of silly city building :) if you like to grind resources to make yourself a pritty throneroom, and all other fun parts of an underground fortress this is the game for you. combat is a little dull.  nice story mission count but would love more maps!
1670	0	a	I can NOT recommend getting this game, I got it for free and have been playing it quite a bit just because its somewhat similar to Dungeon Keeper, then i played it because I wanted to be finished with it, and just now I ragequitted because a dwarf starved to death and the first audio queue I got about it was when he died.  Its ugly as hell. It lacks challenge. Its extremely time-consuming.  I still wanna finish it because its made by Swedish devs, but I cant recommend it to anyone.  If youre German you might enjoy it, but id rather point you in the direction of Dungeon Keeper.
9215	1	a	Amusing little time waster.   The 'carve out your kingdom' thing is fun - but the attacks five levels down can get complicated as your fighters wend their way up and down (or falll into a pit and starve without you noticing).  Actually, falling into pits and starving can be way to common if you get disturbed and 'forget' what you were doing . . .  A build without monsters option could be fun as well
9217	1	a	This is one of my favorite games. It appeals to the builder in me that loved Sim City, but includes some light fighting and mystery. This is one of the games that I can play while relaxing. I hate to micromanage my minions, and the dwarves in this game just need me to set them up with resources and give them a direction to dig. The storyline is cute and lighthearted. The only con is that I have encountered a few bugs, the worst of which is in the higher levels. These bugs have not prevented me from playing and don't cause too much frustration, except in my OCD. Because of them, I cannot accomplish all the achievements, but I am still able to play the game and finish the campaign.
9219	1	a	This game is a diamond in the rough. It's an isometric, much-simplified Dwarf Fortress, with a basic campaign and a sandbox mode. The graphics and voice acting are simple but enjoyable, with a good sense of humor. The mechanics are exactly what is needed in this genre; you dig, you accumulate resources, you move up a tech tree, and then you dig too deep and watch your dwarves die terrible deaths. One of my favorite indie games.
9221	1	a	This is not a perfect game. It is a bit unfinished, and will never be completed as the developer has quit operating. So why am I recommending it?  It's a lot of fun! You play a Dwarf clan and can build vast, underground caverns for your people. You have to dig for gold and other materials, but also make sure you don't run out of wood, and have to defend yourself from incursions by monsters such as Goblins or Spiders.  The campaign is silly, and while there are voice clips they do not match the dialog at all. But it serves its purpose in teaching you how to play. Sandbox is where this game really shines.  There is an in-game shop which wants you to buy items for in-game currency on top of the DLC, but all that's in there is cosmetic and can be completely missed.  If you like your 'town builders' but don't want the complexity of something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress, give this game a try.
9223	1	a	It is like Dwarf fortress meets Dungeon Keeper. Fun and frustrating.
1673	0	a	I've owned this product since 2013 and in that time i've barely played it thats because theres nothing to do. the campaign is bare bones and the game play is repetative dont even buy this on sale
1674	0	a	It's... kinda hard to describe. It's... very...... It's like a /very/ simplified Dwarf Fortress, I suppose, but with more of an emphasis on fighting and actual maps/objectives. It's not that fun, and VERY grindy.
9225	1	a	Much like when I needed to seal some wood and bought Ronseal, I was not dissapointed by this game.
9227	1	a	I like the playstile of the game but it can be improved
9229	1	a	Fun to control your own Dwarven army and build your own empire:)
9231	1	a	The controls can get a bit confusing at times (especially when switching between different layers), but it's a great and fun game nonetheless!   Almost like a more approachable Dwarf Fortress... Exactly what I have been waiting for!
9233	1	a	This is a good game if you like dwarf fortress. 8/10
9235	1	a	Hello,  I would recommend this game to anyone who can go into it without expectations. As others have mentioned, this game could have been amazing. Imagine just about any builder game, but with this games perspective/control and I drool. Gnomoria, Towns, Dwarf Fortress, Terraria, Craft the World, ect. They could all benefit from this type of 3d environment.  Sadly, this game doesn't even bother to try to take the gameplay features of the genre and implement them. Instead it gave you just enough to finish the campaign and rip some more money from you in the form of DLC before it was declared finished.  I had a great time with it. Like all early access alpha/beta type games, you play them and enjoy them because the anticipation for the next content patch keeps you involved. However, if you can't help but let a game rub you raw with it's blatant inadequacy, don't get it. If you can take it for what it is, grab it.  I don't regret getting, so I will upvote. I am saddend by the developers/publishers lack of vision and dedication in letting such a grand opportunity to become the best of the genre slip away.  Cheers, Michael
9237	1	a	I think its a good game when you get into it but it can get very repetative at points.But it does easily make up for it.
9239	1	a	A mix of Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress which is cute overload. For 9.99 it is a grab for sure as the Game Of Dwarves is very fun to play whilst being a long lasting game with a lot of possibilities. You can make halls , bedrooms , mine , research whatever you can imagine and create your own Iron Forge or Orzimmar.  85/100
9241	1	a	It's awesome fun and yet keeps you calm and relaxed the whole time. It's like playing a game while being high when your not high. Come on.. give it a go... it's only Â£8!
9243	1	a	While not for everyone, A game of Dwarves does scratch the sand box builder game itch. Or it could just be crabs. But anyway, great game for a great price.
9245	1	a	Fans of dwarves will enjoy this. Additionally the gameplay is quite enjoyable, balancing fortress management, with upgrades, mining and building an aesthetically pleasing haven for your dwarves is very fun. Incredibly good game and at a modest price.
9247	1	a	Fun game, like dwarf fortress, without the steep learning curve but lacks the complexity. Levels take acouple hours to complete. Well worth the $10 asking price.
9249	1	a	This game looked interesting. The price is reasonable. I bought it. It is a lot of fun. It reminds me of Dungeon Keeper mixed with some other things. It lacks the urgency of invasions, but the developers seem very involved with the community, so I expect new things for this. My wife wanted a copy. Then she blamed it as the reason she crawled into bed at 5am. That is a pretty good endorsement for a $10 game from indie developers. :) I recommend this game.
9251	1	a	Amazing game, reminds me of Dungeon Keeper with a fun factor added.  Kinda amazing what you can develop in the absolutely customizable chunk of rock given to you.  *Be sure to read all father-son dialogues since they are so mucn fun!
9253	1	a	Great little game, the reason i like this game so much is because i was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper games back in the day and this is basicly that but with Dwarf's. The building of your actually base is pretty impresive with the amount of options availible.  7/10
9255	1	a	This game is a very casual game. I frequently mine nearly every tile I can before solving the main mission,just because I can without the fear of loosing. This is not an intense action game nor does it require deep strategy. I enjoy playing the slow paced when I need to unwind from a busy day.
9257	1	a	Pros: great graphics considering the age; good tutorial; easy to understand even for a beginner; low price Cons: unable to get past the initial music/video each time the game is started which takes a little time; even if I do everything right, my chars still die for no reason that I can see; when placing ladders it is rather difficult to get them placed the direction you want (other items seem to place OK though).  Overall, it's a cute game and worth the small price. It was a little frustrating for me but that's probably my lack of experience speaking.
9259	1	a	It's not as far as good as Dwarf Fortress, but hey... At least it has an interface. It's okay game.
9261	1	a	It has a few glitches and lags sometimes but not severely. Overall this plays okay and I like it.
9263	1	a	If you like games like Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress your going to love this. A Game of Dwarves is a casual dwarf management game in which you manage a small colony of dwarfs. You have to keep them happy, safe, well fed and well rested at the same time as you train your soldiers and build insidious traps to ward of potential dangers related to digging too greedily and too deep. There's only two things that keep this game from a solid eight out of ten for me. The first ting is how strangely demanding the game is on my system, and the second thing is how it leaves me wanting more, much more. However, considering the price and how much potential the game has, I'll still give it a fairly high score. My rating: 6/10
9265	1	a	Super addictive and enjoyable Virtual Villager type city builder. Fun campaign mode and sandbox mode.
9267	1	a	Much like when I needed to seal some wood and bought Ronseal, I was not dissapointed by this game.
1678	0	a	A very bad Dwarf Fortress clone.
9269	1	a	Extremely good story,Sandbox is fun.Before I got it I watched people play it for hours. The people that didnt like it are (1) Didnt get what they expected.(2) Didnt have a good enough computer.(3)Are horrible at games and lost everytime.
9271	1	a	Dungeon keeper eat your heart out, you cant say it much plainer than that
9273	1	a	Where do I even start? This is is expansive and has such rich and vivid storyline! You start off as a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sucking the commander's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so you can get promoted but then Orcs come and kill eveyone but with your quick wit and huge â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you defend them off the commander dies YOU BECOME THE COMMANDER!!!! You get to lead a whole midget settlement underground and fight off evil â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like hindus and orcs (no joke they hate hindus). WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ON A CHEST? GO BUY IT AND LIVE LIKE A DWARF IN THIS FIRST PERSON ATTACK/ DEFEND GAME/ RPG!
9275	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is a fun casual game. If you just want to play something that's not too demanding, then this is a good game to consider. It has a few flaws, like what feels like unfinished AI, but, if you just want to spend some time playing an easy, fun game then this one is a real contender.
1680	0	a	Horribale Never Get it I want MY $$$$ BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!
1681	0	a	Horribale Never Get it I want MY $$$$ BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!
9277	1	a	When you play a game of dwarves, you win or you die.
9279	1	a	The game a bit buggy but the gameplay makes up for this.
1685	0	a	There was a bug that made it impossible for me to finish the first level. 0/10 broken game, stay away.
9281	1	a	Silly little game with a tutorial that makes learning game play very easy. The AI is sort of dumb however and can take a while for things to get done.  Glad I got it on sale. Wouldnt have wanted to pay full price for it but its a fun time killer for the casual player.  Relaxing. Doesnt require tons of thought.
1687	0	a	This game sucks. Period.
9283	1	a	A Game of Dwarves is a mixed bag of fun and frustrating; quirky and buggy.   Drawing heavily from Dungeon Keeper, AGoD puts you in charge of a group of dwarves in a small mine. In each mission you expand your starting location by digging outwards and downwards, building new room types to supply your dwarves and advance your settlement.   As you explore further, uncovering new minerals that unlock new rooms and upgrades, you encounter increasingly deadly enemies. AGoD has you constantly juggling between exploration and training so that your military dwarves can always handle what's around the next tunnel bend.   Problems start with the interface. A substandard UI and poor camera controls are mentally taxing. This wouldn't be such a problem except that the campaign missions become obviously uninspired as time passes.   Campaign missions involve digging your way to Spot X, and then digging your way to Spot Y, but this can be frustrated with the way the developers 'walled-in' objectives with impenetrable rock. This often means digging around for a long time, juggling the poor camera controls, just to find the entrance.   Still, there is fun to be had, especially if you can let go of the campaign and focus on building and creativity.   In the end, I can only recommend AGoD to hardcore Dungeon Keeper fans and those who enjoy building epic projects in sandbox environments.   
9285	1	a	THIS GAME IS AWSOME
9287	1	a	I was able to have fun through the game design flaws maybe you can too.
9289	1	a	Keeper.. your dungeon is full of cutesy dwarves armed with dlc.
9291	1	a	Do you like to dig?  Oh of course you do, you are a dwarf! This game brings the dwarf life.... well, to life! Mine, build, survive, and thrive. Fun to play and find all sorts of hidden treasures far underground in your mines.  If you like a simple dwarf colony game with mining, building, gathering, farming, and much much more. Check this one out as you won't be disappointed.
9293	1	a	Very Fun game but there are a few bugs.. nothing game breaking that ive encountered though. I Think this might be abandoned unless theres some HUGE update coming. Anyway its still fun so im rating it up.. Though you could just get dwarf fortress with a tileset and its well.. More complete :P
9295	1	a	I loved this game. I wish they'd continue the campaign. So much fun!!!
9297	1	a	Minecraft meets the management of say... AOE. Humor level around orcs must die's tone. I highly recommend the game even tho the production levels are fairly low. Its cute and easy to lose yourself in it for 5 hours if you dont focus on the mission task.  Rumored to have broken achievements, will confirm.
1688	0	a	An unfinished mess, that I was very hyped for WAY back then when the Yogscast played it before it's release.  Now that I bought it...    It's an unfinished pile of garbage with horrible animations, and generally just feels like an Early Access Pre-Alpha game. Even for it's time, it's just plain lazy. SO this for the Develoeprs.
9299	1	a	I bought this game because I like dwarves.  I didn't really play it that much or really enjoy it that much.   But also I really like dwarves so like 9/10
9301	1	a	Very fun game, everyime to make a new and epic settlement is good for passing time, After all its very enjoyable :)
1690	0	a	Why did I buy this game? Its boring and no fun at all. Do you want a good dungeon management game buy a game like Dungeons 2 (its not Dungeon Keeper but its fun) or War For The Overworld. Or buy Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2 the true classics!! But not this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
9303	1	a	great game but causes my laptop to overheat
9305	1	a	a pretty fun game if you like stradegy games 
9307	1	a	A nice change of pace for me. The level of customization to the world is nice. The graphics are respectable IMO. Game play is also respectable IMO. Over all a very well made and enjoyable game if you have the time and patiance to play it.
9309	1	a	10 out of 10
9311	1	a	I was considering giving this a thumbs down because it's a paid game with DLC and IAP's. I enjoyed the gameplay enough to consider it a recommendation though.
9313	1	a	I was considering giving this a thumbs down because it's a paid game with DLC and IAP's. I enjoyed the gameplay enough to consider it a recommendation though.
9315	1	a	Like a prettier version of Dwarf Fortress.
9317	1	a	I almost did not buy this game, but for $2.50 I have been having fun with it. You have to manage your Dwarves happiness and health while growing your dwarven Kingdom. The game looks good and is easy to learn the skills to make your Dwarves happy and healthy. You can speed up and even pause the game which is handy when you find monsters underground. The only direct input you have with your Dwarves is that you can teleport up to 5 dwarves to any location. Grab it while it is on sale and have fun :-) I did not get the DLC's but the only one that looks good is the Pets.
9319	1	a	We may never see dungeon keeper 3 thanks to EA, but if you love DK series, this is one of those games you should play.  The game is simply and fun to play, just like DK; except this time you get to play with dwarves.   Sorry lad, no mistress this time!
1696	0	a	A cute, stupid, Dwarf-Fortress-meets-Minecraft-meets-Fetal-Alcohol-Syndrome type of game. I kinda regret getting it.
9321	1	a	Really fun the building is very fun althought it would be nice to see some other sandbox options i havent really played the campagin as im more intressted in just building
9323	1	a	Honestly one of the best dungeon keeper type games I've played in a while. The art style is charming and the gameplay is simple to learn.
9325	1	a	Good game , like Dungeon Keeper &amp; Dwarf Fortress . Only con so far is Dwarfs get tired and hungry quick so you have to litter your dungeon with beds and food tables to get any work done . Besides that I like it .
9327	1	a	Want to play Dwarf Fortress (the completely free and insanely convoluted game found here:  http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)  with comprehensible graphics, a user-friendly interface and something as blasphemously casual as a tutorial? Then this is for you. You slimey, no-good casual filth, you.
9329	1	a	A delightfully cheerful game with a hint of seriousness, which can be quite catchy for those who like to explore and build (underground). It may be monotomous at times, but I found that it did not lower my gameplay experience, even if the tech tree is basically resetted every time you start a new map in the story mode.  It is an enjoyable game for any dwarf enthusiast.
9331	1	a	This is a really neat game.
9333	1	a	fun little game a few bugs that will never be fixed but, well worth the cost.
9335	1	a	its a good buy for just $10 
9337	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is not at all the game I was expecting it to be. The original game was a series of self-contained puzzle levels that were solved using a limited set of items. Toki Tori 2 is not that at all. Instead, the game drops you in the middle of a vast open 2D world and leaves you to figure everything out on your own. There are no instructions, tutorials, levels or items. The whole world is open from the start and you just need to figure out how to get through it while collecting a series of, err... collectibles. Unlike the previous game, Toki no longer uses items to solve puzzles. Instead, your abilities are limited to walking, singing and stomping. That's it. Where the complexity (and genius) comes in is how you can combine those actions with the various creatures that populate the world. For example, you can lure birds to pick you up with chirps, move bugs by stomping, and much, much more. I won't say anything further on that, as half the fun is figuring out the rules of the game on your own. As with the previous game, level/puzzle design is utterly brilliant. So many times you will think there is no way to proceed past an area, only to have the solution click a few minutes later (and you subsequently smack yourself upside the head because of how simple it actually was). That is a sign of good design, and I admire it a lot. I can't really think of any puzzles that were totally unfair, although there were a handful that were somewhat tedious. The singing mechanic is also a pretty neat new feature. In addition to its standard functionality, you learn a series of songs that provide other abilities, such as time-rewind, warping around the map, and more. And oh yeah, the characters are all really cute - especially Toki and the frogs (if you're into that sort of thing as a selling point). It all comes together nicely in a really well-executed package. Overall, I liked this a lot better than the first game, due to the open-ended exploration/collection gameplay and the 'complex simplicity' in the puzzle design. It's a fun, laid-back game that should appeal to puzzle fans. A-
9339	1	a	 http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028914/movie480.webm?t=1447358275    i dont play this game too much after i installed this game, i just play few times only but when i leave my PC, i saw my 6 years old daughter play it she look happy and very enjoy playing this  hard to believe it, she can play this without tutorial with more than 800 hours on record playing this game now i am no wonder she can earn all achievements for this game  casual, adventure, puzzle, and very cute characters (tutu,frog, berry,etc) this game is suit for all age  
9341	1	a	This game has some of the most ingenious mechanical and puzzle design you will ever see. It somehow manages to have metroidlike progression, where you see treasures and routes you can't take yet, but will on later visits, despite having no unlockable player abilities. It achieves this unprecedented feat by teaching you new and non-obvious mechanics as you progress through the various stages, which you can then use to solve other challenges you passed earlier. This teaching happens organically as you solve puzzles; there is no text or spoken dialogue in the game.   Toki Tori 2 is an under-appreciated gem and one of the best puzzle games ever made. 10/10
9343	1	a	At first i was skeptical to try the 2nd series because of the hardcore puzzles from the last one.   But it turned out that this one's more intuitive and engaging.   Great graphics, gameplay, puzzles, sound and animations. The music though i personally prefer the lat one.   Never the less, the game is actually fun to play and i would also recommend even the kids to play this game :). Mind the puzzles though, they can get a lot challenging as you progress further.
9345	1	a	I want a neutral button, I don't recommend it if you loved the first one or if you like to play games without having to look up what is the point of this or if you like puzzles in the normal sense of the word. But it's pretty and there are puzzles kind of, but this wasn't at all what I expected after playing Toki Tori 1 and I was disapointed. It's not a puzzle game like the first game it's an open world 2D platform explorer with puzzle elements. And like the new blurb says it tells you nothing about anything you have to figure out everything yourself, there is no kinda of tutorial at all. But it's not bad so I don't not recommend it if this is what you looking for, just be aware it's nothing like the first Toki Tori.
9347	1	a	Pleasant background music, challenging puzzles and cute animals (vampire bats and evil masks excluded). Game is now open-world rather than a set of different levels, and Toki Tori now only has a whistle and stomp ability and will often need to use the abilities of the creatures inhabiting that location to reach next collectible or checkpoint location.  The game is a bit difficult to follow initially as there are no instructions on how or why Toki Tori starts out moving in the forest, and what are the things the player has to look out for and to do to progress in the game. Eventually, the game will reward the player with achievements and secret locations for those who attempt to reach the ending and obtain every collectible in the game.
9349	1	a	Nice puzzle game. Cute graphics. Intuitive controls. Interesting enemies and approaches to beat them. Plus add steam workshop, just priceless. --- Get it and have fun playing this relaxing game.
9351	1	a	Highly recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles! Unlike other puzzle games where they give you hints and stuffs, Toki Tori 2+ drops you into 2D open world and leaves you by yourself to figure things out.  Gotta work that brain out! It gets really addicting, I promise. First look of the game might look like its for kids but it can be for any age range. Pretty fun, adorable chicks, frogy's and more! Happy puzzling~!
9353	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ isn't just one of the cutest games, but also an expertly crafted puzzle game. The satisfaction of discovering its secrets is immense. I've seen it mentioned as a metroidvania, but you could call it that only in the slightest sense. Central to the game is a beautifully rendered island in which you manipulate creatures and your environment in order to progress through puzzles that don't look like puzzles. The latter really makes it feel more like a beautiful exploration platformer, with an art-style and -direction that tell you that this game was a labor of love.
9355	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a one of a kind experience, an underrated gem that brings puzzle games into a new light.  While there are -no- tutorials, many mechanics are introduced discreetly throughout the game, exploiting the only two abilities the player has. (Stomp and chirp) A useful point to note about this: 'Side paths' often require an undiscovered method of using your abilities. These tricks are introduced in different places of the world map, and to avoid frustration, clear what seems easier and head back after exploring other parts of the world.  Some puzzles, often special areas, are extremely tedious. A slight mistake and the entire process starts over. Unfortunately, rewind mode doesn't exist.  *The main problem with the game is sustaining interest of the player during the first few hours. The vague context of the game takes a little away from the experience. (If it wasn't for google, I would still be clueless what the story was.) Tori's abilities feel extremely limited at the start. While you do learn about the environment and its interactions, it feels like Tori doesn't 'grow' for an extensive period of time. (A lack of reward) Moreover, the game is extremely unique and may feel uncomfortable to people who wants comfort in what they are used to. (Toki Tori 1 or most puzzle games) Chirping melodies also seem like a very important feature used to solve puzzles. (but it isn't, it's the interaction a chirp does)   Conclusion
9357	1	a	When I first saw this I though it was just some cutesy kids game, it's actually a cleverly designed puzzle platformer. The interesting thing is they never explicitly explain how to do anything, you learn by observation and experimentation. You never get any more powerful, what increases is your knowledge of how things work. It has moments of frustration followed by moments of clarity when everything suddenly become obvious. It's those epiphanies which really make the experience satisfying, and make you feel smart. My only criticism is I would have liked a tiny amount of exposition just to say who I was and what I was doing.
9359	1	a	Fun game if you don't know what to do with your life anymore.
9361	1	a	English: This is a very nice game. Simple puzzles with nice music...just what i like! :) French: II s'agit d'un jeu tres agreable. Puzzles simples avec de la bonne musique...tout ce que j'aime! Meow
9363	1	a	A fantastic, lighthearted, open-world (ala Metroid) puzzle adventure game. No hand-holding; rather than granting you new abilities, you start with everything you need to solve every puzzle from the beginning, learning new ways of interacting with what's around you as you go. A game that's hard not to love; highly recommended.
9365	1	a	pros: they changed the game mechanic from the previous 'collect eggs' &amp; maneuvering around the level - into a sing &amp; stomp puzzler, beautiful art style, soundtrack fits the theme (although not as good as the first game), environment is reactive to your actions, steam workshop supported  cons: although there are some visual cues - there is no tutorial or objective instructions (which could result in a player getting lost &amp; confused in what you are supposed to do), no mouse support for the world map, no windowed fullscreen mode, can't customize controls, huge difficulty spikes on some puzzles (would often require an online walkthrough to save time in solving tedious tasks)  Overall, this is a lot more open world than the first game but to the detriment of the player, there are times where you would get lost &amp; stumped on solving the puzzles. The new mechanics are great but with a flawed implementation. If you want an extreme trial &amp; error, time consuming, tedious tasks of a puzzle game this is it. Otherwise... Toki Tori 2 is a hit or miss.
9367	1	a	THIS GAME IS DOPEEEEEE.
9369	1	a	I like it,nice,friendly puzzle game.
9371	1	a	Satisfyingly difficult. The puzzles had me scratching my head quite often, but never to the point where it became too frustrating. The game manages to maintain a good balance in difficulty and introducing new ways to apply the few tools you get throughout the game. Kudos to Collin and Hessel, excellent job guys!
9373	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is so much more different than the first game. There's still puzzles but the main focus seems to be exploration and collecting items. The controls are simple, directional movement, chirp and stomp. Two actions but, surpirsingly, the game is mechanically deep. Not a lot is explained and it's all up to the player to figure out how to navigate the world. The puzzles are straightforward in the beginning and get more difficult as you progress. You may get stuck more than a few times especially if you're going for 100% completion.  Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes simple but challenging puzzle games. See how much you can manage without a guide. There's a lot to do and no hand-holding.
9375	1	a	Although it may seem like a 'kiddy' game because of the artstyle, graphics, etc. Some of the puzzles in this game will really make you think. Great for people who like puzzle games, and games that they can play casually to relax.
9377	1	a	Hey, I like the scenery in this game
9379	1	a	I don't pay much attention to this game, but my little daughter loves it. Though she has a hard to time too progress sometimes.   Great game for kids!
9381	1	a	A masterpiece.  Toki Tori 2+ is like Metroid, except the enemies are replaced by puzzles and you never learn any new abilities. The entire map is available to you from the minute you start, and the only thing standing in your way is your brain.  I want to shake the hands of whoever designed this game. I've read that the developer went out of business due to poor sales, which is absolutely criminal.  10/10. Play it, especially if you enjoy exploring.
9383	1	a	This game is really awesome. It truly has a metroidvania style, with a map connecting all the puzzles. And the controls are simple, since Toki Tori only has 3 actions: movement, chirp and stomp. So, how can this simplicity lead to challenging puzzles? The answer is the environment. There are a lot of creatures and other mechanisms, and each one has unique abilities. You must figure out how to use and combine them to advance. And here lies the beauty of exploring this game. In metro-style games, you advance the map and find blocked areas, because you don't have the gadget or ability yet. Then you keep exploring, find them and backtrack. Here, those zones are always acessible. But you may not know how to progress, so you keep playing and discovering new ways to interact with the environment. And then you backtrack and solve those zones, knowing that it was possible to go there from the beginning. The map may not be huge, but there are lots to do. To beat the story, you need to find 5 special frogs. You can collect all wings to uncover new secrets. And there are hidden zones and achievements. Oh, and the art is amazing too. And the game doesn't feel like some puzzles connected to each other by a map. Here, the total is more than the sum of it's parts. And that makes this game truly special and rewarding to explore.
9385	1	a	An awesome puzzle game, much more fun than first one..
9387	1	a	great game with great features that most players will enjoy.  If you enjoy a good puzzle, Play this game!
9389	1	a	Great little game, not much to say. I recommend
9391	1	a	Beautiful game. Tragically underrated.
9393	1	a	This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. It is up there with Braid in terms of quality, but quite different. It's like the Super Mario World of puzzle games with a large, living world that is full of surprises if you explore enough. If you are a puzzle game fan, you should play this game.
9395	1	a	Maybe the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. No, really. Legit.
9397	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is, rather obviously, the sequel to Toki Tori. It's evolved from being a pure puzzle game, with limited use of items, to a more fluid platformer puzzle. While the original was pretty unforgiving, and often required surgically precise steps to solving the puzzles, TT2 isn't quite as strict. Most puzzles can be re-attempted without a reset or winding back time.  In TT2, you return as Toki Tori, and you only have two (unlimited) abilities at your disposal : a whistle, and a ground stomp. There are many other creatures and elements in the game, and they will respond to one, oftentimes both, of these actions. Puzzles are solved by using your abiltiies to manipulate your surroundings. It sounds very simple, but there are many, many different creatures in the game, and the trickier puzzles will require chaining their reactions together. The 'core' puzzles that you need to solve to progress through the game are fairly straightforward, but the side area ones are much tougher, and it always feels very satisfying to finally solve them and hear the bonus area background chime.  There are several good points to this game that I want to highlight.  1) It doesn't try to babysit you. The game provides subtle hints to guide you along, but it lets you learn it without butting in obstrusively. The game itself starts off without any kind of narration, and you're left to make your way through the levels. In fact, the only help text I ever remembered seeing, was the hint to sing the Reset song, and even that only appears after you fail to follow the non textual clue. The effect of this is that it increases the immersion of the game, and makes solving the levels so much more rewarding.  2) No need to constantly run to an ingame menu. Instead, Toki Tori can whistle a certain combination of notes to perform certain actions (e.g. reset to last checkpoint or go to the world map). It's a very nice touch.  3) You don't get any new abilities as you progress (with the exception of the songs, but those don't factor into the puzzzles). This means there's no grinding involved. All puzzles are solvable right from the beginning of the game, but on your first try you won't know how. You'll learn several tips and tricks as you go along, and when you backtrack to the earlier to fulfill your masochistic desire to collect all the score items, it will suddenly strike you that you can get one frog to float another frog up.  4) Graphics and music. The art style is very minimalistic, clean and ridiculously cute, and the music fits the game very well. For the most part, it's a relaxing experience, in spite of all the puzzle solving.  As with most platformers, it plays much better with a controller.  Highly recommended.
9399	1	a	i had a blue bird now it's did
9401	1	a	Fantastic game! I was put off originally thinking it was a platformer running around getting tokens, but it's a really well thought out puzzle game. Animations are great, some levels take a bit of thought to get past, but there are a lot of different routes you can take so can swap to a different area if you get too stuck.  Only thing I'd like is a bit more of a 'The End' - has a game ending, but world is open to run around indefinitely. And all I got was a lousy T-shirt ;)
9403	1	a	Very enjoyable platformer puzzle game. It is of a slower pace andit has some exploration elements. No tutorial but with only 2 abilities you can usually solve the puzzles with trial and error and feel lost. It really is amazing how much you can do with just 2 actions in a game.
9405	1	a	it is just clean and colorfull, one of the best games for kids.
9407	1	a	Very fun games, i bought this game when my girlfriend ask me to buy this game after she watch someone on YouTube play this game!
9409	1	a	brilliant puzzle game. that seems easy at first. but brutally difficult as the game progresses.
9411	1	a	not a bad game at all. a very fun game and worth it if on sale.
9413	1	a	An avian puzzle platformer with a fierce dedication to minimalism, Toki Tori 2 is the quest to save your island home from corruption and make it safe for all chickenkind. It's filled to the brim with puzzles that run from satisfyingly simple to mindbendingly complex, all wrapped in a saccharinely-sweet exterior that will charm you as it absorbs you for many hours. Go anywhere and discover the game's challenges in any order you choose as you sing and stomp your way through a tightly designed journey of bubble riding, photo taking and frog crushing.
9415	1	a	Bought this for the Wife and she seems to like it so far.
9417	1	a	This game is too intense for me. Will have to shelve for now.
9419	1	a	That one is pretty nice. Pleasant 2D graphics, relatively nonlinear gameplay and lots of thinking required. If you liked Toki Tori 1... well, there's no guarantee you'll like Toki Tori 2, but it deserves a chance.  P.S. It claims to be a Metroidvania on the store page - what a load of excrement. Not that the game is bad, but Metroidvania - it is not.
9421	1	a	Cute, not as easy as it looks like... What else do you want? The most obvious difference to Toki Tori is, that this time you don't create bridges, blocks etc. but instead manipulate other creatures by tweeting and stomping. 
9423	1	a	This is a fun, neat little game.
9425	1	a	That chicken (or not chicken) is so awesome!
9427	1	a	A great puzzle platformer! Great attention to detail and creative scenarios all the way through. It's amazing how the game mixes and matches elements to create whole new puzzles throughout the game. The presentation is far above what I was expecting and the whole game has been a joy to play (even when it has been INFURIATINGLY tough). It's been very rewarding and I can't wait to finish the last part of the game.
9429	1	a	+ It's beautiful and cute. + Thanks to amazing game design, puzzles are never frustrating for long. The game is non-linear after the first 20%, so you can finish it taking the route you want (though a specific route is suggested to ensure a progressive difficulty curve). If you're stuck, you can still go to another place of the map, you may learn there a trick that will help you find the solution to your initial problem. You'll be sure not to waste time, since side tracks that aren't necessary to finish the game are always pretty short, and are filled with collectibles. + Not a single word outside the menus and the credits! You learn everything you need through puzzles. + The game is cuuute! + You won't have to inspect every square centimeter of the levels to find the secrets. The game gives you a tool to detect the collectibles, so your only problem will be how to get to them (via, you guessed it, a puzzle!). + Did I mention this game is cute? â‹‹(^3^)â‹Œ  - Such cuteness seems to be pretty ressource-intensive, especially the litghting. In places where several lighting effects were taking place, the game often lagged despite my pretty good equipment. Never was a problem for the gameplay though.  â‹›â‹‹( â€˜â—‡â€™)â‹Œâ‹š May the birds be with you! â‹›â‹‹( â€˜â—‡â€™)â‹Œâ‹š  /|\( ;,; )/|\ Watch out for bats! /|\( ;,; )/|\
9431	1	a	This is a really cool puzzle game. Not quite MetroidVania, but almost. I say 'almost' because from my time playing, it felt quite linear. You do pick up new abilities though. I like the 'no handholding' deal where you gotta figure cool stuff out for yourself. Great controller game for the couch.   If it is on sale and you like puzzle platformers - you will really enjoy this little gem.
9433	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a cute sequel which is also more open. The puzzles range from easy to 'i have no clue'. Having never finished the first game I don't know if the puzzles are actually harder, or more clever,... or easier. Toki Tori isn't a fast chick, he's quite slow actually, which also influences the gameplay. If only he walked a little bit faster. The game is so slow and uneventful that I had to play it in sessions of 10-30 minutes. After 2-3 hours of total playtime I had no more interest in finishing it. I doubt I will ever finish it in the first place. You might enjoy it however so if you loved the first one you'll love this one, too. I'm sure of it.  [Rating: 72/100]
9435	1	a	You may think that this game is for kids only, but if you think so, then you are clearly wrong. I am not really a big fan of puzzle games, however I have once gotten a discount card (or whatever those things are called) and the trailers looked pretty promising, so I grabbed it, and I do not regret it. Every level is thought out very nicely and I love how the game combines a platformer with a 2D map which lets you go in many different directions, while still being a 2D platformer. The graphics are really cute and so is the soundtrack and the puzzles have just the right difficulty. While not being so easy that you don't have to use your brain they are also not so hard that you give up and never play again. I can only recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to solve the puzzles together (in my case a younger sister). Honestly, I have not been as addicted to a game in a very long time, if you are standing on the edge of whether or not you should buy this game; if you have someone else to play together with, then buy it. You will not regret it.
9437	1	a	samus aran got her armor from bird people so here's a metroid starring a bird person, with good puzzles and really clever pacing.
9439	1	a	A great platform game with insanely cute graphics and quirky ways to solve the puzzles throughout. I challenge anyone to play this game without smiling at least a little bit.
9441	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Toki Tori 2+. Although admittedly it took a little bit to start appreciating the game. This is primarily due to the lack of instructions or direction provided by the game. There are no tutorials, no dialog, nothing. What the game does do to help the player is provide subtle hints, that I personally missed at first. For example, always pay attention to the little white bird. He will show you how to get to certain areas and even show you song melodies that you can play to do certain things (e.g. fast travel, restart, point out collectibles). Although this lack of direction made starting out a little tough, I ended up appreciating it later on.  What I really enjoyed about the game is how it takes such a simple concept and is able to make complex puzzles. Throughout the entire game, you can only move (not jump), stomp the ground, and make tweeting sounds. You must use these abilities to interact with different animals and objects in order to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the game, you have the ability to get to any area. The only thing you might be lacking is the knowledge of how to get past certain points. Again, the game does not tell you how to do things with dialog boxes, instead it subtly shows you, through gameplay, how to use your stomping and tweeting to progress through the level.  I strongly suggest checking out this  video walkthrough  for when you get stuck, and you most certainly will. You may have to hunt through the videos to find where he covers the section you are stuck on, but it is definitely worth it as he shows how to unlock all of the achievements and shows some stuff that I would not have been able to figure out on my own.  Another helpful tip is that the rewind song, which is:   (tweet these notes) short short long long  , can be played multiple times to jump back to previous checkpoints.
9443	1	a	Yes. Yes buy this game. Buy this game right now it blows away almost everything I've ever seen.
9445	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is a wonderful continuation of the first game. As far as puzzle games go, it's incredibly cute and can be extremely challenging. 100% recommend.
9447	1	a	my favorite part is the cards
9449	1	a	This game is THE MOST INTERESTING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED and one of the best (next to portal 2) and I love it for the same reason most people probably hate it, you have to figure out not only the puzzles but how to play the game. there are no totorials, instructins or any words. (spoken or written) when you first start the game you are given a quick look at the (very simple) controls and then placed right into the game and are expected to figure everything else out!
9451	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is very different from Toki Tori 1. Whereas Toki Tori 1 is a straight up puzzle platformer with traditional levels, Toki Tori 2 is a Metroid-like explorable world, where solving puzzles is the way to get around. Also, unlike the first game, there are no items to use. Instead, different reactions can be elicited from the native creatures by Toki Tori either chirping or stomping. While it sounds rather simple in theory (and some of the early puzzle are), figuring out the correct sequence to solve a puzzle can get rather challenging at times. Simply put, this is not the game for people who hate puzzles or those lacking patience. Those who do manage to stick around for the harder areas of the game will find an enjoyable experience, and will no doubt find a number of easter eggs in the process.
9453	1	a	Beautiful Game. Buy it! Toki Tori is &lt;3
9455	1	a	The frog is much cuter than most creatures in the game.
9457	1	a	If you like cutesie puzzle platform type games then this is certainly the game for you! It makes use of some interesting game mechanics. You can't jump, but you can 'tweet' up to 5 notes, each of which can be either short or long, and you can pound on the ground. During the game you learn different sequences of notes that cause different magical effects (sort of like a bird casting magic spells by tweeting the right way). So rather than the usual platformer type stuff of killing things with weapons or Mario-style by landing on them, or getting around by jumping, you have to use tweeting and ground pounding to manipulate your environment in order to progress. And there's even a level editor for the thing.  This style of game isn't really my main area of interest, but this game is extremely well designed and is quite unique. If this is your type of game, then this one would be in the must get category.
9459	1	a	This game is as good as pie shoved down my throat into my stomach. 0/7.
9461	1	a	worth
9463	1	a	This is easily one of the best puzzle games, let alone puzzle platformer games, out there, especially for its pricepoint. The level design is consistently solid and new elements and new ways to utilize existing elements are constantly introduced without ever breaking the flow of gameplay and without feeling the slightest bit handholdy. There is an immense sense of discovery to every aspect of the game as shortcuts and hidden paths are constantly present and it is up to the player to decide where to go and to discover how to best use everything the game presents them with. The game also does a great job of adjusting to the player's skill level (or the player's desired difficulty) as there is always a clear path to take, but harder, hidden routes through the game's world are ever-present for players who wish to discover all that this game has to offer.  With its excellent sense of physical and mechanical exploration and puzzles which range from fairly easy to outright diabolical, Toki Tori 2+ is a game which puzzle fans should leap at the chance to play as soon as they can.
9465	1	a	This game is amazing and you owe yourself to play it.
9467	1	a	This is a fun puzzle game. You are a cute little bird who goes through different levels and tries to find a way around different obstacles, without dying. Really colourful and nice to look at. the levels become more difficult. fun for casual play and simple to learn, only 2 buttons to use.
9469	1	a	Some hard puzzle stuff... enjoy this yellow mofoka ;)
9471	1	a	cute as frick
9473	1	a	This is the wrong message for little kids: hide in the grass from your parents, then run away when they are not looking. Also after sucessfully escaping, try to solve problems plauguing the entire world.
9475	1	a	Definitely doesn't worth the full price, but since I got this game from bundle, this game is kinda good to kill time.
9477	1	a	Bloated Frog:) I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9479	1	a	interesting game...i'm glad to try it first xD
9481	1	a	I... I... I... like bird now.... This game... makes me... braindead... Way... too pretty.... i can't..... Handle.... prettyness... and this... happyness... Your bird.. can make... music.... soo.... happy... its a platform.... game... i... i... must.... play... can't... review..  Brain..washed...game... play... at.. your own..... risk.... They.... made.. me like.... it...   6/10.....
9483	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a Metroidvania style puzzle adventure. There are no tutorials, there's no hand-holding, no-one tells you what to do in Toki Tori 2+. The fun is in exploring and overcoming the obstacles of the lush forest island on your own merit.   Our unlikely yellow hero may be the star of the show, but he won't get anywhere without the creatures he meets along the way. Armed with just the Whistle and Stomp moves, he can influence and make use of these strange creatures' unique abilities.   But what's up with that black goo? It's threatening your home world! Your goal is to get to the core of the corruption and save the island!
9485	1	a	Great idea. Quite impressive what you can do with only two ways to interact with things.
9487	1	a	If Rayman Origins was a puzzle game, that game would be called Toki Tori 2. This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment. The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well.
9489	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ outdoes the previous game by doing the opposite of what Toki Tori 1 did. In the first game, you had lots of powers used to solve puzzles in single screen levels. Toki Tori 2 gives you only two interactions (a stomp and a chirp), but does away with the tradition level format in exchange for a huge world teeming with life. The challenge in the game comes from discovering how the creatures in the game react to your two moves and to each other. This makes the game world feel a bit deeper than most Metroidvania style games, as each section has it's own simplified ecosystem that make up the bulk of the game's puzzles.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platforming puzzles, exploration and discovery, or anyone looking for a Metroidvania game without any combat that still delivers a compeling experience.
9491	1	a	Great puzzle game with fantastic music and graphics, but more importantly, a really interesting progression style. Think 'the alien monkeys teaching you how to wall-jump' but for every action in the game. Some very clever puzzles.
9493	1	a	This game is our goal to prevent racism in our society.
9495	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is the exploration of a metroidvania distilled down into pure joy. Instead of being a pure puzzler like the first game, #2's challenge lies in learning how things interact, and then using that knowledge to keep moving forward.   Nearly all of the normal annoyances of this type of game are averted -  Rewind time to the last checkpoint at any time, don't even need to open a menu. Checkpoints are placed amazingly well. I have yet to have to walk more than a single screen to retry a puzzle. It teaches you one thing at a time, then twists it to make it interesting, then combines it with other things you've learned to make it challenging. It TEACHES, never TELLS. Nothing is worse than having to sit through 3 minutes of the game telling you all about the move or tool you just obtained. Toki Tori 2 hasn't done this to me.  Nothing is better in a metroidvania than coming back to an area and realizing that there's a puzzle you missed, but it was hidden in plain sight. Toki Tori 2 just keeps doing it to me, and it's wonderful.  I expected a simple timewaster and I got a very solid metroidvania.
9497	1	a	this is a fun game for little kid with a little bit of adult help at times
9499	1	a	Colorful and cute bird does sound great for children.
9501	1	a	An utterly ingenious metroidvania puzzle game - made even better with enhancements! One of my absolute favourite games with gorgeous graphics, incredible music and fantastic gameplay that doesn't hold your hand. Brilliant!
9503	1	a	Cute game. Challenges await, and the puzzles truly are puzzling.
9505	1	a	This game is great! It's cute, and hard, and it feels really good when you put the clues together to figure out what to do next.
9507	1	a	Remember those animal things in Super Metroid that taught you how to shinespark? Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.  Unlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these 'powers' from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the 'right time' is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me.   Toki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.
9509	1	a	offers some real nice puzzles
9511	1	a	this is a bright and cheerful platformer wonderful game for relaxing
9513	1	a	Come to Steam, children! This is the feeling I get when I look at this game's graphics, all very cute and colorful. This is an OK casual game. It would be better if it wasn't for the rather slow pace.
9515	1	a	Is actually a pretty good platform game, not something I would play, but still good. 
9517	1	a	Don't be fooled by it's colorful and child-like appearance. Toki Tori 2+ is awesome!  Toki Tori 2+ will have you smiling ear-to-ear, as you play a fat little bird who sings and butt-slams his way through his colorful world.I haven't felt this platforming magic since playing Super Mario Bros 2 or Yoshi's Island. It is a patient side-scroller. There's no crazy jumps or wild enemies that you have to avoid. It keeps it simple by letting you explore, find treasure, and figure out how the world works with only a handful of actions. The visuals are really pretty.   This is definitely a call-back to classic platforming.
9519	1	a	It is quite an interesting game, it is a game that will pull you in and it's interactive
9521	1	a	Fun to play. Excited puzzle
9523	1	a	Cute style. Clever puzzles. Charming gameplay. Climaxing story  Overall a really solid game that doesn't allow you to jump, which can be a little frustrating, but it works.
9525	1	a	Super cool game for a kid. My son have played it for hours and hours at 5-6 years old. He needed help in some places, but have managed many thing on his own. It's non-agressive, mind and logic challenging and very pretty. Good game for my son to play at.
9527	1	a	Fun, cute, not too difficult nor is it too easy.
9529	1	a	You just need to buy this game, it's a really fun game to play.
9531	1	a	this is a bright and cheerful platformer wonderful game for relaxing
9533	1	a	Come to Steam, children! This is the feeling I get when I look at this game's graphics, all very cute and colorful. This is an OK casual game. It would be better if it wasn't for the rather slow pace.
9535	1	a	It's a fun and different little platformer with charming visuals and cute main character. Although not really worth 11 euro if you plan to just fly through the story as is it quite short, I can recommend it if you enjoy trying to solve every puzzle and finding all the hidden items.
9537	1	a	Wonderful, tricky puzzle game with colorful and cute graphics. Well done Two Tribes, keep up the good work!
9539	1	a	Good game for relax
9541	1	a	Its a game for children. The game is about a happy bird.  The storyline could hold a child easy, but not for experiance player due to being so simple.  Adults* - 5/10 Children* - 8/10 (Child Tested for my opinion)
9543	1	a	This game surprised me. I basically bought it because it looked cute, and cute games don't terrify me, but it's all a lie. This is a game where you are forced to make characters eat each other in order to accomplish your goals, so it's not as cute as it looks. Anyway, I really enjoy it. It's very freeform, and it's fun to have to figure out what to do next instead of having a clearly defined mission. It's like life. This game has kept me entertained for a VERY long time, and it truly is addicting.
9545	1	a	This is a very cute adventure puzzle platformer for anyone from toddlers (age 3+) to obsessive gamers. The storyline is quite open ended and there's always more achievements and collectables to chase.
9547	1	a	This game is refreshingly different. It's nostalgic in its style and platform difficulty.
9549	1	a	Fun little game - often on special too for the whole bundle - see my video first impression here:          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  &nbsp;
9551	1	a	beautiful art.. I love it.. and that 'no tutorial' statement is a great point.. it make me want to play again and again.. I want to know what will happen next..
9553	1	a	My first impression is that this was a very silly and childish game, but this is far from the truth. It's actually a fun game, really well executed. It requires you to think and solve puzzles on a truely unique way. I think it really stands out in originality.
9555	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ outdoes the previous game by doing the opposite of what Toki Tori 1 did. In the first game, you had lots of powers used to solve puzzles in single screen levels. Toki Tori 2 gives you only two interactions (a stomp and a chirp), but does away with the tradition level format in exchange for a huge world teeming with life. The challenge in the game comes from discovering how the creatures in the game react to your two moves and to each other. This makes the game world feel a bit deeper than most Metroidvania style games, as each section has it's own simplified ecosystem that make up the bulk of the game's puzzles.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platforming puzzles, exploration and discovery, or anyone looking for a Metroidvania game without any combat that still delivers a compeling experience.
9557	1	a	Best platform game ever! -- no UI to in the way of the beautiful graphics. simple controls that have surprising depth. Fun and beautiful
9559	1	a	Great puzzle game with fantastic music and graphics, but more importantly, a really interesting progression style. Think 'the alien monkeys teaching you how to wall-jump' but for every action in the game. Some very clever puzzles.
9561	1	a	Such a great little game. Cute animals, a metroidvania styled world, and challenging puzzles makes for a very entertaing title. If you didn't enjoy Toki Tori 1 don't disregard it's sequel. It adds the element of adventure as you trudge through the world exploring for secret areas while finding all of the collectibles. I highly recommend this game.
9563	1	a	1. Slow Paste 2. Intresting Puzzle Game 3. Intresting Concept 4. Can Get Very Boring  6.5/10
9565	1	a	Toki Tori 2 is the exploration of a metroidvania distilled down into pure joy. Instead of being a pure puzzler like the first game, #2's challenge lies in learning how things interact, and then using that knowledge to keep moving forward.   Nearly all of the normal annoyances of this type of game are averted -  Rewind time to the last checkpoint at any time, don't even need to open a menu. Checkpoints are placed amazingly well. I have yet to have to walk more than a single screen to retry a puzzle. It teaches you one thing at a time, then twists it to make it interesting, then combines it with other things you've learned to make it challenging. It TEACHES, never TELLS. Nothing is worse than having to sit through 3 minutes of the game telling you all about the move or tool you just obtained. Toki Tori 2 hasn't done this to me.  Nothing is better in a metroidvania than coming back to an area and realizing that there's a puzzle you missed, but it was hidden in plain sight. Toki Tori 2 just keeps doing it to me, and it's wonderful.  I expected a simple timewaster and I got a very solid metroidvania.
9567	1	a	Don't be put off by the 'No Tutorials' the game is extremely intuitive and a true puzzle game. This is a brilliant, super polished game.   An excellent pure puzzle platformer.
9569	1	a	To be completely honest, the original on MSX2 and GBC are better than the sequel and remake. But i cant say this is a bad game. It has its charm and everything looks smooth and cute but at the same time its sometimes really hard to figure out what to do and when you finally do, you start feeling like the worlds biggest dunce. i give the game a 9,9/10
9571	1	a	Buy It: This is another game that surprised me a lot, first of all because I didn't liked too much the way the chick looks like, and then because to me it looked like a boring game for children (and even the kids coul be bored to play at xD) I was wrong! It's very nice, relaxing, and you have to use your mind to understand how to get help from the others animals around, the design of the environment and the animals it's pleasant and you will not be bored by the sounds, it's a very gracefull game to play at that will make you smile
9573	1	a	I couldn't get past the second level. Puzzle game fans should enjoy it.
9575	1	a	This game is a beautiful puzzle platformer. This is one of those games that you know the developers really cared to put out the best possible product they could, and it shows when you're playing.
9577	1	a	One of the best puzzle games ever made, which let the player guess what he can do and how. Very clever game, highly recommended !  Uno de los mejores juegos de puzzle que se han hecho, que permiten al jugador adivinar lo que puede hacer y cÃ³mo. Juego muy inteligente, muy recomendable!

9579	1	a	I initially hated this game. A lot. I had loved the first Toki Tori, but found this one frustrating and confusing.  However, after having put it on the shelf for a year and coming back, I decided to give the game a real shot. And after some initial frustration, I really started enjoying it. The puzzles are really, really well thought out. And only a few of them were what I'd call 'unfair' and required levels of perception I seem to lack.  But given lots of patience and time, it was very rewarding to figure out the puzzles, and finish a level.  What I *do* ding the game for though is its lack of focus, and overall confusing storyline. Nothing really made any sense whatsoever, and I never felt like I knew what I was doing, beyond just solving puzzles. This game lacked a lot of the charm of the original, even though, as I mentioned, the puzzle design was freaking fantastic.  I'm giving this a thumbs up, if you love puzzle games, and can ignore the confusing storyline.
9581	1	a	Very good game, In some cases need a lot of mental endurance, but mostly the solution is pretty easy you just have to do it right.
9583	1	a	Not for 12+. Yes. Not for 12+. But Interesting.
9585	1	a	Great little puzzle game. Surprising complexity given the simple controls. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice challenge you don't have to drop dozens of hours into.
9587	1	a	OMG, this game iis freaking awesome! the level design is impressive and interesting!
9589	1	a	Toki Tori 2+ is a fun puzzle game, which can be bought for pretty cheap on a sale. If you're on a Mac, though, you'll want to get a virtual machine with Windows on it for it to work. The graphics are nice, the characters are cute, and there are killer bats. I mean, killer bats, come on. I haven't played a lot of the game yet, so this isn't based off of a lot.   Overall, if you like puzzle games, you'll probably like this one. 8/10  (If you want to jump a lot, though, you may be slightly disappointed)
9591	1	a	Fun to play. Excited puzzle
9593	1	a	so cute graphic
9595	1	a	Super cool game for a kid. My son have played it for hours and hours at 5-6 years old. He needed help in some places, but have managed many thing on his own. It's non-agressive, mind and logic challenging and very pretty. Good game for my son to play at.
9597	1	a	A simple to understand but difficult to beat puzzle game that can often trick you with a simple solution. It has a metroidvania style design but teaches you how to solve puzzles through the environment as you play. This allows for forked paths that are blocked by your knowledge of the game at that point instead of an upgrade or item that you need to find somewhere else.  The game requires two playthroughs if you want all the achievements and that is about the only complaint I can think of, even if the second playthrough is much faster.
9599	1	a	Awesome graphic and gameplay! It's like the old school Space Invaders. If you play Space Invaders, play this.  Very nice game, and you can earn and craft awesome looking badges :D
9601	1	a	It's like Space Invaders, but with a few additions that make it feel fresh and new. Not as good as Space Invaders Extreme, but worth checking out if you like these kinds of games.
9603	1	a	Great Space Invader/Galaga 'clone' that adds upgrades and other touches like bosses that really enhance the playability of the old arcade one screen shooter. A lot of fun and recommended to genre and non genre fans alike especially when on sale... dirt cheap fun.
9605	1	a	Absolutely glorious remaster of the classic Space Invaders game. Innovative, advanced, and scores of fun to be had.  When aliens living on Titan, Saturn's moon, decide to attack, they lay waste to Earth's military forces. Well most of it. You are the last remaining Tank Commander on Earth, and you are one bad mofo. Battle your way across Earth to stop the invasion, and then you take it to the skies as you hit the Titans' outpost on the Moon, and obliterate it. Next stop, the Titans' Martian colony. They wiped out all the little green men also and need to pay. After Mars, you find yourself on Saturn, and the enemy forces are strong. But not as strong as when you reach Titan itself, taking on the nest of the alien scourge to nearly end our way of life... and the poor Martians.  5 levels, 5 mothership bosses, an entire armada of Titan forces, some rogue and oddly light blue asteroids, and 1 lone tank to destroy them all. Fight your way across the Solar System as you upgrade your tank; outfitting it with extra weapons, additional bullets, faster recharge time, more powerful attacks, Shields, and deadly Smart Bombs. You start out small, but by the time you reach Titan, the force of your tank is ridiculous. But that doesn't mean it's easy. Each world you come to is upping the difficulty, more enemies, more styles of fighting, and a tougher Boss.  Not to mention fun bonus Challenge stages after every 7 waves you defeat, where harmless yet swift yellow flying saucers shoot across the sky. Destroy them all with perfect aim and you get bonus prices.  This game is complete with Highscore boards showing the scores of other players across Steam. Compare your best with others and strive to be the best. All the while this game's gloriously beautiful soundtrack playing in the background as you squash Titan scum.  The tank comander from the original Space Invaders would be jealous to see the rig you are in control of now.
9607	1	a	This game is really great   -Good old puppy games styled ost and 8-bit visuals -Galaxian style non-stop action -You can upgrade your vehicle  -leaderboards  Overall its a great time killer, but on the other side of the coin, if you want to unlock all achievements it's sometimes bugs and dont recognise that you completed all stages.
9609	1	a	Puppygames seems to specialise in teaching old dogs new tricks. The old dog in this case is Space Invaders, and the new tricks make it well worth playing again. As you progress you earn money which you use to upgrade your tank, turning it into a laser-spitting death machine. But the aliens are upgrading too, getting faster and deadlier with new abilities. There are five worlds, with a boss at the end of each, and challenge stages every seven levels.  At heart it's still a simple game - nothing can change that - but it's addictive and the graphics are distinctive. It's a good game to play as a break from more complex games.
9611	1	a	FUN! Very old school style.
9613	1	a	Who get the kill? Titans or you?  Titan Attacks is an retro 2D game about Titans attacking earth. The title is based on the convention of the old game 'Space Invaders' from 1978. Your quest is to destroy incoming race by moving the cannon to the left-right while shooting. Easy? Not really. The enemies want to destroy your cannon by shooting and getting closer to you. You need to be really fast and precise to finish every wave without a scratch. The game brings a lot of fun and give you the possibility to work on some abilities like reflex, focus and patience.  So who wins? You and your cannon or the whole Titan race?  Besides the main goal to destroy incoming enemies you also have many things to do in the game. With the next waves aliens becomes stronger and stronger so you have to upgrade your cannon by increasing rate, power or adding special weapons. On every planet the last wave is the boss level so you need to destroy the mothership to go further. Also there's a challenge stage where you can win special prizes and bonuses.  It's not an easy task to finish the game. I played a lot (^ hours) and right now I haven't completed the last 'Titan' level of difficulty at the end - boss is too strong :) But I'm ranked in global Top 30 ^^  + demanding game based on the idea of Space Invaders + has it's individual style + nice fun with friends and  + online statistics and friends comparison  + good balance for cannon upgrades + brings memories of old gaming + unlimited game time + checkpoints after completing every planet  Small bugs that could be fixed: - controller is partly supported - there's a lack of Pause and Exit button
9615	1	a	play this on my laptop in the Bus and Train :P good game if you want to waste some time  7/10
9617	1	a	Another fantastic looking retro game from Puppygames! It is the 2014 version of the classic game, Space Invaders, where you are the last surviving tank commander defending Earth from alien invasion.  The idea is still same as in 1978. Alien forces slowly approach you, while you bring destruction with your tank and laugh at them. At the same time you collect points and upgrades, which you then use for tank upgrades between levels. Upgrades vary from shields to extra ammo and smart bombs etc. Nothing major or too complex though, just enough to give the old concept a refreshing twist.  It's a great and challenging mini game that pretty much anyone with two working hands and a set of brains can start playing immediately. 
9619	1	a	a great Space Invaders remake  + the Puppy Games awesome, polished retro aesthetic +/- the Puppy Games 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...this is hard'  score = 4/5
9621	1	a	Awesome little game. Really addictive and a whole load of fun. You can't go wrong.
9623	1	a	Nice Arcade Shmup game with minimalistic but yet enough graphic effects. Game reminds of warblade but more advanced and less hectical. Beware of achievements though, most of them have to be made in a single run that means without saving the game.   
9625	1	a	Titan Attacks: Space Invaders, but better! That's the long n' short of it, minus the long.   So what is the long of it? Well...   Firstly, presentation! The game takes on an 8-bit  styled  aesthetic; The game's rather high res, but all graphics are styled in a blocky fashion with thick black outlines. Alongside this, particle effects are large pixels, and there's a bunch of filters and shaders on the game that make it look, um, arcade-y? Like, you've got scan lines, and a lot of things glow in this weird way as if you're, er, looking at a screen. It's hard to explain without just showing pictures of the game itself. There's also these more abstract effects where the game screen distorts or wraps around the the edges of the monitor; It was kinda cool the first few times it happened, but it did get on my nerves after a while. Thankfully, it only happens on menus, not during heated space battles, and you can toggle the various distortions off in the options menu (Options are Stroboscopics, Shader FX and Distortion FX).    There isn't a ton of music, but what's there is pretty jammin'. It's all techno, ranging from softer tracks, like during the main menu and shop, to more intense pieces during the actual stages. Stages are over pretty quick too, so it's never like you're listening to any one piece for an lengthy period of time, making them harder to get tired of. Still, there are audio sliders in the options menu for both sound effects and music in case you don't care for either. Might not wanna turn off sound effects though, as each hazard has it's own very distinct sound effect that'll keep you notified as to what's going on around you when things get more chaotic in the later stages; whether it's mines being laid, saucers flying across the top of the screen, or a charging laser beam, you'll more than likely need to keep an ear open for telltale signs of doom.    But enough of that, what about the actual game? Well, you control a tank going left and right across the ground and shoot aliens, most of which fire back at you and descend in some way or another. Occasionally you'll see a saucer flying at the top of the screen behind everything; it'll drop bonus-points, cash, shields, health, screen clearing bombs, or super cannons when you shoot it down, making the game a little easier on you if you can shoot it down. Alongside that, enemies have a chance to fall to the ground instead of exploding when you blast them, and you can shoot them again for a 'skill-shot' for extra points and money (Though they'll damage you if they crash into you). Alongside THAT, there's a chance that a martian will parachute out of the ship. These guys are a little trickier, 'cause you can pick them up for cash bonuses, but you can also accidentally kill them for no point/cash bonus, and if you don't pick them up, they escape and result in a cash deduction equal to the cash bonus you could've gotten otherwise.   With all these basic factors in play, alongside all of the hazards, battles become about good spacial awareness and quick decisions about what course of action should be taken: 'I could try and get that saucer for it's bonus, or I could catch that alien to keep me from losing money and get some bonus cash... The alien's floating over an area of heavy fire though... It might be more trouble than it's worth, and I won't get the saucer in time if I go to it. I don't want the cash penalty though... I think I'll kill it, then real quickly get the saucer.' Of course, if you don't make that rambling monologue of a decision quick, you'll be space dust. You'll have a lot to think about, and not a lot of time to think about it. Gotta be fast! All of this is helped by the fact that you move around by shifting the mouse left and right, so your speed is bound to how fast you can move it, and thus, is more or less infinite. This allows you to go mach 5 underneath low hanging projectiles and ships, making it possible to make those quick choices under the pressure and chaos of a full on martian assault.   In between stages is a shop to spend the money ya get, obviously, on health and weapons. There are repairs, which get more expensive the less damaged your tank is, screen clearing bombs, which get more expensive as you buy them through the game, cannon damage, cannon fire rate, add-ons (Other weapons), and add-on fire rate. It's pretty straight forward, and it's not like you have a whole lot of options, especially since you can't choose what add-ons you get (You purchase them in a specific order). Even then, the add-ons don't really change the gameplay too much; You've got left-side laser, right-side bigger-laser, left-side rocket launcher, and right-side laser beam. It all just kind of adds up to a large flurry of projectiles that don't add much of a tactical edge, but they're useful nonetheless.   The design of the different worlds were also very nice. Every twenty stages, after a boss fight with the mother ship of that world (Which, while fun, were never all that noteworthy), you go to the next planet: Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn, and finally, the alien home world of Titan. The changes of scenery were nice, but the new hazards were what really differentiated them. You see, this game, while being a Space Invaders homage, incorporates elements from other really old space games/shooters. Earth is simply Space Invaders, nothing more. Starting with the Moon stages, you'll be showered with neon blue asteroid outlines that split when you shoot them, which is a homage to... Well Asteroids. The Mars stages have their ships spin around in lines before taking formation for a short period of time, the dive bombing your tank, which is a homage to Galaga. I don't actually know what the Saturn stages homage; The idea behind those stages is that massive hordes of ships will descend from the top of the screen and try to collide with you before warping back to the top. Finally, Titan introduces these trains of enemies that go back and forth and split/drop stationary ships when you shoot them, which is how the Millipede in the game of the same name behaved. Every planet provided something new to keep the shooting more varied and interesting, and did so by providing tribute to some similar titles of gaming's history; I'd say it worked!   And for you score-junkies out there, the game doesn't have to end by the time you beat the 100th stage! After laying waste to Titan's flagship, you're instantly placed back at the first stage of the game with all of your upgrades, the same score, and more durable enemies. I think this goes on endlessly until you die, but I wouldn't know since I never made it to the end boss on the second run. Anyway, this allows you keep building that hi-score and show off on the global leaderboards; y'know, if you're into that.    I do have a few minor complaints, such as how there's no invincibility period when being hit, and how some stages have layouts that'll corner you very easily. Mix both factors together, and you've got a recipe for a near insta-death. It doesn't happen TOO often though, so whatever.   Anyway, I gotta wrap this up. It's a very nice looking and fun Score Attack/Space Invaders &amp; Friends inspired game. It's a bit on the pricey side for what it is though... I'd only really get it if it's in a bundle, on sale, or you know someone who's into the Score-Attack genre/Looking for a late 70's gaming nostalgia trip. In those cases, I'd really recommend it!   But in the end, it's all just my humble opinion. Cross-reference mine with others and see if it's a game for you.  Bottom Line: Titan Attacks is a game you get to shoot aliens and beat Admiral Nyaruko's 10 DIGIT SCORE. Jesus Christ, At least I'm in the top 10... For now... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9627	1	a	I wasn't expecting much from Titan Attacks, I figured it was just going to be another Space Invaders clone, and there have been so many of those over the years. But I do like PuppyGames' art style, and their games usually have a certain charm, so I decided to give it a try anyway.... and suddenly an hour had gone by without me even noticing. I can't say it's not a Space Invaders clone, because it absolutely and unabashedly is, but it's an extremely good one. Lots of fun.
9629	1	a	If you like an invaders type of game you will enjoy this.
9631	1	a	Fun, classic game with upgrade ability.
9633	1	a	Do you like space invaders? Want an updated/different take on it? Titan Attacks is basically just that. There are powerups, many enemy types. It's a modern verson of space invaders. It's really fun. The music is enjoyable, the sprites are easy to distinguish from the bullets (I rarely lost myself in the chaos). This game is a blast. However, don't bother investing any money if you're played out on space invaders. There isn't anything new fundementally. If you don't like the fundementals of the gameplay the bells and whistles will be meaningless. Hope this helps. Game on! :D
9635	1	a	Titan Attacks is a very fun and addictive game. It is almost like a modern take on Spack Invaders which works really well as they have added more to it which is implements in the game well.  + Great ark work which fits in very well to the style of the game  + Fun and addictive  + There is alot of replay value such as leaderboards and achievements  + Being able to upgrade your tank is a great feature which keeps you playing Titan Attacks  + The music fits in very well and has a big variety of songs  + The game is well worth the money and its easy to get a coupon so this game is well worth it  + Controls are simple as they should be which makes it easy to play  - You will find the game to be a bit dull arfter ten hours on gametime  - There are only a few maps to play on and they are very similer from each other  - You fell as if they should of added more to the game at times  Overall I think that Titan Attacks is a great game to play and is well worth the money. I am give it a 7/10. Its very fun but sometimes you want more.
9637	1	a	DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at  www.stanislavcostiuc.com.  I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.  Titan Attacks is a remake of the classic Space Invaders. On steroids. With upgrades and a big enemy variety, and by the end it gets so intense that it transforms into a bullet hell game. The distortion effects on the screen are very annoying though, but, luckily, you can turn them off. So, all in all, itâ€™s pretty cool. If you were into these classic games, or want to try out a modern (though still fairly faithful) take on said classic games, then you should try it out.  In fact, I think more classic games should get a modern take like Titan Attacks (which seems like what PuppyGames is doing anyway). â€¦ Hm. I think I just got inspiration for what kind of game my next side project should be. Thanks, PuppyGames!  Although, on a side-note, I have to say that due to all the upgrades you can get, and how many enemies there can be, the strategic value of having to time your shots well (which was present in Space Invaders and the beginning stages of Titan Attacks) gets diminished, which is somewhat saddening. On the other hand, the curve of starting with the more slow-paced and strategic Space Invaders and then transforming into a hectic bullet hell provides a nice flow and pace to keep you interested throughout all 100 waves (at least on the first playthrough before you start over with all your upgrades intact).  So, yeah. Titan Attacks. Not much more to say, really.
9639	1	a	Old school retro gaming remade for the 21st century. I like how they added more depth to a simple formula, but didn't lose any part of the original formula. Lots of fun.
9641	1	a	Just like the space invaders of old, but modernised. I love that old arcade classic, and I approve of what this game is doing and how it executed it.
9643	1	a	I don't play as many video games as I did 30 years ago when my kids were growing up. But once in awhile when I have the free time, I like to play something. Anyway, I was given this game as a gift, and I really like it. It is a lot like Space Invaders, but with nicer graphics. I like that I can upgrade the cannon. I would recommend it to anybody who remembers  playing Atari years ago.
9645	1	a	holey moley! when i got puppygames' ultrabundle i haven't expected the included space invaders clone to become my favourite of the four games. very addictive title with great visuals and audio. the ability to upgrade your ship between levels adds a nice feel of strategy when you're new to the game and a progressive motivation for the intermediate players.
9647	1	a	Space Invaders
9649	1	a	I'll start by saying this. 'I didn't like space invaders'. You can all call it what you will, but I thought it was fun for a quick bas, but nothing more than 30mins before the frustration sets in. Titan attacks is the re-imagined space invaders for the younger generation. After booting it up for the first time, the neon graphics took hold and determination set in to see just how much these developers wanted me to like there game. It has persistent upgrades to aim for, boss fights, different enemy types with differing attacks. It is essentially, it is still space invaders, just with a bit of makeup and sheeps fur. I have now played 10hrs and have fully enjoyed the experience. This coming from somebody who doesn't like space invaders! 8/10
9651	1	a	Space Invaders with nicer graphics 9.99Â£  10/10
9653	1	a	âœ” Good presentation âœ” DRM-free version exists âœ” GNU/Linux support.
9655	1	a	Back to childhood ^_^
9657	1	a	Who did this?! Who made this game so addicting?! What kind of person would do this to others? This is a sick world we're living in.  Great game though. 10/10
9659	1	a	A nice new take on Space Invaders / Shmup. Lots of very quick levels, upgradeable ship, smooth graphics. Good to pick up in the discounted Ultra Bundle.
9661	1	a	90's kids know it 2000's kids know it  The rebirth of one of the best games!   Titan atack  It is space invaders! But Better graphics! Upgrades! And Harder than it ever was! with multiple bosses!(I don't know how many... never passed the first one :c) And of course FUN!  6.8/10!
9663	1	a	Space Invaders with a few twists. Throws in Galaxian/Galaga type characters while you play in a Space Invaders manner.  WARNING!!!! MAY CAUSE A CASE OF 'MOUSE FINGER' (index finger cramp) AFTER PROLONGED USE!!!!!!!  Like Retro (Atari Days Retro)? Get it.  Hate the days of Atari? Might want to avoid.
9665	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
9667	1	a	I actually enjoy Titan Attacks a lot. There's just not much there to hook you to the game. I would certainly recommend at least considering Titan Attacks if it seems like something you might like.
9669	1	a	Awesome retro game!!!
9671	1	a	I kind of wish Steam allows us to give games ratings rather than a yes/no recommendation, but at least we get to make reviews now! So first off, I like all of Puppy Games products. They've got a consistent look-and-feel across the board, the visuals are a pleasant retro homage but not overly simplistic.  For Titan Attacks, I have to say it's not my favorite. I REALLY love Ultratron, which is a Robotron homage. Titan Attacks is a Space Invaders/Galaga/Galaxian arcade shooter homage. It does its job well, but I feel it has some imbalances:  1) You earn money (shooting enemies, capturing escaping aliens) to buy upgrades. However, as the game progresses it gets harder to capture escaping aliens. When they escape, you lose money. Eventually, you're caught in a cycle where you can only earn enough to keep yourself even and never progress to the higher upgrades. This isn't just that 'Oh hey it's harder because things are faster'. Often times you literally can not reach the escaping alien because there's barrier that will kill you if you do. I feel it'd be more balanced with some sort of change to that penalty. Either a lesser loss of money or losing points or reseting the bonus multiplier. Perhaps only losing money every other escape? But honestly, I found by the time I got to Saturn that 9 times out of 10, attempting to grab or even shoot the escaping alien was guaranteed to kill me and so I just had to sit and take the money penalty.  2) Unlike traditional Space Invaders, this is an arcade shooter where the collision detection isn't absolute. You're ship can actually brush up against enemy ships, bullets, etc. But it seems incosnsitent with how close you can get and varies depending on if its a bullet, an enemy, an enemy explosion, etc. I'd like to see some sort of indicator to show you're too close or something.  3) The bonuses dropped by a saucer when you shoot it are usually points or money, which is great. Sometimes it'll be a super shield or a super gun. In my experience, all too often this ends up being right at the ever end of the level when you least need it. Instead of those bonuses reseting at the end of the level, they should just run for a fixed period of time (5-10 seconds I suppose).  4) I hate the asteroids. And I hate you don't get any points or anything for shooting them. Not even a single $1 of money. :P  Despite these things, Titan Attacks is certainly not a bad game. It runs flawlessly for me. The visuals are great, the music keeps up pace with the action and it's got a huuuuge range of different kinds of enemies with unique appearances, behavior and attacks. It definitely keeps you surprised and alert as you progress. I feel the game would be even better with some tweaks to game play. 
9673	1	a	VERY amazing twist to Space Invaders.  I do recommend this game; however, be warned, it is fairly easy to beat.  After you beat the entire game, it will start you back at the beginning (while you can still pick up on any of your past levels at any time). BUT, this is good. Because of you missed any of the challenge mode achievements; you can go right back into achieving them.  Tons of fun. The ability to upgrade your ship is brilliant. The idea of especially the cash system overall is brilliant, and the saucer drops are brilliant.  This game was a brilliant creation, and is definitely worth the money if you are looking for an enjoyable game to let your mind get into.
9675	1	a	Space Invaders but better
9677	1	a	This riff on Space Invaders is a cool mashup, adding in Galaga-style patterns and other classic arcade riffs. If you're on a roll the game can last, but it's also great as a quick adrenaline rush. Lots of fun!
9679	1	a	the best in 'invaders' style...
9681	1	a	I love the modifications in this. All the titan games these guys made are a blast!
9683	1	a	Space Invaders, but better. Now, before you jump out of your chair and yell 'BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!', hear me out.  Titan Attacks! is a wonderful looking indie title. The story is rather simple and there's absolutely no way to truly spoil it. Aliens have attacked Earth and destroyed every single weapon on our planet, save for one tank - the one you, as the player shall control. Your task is to drive the aliens from Earth all the way to their home planet (technically a moon) and deal with them once and for all!  To make this mission (slightly) easier, you are given many purchasable upgrades in-between fights. Use the cash you earn to buy extra weapons for your tank, make your bullets do more damage or get a handful of borderline 'I WIN' button nukes.  The game is fast-paced and fun. It certainly isn't long, but it has quite a bit of replay value. Oh, it's cheap as well! I'd suggest getting it the next time you're looking for a new game to play - trust me, it's totally worth it.
9685	1	a	Very nice indie game, with nostalgic controls and gameplay resembling Space Invaders. Definitely a game you should get if you're a fan of Space Invaders, or just want a casual game to play offline.
9687	1	a	Simple fun... I did not expect much but at 50+ hours of gameplay it was worth the money (try to catch on sale).
9689	1	a	A really enjoyable take on the Space Invaders format, this time with upgrades and particles everywhere!   Despite playing it for a while I've yet to complete it, like a lot of these arcade format games their simplicity hides some really brutal difficulty but at very few points does it ever really feel unfair (bombs trapping you in a corner being the only notable annoyance).  Very good fun for when you want a quick, self contained game. Heartily recommended.
9691	1	a	I have been playing games made by this developer for six years now. I hold (at least, of right now) #22 and #44 in the worldwide leaderboard. I LOVE this game. Many developers try to make a retro game, and just ruin it. Puppygames has mastered this. The graphics are beautiful, the game is enveloping, and I love the ability to upgrade your tank. The difficulty is perfectly balanced. Also, some people complain about a teleporting glitch, but that is because they are using the mouse and WASD keys at the same time. Just use the mouse.
9693	1	a	To tell you the truth i had never heard of this game and i got a discount for it on steam. i was like you know what lets check it out. I go to the game and the video, didn't look too fun, but it was a big discount.  I WAS WRONG.  This space invaders/galaga style game with modern graphics and a beautiful array of alien ships and upgrades. Makes this game so fun to play. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, convince your friends to try and beat your high scores. Laugh as they try and fail because you are a god and they are mere peasants. Do it. Trust me.
9695	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
9697	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
9699	1	a	Bright cheerful little game that is a lot of fun to play. It's not going to set any records but it is the kind of game you will visit again and again in your idle moments. Basically, Space Invaders with bells, there are 100 levels, and as you play you buy upgrades to your gun turret. It's good fun all the way. I really can't think of anything they did wrong with this one. It's simple fun at it's best. Highly recommended.
9701	1	a	To tell you the truth i had never heard of this game and i got a discount for it on steam. i was like you know what lets check it out. I go to the game and the video, didn't look too fun, but it was a big discount.  I WAS WRONG.

9703	1	a	Its like Space Invaders and Tanks had babies and gave them Power Ups like a StarSoldier style. I reccomend ANYONE this game. Its Addicting funny when you kill certain aliens But also difficulty is just right for this kind of game. Plus it uses controller as well if you wanna use Controllers.
9705	1	a	hollywood version of space invaders. BADASS
9707	1	a	Great casual game. I find myself putting a few minutes of game time on this one almost daily. Something to consider when one remembers paying a quarter(Dollar now?) at the arcade for a couple of minutes of fun at best.
9709	1	a	Itâ€™s a game, about invaders, invaders FROM SPACE. You could almost call them space invaders.  Yeah, it is a Space Invaders clone but it is still very good. It starts out slow but as the game progresses and you acquire better and more powerful weapons it gets faster and more intense. By the last world the game becomes a bullet hell shooter with many, many enemies coming down on you and shooting at you.  I fully recommend this Titan Attacks.
9711	1	a	Space Invaders is by far my favorite Atari game of all time. Titan Attacks makes a very nice twist on it while adding various upgrades to choose from to make your guns more powerful and what not. it's a great game to go to when you need an intermision break from the primary game that you may be playing at the time. I am definately getting my moneys worth out of it.
9713	1	a	A nice new take on Space Invaders / Shmup. Lots of very quick levels, upgradeable ship, smooth graphics. Good to pick up in the discounted Ultra Bundle.
9715	1	a	Galaga with some zest.
9717	1	a	Absolutely brilliant shoot 'em up with retro graphics and soundtrack and especially highly addictive gameplay.
9719	1	a	Space Invaders, but better. Now, before you jump out of your chair and yell 'BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!', hear me out.  Titan Attacks! is a wonderful looking indie title.

9721	1	a	Very addictive, nice looking 'Space Invaders-esque' shooting game with the ability to upgrade your arsenals to go against armies of alien crafts. 100 levels with checkpoints (saves) everytime you beat all stages on each of the 5 planets may make it sound like an easy game, but the game beyond first playthrough disable the checkpoint and you're left to beat the high-score while trying to stay alive... now that's HARDCORE and I LOVE IT!
9723	1	a	this game is amazing!! brings back memories since i was a kid !! go for it !! it is the best arcade for our time
9725	1	a	You have to love these indie games, brilliant gameplay and retro graphics that you can't help but love...
9727	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
9729	1	a	A really cool Space Invaders style game. Puppygames are masters of modern retro styled games and although this one isn't my favourite from them it's still really playable and fun. You can upgrade your rig with all sorts of upgrades and attachments with cash you've collected. Definately worth playing.
9731	1	a	I only bought this game because I got a coupon for it. And now I have to say that I'm very glad about that coupon. This game is quite fun and you can spend a lot of time wth it. ItÃ„s especially good if you maybe just have little time and want to shoot something.
9733	1	a	Buy? Yes. A short and too the point arcade action title inspired by Space Invaders and Heavy Weapon. Lovable art style and rewarding gameplay. Nice little title to finish in a few hours.
9735	1	a	The game is indeed retro. One of the best shooter games I have ever played. It made me feel like a child again. :D Don't be scared by the 47 achievements. 100% is doable.
9737	1	a	Simple fun... I did not expect much but at 50+ hours of gameplay it was worth the money (try to catch on sale).
9739	1	a	Titan Attacks starts off really slow with a Space Invaders like pace, but ramps up quickly to something like Galaga on steroids. The screen is exploding in pixel fireworks after a few stages and upgrades to your little tank. Super fun neo-retro fixed screen shooter!
9741	1	a	It's a fun game! If you are interested - the trailer shows everything there is to know about the game.
9743	1	a	Amazing game! Although I suck, it's great especially for the sale price!
9745	1	a	Pleasantly surprised with the depth and variety in this angry, bomb-slamming space invaders game. A great companion to Ultratron (get that too). Pro tip: keep your eyes on the enemy, not on your ship and you'll hit 'em every time.
9747	1	a	Upgrades and fancy graphics definitely made space invaders better. The controls can be a little bit frustrating at times, but when you're used to it, and playing in full screen to avoid the mouse leaving the screen, it can be a lot of fun.
9749	1	a	If you've played Space Invaders (and who hasn't at some point?) then you already know what this game is about.   That said, it's not a direct clone. There are upgrades you can get, along with some special weapons.   Yeah, I know. This doesn't sound very exciting. Well, it's not the most thrilling game in the world, but it's cheap, easy to play (in that it requires virtually no time commitment), and has extremely low PC requirements. So it's a good little time waster, for those situations where you've got too much time to just sit around, but not enough time to play a more in-depth game.  Something else this game has -- that I really like -- is it saves your game whenever you exit, no matter where you are or what you're doing. It's more of a 'save state' in that your saved game is erased as soon as you load it. There are checkpoints are certain intervals, so if you die you don't need to start from the beginning (but you might have to redo a few levels).  If you've got young kids, this would be a good game for them as well. It's not overly complex and there's no adult themes to worry about.
9751	1	a	A fun little game that might just appeal most to old-timers who would appreciate the homage to arcade shooters. Space Invaders, Galaxian, and Galaga, of course, but also Centipede--by far the hardest levels. And throw in the occasional Asteroid.  Wonderful, bright (and yet dark?) graphics and simple, but satisfyingly wet and crunchy sound effects complete the package.  For the Achievers out there, don't be surprised to find you have completed over 50% of the achievements in a single, one-hour playthrough. Be aware that the save mechanic on Steam isn't at all like you'll read in the PSN guides. However it's not too hard to use the world-based checkpoints to quickly get to the challenge levels to perfect those. You'll likely want to fast-forward to Titan to have the best chance of grinding through the alien capture/escape achievements.

9755	1	a	- 7.5 / 10 -  Great adaptation of the classic Space Invaders. Retro / 80's style chunky pixels, yet nicely done with cool shader effects.   Another awesome wee gem by Puppy Games.
9757	1	a	If you're looking for a classic arcade action similar to Space Invaders, this is it. Not much else to say, but it's a good coffee break game!
9759	1	a	Retro style, almost like space invaders. A fresh spin on an older game style.
9761	1	a	This game is well worth the price on sale. The game is well polished, easy to pick up and fun to play. The game is quick to finish, I've managed to 100% the game in 7.7 hours and after that there is not much left to do.
9763	1	a	Space Invaders as it should be. Great design. Mindless, emjoyable. Well done.
9765	1	a	Nostalgia city with this game. A retro arcade 2-D shooter that's super fun and addicting to play. The pixelated aesthetic of the game brings back memories and is a refreshing trip down memory lane you didn't know you wanted until you play it. It's simplistic in every way, but a blast to play none the less. Give it a go! It's a new age space invaders you know you want to try!
9767	1	a	Let's get down to Brass Tax. Titan Attacks warrants a TRUE RECOMMENDATION! This evolution of 'Space Invaders' may start out slow and simple, but then it starts to reveal its true greatness! Like Space Invaders 95, this one ramps up the cool and offers customizations ala' 'Ultratron!' I got a Puppygames bundle including all their titles for 60% off during a Steam sale. If it comes to that price again, MAKE SURE TO PICK IT UP!
9769	1	a	If you liked Space Invaders you will like this, there's a bunch of ship upgrades to buy and increase your firepower in different ways. The art style is cool. On my 2nd game I got into the #33 position of the leaderboards, so the game isn't that hard. The difficulty curve is kinda random, some stages are way harder than others because of all the stuff in the screen and the enemies bombing you, shotting you and coming down to you. For 1â‚¬ you can't go wrong.
9771	1	a	If you're looking for a classic arcade action similar to Space Invaders, this is it. Not much else to say, but it's a good coffee break game!
9773	1	a	Perfect time waster, old mechanics injected with new content. Very well executed.
9775	1	a	A game in which some really big things start destroying stuff. Nothing more to say about this title.
9777	1	a	Very nice little timekiller that reminds me of galaga big plus for me is that i can play it mouse only, the game has a very retro oldschool feel to it in a nice way the graphics fit this game very good  nice powerup system you can upgrade for example your shields between levels and if you get hit you can add shield again later on after the level, if you get hit you loose some so you need to :) same goes for the rest so there is a reason to score you want the cash for your upgrades very nicely done  9/10

9781	1	a	Not as great as Ultratron, but still a good take on the Space Invaders formula.
9783	1	a	simple, fun, not easy, but not impossible!! how fast are your fingers? this takes space invaders to a whole new level....im glad this is in my library!
9785	1	a	Space invaders! Its a great game to have on the side but you probably wont put endless hours into it. It does have upgrades but its not very strategic, you would probably pick the most obvious ones. This game is already cheap but would be a great deal onsale
9787	1	a	This game is addictive and fun. Among the other awsome games by Puppygames, this one is my favorite. I enjoy playing this simple, yet fun and addictive game whenever im not feeling like playing shooters and other more complex games. Controls are easy all you need is your mouse. Graphisc are awsome. In conclusion this game helps me relax. I recommend it.
9789	1	a	I know what you're thinking: 'Oh it's just another dumb reboot to an old arcade game!' Well, not exactly. While Titan Attacks! shares various similarities with Space Invaders and Galaga, It's more than that. As you progress through the different stages (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn, etc.), You fight a plethora of enemies with different mannerisms whilst building up your funds to upgrade your ship for even more alien-shooting. Pretty addicting if you ask me. Although, there are a few drawbacks. One is that [on keyboard and mouse], Not only does the mouse move your ship, the WASD keys do too. This can make it difficult for players who move their mouse quite a bit when playing games that require it, as just a slight nudge of the mouse will send your ship into a flurry of death and despair.I have lost many a-shield trying to deal with htis problem. It might just be incredibly easy to fix in an options menu that i'm too lazy to check, but as most gamers do, I just went straight to the gameplay. I did see the notice, but didn't expect how highly sensitive the mouse was.  Well, i should stop ranting now. 9/10 Would play again and again. One of my favorite time-killing games to date!
9791	1	a	A reboot of the old arcade style games. Titan Attacks really delivers on it's simple form of fun with great music and visuals.
9793	1	a	I got this in a humble bundle and I'm glad I did! This is a good retro themed game, pretty fun!
9795	1	a	Surprised me a lot, fun as hell and the music is very nice too. +1
9797	1	a	        YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Steam Cleaning - Titan Attacks&nbsp;
9799	1	a	This game is fun, challenging. It could get a little repetitive. I recommend this game only if its on sale. $10.00 seems pretty steep for this game. I will give it an 8/10.
9801	1	a	Brutally augmented Space Invaders.
9803	1	a	It's space invaders.  Kind of fun though.
9805	1	a	I love this game. I've finished it but it's great to play through and try to get the perfection achievements.
9807	1	a	        YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Steam Cleaning - Titan Attacks&nbsp;
9809	1	a	Brutally augmented Space Invaders.
9811	1	a	suprisingly fun game... didn't expect to enjoy this game.
9813	1	a	Awesome litttle mini game based on the Space Invaders format. Might give you a headache after a few hours of playing though.
9815	1	a	Another excellent release from Puppygames.   More than just 'Space Invaders meets Galaga', this top quality shooter features well-honed controls, upgrades, power-ups, an awesome soundtrack and beautifully-realized graphics.  Titan Attacks! plays well enough on Android, but better on PC with a full-sized keyboard.  - Skinny from the Fat B*stard  (curator link) 
9817	1	a	I love this game. It's fast-paced frantic fun, and quite a good update on the old Space Invaders formula. Sometimes enemy ships will plummet to the surface instead of exploding, sometimes they will drop alien parachuters who you can catch for money, or shoot in mid-air, there are bonus waves, there are bosses, there are upgrades, and the games only last roughly 30 minutes unless you're really bad or really good.  Definitely worth 5 bones.
9819	1	a	Space Invaders in new view and really adicting!!!But awesome!!!:)
9821	1	a	Great little game. Short but cheap. Fun but difficult. If you want a small fun and challenging game you can play every now and then for a few minutes, this might be OK.
9823	1	a	An enjoyable old school style game, It has elements that'll remind you of Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender and Phoenix. That's if your old enough to remember those games, Whether you do or not this is an addictive fun way to whittle away those rainy days.
9825	1	a	This is an excellent modernized version of Space Invaders. If that's what you're looking for, this is definitely worth picking up. If you're like me, however, you won't get a lot of replayability out of it. I beat the game on my second attempt, got 33rd on the online leaderboard on my third attempt and only have achievements that require more repetitive playtime left. So if you're decent at this type of game, you'll probably get 3 hours or so out of it before losing interest, unless you are really into chasing high-scores. Regardless, this is a great take on Space Invaders and might be worth picking up on sale.
9827	1	a	I play this game off and on every so often. It's one of those fun little games that you can pick up and play at anytime. 
9829	1	a	79/100
9831	1	a	The Great Attacks
9833	1	a	Space Invaders on Steroids  10/10
9835	1	a	Space Invaders. 'Nuf said.
9837	1	a	I play this game off and on every so often. It's one of those fun little games that you can pick up and play at anytime. 
9839	1	a	Awesome Space Invaders-style shooter. Lot of variety between levels.
9841	1	a	You know, at first glimpse this game seemed to be overpriced but as you get into the game it is thorougly enjoyable and fun. 10/10 would tank again! I know this may be a bit of a knock off of space invaders but seriously I dont give a poop its just so fun to play, you can even upgrade your tank! OOOOOOHH
9843	1	a	Need to kill time? Space invaders on steroids, Do it.
9845	1	a	it's basically a spin-off of space invaders with thier own little twist, btw it's addicting as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
9847	1	a	WTF are you reading this, buy the game already, you wont regret it.
9849	1	a	Mmmmm......Retro Shmup!  I would buy anything from Puppygames, I &lt;3 their games!
9851	1	a	I'm a sucker for new takes on arcade classics. Titan Attacks! is like Space Invaders, except it's pretty, has character upgrades, and features unique bosses. So it's Space Invaders, but better.
9853	1	a	Great game, would buy again
9855	1	a	This game is a passtime game that can be more fun than most games for some reason, dont know why but its made perfectly and I would recomend this to anyone but even more so to retro minigame fans
9857	1	a	As the last surviving tank commander on Earth, single-handedly turn back the evil invading alien army, drive back the Titans across the Solar System, and defeat them on their homeworld...  Titan Attacks has the same easy-to-learn and addictive gameplay of the classic arcade shoot 'em up, but is packed full of extras - new features, new strategies, and stylish neo-retro visuals.  Battle swarms of alien fighters, bombers and giant boss motherships, over 5 unique worlds and 100 levels of frantic action. Earn bounty money and upgrade your ship with extra cannon, rockets and lasers. Destroy falling wrecks, dodge hurtling asteroids and capture escaping aliens - or blast them from the skies! Win prizes in sharp-shooter challenge stages and compete on the online Hi-Scores table!
9859	1	a	THIS GAME IS EXTREME!!!  YOU DONT EVEN KNOW HOW EXTREME IT IS!!?  ITS SO EXTREME, IT MAKES TEA FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER WHILE IT FIGHTS A SHARK!!  IT THEN THROWS THE TEA INTO AN ALIENS FACE, THEN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S YOUR GRANDMOTHER!!!!  EXTREME!!!!!!
9861	1	a	Im a big fan of old school arcade games, such as Galaga, and seeing this made me instantly buy it, which was a good idea on my part. I enjoyed this game. It had clean and crisp graphics for a pixel,and 2D shooter game that is, and later on in the game you encounter new enemies and bosses to spice up the gameplay, it also becomes more of a challenge and almost forces you to think on what upgrades you should buy with the money you saved... which is what I like about the game.   All in all, I Loved the game. It had a mix of challenge and strategy, along with tiny things to spice the game up and give it a bit of variety. The only thing I'd like to see is improved controller support, and maybe even specific missions. :)
9863	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
9865	1	a	Space invaders with upgrades.It's pretty good.
9867	1	a	Addictive old-skool shoot-em-up with cool retro graphics and pumpin music. Ship upgrades add a nice level of depth and let you try different strategies.
9869	1	a	Titan Attacks! really works as a retro style space shooter. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything looks and plays great. Who wouldn't have fun blowing up alien invaders with a super-powered and fully upgradable tank? This game reminds me of the classic arcade sh*t. And that's a good thing.
9871	1	a	Old skool space invaders clone thingy.
9873	1	a	very fun and addictive, the best space invader. 
9875	1	a	I'm a sucker for new takes on arcade classics. Titan Attacks! is like Space Invaders, except it's pretty, has character upgrades, and features unique bosses. So it's Space Invaders, but better.
9877	1	a	Nothing much to say about this one. It's a Space Invaders clone, featuring new stuff that doesn't seem like Space Invaders on later levels, but a whole different bullet hell shooter game. The game has 5 worlds, and 100 enemy waves. You get to upgrade your gunpower, your shields, add Smartbombs, extra cannons (Plus a laser blaster and a rocket launcher.) and the amount of bullets in screen. You better start off upgrading the amount of bullets, cause accidentally shooting and waiting for it to go through the whole screen is really boring. And might get you killed depending on the situation. The soundtrack is good. You can use a keyboard, controller or even the mouse itself. Controls are so simple you can use a MOUSE.  tl;dr version: It's Space Invaders. With Upgrades. And more speed. And more gun. And it's good. Buy it. It's cheap.
9879	1	a	very fun and addictive, the best space invader. 
9881	1	a	Byotiful.  Absolutely byotiful.
9883	1	a	the game is space invaders, but with that awesome puppygames or whatever awesomeness into it, the music amazing has always, and is a challange the more you move forward, but somewhat easy considering the 2Âº time I play it, I not only beat the final boss, but was able to get the 56Âº score on the online top 100, under the name 'ALL BUSINESS*, but the game is worth, and a huge thanks for my friend (current name at time of post) Icy-Spicy for gifting it to me *huggles and wuvs &lt;3*
9885	1	a	If your a fan of Space Invaders than this is the game for you.  Think of this as Space invaders MK.2 on LSD. The music is good and the graphics are enough to keep me playing alone. The game play is solid and continues to get more difficult as levels progress. There are Bosses and tons of levels.  For $10 you cant go wrong (but I got this game for 50 cents with a coupon :3), still would have paid full price for it though 
9887	1	a	Ahhhhhhhh... the late 70's/early 80's... anyone here remember these names: Boot Hill, Asteroids, Berserk, Centipede, Defender, Galaga... and of course... SPACE INVADERS. Seriously... how can ANY old gamer that remembers what a real arcade is NOT love this game? It is Space Invaders on 'roids. And if you can't hear the balls being racked behind you, the air hockey puck slamming into the goal slot over in the far corner, or the relentless march music of the Space Invaders descending on you... you graduated after '87 and I don't wanna talk to you. :D
9889	1	a	Fun Arcade game to play on and off
9891	1	a	Nobody told me we needed a Space Invaders clone.
9893	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
9895	1	a	Titan Attacks! is a great game that you can play for ages or just in small 5 - 10 minute bursts. Its a arcade style shooter along the line of old style games like Centipede. It has a steep learning curve and does get chaotic in parts but there is a sweet sense of acomplishment when you do beat each level.
9897	1	a	Great retro game. A hommage to the classic Space Invaders
9899	1	a	Beautiful game to have a good time!
9901	1	a	Simple and really fun! GO PLAY IT!
9903	1	a	Really takes people back to the days where you would go to an arcade and play games like Space invaders. really awsome game.
9905	1	a	Wonderful old school touch, kinda overloaded on certain levels. But enjoyable.
9907	1	a	Lovely game, What a lovely game! :)
9909	1	a	Twisted Space Invider.
9911	1	a	A bit expensive but loads of fun
9913	1	a	This game take the old invaders games to a whole new level. Super fun and addictive.........BUY IT NOW!
9915	1	a	Good ol' space invaders with a sweet artstyle and nifty features. 8/10
9917	1	a	Remake of the classic Space Invaders. Puts your reaction skills on the line. Good looking visuals and a compelling soundrack combined with exact controls makes this a wonderful experience. Great replay value to increase your score or try another upgrade strategy. Enjoyed it a lot.
9919	1	a	This game is a very fun take on Space Invaders and is a very fun casual game that will keep you entertained while you play it. Keep in mind that it is NOT meant to be played for long periods of time each time you sit down and play it. Most likely, you'll only play it for 30 minutes to 2 hours every time you decide to play it, but over all the times you play it, you should easily get your moneys' worth with this game.  The game itself is very fun and exciting to play, and when you get really far, you feel really accomplished because this game is not that easy by any shade of the imagination! You have to be GOOD at this game if you want to win :)  The achievements are a nice touch as well :)  Overall, if you like Space Invaders, you'll love this game, and it is definitely worth it, although maybe not at full price. Wait until it is on sale and then get it :)
9921	1	a	Titan Attacks is just Old School. When I want to get challenged I play this game. You have your rage moments but when you win you feels epic. This game is SUPER cheap and worth it! I don't know how you can't have it &gt;.&lt;
9923	1	a	awesome game if you got some free time on your hands. plus its extremely addictive and fun for playing when you get bored and don't know what to play. so i hope you have a good time playing it.
9925	1	a	Perfect time killer! I can keep coming back to this game again and again. There's not much to tell... it's a space invader's remake... but it adds a lot of features like upgrading your tank and boss fights.
9927	1	a	It's Space Invaders evolved &amp; it's not pulling any punches. The game sticks with the oldtime graphics from the atari days, but adds upbeat music with challenging gameplay. A must for any retro-gamer.
9929	1	a	A walk through the history of top-down shooters starting with Space Invaders and progressing through Galaga and Centepede with some Asteroids thrown in for good measure. Well put together both visually and aurally, it's only weakness is in its simplicity. Overall worth checking out for the fan of old-school stand up arcade games.
9931	1	a	I like this game.
9933	1	a	Byotiful.  Absolutely byotiful.
9935	1	a	***** blast bombs then enjoy it
9937	1	a	It's like space invader super classic you can upgrade though and play tons of levels!
9939	1	a	Nothing much to say about this one. It's a Space Invaders clone, featuring new stuff that doesn't seem like Space Invaders on later levels, but a whole different bullet hell shooter game. The game has 5 worlds, and 100 enemy waves. You get to upgrade your gunpower, your shields, add Smartbombs, extra cannons (Plus a laser blaster and a rocket launcher.) and the amount of bullets in screen. You better start off upgrading the amount of bullets, cause accidentally shooting and waiting for it to go through the whole screen is really boring. And might get you killed depending on the situation. The soundtrack is good. You can use a keyboard, controller or even the mouse itself. Controls are so simple you can use a MOUSE.  tl;dr version: It's Space Invaders. With Upgrades. And more speed. And more gun. And it's good. Buy it. It's cheap.
9941	1	a	New age Galaga. Extremely entertaining and very addicting. Leaves you frustrated and satisfied at the same time. Good buy.
9943	1	a	Space Invaders for 2012! Well, it should be, but there's too much of a good thing going on here. As the game is full of unlocks, such as smart-bombs, extra cannons, firing rate increases, shields, etc - it can all get a little too chaotic.   The devs would do well to take a leaf out of Popcap's book here with their Bejeweled games and Zen Mode. Such modes are geared far more towards a casual and 'relaxing' play through of the game - than a hectic, luck riddled blast. Titan Attacks should have a pure, Space Invaders clone-type mode.  The biggest criticism of the game however, is the lack of save point as you progress. Rather than the game saving each mini campaign as you progress from the Earth, onto the Moon and onwards - once you die you have to redo the entire mini campaign again. It's massively draining and frustrating in equal measure and I very much doubt I'll see the game through because of it. The stress simply isn't justified to reach the end! 5.5/10
9945	1	a	Lots of fun. Has a great sound track to it as well.
9947	1	a	its like space invaders on crack, and you get mega upgrades!
9949	1	a	Titan Attacks! is a blatant Space Invaders rip-off, but it's a really good one! The game has gorgeous, retro-themed graphics and effects, local and online leaderboards, controller support, upgrades, achievements and Steam trading cards... and all of this comes with a budget-title pricetag! Anyone who likes a good, ol'-fashioned arcade-style shooter should consider getting this game!
9951	1	a	Classic Space-Invaders / Galaga with cool mouse control system, definitely worth buying for some hours of extreme fun
9953	1	a	It's space invaders 2000 edition.
9955	1	a	A great Space Invaders homage. Lots of levels, 5 words, and upgrades for your defensive ship/tank thingy. 'Tis a winner, this one.
9957	1	a	Ah, remember the good ol's SNES game Space Invaders? I mean, who doesn't? This game certainly brings to life the very thrill of shooting down aliens who are slowly decending towards you while also blasting lasers down at you but with more flash and bang for the pixelated buck. Upgrades and a progressively tougher set of foes make this game fun all the way to the end. And the boss battles? Oh, they are quite the challenge.  I'd recommend this game if you have some hours of time to kill while saving humanity from impending alien invasions. It's better than zombies, afterall.  9/10
9959	1	a	From the creators of Revenge Of The Titans, here is a nice tribute to space invaders, with a design style that I can't get enough of. You progress through various stages and planets with a short description of your mission; which is of course to SAVE THE WORLD. As you progress you build a score as well as a bank in which to use for buying upgrades. Upgrades include weapons, armor, screen clearing bombs, and more. Each planet is finished with a boss who may, or may not, be trying to destroy you. It's a great casual experience that you can walk away from and it will be right where you left off when you come back. The best part is if you die, you return to the beginning of the planet you were on! Yes, you do get set back a bit but it's a nice surprise to not having to start entirely over! So if you liked Space Invaders, you should definitively get this game. Shoot those laser bullets, destroy those aliens, capture and/or kill the ones who try to escape, defend those planets, and win!
9961	1	a	Fun re-imagining of space invaders, where you get to upgrade your gun/tank/turret and choose what upgrades to use.
9963	1	a	A very good remake of the classic Space Invaders game. Starts out a little slow and ends up being perhaps too hard. Great game to spend a few hours playing.
9965	1	a	Twisted Space Invider.
9967	1	a	This game is an update/love letter to Space Invaders (itself still an enjoyable arcade classic). It adds a money/xp system with upgrades, more enemy variety, and smooth control. It's perfect for scratching the itch you get when you want to play something old school and arcadey like Space Invaders, Galaga, or Phoenix.  Also check out Ultratron, which is a similar update to Robotron.
9969	1	a	A very simple premise: Make Space Invaders for modern gaming. Mission accomplished in spades. A perfect game for casual, retro gaming.
9971	1	a	The game defaults to windowed, but allows your mouse to stray out of the window. This is super annoying. Rest of the game is good, though. Will play again.
9973	1	a	A modern day Space Invaders. Not the prettiest but quite good.
9975	1	a	This game is so damn hard, my god. Get it on sale.
9977	1	a	Okay...the trailers give you all the info you need. And yes, it's just as fun to play. It's basically space invaders with a wider variety of enemies (which makes it play like centipede or a bullet hell shooter at a few later levels) and some item upgrades. It's not the most complex game on steam, but it's absolutely fun. :-)  (note: I had some issues getting this thing to properly work on fullscreen. At first, it didn't properly register my mouse, meaning my ship couldn't go all the way to the right. On windowed mode, it could happen that your pointer accidentally went 'off screen', meaning you suddenly dragged the game window around. In the end, I set the .exe to start at 640x480 resolution. It works, but looks more retro than it's supposed to ;-) ).
9979	1	a	Nobody told me we needed a Space Invaders clone.
9981	1	a	bring back the memoriesof the nes era....this is what all games are all about....fun...
9983	1	a	If you enjoyed Space Invaders back in the day, and would enjoy the added bonus of power-ups in such a game, then this game is for you. Simple, colorful, proper challenge-to-advancement ratio, and most importantly: Fun to play. For the type of game that it is, I would give this a 10/10. -70sG
9985	1	a	Titan Attacks! really works as a retro style space shooter. From the graphics to the gameplay, everything looks and plays great. Who wouldn't have fun blowing up alien invaders with a super-powered and fully upgradable tank? This game reminds me of the classic arcade sh*t. And that's a good thing.
9987	1	a	Fun 'Space Invaders' inspired shooter that throws so many enemies and gets so fast it is almost unplayable without stimulants.
9989	1	a	better than the original in every way endless things to kill
9991	1	a	Cute and fun Space Invaders ripoff.

9997	1	a	Mix space invaders and galaga with moderna graphics (pixelated, yes, but watch closely) and playability and you get this addictive game
9999	1	a	Simple and really fun! GO PLAY IT!
