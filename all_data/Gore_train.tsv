37	1	a	  I think its a nice game. It's true that there is no one playing online but i think that if people talk about it and really put time into this game they would like it. Nice shooter and zombie combination. You should try it for yourself. I didn't play for long but i already see the potential.

53	1	a	My grandpa runs better than this game and hes dead. 10/10 original joke.
55	1	a	Having a really good time playing this game! It's just the senseless silly fun that we all need in a game sometimes! See what I mean here         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  #Worth?! Ep.42 - Zombie Playground (Gameplay / Review)&nbsp;
57	1	a	The game is fun, the only problem is that im laggin with 60-90 fps. in addition to the camera being jittery makes it hard to play.
59	1	a	it's a nice game fun to play, even alone.  
61	1	a	I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character. This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate.The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself. To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion. The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developersâ€”there is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion.At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes. While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enoughâ€”in fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to doâ€”there are other aspects of the game that are downright rough.Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are.Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights. There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them. The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart.While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience.
63	1	a	Remember that horror flick titled The Omen? I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it.  Lucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen. You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil. Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives. This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections. So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue.  And that is the point here. We cause accidents. Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person. I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason. Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting. A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family.  Anyway, I do not want to spoil it. The game has very nice graphics and memorable music. I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season. This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring. Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role.  Later on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control. To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game. I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit. In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution.  The game has some flaws, though. For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do. Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful. Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?  I am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best. I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen. 
65	1	a	Quite possibly the most evil game ever created.  Bravo for another Indie developer.   This game is something else even though it's a familiar genre. As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others. Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you.   Anyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here. This could easily be made into a movie. You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents. You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff.   You play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters).The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did).   This game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing. You have to read between the lines. You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target. It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom. After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on.   You also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents. As far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome. The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak).   One thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself.......There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls. These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell). So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks.   The story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the 'freak accidents' get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission. Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game. This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least.   The last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking. In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio. If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment. That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales. So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all.
67	1	a	A perfect gift for all your christian friends
69	1	a	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie â€œThe omen.â€ The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.     As far as the story goes, Lucius, the devil's son, murders members of his household, making them look like accidents. The Devil approaches you once in awhile, to congratulate you, as well as provide useful abilities or to demand better sacrifices. Over time, the means to kill your target, become harder and more arbitrary. After killing most of the live-ins, you will progress to start killing family members, leading up to the final chapter.     The gameplay revolves around checking notes, listening to people, doing chores on occasion, and finding a way to kill your target. The player will always be in the same house, and never leave it, becoming boring over time. The house, overall, has a creepy feel to it, fitting properly into the story, however becoming dull rather quickly. The player will spend time in three main areas of the house, with a lot of unexplored areas.     The art style, although aged at the time of this review, is still present; dark, creepy and mysterious. The sound and music in Lucius come across perfectly, trying to add to the creepy atmosphere. The Voice Acting is well done, by most of the cast. Some characters are more convincing than others but no character really stands out as a â€œBad sounding characterâ€.    The game can be confusing at times, with the ingame hints being extremely arbitrary. The game isn't overly linear, making the game a tad harder to progress, and may be frustrating. With hundreds of hints and walkthroughs online, makes completing the game very easy, however if you are the type of gamer that refuses to look things up online it may take a long while before you complete all the chapters. I Myself only looked online when it came to the final â€œBoss fightâ€.    Lucius did a lot of things right:     The sound and voices in game is solid   The cutscenes are gruesome and fantastic   The achievements are rather easy, if you plan ahead   Lucius is an enjoyable character   Lucifer is the best sounding, and most interesting character   The kills are satisfying      Lucius does a few things wrong     Massive map with spread out objectives   Can be very glitchy   Can be boring if lost or confused   May be frustrating to some players    can be to easy or to hard depending on skill level     Overall, lucius is a good game, it has its bugs and problems but can be very enjoyable. I killed almost 10 hours alone just playing the story, and i still got over 70% of the achievements by accident. Is it worth the $10.99CAD pricetag? That depends on if you enjoy either hunting achievements or are a fan of the genre. Although different from â€œThe Omenâ€ it's still very similar and fans of the movie will most likely enjoy it. Pick it up on sale sometime and give it a play.

61	0	a	Really wanted to like this game. Thought the setup was great.   Pros  - Decent story - Interesting concept  Cons  - Bugs that cause you to restart whole chapters - Memory wipe power was worthless - Sometimes obscure pieces to the puzzle - Very linear - Chore concept could have been better - lose suspicion allowing more flexibility for being a 'good boy' - House design is a little poor - takes some time to figure out where everything is - Would have preferred using powers to make others do terrible things on their own instead of just killing them outright - Some controls like Telekinesis and the tricycle are clunky. Same with final encounter mechanics  Kept waiting for the game to shine and it just never did. Can't recommend.
73	1	a	good game, although the 'deaths' are scrpited, could be better if you chose the way you killed your victims.
75	1	a	As a fan of The Omen movies, I immediately bought this game desipite the so-so reviews.   Yes, as a quality game it fails in some ways. The graphics are pretty bad and I thought I was looking at a Halflife 2-era game because it looked like something off the Source engine.   There also isn't a lot of freedom to trap setting because once you find the solution that's it. It's basically an adventure game.   Now that the bad is out of the way, the concept is so awesome and the deaths are so unbelievably cruel and gruesome that it's a memorable experience. I would wait until it goes on sale, however.   
77	1	a	Game name: Lucius Game score: 8/10 Reviewed by: Wolf   In Summary...
62	0	a	A great idea, executed in a not-so-great way. That is Lucius, a horror-focused action adventure.  So, the idea is great; a free roam game where you get to kill people like in those famous horror movies we've all seen. You'll be using items and powers to kill off these people. It's not all that straightforward though. You have to solve little puzzles to complete objectives. And every time you complete one of these objectives you're one step closer to killing a certain someone.  But it's all executed in a mediocre way; the inventory is cumbersome to use, but manageable. The 'stealth' missions are terrible; there's no way to see where a certain character is so you'll bump into someone frequently. And sometimes the hints you get just aren't clear enough, which results in you doing the wrong thing. And when it's Game Over you have to start the mission all over again (including sidequests).  It's an interesting idea though. And I would love to see a(n improved) sequel someday.  [Rating: 65/100]
79	1	a	10/10
81	1	a	Its like a Hitman Game but as a little kid with supernatural powers :D  Took me around 5.5 hours to beat the story  HOW MUCH BETTER COULD IT GET :D  10/10 Would recommend getting it on Sale
83	1	a	This is one seriously twisted game. The graphics are good looking and smooth but the gameplay is limited despite the undeniable pleasure of randomly killing just about everyone you come across in a variety of inventive ways. It will never be a classic but it's certainly worth a look if you can pick it up cheap. 60%
85	1	a	Finally a game where i can be the bad guy. Its rare to see a game like this. The voice acting is a little weird at times while the faces have little to no expression to them. You get to be a little demonic fuker going around killing everyone. Achievements are easy enough aslong as you try. Some of these deaths are really brutal, which i love. 10/10 Everyone should try this game.
63	0	a	I don't have 9 hours on this, I left it idling while going to get pizza. I bought this for 2 dollars. I did, however, beat this game in 4 hours.  If anyone were to find this game enjoyable, it would be myself. I am a huge fan of the hitman franchise, puzzle games, and being an edgy powerful spawn of satan that can manipulate people and burn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with his/her mind. I expected this to be an open ended puzzle game with many solutions to every mission (offering replayability) that slowly worked up to a Carrie-esque climax when your power reaches an apex.  This was not the case.   Reasons:  1. Every mission can only be solved one way. Past the 7th mission, [almost] every mission is solved by simply manipulating people to kill themselves. Most missions are either too easy or pseudo-difficult by not allowing you to use your satan given powers for unexplained reasons. Some missions are so unbelievably easy that it can take quite a few minutes to figure out because you need to take a moment and stop thinking creatively.  2. At your most powerful, a priest with a looped cliche voiceline 'The power of christ compels you' can 'game over' you in the matter of seconds. Same goes for a man with a fire extinguisher. Aparently, satan's child can be killed by a swift whack to the face with a fire extinguisher. Oh and god forbid satan's son got surrounded by fire because OF COURSE you can't walk through it. Same goes for locked doors.  3. The game does not play smoothly. In order to open a door, you must have the 'hand' ability equiped instead of any of the other powers given to you. Every action just enables another animation/cutscene. This makes you feel separated from the character entirely and everything feel like a chore. Might as well actually get off the computer and pace a large â™¥â™¥â™¥ mansion looking for some super glue... the graphics in real life are better.  4. There was absolutely no attention to detail. The developers were obviously very lazy as they did not fix/add simple things. Uncomfortable pauses in voice acting, clipping, glitching, dull gore, the list goes on. One of the most lazy moments: When people see you using a power, you are spotted and it's a game over which makes sense but at one point, a person who is trying to kill you knows that you are a spawn of satan and you can still get a game over by them seeing you use a power in order to defend yourself. I suppose the developers simply forgot to remove this feature at this part in the game. This is probably because it is near the end and none of them could actually bring themselves to play this far.  5. The story is    The Omen    how original!  6. The side quests are so dull the developers didn't expect anyone to actually do all of them. Well guess what â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s, I did. I did all of your boring side missions. I did them because they unlocked items in game! However, this is only true for the first three or four chores. After this, the developers couldn't come up with any more easter eggs/items to use. Imagine doing a tedious side quest in an RPG only to be prompted with 'No more awards available' after you ran Dr.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥head's Bread all the way to Fort Shimbles!  7. Even the achievments are lazy.  8. Finally, the developers were lazy which completely makes the game unenjoyable.  The moral of the story, don't give these lazy â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs even two dollars of your money because they may possibly devote their profits toward ruining another good game idea!
87	1	a	Child of the Devil...
64	0	a	Lucius is a third-person adventure/puzzle game, in which you play as Lucifer's son and murder everyone in the manor you live in. The concept is interesting, since it's kinda like reverse horror, but unfortunately the execution is poor.   The gameplay is pretty much just murdering the people in the house in a certain order and in a pre-determined way and watching a cutscene showing the murder. After the murder cutscene you get a new cutscene, which usually involves a detective, who is put on the case after your first murder. The game could have easily been a point-and-click game, because you just look for items and after using the right items you watch the murder commence.  The game let's you free roam around the fairly big manor between the murders, but there isn't much to do aside from some 'fetch quests' called chores and looking for items needed in future murders. After doing enough chores you get some items, of which 2 just give hints for the murder puzzles and the last one is a tricycle. The tricycle let's you move around the manor a bit faster and also let's you use a glitched staircase to get out of the house.   After each murder you get a new superpower or upgrades to the ones you already have. The game has 4 superpowers: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase and combustion. You will need all those superpowers for the murder puzzles and while you can use some of them for other purposes, they're not really fun. The combustion power is also used in the boss battles the game has and also in some extra mini-game, which seemed to involve priests chasing you (a child) with crosses in a dark forest. I didn't like the boss battles or that mini-game at all, because the combustion power isn't fun and felt a bit clunky to use.  Graphics-wise the game looks pretty good for an indie game, but the devs decided to occasionally use some post-processing effects, which actually made the game look a bit uglier. The lip-syncing seemed to be a bit off, but it didn't really bother me. The voice acting ranged from pretty good to quite awful. The game also has a pretty badly done sex, which looks quite funny as a result and there's some frontal 3D nudity as well.   The story and dialogue is pretty bad and the ending was probably one of the worst endings ever.  It's a pretty bad game, which could have been so much more. I wouldn't really recommend playing it unless you want to experience some pretty funny glitches. The game is pretty short (took me 5 and a half hours to complete), so it's not like you'd waste a lot of time.
89	1	a	So I acutally bought this game last year, perhaps around October (2015) time, and I haven't played it until now.  This game is one that I would recommend for numerous reasons.   Upon initially loading up the game and killing my first person, I was completely hooked. I'm not too sure what that says about me, but who cares. I think perhaps it was the fact that I've never played a game where I am basically the spawn of Satan. Also, post purchase of the game, I was surprised that the game had an actual, well-written (arguable) storyline. It was nice to have to follow a pattern of scripted killings, instead of just walking round murdering at will (not the mechanic xD). I especially enjoyed the fact that every death was different and unpredictable. This was very pleasing.  Another reason why I enjoyed this game was because each character was different and had a different purpose. There was one particular character I had a problem 'ending'...and that was Alastair. I thougt he was cool, and he reminded me of Alfred Pennyworth, who's a pretty awesome Batman character.   However, having said that I would recommend this game THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD IMPROVE.  First of all, I began to feel that the constant murdering towards the end (even though I did enjoy the story and each character's death scene) was getting a little teadous. It just felt like it was going on-and-on, chapter-after-chapter. Although it was still fun. Second of all, I had a real big problem with some of the achievements. As of writing this, I have all but three achievements left to collect:     Playing for 20 hours.     Playing for 40 hours.     Riding on the bike things for 10 miles.    At the moment, the 10 mile one isn't a problem because I know I'm just going to have to ride around, however, the other two are completely ridiculous.  First of all, I don't see how there is 40 hours of content here, and after looking at the global achievement statistics, only 2.9% (or something like that) of people have got this achievement. This is a game that I will come back to and replay in the future but, there is no way that I am getting a 40 hour achievement that is worthwhile to get. So I will be missing these achievements out. Having to do this really annoys me, because I am (and sorry for the colloquialism here) an 'achievement â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'. I really like achievement hunting.   Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I've never really given a proper review before on here, but I felt like I should for this game.  Thanks for reading and please be respectful of my opinions, as I would be to yours.  Thanks again.  
91	1	a	Come to the dark side, we have cookies  about Lucius Its a good boy..................until he reach age of 6  pros +graphic s pretty good for that genre of game, it give the feel of evil +the story is pretty simple you need to kill people and they souls go to your Daddy aka Satan +however I said story is simple bu didnt said its easy, all murders need to happen by accident, first few are easy but later not so much +you know how they need to die you just need perfect timing and way to make it happen +later in game you get a challenge +its a big house where murders happen so lot of explore and side quest  +patience is key of sucess +game is challenging   cons -memory wipe power sometime doesnt matter when you get caught from behind you need turn around erase memory and run away, this can be good feel but after few times getting caught it really not good, btw when u get caught and not fast enough to erase you need restart chapter -.-, however it teach you to be more careful   Playing this game I can recommend this game 100% it give you challenge, and of course SATAN
65	0	a	Lucius has so many problems. So many glitches and bugs that make to solving puzzles impossible. And you can try so many times before you understand that its a bug. Graphics are acceptable but not smooth and i had fps problems with my i7 4720, gtx 860, 16 gb ram system (but this is not acceptable). And it wont scare you cause you are the guy who is scary. The best thing about Lucius is a idea of playing Lucifer's son (Omen? of course:) ) Totally it needs more things apart from a good idea. I dont recommend it.
93	1	a	Absoloutely love this game, It has hours of fun, lots of puzzles, and a very creative story. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a dark game filled with satan and lucifer. This has many missions and a great character list. In the first mission alone you get to trap a maid into a freezing meat locker and freeze her to death, and that's only a tutorial on how to play!! I love this game and I would love to play it more, I'd give this a 7.5/10
95	1	a	This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours, where I also got 54 achievements along the way.   You play as the devil's child and you have to kill all persons in your father's mansion without leaving any traces, while a detective investigates every death as they happen.  The game is a bit of adventure, point and click, stealth and puzzles in general.  A special note to a chapter where you have to take the power down, then everyone in the house is walking around with a flashlight and you have to avoid them at all costs while doing some tasks - a really fun stealth experience.  LUCIUS IS REALLY BADASS.
97	1	a	9/10  +interesting quest +sex, violence and cruelty +interesting ways to kill them +cool and interesting story +play for evil -low quality -terrible bug
66	0	a	Lucius is a reversed horror-based detective story, where it's you who has to apparently outwit the detective and not the other way round (as is usually the case).  As the son of Lucifer, it's your task to rid the entire household of Mr Wagner, a US senator while being discreet as possible. In order to achieve this you're given some powers that will aid you along the way that include memory wipe and mind control.  It's fun while it lasts but because it's within a mansion and you have no control over how to go about killing these people (it's written in stone), it quickly becomes boring.  6/10.  My Youtube review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoIM6UsOio 
67	0	a	Would love to, but i just can't recommend this game. I like the idea, love the genre... but Lucius simply doesn't meet my expectations. Hope they do better next time tho.  Cons: - No plot at all (you are basically a paranormal serial killer) - No logic involved in many puzzles. - Huge mansion, small essential objects to collect not easy to spot quite often. - No AI. Just bots walking up un down predefined paths + some triggers. - Extremely linear game:  * Puzzles have 1 and only 1 solution, if you miss a tiny object in the corner of a room you are simply stuck till you spot it.   Overall: - Dull, repetitive, frustrating paranormal serial killer simulator. 'Avoid this game as hell, the power of the Christ compels you!'
99	1	a	This game was a birthday gift from a great Steam friend, always wanted the game and always wanted to try it but I was always unsure about the game if it would be good.  Well im glad I got to play this game because it is truly an amazing game yes it's from 2012 but the story is pretty cool, It does revolve around one house and one family but the developers have made this work in a good way, you play the game as a child coached by the devil into doing some pretty evil things.  The gameplay was great and I will play this game again to get the last achievements, the graphics are great and it worked well on my 5760x1080 resolution which I really liked.  controls are pretty basic but for this game and it is ok  To me the Steam write-up does not help sell this game and the metacritic score I don't really understand people's low ratings I guess we all see games from different prospective.  I will finish this off by saying if your thinking about buying the game buy it you wont regret it if your into horror.
101	1	a	Gore 10/10 Story 8/10  Gameplay 6/10 Replayable 8/10 Achievement 100% 7/10  Lucius is like the film Omen, but let's not talk about the film 'cause I can only remember bits. 'Bought this game when it was on sale and I would buy the game if it wasn't. The Story and Gameplay kept me playing alone.  If you enjoy playing a dark twisted 6 year old demon child, that go around killing residents of the Mansion you call home in the sometimes sick and gorey ways a demon child can kill you.   Story isn't majorly long about 6 hours, well thats how long it took me. On each of the chapters of the game you kill someone but you have to go on a hunt to find certain items or objects to set them up to look like a accident and not a young speachless boy.  And for more creepy is unlocking the bicycle and go riding around from room to room like its a scene out of a Stanley Kubrick horror movie.
70	0	a	   Non-flexibility at killing gets annoying after a while
103	1	a	Lucius is a game where it puts you in control of a 6 year old boy whos grandfather has a deal with Satan. Where he and his family well gain everything they could want, in return his first Grandson, Lucius. Satan comes to claim what is his on your 6th birthday, where he proceeds to instruct you on your new fait. You must kill every one living with in the house hold (maid, cooks, mechanic, family members, and your teacher) with out being caught by the investigator that is trying to piece the hole mystery together.   The killing is a little linear when it comes to who and how you kill them but it still makes it interesting trying to figure out how to do it. The story is good and the graphics are not to great but over all its still one of my fav games. If it goes on sale for $10 its a must grab if you enjoy Horror Adventure games from the killers point of view! 8/10
105	1	a	Ahhhhh, what can I say!!? The cutest little devil ever!!!!! :')
107	1	a	Lucius reminds me and I'm sure of a lot of people of The Omen. The gameplay is simple yet the manor is a big place to explore and the chores for side missions were fun to do for gifts and rewards that help you around.   The voice acting is pretty bad and the graphics are fair but despite this, it's the idea of controlling a six year old to kill that gives me, and people that actually understand this game, a very deep guilty pleasure.
109	1	a	There are too many 6's involved! The baby was born in June, the 6th month, on the 6th day, in 1966. That's four 6's! Now if the baby was born on 6-06-06 and the game was set back in the day just a bit further than what it is now (60 years lol), it would be freakier.  It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. There is no reset to default in the keybinds, so be sure you want to rebind keys before procceding. Some of the quests can be quite confusing. 'What do I do?' is the most used question I have asked myself throughout this game. You are not really given hints on what to do or where to go until you do them and your notebook is updated. Thanks notebook, where were you before I did this or that?! Satans notebook bites.  Man, I am one evil, little 6 year old murderous brat, it's great. Another creepy thing is, when writing this review my text was spazzing out all over the place. This game is haunted! One of the best game I have got for free through Indiegala.
111	1	a	The Omen Simulator. 10/10 would peep bathing maid again.
79	0	a	Meh.  As others have stated it's not a 'kill people in clever ways you choose in a sandbox'. It's a 'figure out how to kill people in ONE clever way that it pre-determind.'  It's narrative driven and probably not bad (gfx and controls are good) but not what I hoped. Should have researched before I bought.
113	1	a	In this adventure game you are Lucius, a son of the devil. Daddy likes souls so he asks Lucius to go kill people for him. He rewards Lucius with special powers that make him an even better killer.   Lucius shouldn't get caught, of course, so he makes murders look like an accident or frames someone for them. This means that each murder is a mini puzzle for which Lucius uses items he collects throughout the mansion and his special powers to 'solve the puzzle' and kill the target without getting caught.  Meanwhile, the story in the game is about the adults in the house: a bit of background for each target, how they react to the murders, the police detective investigating the deaths, etc.  For me, the puzzles were neither too hard nor too easy, so I found the difficulty perfect. At the start of each chapter, you are pointed to your target either via your note book or via the in-game map. Sometimes you may feel a bit stuck because you don't know what is expected, but when you look at the clues (you can get a cryptic clue from Daddy in your room, but you should especially look at the items you collected and at your notebook) the solution always comes to you because it makes sense.   Lucius' special powers like telekinesis and mind control are explained very well by Mr. Lucifer and they make the puzzle solving a lot more fun than your average 'point and click' adventure slash puzzle game.   The options in the game menu are: - adjust resolution, adjust graphics details (low, medium, high or ultra high), toggle full screen, toggle Vsync and adjust gamma - adjust sounds and music volume  - toggle 'invert mouse' and adjust mouse speed - re-bind keyboard keys or controller buttons  You should expect to get about 5 hours gameplay. About 7 hours if you don't rush and hunt most of the Steam Achievements. On that note, I should add that two achievements are absurd i.e. 'play the game for 20 hours' and 'play the game for 40 hours'. This means running the game as your active window, so running it in the background doesn't count. This is such an obvious and cheap way for the devs to try to get higher numbers of playtime for their game in Steam. Moreover, these two achievements appear to be bugged for me because the counter for both is still at zero.  All in all, I had fun playing this game and would recommend it but only when it's on sale at -50% or better.
115	1	a	good game reminds me of my childhood
117	1	a	Good concept for a game, although it is a bit short I completed the whole thing in just over 4 hours. However I have to continue to play or leave the game running for 40 hours for the final two acheivements. Whilst it is a decent game I can't see myself playing it for that length of time. I re did quite a few chapters when I was acheivement hunting so I think I'm done with it now.   The house can be quite difficult to navigate and the game feels a little clunky and buggy at points (It crashed twice and my new PC hasn't crashed with any game). Would have been nicer if you had a little more freedom in the game, as it is you have to stick rigidly to the storyline. But I did enjoy the story and some of the kills were just pure twisted and evil.   I got this in the Steam sale and am happy with it for the price I paid, but I don't see myself paying full price for it. 6/10
119	1	a	Very dark plot in this game, it is like that horror movie Omen. Game is bit too dark for me so I won't finish it. It plays okey and graphics are good. The mood is perfect anxiety if you like being villain in game then this is for you!
81	0	a	Unfortunately Lucius is buggy with a poor checkpoint system and has game breaking levels that are just unacceptable. The vague tutorials will have you looking for walkthroughs quickly and hampered by bugs in the game. Sometimes leaving you with the game over screen when it shouldnâ€™t be. Lucius is a clever idea and can be funny at times, but overall misses the mark.
121	1	a	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended. 
83	0	a	If you think you can run this game above 40 fps, you are very wrong. My old pc runs this game at around 5 to 20 fps. My new pc runs this game at around 15 to 40 fps. and I have saw so many posts about people cannot run this game with good fps. So yeah , I decided to uninstall this game. Poorly optimized , even high-end PCs cannot play it smoothly.  Current PC Specifications :  DELL Inspiron 7559  Windows 10 Home ( 64-bit )  Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz ( 4 Core ) 16 GB RAM  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 4GB   Old PC ( 2011 - 2016 ) Specifications :  ASUS Laptop N53J  Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1  Intel Core i5 M480 @ 2.67 GHz  4GB RAM  NVIDIA GeForce 425M CUDA 2GB
84	0	a	I wish I could write iffy reviews. Because this is a game that will infuriate you with it's bugs and lack of a save feature but then make you laugh at all the stupid voice acting and goofy death scenes.  A lot of the times the missions will be vague and you *will* need a guide.  Sometimes your interface will disappear on you and not come back until you restart the whole game, and you can't save.  There's no first person camera so get used to the back of Lucius' head blocking everything.  But if you can look past all that, the game is still very amusing and atmospheric.
85	0	a	A fairly mediocre adventure game with an even worse story. Got bored really quickly of the mechanics of the game and the story never really interested me. It is a surprisingly violent game but I personally think it doesnt really add much to the experience.  It also has two really poorly designed achievements that require you to play a total of 20 hours and 40 hours of the game. Why is this poor design? Considering the game can easily be beaten in 7-9 hours the high time requirement just doesnt make much sense. Sure, the 20 hour one could be conisdered a 'beat the game twice' kind of achievement but as the game really lacks reasons to play it more then once not even that one feels justified. The 40 hour achievement just feel like they want people to keep the game running longer as free advertising.   Time to 100%:  40 hours
123	1	a	Well, this game is pretty awesome.. I mean killing people, worship Satan and stuff. But, there are also some annoying things such as broken controls, sometimes I couldn't pick up an item and had to reload. And one more thing which made me hate this game for a moment.. it's the mother of Lucius. I hate this stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, she used to follow me every step while I was playing. So sad I had no chance to kill her in a first hour of playing :\
125	1	a	What can I say,I feel so satisfied when i can kill my bi#@y mother,my ugly Granfather and finally my dumb father :D
127	1	a	Not super polished, but still pretty good game where you control Lucius, and kill other people. And make them look like accidents. Game is somewhat limited, you kill everyone the way game wants you to. You can roam in the map pretty free, and it has some stealth elements to it. Little bit clunky, but after a while you get used to it.   If you can get through the rough edges of this game, it can be really fun. Or at least entertaining, as I don't think killing everyone one in your family should be considered fun.  Pick it up on a sale, or in a bundle
129	1	a	gifted this to my friend with christian parents  he got grounded
88	0	a	A brilliant concept, but inescapably dull gameplay. You have to spend too much time wandering around looking for objects, or specific interactions, and because the game's kills are so linear, there is no way around this.   A great idea, well built atmosphere and theme, but it just isnt really worth the time. Also, my xbox360 controler did not work for this game despite 'full controler support'.   6/10
131	1	a	great adventure and little bit horor game but very short storyline but while you are achvement hunter you must played this game 40 hours for all achvements
133	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale.  Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...
135	1	a	If you run out of matches.. Go buy new ones...
137	1	a	BEST TRICYCLE SIMULATOR EVER
89	0	a	An interesting concept, though poorly done. Doesn't worth to be picked up, unless on a very big sale.  Lucius has a very good story, decent graphics and amazing voice acting, though the bugs, glitches and the limited gameplay ruins the chances for an entertaining experience.  Being the son of Lucifer, he does have quite a few paranormal abilities, still, making his tricycle drive for a few seconds after he gets off it and eventualy crush half of it into the floor - is definetly not one of them. Same with Lucius walking through closed doors and getting into places where he is not supposed to be. Noticed this once in the middle of the game, and once again at the very end, when you're supposed to kill your father in the burning house, somehow i walked through the front door (which was locked) and could't manage to get back inside after trying for a half hour, ultimately being forced to restart the game. Yet, this is all pice of cake. The most annoying glitch in this game are the hints. It's not enough that they are kind of unclear, but sometimes they appear after you already completed the task, leaving you in the most complicated missions without no clue what to do. As for example there is a mission where you must kill one of your maids and the only hint is 'she is doing laundry'. After i spent about 2 hours trying everything that came into my mind, i finally gave up and decided to watch a walkthrough where i found out that i'm supposed to use telekinesis to pick up an iron from a top shelf and drop it into the washing machine, then start it. By doing this you'll brake the washing machine and leave the maid without an occupation, then she'll decide to take a bath giving you the opportunity to kill her. How the hell was i supposed to know this ? And guess what ? After i broke the washing machine i got the hint that i should do so...  What i hated the most was the limited gameplay. The history was already written for you. You can run around in a huge house, interact with the people you find, but you can't choose which one to kill, or at least how to kill him. Each crime is to be commited in order, and by the specific methods, even the special powers that you have can be used just on specific missions, specific people or objects...  I would recommend to skip this one, unless you get the occasion to pick it up on a very big sale (at least 80%) just for the heck of it.
139	1	a	Inferior OMEN game adaptation! Sacrifice people and get a tricycle!  (one-timer interactive movie, easy to get 100% achievements)
141	1	a	A game where you get to play as the antichrist, I found Lucius to be alot of fun. If you're a fan of the older Hitman games (Where planning of a hit was paramount) then you will find this game rewarding. Its also a breath of fresh air since you get to be truly evil for once.   A small indie dev so don't go in expecting AAA production values.
143	1	a	7/10 
145	1	a	Saw from Poods , if you like satanic stuffs and screwing around this game is just for you. Funny/dark playthrough so just buy and raise some hell !
147	1	a	Lucius is a gem of its own kind.  The story, very original, compliments and works perfectly with the very original and unique gameplay. Even though the basic concept remains the same throughout the game, it never fails to feel new and more innovative each time, by asking you to really sit and think about how to proceed in your tasks. It's also very challenging ! You may get stuck on a few of the murders as they will really push you to be creative in your process of thoughts.  It just was fun. Very fun.  Now of course it's not perfect : there are a few minor bugs scattered around, and the gory/satanic side of the game may give people some trouble, but then again that's what to expect with such a game.
149	1	a	Lucius is an evil game with a great atmosphere and an amazing soundtrack. The gameplay however is at times just moderate and a bit clumsy bot most of the time it's interesting to figure out how the next murder should be done. The gameplay, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack and finally the setting - all go arms in arms and create a wonderful charme of spine-chilling scariness. Overal this game is simply brilliant and I'm not aware of any other game with such a deep haunting atmosphere.  Not recommended for weak nerves, otherwise try it out.
151	1	a	Completely brilliant, if somewhat linear.  Once you get the hang of figuring out creative ways to kill people, and how to navigate the map, it becomes less tedious.  Who needs clean underwear if you've already got your toys?
153	1	a	Great game, great story, not boring .
155	1	a	This was one of the best games that I have played. I wanted it for a while and I got it during February because it was on sale for $5. This was well worth the money! You play as a boy named Lucius who becomes interested in his true calling, killing people. So you kill everyone in your household and after each kill you wake up in your bedroom in the night and Lucifer teaches you a new skill. You get skills like Telekenesis, Mind Control, Memory Erase, and more. Overall great game! Buy it! 8.4/10
93	0	a	This looked like it could of been a good game but you are not given any info in the game on what your suppose to do.  This is the reason I do not Recommend this game Also its not worth $20 if you want to try it wait until its on Sale again here on Steam.  The Controls on this game are also worthless.  So Unless you get this free or for $1 like I did I don't recommend it 
157	1	a	Murdered the gardener by making him ram his head into the lawn mower and escaped on my getaway Tricycle. 10/10  In all honesty though this game can be kind of a pain to figure out. Don't go in with the mindset that you will absolutely NOT use a guide- because you will probably never beat it without one. Some of the kills are straight absurd on how you do it. Otherwise fun game, I still recommend!
159	1	a	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
161	1	a	this is the first game that gave me experience to be a   bad-satanish-boy   character.  at first I was really excited to be in this huge mansion but after like few hours Im getting bored cuz actually this mansion is not that 'huge'.  plus with lack of creativity in killing people cuz there is specific weapon for specific people in specific mission.  So, thanks to the walkthrough guide :D  well it is worth to try.      my playtime is including my little sister's playtime and also the one for getting the achievement    
94	0	a	So awful that it's actually kinda good.   Hilariously over-the-top gore, unexpected nudity, laughable writing and voice acting, wonky physics, bugs galore - it's like the Goat Simulator of horror games.  The game's main problem is that it is so linear, limited and obtuse that it's pretty much essential to play with a guide so that you can follow the precise series of steps required to complete a chapter. Wandering around the mansion with no clue what to do next gets old very fast.  
163	1	a	The criticisms are unfounded.  I didn't buy this for a while because many reviews spoke of mainly 2 reasons that made the game frustrating: 1) A lack of autosave means you have to do the WHOLE level again if you get caught. 2) It isn't clear what you have to do, and you spend forever wandering around trying to find or use the right item.  What they don't mention is 1) a level lasts 2 minutes when you figure what to do and, bar 1-and-a-third levels, you can move freely around your mansion. 2) You're given many clues, but there's always Google for when you derp. I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but this never happened.  Another common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point. (Lucius 2 would go on to prove this point according to all those reviews.)  It falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, and it's not bad anyway. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people would like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better).  Be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways. It's a right laugh.
95	0	a	Great in concept, absolutely indescribably terrible in execution.
165	1	a	EDIT REVIEW:  Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.
167	1	a	+Voice work  +Story  +Music  -Can't skip cutscenes  -Game becomes bugged if you pick up an item before you should.   -Resume game option only after intro level  -Can't skip HUD intro.
169	1	a	I love this game, it's so evil! If u like horror movies u will like it. The story is based off of The Omen.
171	1	a	It's entertaining, short, adventure, puzzle quest game with many gruesome deaths, little bit of nudity and few plot twists.   Game is straight forward - there is only one way to kill each person and you must find all items to do it. Even with all quest items, it may take some time to understand what and where is required to do, but luckily there are guides for that.  Don't expect open world here - mansion and garden is all you can explore.  Graphics even on Ultra High left me unsatisfied. You may encounter some bugs, restarting chapter will fix that.  There are 2 endings. First is easy, 2nd takes some time to do it right, but will reward you with more satisfying ending, a la horror movies.   Don't expect too much, this is no AAA title, but good for indie developers. Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.  P.S. Don't let your kids play this.
173	1	a	Have you ever wanted to corrupt the innocent and be a generally evil demonic little child? Well then this is the game for you.  If you just stick with it through the glitches and try to overlook the many shortcomings this title has then you WILL have a good time. Itâ€™s a real diamond in the rough.  On the surface it may look like a third person action game, but itâ€™s actually a third person puzzle gameâ€¦ one with a good premise too.  Price wise though wait for a sale, full price it is a little much, unless you LOVE the idea of being the Antichrist then have at it.  Trust me, go ahead and play the son of the devil. Its fun ^_^ 
175	1	a	:::: Bringing the Devil Out :::::  What to expect from this game?  It is a game wrapped around the life of a boy who is not ordinary. In fact he is driven from the human number of the Beast, '666', and it is your goal to carry on some devilish fun. The game has very detailed graphical visuals that surround the setting of a Mansion where the boy does his evil deeds. If you are into some puzzle solving killing fun, this may be the game to enjoy those fantasies and desires.   What are the positive things about this game?  While playing this game, you will immerse yourself into a house full of family, staff and house guests who will live throughout their last days while you prey upon them. There are plenty of rooms to expllore and things to move or take for your goal needs. Once you play for an hour or so, you will feel like part of the family. There will be different missions/goals to achieve during the day or night, while others are awake or asleep. Rain, snow or sunshine will not keep you from killing. Just, do not get caught.   What is the negative things about this game?  This game is linear oriented to the variety of ways to kill your target. There is only one solution for each goal, which can be very fustrating. (For example: You can easily squash a bug, spray it with poison, or catch and release it. In this game, you can only spray the bug with poison.) This game would be better if their were alternative ways of reaching your goals. Also while playing this game I have encounter some game glitches, bugs and crashes. The game have crashed while loading the next part of the game. I also encounter a glitch while traveling down or upstairs, the NPC characters would either push your character off the stairs or get you stuck between them.  Would you recommend this game?  Yes, solely becuase of the orginality of this game's design. Although this is a very linear game, I find it ammusing to try to leave clues about you being the killer throughout the game. (Such as leaving toys or other objects to appear in the cutscenes when not needed. I had many laughs with it) **There is no playback value to this game, except to have fun and cause mischieve.   BE A VERY BAD BOY !!!!!
177	1	a	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10

181	1	a	Quite a nIce game. It's about the everyday life of a 7-y.o. boy, with stuff like household chores, finding different stuff for people and ridind your small tricycle in the hallways. I recommend buying it, it's pretty relaxing and a lot of fun.
183	1	a	Lucius is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global for Microsoft Windows. It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Players take control of Lucius as he murders members of his household, using powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that lead to the deaths of multiple residents of Dante Manor. Players use their wits and follow hints to ensure they do not leave any evidence that would lead to a mission failing.
185	1	a	Bought it yesterday for $20, on sale today for $2. Worth it.

189	1	a	i noticed some problems with optimisation. with my GTX 850M and 2047 MB of memory, i had max 25 frames. anyway, despite technical problems, the game is absolutely awesome, great reference to the famous film Omen.  9/10 because of the fps, sorry.
191	1	a	Kill your family. Impress your unholy father. ????? Profit!  Other thoughts: I'm impressed that this game still gets occasional updates.
193	1	a	A little short but interesting and enjoyable game.
195	1	a	A personal guilty pleasure. Fans of tacky horror movies will find enjoyment in Lucius.  The mansion where the game takes place is very interesting and is a excellent environment to explore.   The graphics fail to impress and the controls feel very clumsy. Chapters also feel very short and fails to give players the chance to be creative as the way you kill people has already been pre-determined by the game.   Overall the game is enjoyable but could have used a bit more polishing.
197	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and cool gameplay, the soundtrack is good. This was a unique experience playing that game and I liked it a lot.
199	1	a	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!
201	1	a	Very fun to play with people
203	1	a	6 year old kid killing his whole family for the glory of Satan. And you are that kid armed with demonic power. Each murder has to look like accident so they wont throw your â™¥â™¥â™¥ in asylum, or yet worse, catholic church. The concept actually sounds better than actual gameplay looks like, but it is worth trying.
101	0	a	Lucius is one of those games where so much could have been done, but nothing was. It is very linear, you cannot decide who you want to kill and when, but the game tells you who, and exactly how to do it. It introduces new skills when they are to be used. The characters have no character, except for the father and the detective. Either the mansion is too big, or there is too little in it. I did enjoy the story-telling element of the detectives puzzlement.  I got Lucius on sale for 90% off, and that is a more fair price at which I would recommend it.
205	1	a	I've always dreamed at things that Lucius does. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing wonderful game. Best song for this game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWNzZygAjJY 
207	1	a	Satan taught me how to use a flashlight.  10/10
209	1	a	This is a suprisingly nice game. Wasn't expecting nearly as much from it.  Basically you're a devilish child doing devilish things, cursing your manor and driving the family insane.   Pros:
211	1	a	Pretty neat little game, more fun if you go for 100% achievs.  (paid $3.50 for both Lucius 1 &amp; 2 very happy, felt like a steal)
213	1	a	This game is different from what I usually play. It does feel a bit glitchy using the telekenisis ability, especially if you haven;t played for a while, but that might be just me.   It's fun for the morbid part of all of us.

217	1	a	It's a fun game though sometimes the house can get pretty confusing. Worth the 5 dollars for sure.
219	1	a	666 out of 10
221	1	a	This game is great. Maybe not as polished as bigger titles, but a very good play.
223	1	a	Installed. Been playing for 16 minutes. Game freezes. GGWP Lucius.
108	0	a	This game was a joke to me. I don't know why it just seemed â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. You go around killing people as a little boy that never freakin talks man.
225	1	a	If you ever dreamed of being the son of evil, this is your chance. Lucius is a game with strong links to 'The Omen'. The player takes the role of Lucius, the son of the devil, who has to clear the mansion of itâ€™s residents. To do this he must orcastrate â€œaccidentsâ€ without anyone suspecting him of any foul play.  Sounds great but sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.   Sound 9/10 Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 7/10 Atmosphere 8/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
110	0	a	There is something missing from this game. I love the idea of wandering around a house, finding items to use against hapless victims but the whole experience was a little stale.  Became very boring very quickly
111	0	a	At least as bad as some of the worst games I've played, Lucius is a cheaply-made game at not such a cheap price ($19.99, at least $25 over what it's worth, meaning the developers should pay you to play the game).  Everything from its looks, to its cutscene and gameplay style might make you think this is from another era (and not a good game from that era), yet it's a 2012 game, only one year old at the time of writing.  The game is incredibly frustrating, with no pointer as to what to do, yet it wants you to perform in a way that is 100% how the developers intend you to play a mission.  In fact, there is a hint as to what to do, the mission title, but even if you get it, which if you're like me you will usually, you don't get how to do it because the game just won't let you use your powers in a meaningful way unless you're at the right place, at the right time, under the right circumstances.  Lucius is a very poorly designed game.
112	0	a	Unfortunately this game is linear and uncreative. A promising game held back with poor execution including bad voice acting, lame writing and boring gameplay. In order to solve the way to kill someone it'll take you a matter of minutes because there are only a few areas to even access. No multiple ways to kill someone either. Got it for $2 and I feel like I over payed.
227	1	a	Excellent game! I loved the plot a lot! Buy it, it's worth it!
229	1	a	I just completed 'Lucius', and thought that there'd be no better time to write a review for it. In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though. 'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use. If you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.
231	1	a	Finally a game that lets me BE an evil child instead of running away/fighting an evil child. There's nothing more relaxing after a hard day than murdering people. For the glory of Satan, of course!
233	1	a	Excellent game! I loved the plot a lot! Buy it, it's worth it!

237	1	a	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.
239	1	a	I would recommend this game. I like the concept of the game and the story. I think this isn't the kind of game you play for the incredible graphics and the game also has some bugs. But overall it was good fun, I liked the tricycle!
241	1	a	Bought this game on the Steam Summer sale and made a good choice. This game was fun. The story was pretty good too. Overall 9/10.
243	1	a	After completing the game I decide to write a review within minutes of completing the game no spoilers are included: The game is about killing everyone in your house without getting caught and using unique ways of killing. The game has decent graphic despite only a few characters having proper walking animations and everyone else just wobbles. There are some glitches like being cornered and then pushed off the map, but glitches are bound to happen with old game. I do have to say without help from a few guides on some missions that lacked explanation or I have not notice. 
245	1	a	pros -  satan is pretty handsome.  Spooky demonic powers  Harvasting souls for daddy. Smashing peoples faces in with pianos.   Cons:  Buggy as hell.
247	1	a	Very original game, worth the price and very fun in a sick kind of way!  Could improve with better instructions and tutorial and faster loading!  Overall very cool game! :)

251	1	a	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
253	1	a	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
113	0	a	Frame drops and crashes almost all the time, I do not recommend unless you'd like a game full of lags and unpatched bugs.
255	1	a	Picked up maids panties, learned how to use a flashlight, killed a maid in a freezer. 10/10 would be antichrist again.
257	1	a	You can get bored after like 4-5 hour of playing, but It's a good game.
259	1	a	Fun game, you have to love killing people in a dark style or something. Worth my 94 cents xD  Leuk spel, je moet wel van mensen doden in een rare stijl houden ofzo. Het is mijn â‚¬0.94 zeker waard xD
261	1	a	This game makes you think you can get away with murder... NOTE: YOU (probably) CAN'T GET AWAY WITH MURDER  Pros: fun puzzles to solve, murder, b00bs (yes, it has b00bs), descent play time, gory, not terrible graphics, good story  Cons: Not enough people to murder ;)
263	1	a	Awesome.....hahahah this games teach you how to kill people
265	1	a	As Lucius, you're tasked with systematically slaughtering a mansion full of family and staff without getting caught. That also means you cannot attack your target directly by conventional standards. Because of this limitation, Lucifer himself had endowed you with various abilities and powers to assist in your work. Naturally, the more souls sent to your father, the stronger your powers become. These powers involve telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and combustion. You'll mostly be using telekinesis throughout the game, while others are used in specific areas or chapters. The only ability I thought had any growth was telekinesis. From lifting cups for a few seconds to starting cars and killing power to the entire mansion was the only time you felt like you were getting stronger.   When it came to the murders, I was a little let down. I had expected more freedom when planning each kill. Something closer to the Hitman games than what we got. You're presented a scenario in each chapter and you have to figure out what is expected of you to meet the criteria and proceed forward. Each scenario is interesting and satisfying in their own ways and involve homicide, suicide and accidents. Yeah, it's some pretty gruesome stuff, too. One example is using water on snow to ice over and having a character slip on it, then using telekinesis on an icicle to finish the job. Almost all of the murders involve an extreme element of puzzle solving instead of force to accomplish your goal. If you're into that style of game, it's pretty damn fun. I wasn't complaining too much after I got the hang of things.  OH yeah, you have to appear as a good boy to the house hold, too. You're actually given chores like cleaning your room and brushing your teeth to complete. Upon completion, you're given good behavior points and will receive gifts that may make your work easier. And it's kinda fun. A little. Maybe. What? It works and so does this game even if it's not the game I had expected. It's pretty damn close. And I cant think of another game that's really like this. It's far from perfect and can be very frustrating, but it's a neat experience and an interesting perspective to take on. It's a slow horror game about plotting your attack, without any threat of being attacked or having to hide in a closet. It's a liberating horror game in that sense, having so much power with nobody suspecting a damn thing.  After my first playthrough with Lucius, I was reminded of games like Destroy All Humans, Stubbs the Zombie and, well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, Grand Theft Auto. I wasn't reminded because of gameplay similarities, but of the theme of playing as the villain or â€œbad guy.â€ You see, there once was a time when the ability to play as the villain was kind of a hot topic among various circles within the previous decade. Ultimately, the conversation didn't go anywhere and most people seemed fine with this idea. The most controversial moment was in a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 segment that allowed you to play as a terrorist and shoot up an airport full of American civilians. That segment was so upsetting to some, it gained attention from national news networks. If that was something that got under your skin, playing as a seven year old spawn of Satan tasked with killing a bunch of people in horrific ways might have the same effect.
267	1	a	Pretty short and a little bit buggy. But very fun to play.
269	1	a	-SPOILER ALERT-  My Parent's Maid had an ice cold personality, so I put her in the Freezer!   10/10 would freeze again.  I feel my behaviour was a bit cold now that i think about it though...
271	1	a	It's a brilliant game but the police are awful. I froze someone in the freezer room and the police's final diagnosis is... cardiac arrest.
273	1	a	Great game. very fun
275	1	a	Fun. Demonic. Satanic. Lot's of killings (Nothing else lol) Ever wanted to be a 6 year old walking around a big mansion killing people with magic powers given by your father, The Devil? Well i have not, but the game is fun sooo, try it out.
277	1	a	Great story. It is fun to be evil. During the game you have to figure out how to kill all your targets. You also getting a few special powers. You can also use your tricycle in your house and break a few pots (and no ruppies inside, I am not link)  In the last level I do have a irritating bug/Crash, this make it very hard to finish that level.
279	1	a	Lucius 47, Codename: Devil  Unique, funny game where you slaughter everyone in the mansion while being possessed by Devil himself. Bought this for under 1 euro, was a blast to play through. Can't wait to jump into the 2nd one.
281	1	a	I got this game on sale a little while ago, and I had such a great time playing it. The game follows a strict storyline but allows you free reign of the house to explore. It does glitch at times, which can be frustrating, especially towards the end, but I would say that the gameplay itself makes up for that. The dark plot and graphic murders are definitely an enticing storyline, although I would say (without giving too much away) that the story seemed very rushed towards the end. But overall, a brilliant game, very enjoyable to play, would definitely recommend.
283	1	a	its a fun game but its creepy to the point that its scary
114	0	a	Frame drops and crashes almost all the time, I do not recommend unless you'd like a game full of lags and unpatched bugs.
285	1	a	You can have a tricicle and kill everyone, TEN OUT OF TEN
287	1	a	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
289	1	a	.. forgive me father, for I have sinned..     and for those who's seeking to be enlightened about the game:  you will have no idea what you have to do, because you lack of clues. But don't worry tho, you will be guided. ;)
291	1	a	I rather enjoyed this game. Playing a precocious child by the name of Damien Dante, you have to kill people. Why? For the glory of Satan of course. This game is pretty much just The Omen: The Videogame. You have to figure out how to kill people without getting caught. The only problem is there is just one person per level that you kill, and there is only one way to kill that person. So it does not play like a sandbox murder simulator, it plays like an adventure game. That means it is boring. Even rudimentary skills at rpgs or adventure games will make this one far too easy. But still, it was fun. With the exception of the 20 hr and 40 hr acheivements, that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t when I can, without cheating, complete the game in 6 hrs. The style of game also makes it not replayable. Buy it if you can get it on sale for super cheap.
293	1	a	Nice 10/10 would read the holy bible again
295	1	a	This goes to one of the 'Game you have to play before you die' on my list.  The gameplay is similar like Hitman.  But you are not bald.. And you are son of the Devil :)
297	1	a	Killing all the people in your house because you're the devil's son. Who'd have thought this would be such an amazing game to play. And no, I'm not playing the game just because the kid's name is close to mine.. I blame Pewds for getting me interested in the game, it's probably one of the most gruesome games I've played before, but I love it. (I'm not violent, I swear.)
115	0	a	It's a load of crap
299	1	a	It's a brilliant game but the police are awful. I froze someone in the freezer room and the police's final diagnosis is... cardiac arrest.
301	1	a	Fun. Demonic. Satanic. Lot's of killings (Nothing else lol) Ever wanted to be a 6 year old walking around a big mansion killing people with magic powers given by your father, The Devil? Well i have not, but the game is fun sooo, try it out.
303	1	a	Awesome.....hahahah this games teach you how to kill people
305	1	a	666  I enjoyed this game!  + story + cinematics + devil/hell things + you feel like a badass! + two ends   - sometimes glitches - kinda hard puzzles (I used walkthrough)

309	1	a	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.
311	1	a	This Game Is Very Good !!! Interactive !!!!
313	1	a	pros -  satan is pretty handsome.  Spooky demonic powers  Harvasting souls for daddy. Smashing peoples faces in with pianos.   Cons:  Buggy as hell.
315	1	a	Lucius is a devilish game that follows a little boy hellbent on murdering everyone in his house to please his father; Lucifer. The game is broken into chapters, and in each chapter you must kill an assigned target. There is no time limit to this, which gives you plenty of time to explore the game and interact with your fantastic surroundings, and talk to the characters which have unique dialogue that change as the story progresses.  The game has some very difficult parts that take quite a bit of thinking, and a couple of easier parts. Sadly, each death is scripted and you have no choice in the way they die, which means if you replay the game, you don't get a different experience. Having said this, it is a wonderful little game, with some very interesting cutscenes. The premise is a little cliche, but the execution is fantastic, as it keeps you interested until the very end.
317	1	a	*spooky scary skeletons play in the background*
319	1	a	being the son of satan is awesome  
321	1	a	Im almost 12 Now. Killed over a couple of Guys. Still no idea how to tidy my room.  
116	0	a	a bunch of wax dummies get murdered by damiatian from the omen, listen to black metal and meditate while playing this and your chakra will allow you to communicate with satan as you contemplate the abyss of the inferno society clings to. I stopped playing when your mom tells you to clean your room, hit too close to home.
323	1	a	100% Satan is my Dad now. I'm so proud.
325	1	a	An Amazing game with a brillant written storyline. Brought it yesterday i was unable to put it down. Managed to complete it within 5 hours
327	1	a	Interesting idea, pretty bad graphics, entertaining, but not creative gameplay. Strong 8/10, worth buying for that 1$ :)!
329	1	a	Very challenging, with a lot of exploration needed to solve the murder puzzles.
331	1	a	Lucius is a awesome game but can be hard at times. You need to find out what to do and eventually you'll get caught doing it or moving too it. Really frustrating at times but that's all part of the game. :) I loved the game, the killing parts are the best. xD
333	1	a	Satan's blood marches through my veins, like giant RADIOACTIVE RUBBER PANTS! The pants command me. Do not ignore my veins!  AND STOP TELLING ME TO PICK UP UNDERWEARS!! GIVE ME MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ TRIcycle that i had to ride in circles for an hour to get ONE achievement.  How i hate this game *hugs*~
335	1	a	Very challenging, with a lot of exploration needed to solve the murder puzzles.
337	1	a	This Indie-game is the perfect combination of 'The Omen' horror-film and gameplay from 'Hitman' franchise.
339	1	a	Pros. Nice graphic unique gameplay Need to think first before act Unique story  Cons. The stealth thingy feels stupid bug.lot of em even in the last fight you must restart the game more that 3 times.  Be aware that this game are full of satanic thing and gore if you can't stand or get triggered by that kind of thing then don't buy it,But if you like those thing i reccomend you to buy it because it can turn on your inner psychopath feeling  Overall 8/10
341	1	a	Its so amazing and funny. Ways of murders are so good :D
343	1	a	Murder your whole family.....
345	1	a	I really enjoyed this amazing game. 8/10.  + interesting storyline + not too easy + puzzle game + few side quests + the house is big and enjoyable + the powers are simple to learn + deaths were entertaining and creative + peli on suomalaisten tekemÃ¤ ja sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ hiukan suomalaista insidelÃ¤ppÃ¤Ã¤ joten se on mainitsemisen arvoinen plussa :)  - felt like the game wasn't long enough - the graphics are not most appealing but it makes the game look more scary - characters (doesn't include lucius or lucifer) were kinda impersonal - voice acting wasn't that good - if you fail a quest you need to start the whole chapter all over again  I maybe wouldn't buy this at full price but when it is on sale it is a must have.
347	1	a	Walkthroughs Matter
349	1	a	I absolutely loved this game! The story was interesting and had me hooked the whole way. It was gruesome, fun, and paid homage to some of the greatest possession movies and stories out there in a fantastic way. Once I started it up I could not stop playing until the very end, nothing beats a night of plotting diabolical acts for a six year old demon to perpetrate!
351	1	a	Quite enjoyed this game, twas a good Saturday distraction. I managed to get 55 of the 58 achievements in under 10 hours, while also finishing the game with both endings. The remaining achievements were the running one, which I did while getting the laundry chore done (got lost enough! hehe) which I managed the following day within a half hour, and the other two were the time-based achievements (play for 20 hours and play for 40) which I'm still on my way to getting.  All in all, a very enjoyable game, though don't expect open-world, it's very scripted. This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.  Top story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).
353	1	a	This game is good, if you like games where you can walk around and just cause havok. I like to play this game from time to time, when I am bored of my bigger games. This game is great, the story is a little corny, but i enjoy this game. I like the different ways you set up each person for the 'fall' they encounter and the different maze like ways in the mansion, you can get to different places. Also the story following the seasons and years also. The only thing I hate is some of the difficulties in the game are a little hard to get past, and the build up to the end of the story and having a crappy climax. Other than that an ok game to play on A rainy day. Thanks Pew Die Pie , for bringing this game to my attention. =0)
355	1	a	Went through a wall on the last floor and fell out of the map with a tricycle. Got back in from the wall next to the kitchen! 11/10 Would glitch out again
357	1	a	Spooky, scary and very satanic!  Warning! Upside-down crossed!   :p
359	1	a	amazing game pewdiepie plays it yay but all together i think it'sawesome :D
361	1	a	I fell in love with the game the minute I saw the name. Dark, creepy and really keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this to anyone who loves anything dark and creepy
363	1	a	Get to kill people with your power ''Telekinesis'' in the game and also uses strategy to kill them.  Gameplay is very fun, Voice acting was a bit late while the character moves it's mouth.  Graphics are pretty good for a 2012 game, I RECCOMEND IT!
365	1	a	This game can be difficult, but its well worth for how crazy it gets.
367	1	a	Ever wonder what it would be like to play the villain? Or need a good game to vent some real life frustrations on? This is definitely the game for you. This is a beautifully designed and rather well written dark parody of classic horror movies and video games. The story itself could take you anywhere between six to twelve hours of gameplay to beat depending on how well you fair in puzzle games. It does focus a lot more on puzzles and stealth, but has it's action moments. This game is definitely worth a pick up and play when you are bored. Personal Score: 7.5/10.
369	1	a	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)

120	0	a	The idea is great and the it's sometimes satisfying due to the concept.  Overall though it's not something I can recommend. First off, the gameplay is just boring, outside a few stealth and combat sections this game has nothing exciting to offer as far as gameplay goes. The puzzles are sometimes nice, but mostly uninspired. The story is what kept me finishing the game, in the end I felt that it had more potential, but was still fine.  What really annoyed me though is the lack of life from most of the characters, if you can even call them characters. They have no personality, not even a glimpse of it, which would be fine if we didn't spend like I don't know, 75% of the game killing people like that. I mean as a hellspawn wouldn't it be much more satisfying to kill people who are good and have things to lose? It's more devilish, you know. Sure, everybody has something to lose, but why should we care about these people? Some of them are considered annoying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s by Lucius himself (let alone me). And the others are just there, because somehow you must fill the mansion with people. The main characters are OK, and it's interesting to see them reacting to the events. So yeah, outside a few things this game doesn't really offer much. It's a great concept and a little bit of fresh air with the change of roles, but it doesn't execute well enough to be considered anything but a good idea.  tl;dr it's eh. 4/10
383	1	a	I got best walkthrough
385	1	a	An OK game. The gameplay is steady and fun. The achievements are quite easy to achieve (minus the 20 and 40 hour ones).  Unfortunately, replayability is not this game's strong suit. Once you have played it once (you can get all achievments on a single playthrough) there isn't any benefit to playing it again, since you know how to kill each and every one of them. The mansion's floorplan could have been better. It is very awkward to move around in and it is difficult to learn. Even after completing the entire game, I still don't have a good idea of what's where in the mansion.  7/10
387	1	a	1. Get powers 2. Kill the people u have to end 4. Turn all the crosses upside down 3. Like this if you have crippling depression
389	1	a	Lucius is a fun game. I've only played it for four Hour's and i'm almost done already. I bought this in feb But stayed off it because i couldn't run it very well. Now it's better! You should get this game!
391	1	a	Lucius is a bold attempt to put you in the shoes of an evil 6 year old with supernatural powers and a good standing with the devil in order to murder and cause mayhem amongst all other people in your home without being detected. While the developers characterize the game as an open world experience, it only takes place in the very confined place of the house and does not allow for creative approaches when it comes to murdering the inhabitants. Unfortunately, this is also my major issue with the game that has to be lauded for trying something different, but fails upon the execution - quite literally. In addition to that, controls are a detrimental to the experience and become your real enemy in the few, but frustrating fighting sequences. One can argue that a certain amount of dark humor is present, but again the execution feels forced and especially the sexual scenes add nothing except for their own sake being there. In short: Interesting concept - no buy
393	1	a	Great game. 7/10 :)

397	1	a	Hahaha, this is such an evil game.
399	1	a	Devilishly good and entertaining gameplay.
401	1	a	4.5 Stars out of 5. A really fun game to play. Only problem was sometimes understanding what your supposed to do next but you can easily find out through youtube vids. Also really easy to get 100% achievements.
403	1	a	Honestly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game. It does have amazing visuals and a great story line although I must point out this game isn't for the faint of heart or people of the Christian religion. It has a lot to do with the Devil and Dark Magic. I as a gamer don't take offense to simple video games however I am aware that many people or their family members may not entirely agree with this this game and I respect that, therefore should you be Christian or have family members who are either Christian or believe heavyly into the Bible, this isn't a game for you.
405	1	a	The game has a really neat idea, I like it although I do have some complaints: -There isn't very much direction, I understand it is meant to make you think, but some things are just completely random, I did find a guide for a little help though. -There are a few glitches, mostly just entertaing. (Mom walking in place at a door when the door is locked) -It is very linear in most aspects, ie: you can't do certain things unless you check your journal first, even if the update in the journal is a conversation you are in the middle of having.  -And a minute problem, I think the 'Devil' could have looked better. Although it's many issues, I do still like the game. I'm wondering what else may be coming out from the developers.
407	1	a	Very fun horror game. There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your pants.  But it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner.    The game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.
409	1	a	I didn't know what I was in for when I got this, but I was in for a treat. The game does lack in action, gameplay, and replayability... but it makes up for it in storyline and fun.  The basic idea is that you are a little boy who is evil, cold, and heartless. Your goal... kill your rich family and its employee's. It is done by solving puzzles and making it appear like a tragic accident.  Unfortunately once you play/beat it... there is no alternative methods to really kill your objectives so its really good for one run through. It can be creepy and you might need a guide a couple off times...  But if you want to run the gambit of a child murder horror game... this is it for you. :-D (FYI - Gore, Nudity, and Cold Hearted Death.)
411	1	a	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)
413	1	a	Don't look at your map since it seems it will always tell you what you need to do next. There is no option to turn this off. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.
415	1	a	Hahaha, this is such an evil game.
417	1	a	Devilishly good and entertaining gameplay.
419	1	a	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.
421	1	a	My Favourite Little Brother!
423	1	a	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.
126	0	a	A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen. First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it. The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target. In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).  To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place. These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight. You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.  You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol. I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending. The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.  I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea. The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun. Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it. If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle. Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.
127	0	a	i have some trouble with game :(  if i press M to open map &gt; crash
128	0	a	The idea for this game is great but the way it plays is really annoying. It lags cconstantly and the mouse control is horrible. The walking is way to slow and the running to fast for the lagging to keep up with and you end up running in to walls constantly. When you are given chores to do in the game it goes on for ages due to the bad controls and really just puts you off wanting to play onwards. Again its a great idea and if the problems are fixed i would happliy continue playing this game but for the moment im not planning to progress any further.
425	1	a	Yeah, I liked it. Feels so arbitrary plotted that I assume its plot is directly ripped from elsewhere, that aspect also means it's hard to have any â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing clue what to do: Time for your Biology lesson Lucius! Next go steal an obscurely hidden key in room #43 and get the water bottle from the second shelf in room #3 of a million rooms, then use that to access a draw in a study with bullets and then guess the combination to a safe and take out the gun and then load the gun and don't shoot it no you have to put it on an arbitrary desk near the teacher and tell him to shoot himself and he's like what and then he does it but you don't get blamed.  I mean, no, right, I liked it. Worth like a pound, it was fun and being an evil boy is cool, it's like I was really Tulock.

433	1	a	So many ways to kill people. It's sad how addicting this game is. xD

437	1	a	  Puzzle game which fails at horror genre and is edgy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. But still playable, my little sister enjoyed it.
131	0	a	At first glance, this seems like a sandbox game where you use your inhuman powers to creatively kill innocent people in a variety of ways. In actuality it's simply an un-optimized puzzle game which rewards your frustrated attempts to lift an object across the room for more than 3 seconds with another unsatisfying useless power in the next chapter. The game itself had so much potential but the improper coding and limits of what you can and can't do with your powers was highly annoying. Think you're going to make awesome use of your mind-control powers to have a little fun with your victim before the big kill? Think again, you can only do anything useful with your mind-control if it relates directly to the step in the puzzle you're trying to complete right now. Think that piano is going to stay in it's proper room and on the floor? Expect to see it flying through the hall ways like a drunken pilot! Even chores will sometimes not complete once you've done all the steps required, forcing you to restart from the last save point.  I can't believe this game even made it to a sequel with how many problems the current game has but I'm glad it did. Maybe on the next one they'll have all the bugs worked out and actually make this a fun game somehow. Until then I wouldn't spend $10 on this game, let alone $20. Time to wait for Lucius 2 to come on sale and see if they actually did it right this time.  1/5 Not a very enjoyable game.
439	1	a	Delightfully demented!
138	0	a	I'm on chapter 4 of what, 20, and I'm through with this game's crappy control, annoying music, boring, linear gameplay, bad acting, bad animations, bad AI. Hell, the bathroom where the janitor I killed was working still has his todo list and toolbox two months later, WTF?  No care at all producing a game. Spent less than five bucks on sale, was not worth it.
441	1	a	Hitman for possessed children. Underrated and interesting game.
140	0	a	A perfect example of why a lack of quality assurance can turn a mediocre game into a bad one. The concept behind Lucius is a good one - you are a demonic child whose purpose is to sacrifice souls to Lucifer in exchange for power - but the execution is lacking. Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.  Worse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free 'horror' tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious 'chase scene' music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.  Lucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.
443	1	a	If you're religious don't buy this game. But I'm not, so all hail Satan ;)
445	1	a	Setting people on fire.. yes please!!
447	1	a	I fixed it so I could see the mouse, but it'd be nice if it could go fullscreen boarderless.
449	1	a	great game
451	1	a	Lucius, a 'Puzzle' game with a gloomy and dark setting.  Pros : + New kind of puzzle, I call it a puzzle to kill a person without anyone know  Cons : - You can't solve the puzzle in several ways - The puzzle clue is somewhat hard, and needs attention to solve  Why I repeat the puzzle word is because, while it's kind of new for the theme of this game, Lucius is no more that a puzzle game or point to click adventure like 'Deponia' or other games.  From the theme and review, I was expected I would have several ways to kill a person, but it seems the game didn't meet my expectation and you can kill the person with just one way, the way the game designer designed the next person will die in that way.  I hope steam allow me to do a so-so review, because while the game is kind of a new breeze in the theme, it's kind of boring because you have to roam the house just to find the correct item or way to help you kill the person. Why don't the game let you decide what do you want to do with that person way to die?  I still recommended this game to you that haven't played the game. And it would be wise if you wait until the game on sale.
453	1	a	You are playing as Satan`s child.  10/10
455	1	a	seriously love this game
457	1	a	I fixed it so I could see the mouse, but it'd be nice if it could go fullscreen boarderless.
459	1	a	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended
461	1	a	You are playing as Satan`s child.  10/10
463	1	a	Hehehehe I wish I had more time to play this game.... To cut a long story short I'm just gonna say it is 'THE OMEN MOVIE = LUCIUS'.... You play as the Son of the Devil, who's born into a rich family....your aim is to kill people while maintaining your innocent disposition... Do this by cleaning up your toys like a goodboy, then go downstairs, turn the crosses upside down and lock your nanny in the freezer room.....(accidently of course ;) Graphics are fantastic, the sound and lighting are sensational and the setting is spooky. As you're killing these people so stylishly, you cant help but grin from ear to ear....and you always feel great when you please your father (The Devil) I give this game a 9/10.... Nuff said..... I must for every disturbed player like me :D
465	1	a	I completed this game in 5.7hrs and I felt like it was an endless puzzle action game... I loved it. It had a few puns once in a while.
467	1	a	Good storyline Has a surprised and emotional ending There are many secrets But this game has lots of bugs/glitches and no one fix it. Overall: 7/10 
469	1	a	Take hours and hours to find things to get through story
471	1	a	Be right back, feeling an immense urge to kill everyone, everywhere.   It's just great.  I don't usually score games, but like someone said previously, 666/666.
473	1	a	Overall this is a very hit and miss adventure game.  It starts off well enough. Slowly introducing you to the game mechanics and drip feeding new abilities, but then the game never really goes anywhere.  A few levels in and the mansion opens up, but then most of it is pointless space with the occasional hunt for an object in one of the rooms. I feel it would have been better to restrict each chapter to a certain area, but admittedly this would feel constrained.  The solutions themselves range from pretty straightforward to bordering on the illogical. Additionally there is only one way to solve each murder and sometimes feels like guesswork to deduce the intended method (clues can be obtained using an unlockable item).  One for adventure fans to pickup on sale, otherwise avoid.
475	1	a	Kill people and get supernatural powers in return from Satan, what else do you want?   .
477	1	a	I thought this was an awesome game. If you are a fan of the Omen then i highly recommend this game.
479	1	a	OMG I love it. its great. It is well worth the money
481	1	a	Cleaned my room and brushed my teeth. I'm such a good boy!   11/10
483	1	a	Had to play for 4 times more hours of normal storytime to get all of the achievements.   Would play for 4 times more hours again to get all of the achievements.   666/666 3:)
485	1	a	Story: To start off, you're Lucius, the son of Lucifer. You're born in a rich family and only found out the truth about your true origin when you turn 6. Throughout the game, you murdered members of your household with several interesting methods to gain more powers, such as Telekinesis, where you can move objects or tinker with certain machinery with your mind.   Personally, I felt that the story is very interesting as most games that we play usually put us in the shoes of a 'I want to save the world and protect my friends' kinda protagonist. However in this game, we play the 'fk u, fk u, and fk u' kinda guy, where you simply don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of the fact that you're just a 6 year old plotting to murder your entire household.   Gameplay: Similar to most sandbox games in areas such as where you can go around the manor and break stuff, explore around, talk to people, cycle around in the tricycle that was given for being a little good boy, but with a very huge difference. You can only kill someone in a set particular way. There's no other way around it. Nevertheless, it is still very interesting to witness the several different ways the game wants you to witness for the murder of each member of the household. However, due to the fact that you can only kill someone a certain way, the events and objects that you have to trigger or obtain can sometimes be fustrating to figure out yourself without looking at guides.   Achievements: All the achievements in the game are pretty easy to get. You simply have to look at guides while playing the game to make sure that you do not miss any, otherwise you have to replay the chapter that gives that achievement. However, if you want to achieve every single achievement from this game, I felt that it is pointless to try due to the fact that the last 2 achievements requires you to play 20 hours and 40 hours respectively. As mentioned before, the game only allows you to kill someone in a certain way. There's no flexibility in the amount of ways that you can kill someone, thus not giving any fun out of replaying the game again so that you can kill someone using another method. To add on, you can complete the game in 7 hours and you cannot afk in the game to achieve those 2 achievements. You would have to be 'playing' by moving around, and only that will make the game record the hours that you have played.   Graphics: Watching the gameplay of this game on platforms such as YouTube or twitch may cause some people to think that the game requires a very good graphic card to play, I have a NVIDIA NVS 5200M graphic card, which only allow me to run the game on low settings, but it still looks really good and it runs with a very decent fps of more than 60. It is still a plus if you have a good graphic card to play it on a higher setting though.  Price: Is it worth buying the game at full price? Well, $10.50 to entertain youself for more than 7 hours on average sounds pretty decent in my opinion. My call? Yes, buy it regardless whether it is on sale or not.
487	1	a	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie â€œThe omen.â€ The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.   Kinda Like it :D
489	1	a	Graphically unsatisfied. You could make it better
491	1	a	Oh boy, oh boy! What is better than being a Son of Satan and killing bunch of innocent people in your house while nobody know it's you...
493	1	a	It's good, just good.  Lore was what was keept me on the game.  Try it if you want but your expression might be 'meh, it's ok.'

499	1	a	I absolutely loved this game!!! 10/10
501	1	a	I used to love this game. Back when it first came out, I remember watching PewDiePie play it. And so I gave it a go. Didn't regret purchasing it one bit.
503	1	a	The game is very good! I had played it many times and enjoyed it.

151	0	a	There will be some spoilers in this review. Read at your own risk.  Lucius is a murder centric puzzle game where you play as the titular Lucius Wagner, a child of Lucifer. The premise of the game is rather interesting. Lucifer visits Lucius in a dream and bestows him the unholy mission of garnering the souls of people around Dante Manor. This is done through rather unintuitive and lacking puzzles.   The story takes place in the painfully large Dante Manor. From nearly the very beginning of the game, most of all of the manor is open to you. With the mechanics that exist in the game, this is NOT a good thing. It does not reward exploration (save for the aptly named 'Explorer' achievement). Furthermore, the puzzle solutions are extremely unintuitive and, quite frankly, boring. At several points, there shows potential for many possible ways to kill the chapter's target, but as the game requires deaths to be the ones laid out for you, it does not help at all (for example, one kill requires you to set someone on fire, but simply setting them on fire does not work. You have to douse him in gasoline and then setting him on fire will allow the kill.). More than that, the way some of these events transpire, it will severely test your suspension of disbelief (if you were to light a ciagrette at a stove, would YOU stick your face into the stove fire?) and the game simply can't be taken seriously.   Even worse still, this game at one (potentially two) point(s) tries to hopscotch between puzzle and action game. The controls and camera for this game are already pretty clunky as is and making it into a third person action game with a terrible camera does not help the game's case in the slightest. Lucius also suffers from having quite a few bugs (several things can go wrong during some chapters and will force you to restart the chapter) and collision issues (getting caught on nothing comes to mind).  Other bugs that come to mind are broken achievements. Some achievements do not work at times and can cause potential frustration.  All in all, this game is NOT worth your time or money. I got it on sale for 75% off ($4.99 instead of $19.99) and I still feel like I got ripped off.
152	0	a	Horrible game so far, Though idea is kind of nice, execution is really bad. Terrible lighting and animation, ugly character faces, too many long and boring cutscenes (which you can skip), linear gameplay, nothing about this game is good. 40 hours gameplay achieve? WTF
153	0	a	Got motion sickness from the repetitive lines and the 2005ish graphics.
154	0	a	Poor voice acting. Boring story. I honestly was about to fall asleep after watching the 5th long cutscene that is supposed to invite the player into learning the storyline, but it was just so poorly voiced and represented.
517	1	a	Very good game, especcialy for those, who want to play games with light part of fantasy. Game is something like Risen 2 and Harry Potter, but it's something better.  
519	1	a	Yes i do recommend this game it has good graphics, good story and everything to make a good horror game..
521	1	a	I Loved the game. I think it was well made but some things with the controls and game play could have been better. Only a few parts i got stuck on and got fustrated with. But overall i'd play another playthrough and look forward to some sort of sequal.
523	1	a	The Omen meets point and click adventure puzzle solving. Entertaining and provides you with some really dreadful deaths.
525	1	a	If you're a fan of old school horror movies, like The Omen, then you'll enjoy this.
527	1	a	Welcom to HELL 
529	1	a	\(._.\)  Good as  hell   (/._.)/
531	1	a	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10
533	1	a	running around a big â™¥â™¥â™¥ house made by some maze-maker with sever autism as some pre-pubescent hitler kid killing people and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for no apparent reason other than my dad is the devil and he said so.  10/10
535	1	a	this game is great and is so much fun bit sick and twisted but its got a lot of good things going for it
537	1	a	They need to make a Lucius II.  It is nice playing as the bad guy once in a while, but making the bad guy the 6 year old boy takes sinister to a whole new level. This is more of a story than a game as some of the controls are clunky and the game is completely linear. Still the game has a unique 'evil' feel about, a 'who-dun-it' atmosphere that is backed by a great musical score. **79%**
155	0	a	I was interested in the concept of this game but it just never really got me into it and I got bored fast. All the missions are very linear in that you can only kill the target in one way and it doesn't allow for any creativity or fun. Running around the mansion looking for the right items is tedious and it just doesn't have a lot of fun to it.
156	0	a	Really slow story line, amusing story telling, and overall decent atmosphere. Good when there's nothing else to play! :d
539	1	a	  One of the best games I have ever played... Wow. Everything was on point. Except for some subtitle mishaps but that didn't affect the experience much.  10/10  Had to use a guide, though, I didn't want to click through all the interactable objects in the game :D  The guesswork got boring at one point.
541	1	a	  Well yeah i would recommend this game, if someone has been â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you off lately, most terrible ways to kill a person, (hold dis gaim away for da kids, gives ya'll f nightmares) good graphics even though it's a old game, pretty good story line, yeah ( thumbs up ) &lt;3
543	1	a	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie â€œThe omen.â€ The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.   Kinda Like it :D
545	1	a	I enjoyed every moment of this game. Except the chores! (Just kidding) It was quite good and I'll play it again to get all those achievements and kill them all once more!
547	1	a	Yes i do recommend this game it has good graphics, good story and everything to make a good horror game..
549	1	a	I Loved the game. I think it was well made but some things with the controls and game play could have been better. Only a few parts i got stuck on and got fustrated with. But overall i'd play another playthrough and look forward to some sort of sequal.

553	1	a	If you're a fan of old school horror movies, like The Omen, then you'll enjoy this.
555	1	a	Welcom to HELL 
557	1	a	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.
559	1	a	I got it in a steam sale and it was really cheap, like less than a cinema ticket, and its pretty cinematic and heavy enough on plot to keep me satisfied. All in all a pretty good game. An achievement hunters dream.
561	1	a	It is kind of free world, as far as the house goes, so I had to resort to a walkthrough to figure out what I was supposed to be doing next. Other than that great game.
563	1	a	Creative game, like seriously. Through out the game u feel like ur getting away with everything that u've done, and at the end BOOM u r son of satan and u burn everything down MUAHAHAHAHA, ahem.  That being said, the bicycle control is weird and the achievements r just unreasonable. I mean really, 40 hours? Who would play this game for 40 hours?  Other than that, I had fun in this game and its definiely a game u should try.
565	1	a	Surprisingly a good game with decent graphics, just let down by all the bugs and ****ed up things.   7/10
567	1	a	I'm Christian.
569	1	a	Good fun game with a lot of gore. I just love murdering my family in the morning....HAIL SATAN!
571	1	a	The Omen meets point and click adventure puzzle solving. Entertaining and provides you with some really dreadful deaths.

575	1	a	Welcom to HELL 
577	1	a	It'll make you a sadist. If you're a nice person you probably shouldn't play it.  7/10
579	1	a	An indie-game that requires intelligence, patience... and sometimes google.  Absolutely fascinating concept; with many, many allusions put into the game. Just the fact that the mansion is called 'Dante Mansion' is kind of a no-brainer, but passing names like Wuornos and Gacy; is lost on those who do not know. I, however, was not lost - and found the game to be refreshingly original.  It is a challenging game, not only in having to solve the 'puzzles' - but in an ethical sense.  A breath of fresh air/fire, this one.
581	1	a	I highly recommend this game for any horror fans out there. Gameplay-wise it's more of an adventure/stealth-game but the story is very similar to the movie 'The Omen'. You play as Lucius, son of the devil, and you do his evil deeds for him, mainly killing everyone in the mansion where you live, I had great fun with this one! And it sometimes is quite a challange to figure out what steps to take in order to complete the killings!
583	1	a	- Good game - Acceptable Graphs Too bad it's too short
585	1	a	The game isn't the best but it's not a disgrace so I recommend it for everyone :)
587	1	a	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.
589	1	a	Play as the son of Lucifer, just make sure the grown ups do not catch you or it is back to your room and no dinner.
591	1	a	Good game, but you only realise its potential 75% through the game. Not enough playtime. 6/10
593	1	a	i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.
595	1	a	A twisted game that is definitely for horror fans, if you love movies like The Omen then this is for you. IMy only complaint is that the killings are scripted so there is no freedom on how you kill your victims.
597	1	a	\(._.\)  Good as  hell   (/._.)/
599	1	a	Good fun game with a lot of gore. I just love murdering my family in the morning....HAIL SATAN!
601	1	a	 Excellent plot, good animations, easy achievements and mother wearing the same clothes for months.  Recommended!!! . 
159	0	a	  What is this game exactly? Just a kid who has to find many different ways to kill everyone. Overall gets repetitive and boring and no actual plot to continue it. For the price of free I guess it was ok.    3/10  
603	1	a	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied.
605	1	a	Lucius is a horror game that combines stealth killing like from Hitman games with puzzle solving but will you want to play this game ? In Lucius you play as Lucius who is the son of the devil. On his Six birthday Lucifer Grants Lucius powers but in exchange for souls which Lucius has to deliver to him by killing his fathers employees. So how is this game ? Overall Lucius is a very fun horror game. Now first the atmosphere is great. The entire game takes place in a mansion which is really confusing to navigate but theres alot of stuff to see and explore another thing thats really cool about this game is to figure out the ways that you need to dispose of enemies. You keep a journal which tells you about the victim and his or hers weakness which sometimes helps and sometimes doesnt. The game also has some illogical puzzles but just minor stuff and thats pretty much it. And plus this game takes inspiration from the Omen so you can practiclly say its Omen The video game. Overall its a really good game with a few small problems. I give Lucius a 7/10
160	0	a	Do NOT buy this game unless it's less than a $1. The only reason I've 'played' this game for 60 hours is to get that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing 'Addicted' achievement which requires you to play this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over 40 hours.
161	0	a	It's a shame Lucius is lacklustre. It's a neat concept for a dark and morbid puzzle/adventure game. It's a less-than-subtle homage to the 1976 film 'The Omen'. In it you play as the titular Lucius, a 10 year old boy to whom Satan (who looks and sounds like a poor Jack Nickelson impersonator) reveals is the antichrist. You're tasked with killing the entirety of the household, including your surrogate family, in ways that draw no suspicion to you, or your satanic nature. Asside from an entertaining concept the acting is probably the best thing about this game. Watching your family lose their minds over the inexplicable deaths tormenting them grows more and more harrowing as you progress. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. This game is a technical mess. Objectives are unclear, gameplay is stifling, the sidequests are boring and the glitches are rampant. I spent a whole hour on one of the early missions because you cant use your satan powers when in direct line of sight of NPCs. After looking it up in a guide it turned out I had to stand behind a small, suspended rack of meat about 2 feet away from where I was standing. On the plus side, i found out if you walk lengthways into a door while it's opening or closing, it'll slingshot you outside of the map, allowing you to get a better sense of the houses layout. Later in the game you can unlock a gun and mind-wiping abilities, but aside from the tutorial, I found no place to use either of these for the whole game. Another sidequest reward is a Jack-in-the-box, the function of which I was never able to figure out, but it had a limit of 2 charges of whatever it did. This was my reward for spending half an hour gathering socks from around the house and putting them into the laundry bin, one by one. Despite the open world, it becomes quickly apparent that there's only one way to complete each mission. Ideally, a game like this would involve forethought, strategy and precision. Instead it's just trial and error see-what-this-thing-does. For the finale of the game it takes a stark departure where you are suddenly just throwing fireballs at people like the fantastic four. It feels like the core gameplay just gave up.  Overall, Lucius is a neat concept but the execution feels rushed and incomplete. Can't recommend.
162	0	a	it sucks! big amount of glitches , boring as hell, saving system fail and NO CONTROL SUPPORT - WTF , this is a console game that you cant play with a joystick..
607	1	a	These are the kinda kids Joesph Fritzl should of kept in his basement
609	1	a	must play! if you love killing Lol!
164	0	a	The controls are stiff and the gameplay matches. While you do get to kill in roundabout ways, the entire interaction doesn't go smoothly and gets extremely boring extremely quicly.
165	0	a	Decent game. 6/10 The graphics are pretty well designed. The gameplay is a bit akward. It submerges you into the game with hardly any instruction. I was stuck on the second murder.  It's not worth the money unless you just enjoy figuring out stuff on your own.
611	1	a	demon babies make this game amazing buy this game and you get the chance to be satans little boy and murder your own family for satan with satanic powers!
170	0	a	Worst game I've seen this far. I was stuck in-game after some chapters and was never able to finish the game even with help of forums. There is also no ability to save. It looked promising but you will get detected often and 'game over'
171	0	a	This game must have been made by the devil because it's unholy. This game is the Citezen Kane of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ because nothing is better than this game at sucking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
613	1	a	Love this game!! Lucius is creepy as heck though. I sometimes had to take breaks from playing because he just creeps me out too much. Overall this is a must play game... on sale for $5 what do you have to lose other than your soul...
615	1	a	  definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard, I used my internet to get some hints because you need to guess where the thing that you searching for that will help you to end the game but in conclusion its one of the best games that i have ever played, and i played alot, i give 8/10 only because that the game pretty hard
172	0	a	First time playing, this game was truly amazing, you're playing as the killer for once, as the bad guy, as the guy others fear and not the other way around. Mostly inspired by the Omen films I guess, you're basically the son of Lucifer. You live in this big mansion and you need to slowly kill basically everyone around you. Concept seemed fun, and it intrigued me to buy this game.  You'll gain different powers as you progress through the game, but most of the time, you'll need to rig something to make it count for a kill. Now my problem with this, is there are no waypoints or no hints whatsoever, it is expected from you to immediatly know what to do or where to go. You'll probably look through guides a lot while playing this.   If you miss a key item somewhere you'll be stuck till you find it. It's basically a linear game, you only have 1 choice and you can only execute the kill in a predetermined way. It's fun for the first time, but later feels like a chore. Especially with the addition of those 2 hour farming achievements, it's just a big drag.  AI is poorly designed and most of the time you'll see them crashing into walls, walking and turning around at times for no reason. Storyline is predictable if you know the genre.  I'd give this game a positive review, but it's basically a 1 time play. Those hour achievements could've been better if the game had a new game + mode, or a mode in which you could preform kills in a different way. All in all, overall disappointed with the game, had a lot of potential.
617	1	a	If you liked the Omen you will love this game.
619	1	a	I never thought being the child of Satan would be good fun. I do have a few problems with this game, but would recommend it overall. I feel like some of the achievments are a bit ridiculous and time-consuming, yet aren't fun. (Side note: I have been trying to get the music box achievment and still cannot get that even though I am sure I am right.) There are some things in the game that do not run as smooth as I would like, but this is an older game so it is actually kinda impressive. Just be careful using your tricycle because you might get stuck in a wall. It happens, no big deal. Some of the voice acting is a little cringy, but the gameplay itself is pretty fun. The story isn't exactly award-winning, but it doesn't totally suck either.   TLDR: Game isn't bad, and it fun but I personally would not pay full price for it. Achievements are annoying at times. Game itself, ignoring achievements, its entertaining. Not the best game, not the worst.
621	1	a	  definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard, I used my internet to get some hints because you need to guess where the thing that you searching for that will help you to end the game but in conclusion its one of the best games that i have ever played, and i played alot, i give 8/10 only because that the game pretty hard
623	1	a	The good first: Lucius is interesting, macabre, and keeps you wondering who you get to kill next. The storyline is pretty good. A couple of twists keep it interesting (even if you sort of see them coming, you get to say 'I knew it!'). I really did enjoy this game, and it's a game that I would reccommend... if you get it on sale.  The bad: The game gives you literally no options. You have to do everything in EXACTLY the way the developers intended, or you can't complete the chapter. Personally, I'd prefer a little bit of an option on how to kill my victims... I don't want to complete elaborate schemes with no choices. Often, quick timing is required with skills that are less than precise, which can prove to be incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend it to those who rage easily. One scene alone I played for about 45 minutes before I could beat it, and had to continuously kill myself to start the chapter over. Furthermore, there is no 'save' or 'load' option. If you lose a level, you start at the beginning of that level. The levels aren't too long though, so it didn't bother me too much. Some of the cutscenes are very long; I was almost late to work because I was determined to get through the cutscene(s) that were playing, and it took 14 minutes (I had figured itwould only be 2-5 minutes). It's pretty glitchy, and some of your 'powers' are very difficult to control.  Overall: I do recommend this game. It's an interesting premise. Although it could have been better executed, I took it for face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. If glitches or elaborate gameplay irritate you, this may not be the game for you. If you can work around the glitches and enjoy games that are more like movies that you interact with, it's 100% for you.
625	1	a	you get to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up your whole family and be satan 10/10 in my books.
174	0	a	Too Many Unskippable Cutscenes  That's basically the one fatal thing about this game I've got 50 mins in the game and I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you not 30 of those were spent between cutscenees and loading screens. It is neither difficulty nor nerve that prevents me from going forward in this game, it's dreading more of those unskippable cutscenes. I bought this game to play a devil child, not watch some cgi re-enactment of 'The Omen'
175	0	a	It\'s fun to kill people but this game is boring af
627	1	a	Great family game. Recommended for children ages 4-6.
176	0	a	This game seems half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.
177	0	a	You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play. If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you. The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.
629	1	a	I am Lucius, six-year-old son of Lucifer. I can shatter objects with telekinesis, control peopleâ€™s minds, erase memories and even set things on fire with the power of thought alone, but right now, Iâ€™m running around a house carrying a single dirty sock. Iâ€™m supposed to be killing someone, but to draw attention away from my suspicious behaviour, Iâ€™m doing some chores around the house for my mum. One of those chores involves collecting dirty socks and underwear from various peopleâ€™s rooms and taking them to the laundry room, and it takes forever because I canâ€™t carry more than one sock at a time. There is something very wrong here.
187	0	a	The son of the devil possesses all the grace and maneuverability of a pontoon boat with rocket thrusters. Who told you people this game was finished? It is a struggled just to walk through a door. Seriously. I'd like my $5 back.
188	0	a	don't bother. Buggy unfinished and Linear. Frustrating endgame, poor design. Decent concept but no imagination and very scripted use of powers. Dissapointing
189	0	a	This game makes me sad. It's a classic story of 'so much potential.' You basically play as a little devil-spawn kid (ala 'The Omen') and run around the house plotting and executing the murders of various occupants in your house without getting caught.  The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are. It would be a lot more fun if you could wander around exploring and gathering and then choose an execution method based on your inventory, rather than having to find the items for the single available method.  The other problem I had with this game was that it has far too many cutscenes which last for too long and happen too often. It interrupts the gameplay. At one point, you have to sneak out of your room to get some rat poison. You have to sneak around without being noticed, which is actually a good deal of fun. So I picked up the rat poison and expected to have to sneak back, but instead there was a cutscene that had me waking up the next morning. One of the best parts of the old Thief game was trying to get back out after you've accomplished your goals. No such 'extra drama' here. Just do your task and watch the next cutscene.  I was very happy I was able to give this game a try, but I can't say I recommend it. It's just too frustrating, the voice acting is poor, the characters are either unbelievably mean or oblivious, your actions are too limited, and worst of all, the story isn't compelling.
190	0	a	I haven't played this game for very long yet but from what I have I can tell I'm utterly annoyed the controls, the way the menu works and the amount of bugs.  It's sad because the concept is good. I like the idea of playing as a kid who kills people and has the ability to contact with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' Devil but...this game didn't put it off very wel. I certainly won't stop trying to enjoy this game but I won't recommend it at all.
191	0	a	I guess, seeing trailers a lot of people may get an impression that Lucius is something like sandbox killing game... a Hitman game with demonic powers. Sadly - it's not.  In a game, you play a role of Lucius, a young boy, who - thanks to his Grandfather's occult involvement - posses demonic powers. Each month, he's visited by Lucifer himself and each month he has to kill a new target. It's an interesting, if not slightly controversial concept, which should have allowed for wide spectrum of possibilities. And even first 3 of the chapters show a fair amount of potential that this game should have used to maximum.  Well, the main problem of the game is that - there are no alternative solutions to a problem. After 5 or 6 missions, you realize that - even though 'the playground' is getting bigger and bigger - the concept and possibilities the game gives you stay exactly the same. This essentially makes the game just a shallow adventure game, where player's task isn't to find the best way to kill a target, but finding a way that developer's designed.... even if it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so - in later levels, you're running back and forth, through a gigantic mansion, trying to find that one object that you need to finish up your task, only to find something that is as big as rock or battery(!). This alone wouldn't be so bad, if the game gave you enough hints on what you're looking for or what you have to do, but that isn't a case.  Not only that - the game sometimes doesn't even fallow the rules of 'smart level design' and places many objects that you have to use in shadows and badly lighten places - the type of places, where a player is least likely going to look for them. I remember being stuck in chapter 10 for good 10 minutes, only to realize that objects I was looking for were hanging on the wall - the only place in the entire the room, that was in the shadows. Finally, the design on a mansion itself is extremely confusing and it's going to take good few hours, before you're going to learn where to go, to not run in circles.  From all of that, you may get an impression that I completely hated the game. That isn't the case. When everything was going fine and I had any idea what to do, where to find it etc. - the game was fairly entertaining. And storyline - even though, idea behind it felt flat on its face after 7 chapters - kept me interested enough to keep playing till the very end. The number of achievements also helped quite a bit, making me feel rewarded even for the most minor of tasks.  When it comes to graphics - Lucius looks decent. It's more or less something that I'd except from a game of this calibre. There are few textures that don't look right and few places in a house, that feel empty, but it isn't anything game breaking. Character animations sometimes look a little stiff - especially facial animation could use some work. There are also some weird problems with optimization, where a framerate drops in some areas for no obvious reason, but - once again - because it isn't really an action game, I don't consider it a major problem.  Lucius also has a decent music. Although, by the end of the game, you'll hear each of the tracks way too many times. Sound assets are good and fitting for the most part. Voice acting however is a mixed bag. I've played an English version and I personally wouldn't say that for the most part actors are doing a bad job. It's more of a case that script they had to work with and lines they had to deliver aren't very good. It's also obvious for me that in many places, they weren't given enough directions on how should they play their roles, which results in some hilarious conversations in few parts of the game.  Bottom line - I'd avoid Lucius for the price of 20â‚¬ or even 10â‚¬. However - with 75% discount, I could recommend it to people that like adventure games or simply don't mind checking walkthroughs. It's a 6-8hrs long mediocre game, that sometimes shows its potential, but at the same time - is flawed with problems.
192	0	a	It\'s fun to kill people but this game is boring af
193	0	a	Too Many Unskippable Cutscenes  That's basically the one fatal thing about this game I've got 50 mins in the game and I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you not 30 of those were spent between cutscenees and loading screens. It is neither difficulty nor nerve that prevents me from going forward in this game, it's dreading more of those unskippable cutscenes. I bought this game to play a devil child, not watch some cgi re-enactment of 'The Omen'
631	1	a	Saw this game on sale and thought I'd try it out.  Haven't stopped playing it since purchase and can truly say it's amazing for those who love a good little horror game :) Recommend to those with a tough gut and sick humour &lt;3

633	1	a	Great family game. Recommended for children ages 4-6.
635	1	a	A very good game with beautiful art about how is a common day in the life of satan's son.   Pros: - Good story - Good voice acting. - Violence  Cons: - Short gameplay - Some bugs
637	1	a	it has a pretty bad storyline, but if you want to you can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around with stuff in the house
639	1	a	This must be the feeling  to be like Damien Thorn.
641	1	a	restarted game for tricycle      SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING WORTH IT.   
643	1	a	10/10 would never play again even though I would be given a nailgun at the beginning
645	1	a	Its an awesome game. You have to give it a try you won't be disappointed, cant wait for Lucius 2
647	1	a	666

198	0	a	  You play as the son of the Lucifer who goes on a killing spree while hiding in plain sight and make sure nobody suspects you in this game. Sounds fun, right?  Sadly, no, this game isn't as fun as it sounds on theory.  I really tried to like this game, I really did. But with mediocre story, boring puzzles, annoying music, confusing gameplay (you'll definitely need a walkthrough at some points) and not to mention the random glitches, I just cant make myself recommend this on a full price. Luckily this goes on sale/giveaway every so often so if you still feel like giving it a try, get it then.
199	0	a	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.
657	1	a	Wish to kill your household members in a gruesome way? If yes, this the game for you. It can be whip to get your brains whacked up to think and plot your murder. Despite the bugs, which can be really infuriating sometimes; this game is a gem of sorts. Head chopping, sending a nail through the face, burning a man alive... These are some of the ways of murder you will experience, which can be really satisfying. This game is gem, i hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
659	1	a	HOW did i miss this AMAZING game until now!? IT IS AMAZING!! you basically play as Damian from the Omen... and it's HELL ON EARTH! hahaha!!
661	1	a	Pretty good game. It is an amazing horror game where you have to murder people living in your own house... AS A SIX YEAR OLD! Might sounds weird but it is pretty fun for some odd reason.
663	1	a	This is fun i would reccomend it xD
201	0	a	Boring. Plays like a crappy version of Hitman, but with only like one way to kill targets.
665	1	a	I bought this on sale and got 10 hours of entertainment. The deaths are creative and gruesome but it's a shame there is only one for each target, this considerably reduces any replayability. What a shame there isn't a level editor.
202	0	a	Some of the cringiest modelling and voice acting I've ever seen.  Horrible map design, horrible quest design, really just quite a poorly made game in general.  3/10
203	0	a	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.
667	1	a	Thats ok son!I'll bring some body for kill them if u don't like them.  LucÄ±os is like problem kid,he directly become psychopath when saw someone around not like. Nice game if u wanna make ur self nerveus,very well go ahead :-/  Some of control not good enough in game when u set up new skill(s),details same like 'Max Payne' . 7/10  Creator/Producer that's ok son,i paid for it n u earned well.Isn't it?
205	0	a	Doesnt work for me Menu is glitched  10/10 IGN would buy again
669	1	a	Also try 'Lucius II'.
206	0	a	This is a game I got on sale for $1. The most i'd pay for it is maybe 3, and after getting to chapter 5 i can't recommend it. Figuring out how to kill your victims is an extremely boring process, probably even more so if i didnt use any walkthroughs or anything like that. It's also a big flaw that each of the victims only has one way they can die, so you get no freedom in that, which is what would make the game fun (if it had it). Kinda fun, very very boring and not worth the work once you finally figure out how to finish the chapter. I'd only recommend it it's on a big sale.  p.s. my hours aren't accurate, ive probably left the game open on accident a few times.
671	1	a	Fun to play. I liked it.

209	0	a	Just not fun. Its almost like a puzzle game, but it is made in a weird way that just doesn't work at all. It's a cool theme, being the spawn of satan, trying to kill random people without being suspected or worse, cought red-handed, but it's just so difficult to play. I think there's a second one, so I would look that one up. Probably fixed a lot of bugs and functionality.
673	1	a	OmerGherd such a goood game!!! :D Kill people and no one knows its the little kid!! MWHAHAHAHHA &gt;:) Any way haven't really played a LOT of this game but with what i have played a freakin' LOVE it! :D GET IT NOW WHILST ITS LIKE 74P!!!
675	1	a	I tried to get into this but i can't i simply can't
677	1	a	:v Nice Game And Nice Porn c:
679	1	a	this game is a yes but lemme tell you something ,  good: the graphics are good , 60 fps lock on vsync , mind games , easy achievements , chores and gifts ,  bad : after the last update (or so i noticed) : alot of bugs , if i ride the tricycle into the wall in the alastair stairs/backroom , it noclipped and i got out to the street , picked ivor's bottle on chapter 4 first time and i gave it to tom , now i restarted couldn't get it , i can take the one in the closet only , after killing alastair on christmas , he lived on tom's chapter , dunno how but he was standing there , driver smoke chapter the rug i am supposed to make him sniff didn't fall with him , stayed floating . i killed lucius' mom on chapter 6 by fault and no one noticed , you don't need to go put the plug to load the nailgun with air , when i killed susan she jumped from the bathroom and then everyone was flying including me and the house was underneath us , i have much more of these glitches screenshotted in my profile ..  flashlight lucifer's head and see what happens ,   all in all , 8/10 one of the best mind devilish games i have played    EDIT: would recommend this game when it's on sale ! not worth over 15 if you like playing long story driven games , the story is short but awesome gameplay
681	1	a	gonna play this, recommended
683	1	a	it gets borin but hey i got it on sale i really cant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for a game i bought for 0.99$
685	1	a	The game first appears to be some kind of  The Omen  tribute, where you can raise all Hell and make a mess of this little imaginary world. It could not be more far from the truth. But it does result to be a good puzzle-solving grotesque game. It will get your brains to hurt, not for its difficulty, but for the absurdity of some of them. I highly recommend to play it with a walkthrough and a guide, and trust me, you will thank me later. Bizarre, bloody, a sin itselft for some - but certainly fun. Turn down your crosses and leave your Jesus Christ crap at home, buddies!  6/10
687	1	a	Saw boobies, gave review.
689	1	a	It's good, the end is weird, but it's good.
691	1	a	great game
222	0	a	I wanted to like this game but the controls and save function kept me constantly frustrated so I stopped playing it. Wish there was an arrow option and for the love of God why no saving??? Dear every game developer: Allow us to save at will. Why they refuse to add this function is beyond me. You will get a thumbs down from me every time if you don't allow that.
693	1	a	To all atheists, and agnostics, this is actually a fun game. It would remind you of the Hitman series if you're familiar with it. The controls are a bit clunky, and the graphics are not bad per se, but the gameplay's nice. I wouldn't consider it a 'fun' game, though. There's no replayability, except when you want to get all the achievements. So, technically, the interesting aspect of this game is its story.   The death scenes of your targets are fun to watch, though.   Overall, it's a good game, not great, not bad. Just good. Also, there are not many games that focus more on Satanic references and all, so this is one of the good ones.  To all devoted Christians, nothing to see here. Move along.
695	1	a	If you are super religious God would probably look down on you for playing this game. It makes you evil to the core.
697	1	a	A very good game, I highly recommed for people who like puzzle solvings and, hell, this game is quite funny sometimes.
699	1	a	Bought this game because my wife likes these type of games.. She seems to like it.. controls are a little frustrating but overall it is good.
226	0	a	I feel that this game has no freedome of playstyle. It is very boring and I would not recommed it to anyone who likes to stay awake while playing a game!
701	1	a	Saw a person, killed them Saw another person, killed them too Oh and saw another person...killed them But I did see the Devil, I didn't kill him
703	1	a	  ....
705	1	a	Yeah it has a few gameplay bugs, but nothing that fully derails the experience. It's almost therapeutic to be the bad guy for once. The VERY VERY bad guy.  So see life from the other side for once...just please, don't try any of this at home ;)
228	0	a	It had so much potential and fails miserably.

707	1	a	If you're looking for a positive review, then you're in the wrong place, HOWEVER, if you're here for a tremendous chicken Stir Fry recipe, THEN LOOK NO FURTHER!  - Serves 4 - 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook - 325 calories / serving - Healthy  INGREDIENTS:  - 1 orange, zested and juiced - 2tbsp soy sauce - 2tbsp sesame oil - 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli - 5cm (2in) piece root ginger - 1tbsp sunflower oil - 1 garlic clove, finely sliced - 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced - 150g Straight To Wok Noodles - 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slices  METHOD  Step 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.  Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.  Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger. Then heat a large frying pan or wok, add the sunflower oil, heat it until sizzling, and fry the ginger till it's crisp.  Step 4 - When it's done, remove with a slotted spoon. Add the chicken and garlic, and stir-fry until just browned. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and set aside.  Step 5 - Add the red pepper and broccoli and stir-fry for around 2-3 minutes until it's just tender. Add the soy sauce mixture, bring it to the boil then return the chicken to the pan and heat through. Serve with noodles.
232	0	a	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!
233	0	a	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.
709	1	a	Bought this game because my wife likes these type of games.. She seems to like it.. controls are a little frustrating but overall it is good.
711	1	a	First Impressions: You're a little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devil child that murders people and makes it look like accidents. If you're looking for a satanic murder puzzler then this is it.  7/10
713	1	a	Amasing game love it i like it more then Lucius 2 myself man i really like just taking screen shots of the deaths. 8.5/10
715	1	a	Originally I was sceptical about this game, but it was a really nice surprise for me. Story is pretty good and interesting, event with really weird ending (at least the action one, the puzzle one is a much better). Graphics is nice with solid performance optimization. The problems of this game are the bugs... many bugs. Many times I was stuck behind some stuff and I could get out from there, once I even somehow fall out by the texture to the outdoors and could not go back to the mansion. Also the game is loading too long always and when you encounter a bug you have to load the game over and over again (at least I've encountered critical bug when I had to load the game again only about 3 times). Game is also pretty short, it took me only 7.6 hours to get 56/58 achievements and now to get the rest of them I have to be ingame for 40 hours total... Like WTH, it is not even counting to be in menu, so I could just let the game running and doing something else and now I have to add another monitor to have the possibility to do something else if I want that achievements.  But despite the game having some negatives, I still recommend this game. 7/10
717	1	a	Heyyo, It's a neat and fun indie game... some of the ways you commit the 'murders' or 'assissted suicides' are pretty neat. It's a good game for the low price.. just not a very long game.
719	1	a	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.

725	1	a	More like explore the mansion simulator,a real mediocore game,could be better if the house wasnt so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing big. Pros: - 9,99$ for this game is worth it. But you should wait for a sale more like for 1.49$ or something - 20+ Hours if you explore look for secrets and simply have fun with the mansion -Creative ways to kill -Lots of details -Nicely optimized -AI is kinda good... -You're a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing demon and a son of Lucifer how cool is that?! Cons: -IN THIS EPISODE OF WAT! DAFUQ AM I SUPOSED TO DO HERE  -LUCIOUS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥  -BORING CHARACTERS! -THIS ISNT A HOUSE BUT A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING MAZE -CONTROLS SUPPORT SO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING AWFUL -WHAT AM I SUPOSED TO DO WITH THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING DEMON POWERS THEY HAVE NO USE AT ALL! Conclusion: But either way It's a nice game,but avoid this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, 69/100 just because there is a nude scene ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) and It's nice for a chil after playing all those FPS and head exploding games. Get it only if you are a story kind of player.
727	1	a	I played this once and to be honest, Its a really good game. I bought it again....because of......ACHIEVEMENTS.....DUN DUN DUN.  This game deserve a rating of 99999/10 Thanks 4 reading.
238	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up devilish game
239	0	a	Great idea, bad execution.  The entire game feels really repetitive and gets boring after a couple hours. I have never really gotten into the story even though I have finished it. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.   Pros:  - Interesting idea   Cons:  - Limited gameplay. You have only one way to complete your mission even though there are a lots of possibilities that you can think of. - Bad voice acting. It is cringe worthy at times. - Frustrating hints. It's either a little hint per stage or no hints at all. I've spent quite a lot of time just running around the house trying to find something to progress further. Eventually I got bored and had to look up for a hints online.

735	1	a	fun game, just don't play it if you're under 10 years old, there are enough underage psychopath killers in this world we don't want another. Worth playing this game though not worth buying the second game
737	1	a	Good concept and story, but sometimes glitchy.
255	0	a	I don't get the wow feeling when killing people, just the meh generic feeling.
739	1	a	The Omen ripoff, really liked it.
256	0	a	wow this game left me with so many mixed feelings being an Omen fan will leave you loving the house's layout, the graphics are fine and most of the murders are fun the gameplay gets long and boring not long after, unlikeable characters, buggy physics, stupid final mission
741	1	a	Great game, classic, and I beat it within the four hours I played. Not worth buying for the $10, asI bought it on sale for $1, so I would wait until then.
743	1	a	+
745	1	a	  Ive only played 13 minutes i dont remember playing this game i think its fun. ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
747	1	a	BEST GAME EVER ~_~ STEAM TRADING CARD ART IS THE BEST!
749	1	a	So, my internet isn't great, and yet I really wanted Lucius. So I got it and downloaded it overnight. During the night, I had the weirdest dreams ever. When I woke up, I looked at the download. It had finished, but when I glanced at the download meter, I noticed that the highest kb/s it had reached was 66.6.  666/666, would be cursed by Satan again
751	1	a	It's like Hitman, but you play as a 6 year old hellspawn instead.  10/10
753	1	a	HAIL SATAN!!! 9/11-IGN
755	1	a	Great game!
264	0	a	I don't really know what to say but when i was trying to play it was messing up, I can't do the first kill because the maid wouldn't go in the freezer and one of my friends said it was laggy and buggie so i don't know what to do with it
757	1	a	HAIL SATAN!!! 9/11-IGN
759	1	a	For those that dont know if its worth buying it here is some reasons: You kill people I think those reasons were really convincing  Thank me later!

771	1	a	A six-year old killing everyone in the mansion  why?  For the glory of satan of course!  10/10
773	1	a	It's definitely one of my favourite games.  Creative Fun Addictive Cheap price
775	1	a	Did you like Hitman?  If answer is yes, then get Lucius.  If answer is no, then bog off and go back to The Sims.  Why is it similar to Hitman? Accident. The safest, the hardest, but the most sophisticated way to get rid of someone. Let no shadow of suspicion lay on you. The farther into the game, the more powers you possess and they stronger they become. Use your hiding skills, use items, use devilish powers to achieve what your 'Father' tells you and don't get caught. Even if they find you, you still have a chance to escape. How? 'Father' teaches you how to trick weak people to act according to your will (or rather His will).  Anyway. You are Devil's disciple and you have to kill your targets. Area of your actions isn't big - it's a manor. 3 floors. Several people. Each must be killed in a specific way. Lucius is a very linear game. You can't choose targets and means to kill them. Your task is to figure out how to achieve this predicted result. You have the 'tools', sometimes you have to find certain items, but in general you have to play in a specific way to set things (sometimes literally) in motion. Push them over railing. Kill them with an icicle. Burn them... and many others. Souls is what you need.  Satan is your Master and you do what he says. Please him and bring him more souls.  Graphics is fine. Sound is fine. Music is nice. Location is ok (a bit empty at times). Mechanics is simple. Story is good. Pacing is ok.  So what's wrong with this game? Very linear. Little replay value. Simplicity.  As with every game you expect to play it more that one time or at least offer something more on another playthrough. That's not happening.   My suggestion is to treat Lucius like and point and click adventure game (just this time happening from 3rd person perspective). Those don't allow second playthrough as they serve all they got in first playthrough. Try to figure out puzzles on your own. If you like stealth, puzzle and adventure genres then Lucius is a good choice. It is a solid game overall, but nothing else.
273	0	a	Unlike real games, Lucius gives you almost no hints. It's a 3rd person game where you use your powers to murder people as you play as the son of the devil. More people you kill, the more your power grows in the story. The first time is a tutorial and basically tells you how to kill the first person and you're told each and every new target you get a hint in the jurnal. The hint is invisible to me or doesn't give me much of a suggestion. I was meant to kill some guy who smoked, ok. I realised damaging the gas on the cooker would be the point, however I had no idea how to make him go into the kitchen and light up.  A very interesting idea, but it falls flat and the arm animation on the characters seem a little...off.
777	1	a	You get to kill a guy with a saw using telekinesis 10/10 would recommended to those under 12 with Satanic urges.
274	0	a	came across far too many glitches in the game when playing... so now i am not even going to play anymore... between someone walking into the freezer, instead of into the hallway... and dropping the toy into the box but it keeps resetting... and then having to quit because of a glitch and sending me back another 10 minutes... screw that
779	1	a	This game is horrible.
781	1	a	Lucius name should be Satans-Little-Helper...
278	0	a	this is the worst garbage that i have ever played... i want my 2.99 back
783	1	a	Spawn of Satan simulator.
785	1	a	This game is more fun than being satan himself. it's worth buying even doe it's old a lil, but still one of the greatest games that never would never die. &lt;3 COME TOGETHER TOGETHER AS ONE COME TOGETHER FOR LUCIFER'S SON  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–€â–ˆâ–€â–ˆâ–„  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–„â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â–€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–„â”€â–€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–€â–€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â–ˆâ–„â–€  â”€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â–€â–€â”€â–ˆ  â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–€â–€â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–€â–€â–€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ Look son â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ a good Game â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â–€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–„â–„â–„â–„â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–€â–€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–„â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â–„â–€â–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–„â–€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–„â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ–€â”€â–€â–ˆâ–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–€â–€â–€â–„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–ˆ  â”€â–ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–€â–„â”€â”€â–€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

285	0	a	It was fun killing people.  2/10
286	0	a	-Unoptimized -Buggy -Unnecessary gore -Unlogical achievements -Boring easter eggs -Complicated interface/gameplay -Weak&amp;uncompleted storyline Waste of time
287	0	a	rubbish graphics boring gameplay a botched job do NOT RECCOMEND

295	0	a	This game is just 0 out of 100
296	0	a	Only played 82 minuted so you can hardly call this a review but this game has one of the most just down right depressing graphics and storylines ever! Kind of fun i guess, the first 4 missions take like 3 minutes to finish even less, but not one of the worst indie titles on steam, also the voice acting sucks aids, but i would not pay full price for this crap it's not worth it wait until it's on sale or get a retail cdkey from the internet. 4/10

300	0	a	To be very blunt, this game was not what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting a sand box-y style horror game where I would be given mission(s) and could choose to fulfill them however I wanted, what I soon discovered was that this is more of a point and click adventure game, where they expect you to follow very specific rules and paths in the game. On top of that, the graphics suck, they are kind of outdated, like Grandtheft Auto 3 graphics and even on good hardware seem to have issues with frame rates.   Quite frankly, it's a massive disappointment.  It would have been amazing if I could go about killing the people in the house, how I wanted, with multiple endings and murders, but that just isn't what this game is like.   What's even more annoying is at the start of each mission, they usually give very, very vague hints and that's about it. I don't expect a puzzle to be handed to me, but when all you give me is like, 'I don't like this person' and that's it, it can become incredibly difficult.  The AI is also â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to say the least. During the tutorial the characters mother spent the entire time simply walking up against a locked door watching me do the entire thing without saying a word.   it's not even remotely close to a 'open world' when not only are rooms locked off if you have no buisness being in them, but there are extremely specific guidelines for each mission you have to follow. If this were an open world, I should be able to kill the people, howeverr I want and this simply isn't true.   In short, a friend bought this game for me for Christmas and I am so very glad I didn't spend money on it, it's a waste of time and money. I feel bad my friend wasted money on this title. The developers had a real award winning idea here and they just wasted it with lazy design and production.
301	0	a	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
302	0	a	I'm christian.
801	1	a	At first I wasn't sure if I would like this game. I had many problems (finishing quest before starting causing the quest to get stuck, and getting stuck in numerous walls) but I went with it (not gonna lie, those pantie physics made me want to keep playing).  As the game went on I started liking it more and more- Until the last level. (spoilers) I chose the puzzle instead of actionâ€¦ it made me so mad. Trying to kill the priest I was aiming for the chandelier but I ended up getting â€œcaught.â€ So? He knows Iâ€™m trying to kill him, why would it matter if I get caught? Then I realized I was supposed to use the fire to get him. Dang priest ran out so fast I donâ€™t even know how many times I had to restart because I ran out of time. Then, after that, when getting the father, I encountered a problem where after he was knocked down I was stuck. After messing around with various powers it eventually popped me to where I needed to be and I completed the game. Itâ€™s not an overall bad game. I thought the game was enjoyable, but there are some things that can really make you angery- things that should have been fixed. As for recommending- it's a tie.
803	1	a	I killed my whole family threw this game   7/10  And I pick killing my family every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time
805	1	a	This game rules man
807	1	a	it's very fun and inventive, but needs more detail so you know what to do exactly.
303	0	a	I cant even walk at the start of the game I try to walk using wasd and nothing happens the controls are horrid for me Im sure this is a problem for me only but I have no clue how to fix it
809	1	a	Super fun. Really cool that ypu get to play as a demon child. A little hard to find your way around the manor though. 9/10.
811	1	a	this game is wicked
813	1	a	I love the premise behind this game, and I was excited to play as a serial killer. But I can't seem to figure out a way to play this game that isnt low low graphics settings or normal graphics with very laggy gameplay.
815	1	a	Absolutely wonderful game. Full of Challenges, Both strategic and mental. Awesome graphics and game play. 10/10!
817	1	a	i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game JOVITA DE LA COVITA MACITA!
304	0	a	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).
819	1	a	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.
305	0	a	Honestly played it for 30 minutes before stopping for good. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to get it. The trailer was really well done and sold me. Unfortunately, the graphics are poor, the acting is poor, the script is poor, the programming is poor, even the layout of the mansion is poor. It didn't take long for this game to convince me that I was not going to enjoy muddling through it.
821	1	a	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!
823	1	a	Game runs smooth and its good af!!!
825	1	a	Creepy child of Satan on a quest to murder his family. Heck yes. Tiny bit repetitive, but an overall easy play.  Death sequences are hilarious.  Still working to get the 20hr and 40hr achievements. You can beat the game in under 10 hours easy. I can only play through so many times, gaiz. :&lt;
827	1	a	This is a fantastic game if have ever laughed at any of the death scense from Omen or thought that the first Exorstist movie was funny for trying to be scary.
829	1	a	game is sweet has its frustrating moments but still awesome
831	1	a	So much death, t'is good
833	1	a	Bring on Lucius 2!!
835	1	a	This game is so good . It's time to kill.
837	1	a	so in lucius you are the son of saton and you get all these really cool powers such as telekenesis and really cool things like that and the point of the game is that you attempt to kill everyone in the house and the game is the best. My favourite part in personel is the ending when you take control of your father and make him pick up a drill and drill right through your mums head
839	1	a	this is a sort of game you need to think outside the box, this is a massive puzzle game. you could get stuck on certian parts but when you figure it out you will have a bundle of fun being a demon child killing people for your deviel farhter
841	1	a	Great
843	1	a	this was a great game, some parts were a little challenging but thats what makes it fun, it also has a great story
845	1	a	Killing people as 6 year old, how can you go wrong? Open world-ish gameplay and inventive deaths makes it a good game however it's a little let down with poor directions and very little hints. Some areas will have you wandering around for ages looking for a clue when it turns out to be a tiny marker on the ground which you need to be 1ft away from. Overall a good game, storyline feels rushed but for the morbidly curious this ticks a lot of boxes.
847	1	a	Im not into horror games usually but this game I found really fun and I would recommend getting it.
849	1	a	Lucius was honestly one of the best games I've ever played. Granted, at times, it felt like an adventure game with a set path, but the satisfaction of independently finding out how to brutally maim someone while making it look like an accident is something no other game can match. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there, such as me spawning outside of the bedroom at the start of Chapter 4 and being able to walk freely outside the mansion, but it was fixed by me reloading the chapter. This game is worth it. There is a certain charm about being the son of the devil that just hooks me. 
851	1	a	Lucius!Idon't think that is a Horror game at all,because is not scary;I think is a half adventure and half puzzle game,in fact you have to find ways to kill every member of your family with various infernal powers and objects,that sometimes are easy to find,sometimes not.  This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20â‚¬(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)
853	1	a	I got this game for some two dollars or so. And I must say, what more could a man want from a game to be the six year old son of the devil, riding around on a trike in his mansion, while murdering everyone inside it.   Although taking out the trash is the hardest part of the game.
855	1	a	It was a nice game.  The story didn't take too long and it was somehow a creative feeling killing all these people. I can absolutely recommend it when you wanna have a shot but nice experience! Some passages were a little bit annoying though.
857	1	a	Very good game, very fun ! Only downside is that it is way too short. Was able to get all achievements except 2 before the end of my first playthrough.   Still, highly recommended, buy it !  Note that the game is averaging 5-7 hours in length. My gametime reflects time spent on 2 achievements that require 20 and 40 hours of being in-game.
859	1	a	Lucius is a guilty pleasure. Thereâ€™s just something perversely satisfying about planning and committing murders under the guise of an innocent child for the sake of malice. The story is a bit predictable and sometimes implausible, even in a supernatural context, but its shortcomings pale in comparison to the thrill of getting away unpunished with serial killing and the supernatural powers acquired throughout are a lot of fun. Itâ€™s so good to be bad.
306	0	a	This game... I don't know where to start. The bad storyline. Uh... the lip sync that makes old japanese anime look on time. The only thing this game is good for is the unintentional comedic value. Yet I've played it through three times. Save yourself. Save your wallet. Kill me.
861	1	a	It was ok, but I got bored after a bit, no challenge
863	1	a	Creative, fun and brings out the devil inside you. What else can anyone want in a game!!! 7.5/10
865	1	a	This game is by far the best game i ever played and i an supper exsited to play the 2nd one!
307	0	a	Destroyed by it's lack of a save function.  I love to spend time exploring. I don't love having to go over and over and over the same ground re-collecting items and repeating the same conversations just because the Devs are either too inept to program a save routine or think that it will make the game seem to be longer than it is.  Shame, because otherwise it was good fun.
867	1	a	Ahhhh... Lucius, Lucius, Lucius. What a great game, with a great concept. Killing people as LITERALLY the spawn of Satan. Alright into a list of pros and cons of the game.  Pros: -Great great concept of the game.  -Great character.  -Interesting ways of killing people.  -Loved the consistency throughout playing it.  Cons:  -There were a few bugs that I noticed. To list some: Falling out of the map, biking outside of the house, and... TELEPORTING PRIESTS.  -Final 'boss' battle, was too simple, but required the thinking to pull it off quickly. -I felt bad for some of the people I killed (LOLNOPE)  Overall an 8.5/10 game. Would run around burning people and biking over the dead bodies again.
869	1	a	Fun game just to sit back with and find the way that someone has to be killed, my only complaint would be that it is exremely restriced in the ways you are allowed to kill. Everyone has a way they have to die and you can't kill them any other way then that pre-determined way or you get a game over.
871	1	a	Well this is kinda unique advanture game where you become.... well, murderous antichrist. The game has 2 main flaws - there is only one way to perform current murder - so you need just to solve the puzzle - no room for artistic creativity :P - game has bugs... sometimes 'cut scenes' will not play as they should and you need to restart chepter to fix that... sometimes it's hard to figure out that is the case. It happened to me 4 times during playing so be aware  But the story, the way it is tolled, the idea and the idea makes those flows not really big. I have big hopes for Lucius 2 :D  Overall 8/10
309	0	a	Lucius is a fantastic concept but it does fall short of the promise of it's early trailers. Playing any game as the antagonist, let alone the antichrist, is a tough balance to pull off as we need to be drawn into the character despite their actions. Unfortunately the gameplay is so linear with no real choice over who dies/how we are entirely alienated from the main character and their motivations. They are a silent cipher unquestioningly carrying out commands. Whilst this is not dissimilar to many point and clicks, guybrush threepwood had a personality that carried you through.  There are other good factors about lucius such as clear intentioned level design and a dark humour that has great potential. These are not on their own redemptive enough and I would reccomend that you buy this game only in a sale or otherwise skip on to lucius 2.
873	1	a	Makes me enjoy murdering innocent people.  10/10 would murder again.
310	0	a	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   Game does not provide any hints of how to kill your victims. A lot of it seems poorly written, especially the reasons as to why Lucius is murdering some of them.   This game was boring, there is not a lot to it thart makes the gameplay fun. The 'boss fights' are the most type of oss fights I have ever played on a game. I managed to complete the game hoping for a good ending but it was cheesy and lacked any real depth. This game had huge potenial but it wasn't delivered wel at all.   I wouldn't recommend buying this game.
875	1	a	So very interesting but buggy. You play as the Antichrist, a kid who murders everyone. It is dark and gruesome but the graphics are not amazing so the gross parts are not too bad. It's buggy as well and hard. I could not beat it without watching play throughs. All that being said it's still a super cool game pick it up at 50% off.
877	1	a	got a tricycle. rode through a wall. got out from the manor. so happy. much free, very freedom. wow. rode till there's no road. fell off. forever falling. halp?  haz porn. 10/10
879	1	a	i recommend to you this game only if you love to kill people or bobes!!
881	1	a	its was a nice game :)
311	0	a	This is an incomplete, broken game, dont wate your time or your money buying this crap. The gameplay is terrible, the animation looks made by a five year old, the game has numerous issues. Wont be buying part two or anyhting from this developer ever again, and neither should you.
883	1	a	The theme is good over all, solid voice work and great story however...  The controls on your powers are dodgey at best and if you're stuck then look up a guide because some of the things this game expects you to do and figure out are crazy and flatout unreasonable at times.   I recommend it, but only if you play with a walkthrough next to you and during the last chapter if you choose the right option and beat the game lemme know because I spent 2 hours on that encounter and had to switch to the left one to beat the game finally.
885	1	a	Don't mess up with children. (Sorry for my broken english)
887	1	a	Abnormal game... so dizzy during playing. However it is a good game with logical mission.
889	1	a	Cool Game
891	1	a	Best game ever 10/10.  And this was the most usefull review in the history of reviews.
893	1	a	This games so creepy :v
895	1	a	its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in twisted evil minded â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up child game     i luv it
897	1	a	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
899	1	a	Hey, any game that allows me to telepathically influence my father into killing my mother with a nail gun is a must play!  Right guys? Anyone..? No? Well if you are not a fan of the above mentioned you can ride your trike for hours! :D
901	1	a	Top tier lip synching
903	1	a	Pros  Fun game Good youtube content Fun kills BYCICLES CONS Linear story not very creative gets a bit repetive  0 replayablity
905	1	a	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
313	0	a	-saw mom trying to walk thru a closed door -got stuck on the floor like if i was swimming in it -sneaked past mom while making all the noises in the world -got stuck in a level because the detective decided to see me because I was 1cm left to the spot i should be (what?) -had to take the garbage out but lost it in the middle of the living room, during day time, because the room was too dark (even tho if you look from outside, it's quite bright inside). -killed someone instantly with rat poison, even tho that stuff takes it's time to actually kill someone (right?)  i don't even know anymore
907	1	a	I got this game for some two dollars or so. And I must say, what more could a man want from a game to be the six year old son of the devil, riding around on a trike in his mansion, while murdering everyone inside it.   Although taking out the trash is the hardest part of the game.
909	1	a	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.
911	1	a	It was a nice game.  The story didn't take too long and it was somehow a creative feeling killing all these people. I can absolutely recommend it when you wanna have a shot but nice experience! Some passages were a little bit annoying though.
913	1	a	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!
915	1	a	OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10
917	1	a	The lag in this game needs to be fixed
314	0	a	if you like running around like an idiot not knowing what to do next and having to go check a guide on youtube well this game is for you!!!! feel like home!!!!
919	1	a	Woke up, rode my trike into the garage, doused my mechanic in gasoline, and set that n-word on fire.
921	1	a	Creepy T_T
923	1	a	I Killed My Parents =)   10/10 Lovely Game
320	0	a	Pick this up on sale if it is marked down. I got a good 7 hours playtime out of, but I ended up resorting to using walkthroughs on a few spots I got stuck on. The controls at times can be frustrating, especially the levitation. You have to murder people in a very narrowly defined path and it can be very difficult in some parts to figure out what to do. I did still enjoy the game however, even with these flaws but would not recommend it at full price.
321	0	a	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.
925	1	a	:}
927	1	a	I rate it 9/11 its a solid game some glitches here and there and crashes but putting that aside, Got it for free, Gave it a try and it was pretty interesting, I mean if you want a short game thats pretty wack and some what fun its a game to get.
929	1	a	To be brief, the game is very linear and there may be little re-play value in it. That being said, the game is quite enjoyable. The kid is a little devil, and it's great setting up the deaths and watching them play out. The puzzles do feel a bit easy, and there are a few glitches, but those are quite minor - the game is definitely worth checking out.
931	1	a	Absoutly Stunning Creative Ways to kill people.
933	1	a	great and cinical game, fun. i liked it
325	0	a	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   Game does not provide any hints of how to kill your victims.

935	1	a	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
937	1	a	Such a great game
939	1	a	maybe toptenreviews should add like top 10 ways to dead
941	1	a	i love this game but hard to control at first
327	0	a	Lacking gaming objectives, spent hours finding how to continue the game.
943	1	a	It's a horror game where you play as the horror, and I've been wanting that for ages. Games where you play as the villain always intrigue me, and this game embraces the concept. Throughout the entire thing you're either plotting your next evil deed, enjoying the result of your work, or just using your hellish powers for giggles.  The game feels like a horror movie all the way through. You got a narrator talking about your progress, cutscenes to give the story more depth, and an impressive climax. The voice acting is decent; it ranged from superb to not so bad as to ruin the immersion. The characters are actually intriguing for the little time you know them and I almost felt sorry for some of the poor victims.   The whole puzzle theme of the game is intriguing since it forces you to think a lot. Sometimes you might get stuck for hours because you can't figure out you need that tiny thing in that room and put it in the other thing. But the cutscenes at the end of each chapter are rewarding and satisfying enough to make the frustration worth it.  The set of powers you get to wield with your character are also fun to use. I would have preferred some more freedom to fully enjoy your awesome powers of Antichrist, but as it is, the game takes great advantage of what it gives you. Especially in the climax, where you truly feel like a demonic badass with the help of great surroundings and an epic soundtrack. That too should be mentioned; the music in this game is really good.  If I were to point out flaws, I'd say that I did encounter a few bugs. Nothing so big that it damaged my experience, though. The characters' talking did get old really quickly as well. Especially the final boss, who has ONE LINE that he repeats the entire time.   To conclude, Lucius is the perfect game for the sadistic player who wants to feel like a villain and also enjoys puzzle games. The experience is enhanched by beautiful graphics for an indie game, great soundtrack and an interesting story.
945	1	a	There is a bike in the game :)
947	1	a	I love this game so much due to the fact that I'm playing as the son of the Devil. I'm going to just dive right in by saying that I haven't even completed the game yet but I felt like it deserved a nice review! So, the main goal of the game is to give your father souls. To do this you must kill your family, people who work for your family and your families friends. Pretty funny right? No. You literally give some pretty gruesome deaths to people for no reason whatsoever! I love it! You have cool powers like Telekinesis, Mind Control and more! This game focuses on following a plot [kinda] which is why you can't just kill people randomly, and you can only kill people with certain moves or objects.   Lucius 2 is the game for you if you feel like literally killing everyone who crosses your path. It's just rooms of people that you are allowed to kill - constantly. 
949	1	a	yes its nice game
331	0	a	well it seems fun but u can use your powers like you want to. also theres this one mission that is really annoying and seems like is completely random and impossible. after trying it about 30 times and failing at the same exact point i gave up and uninstalled the game
332	0	a	I do not recommend buying this game at full price - I got it for 2 dollars though, and if that is still the price when you see it, then by all means, drop two bucks. That being said, this game is a mess.  I like the idea - I REALLY like the idea - but the execution is mediocre at best. Run around a mansion as a 7 year old and murder everyone in various ways. Sounds like a blast! I didn't even care that it was all scripted, and that there was little to no creativity allowed. What I cared about was the wacky bugs and confusing as hell missions. I had to look at the wiki in order to figure out what to do in the last half of the game, and I regularly play the Sherlock Holmes games, so I'm no stranger to adventure/puzzle games. But there is very little guiding your way. An intial mark on the map shows you your target, but after that, nothing. No markers showing important objects or following your target or anything. You can get a couple 'gifts' that give you hints, but unfortunately my game bugged out and failed to register my 'chores' so I couldn't get past the Ouiji board (which only hints at an important item to obtain, not what to do). Need to kill one of the maids? Clearly the thing to do is...break the washing machine by dropping an iron into it, thus making her...take a shower? Of course! Need to kill the driver? Well break that washing machine with the iron again to lure out the mechanic (because to hell with washing clothes!), then...find a mix tape so he can turn around and listen to it, allowing you to get some paint thinner and a rag to knock him out with? Masterful! There are also plenty of zero purpose items in the game. Books and bottles can be picked up, but serve no purpose. You can't even throw them to distract NPCs away from locations. Light switches can be flicked on and off, leading one to believe that there is a 'stealth' aspect of the game Nope...in the one section where you can do it, darkness has no meaning - mom will find you whether you are standing in pitch black or right under the light bulb. There is a section of stealth gameplay later in the game where darkness actually matters...but you take out the power to the mansion, thus rendering the switches useless anyway!  The powers are cool, but you rarely get to use them. Telekenesis is your go to, followed by mind control. You can mind control a few of the people in the mansion, but unless they have some scripted interaction in that particular 'chapter', you can't do anything with them. Later in the game, you get some offensive spells...but unless you choose the 'Action' ending (oh yes, that is a thing), you will use the fireball spell twice and the combustion spell - your last spell, btw - once. Yep, one time. The only truly useful spell that doesn't require a scripted event is memory erase, where if you are caught doing something, you can make them forget (but only 6 times a chapter).   And don't even get me started on the bugs. I have witnessed: an NPC walking into a closed door, effectively locking it for me. A chore not registering as complete (taking out the garbage), thus failing to allow me to continue that line of 'side quests'. Dropping that iron into the washer didn't work a few times. Dropping a hair dryer into a tub didn't work because it got stuck behind it, and was out of 'range' of telekenesis. Entries in my journal not registering, leaving me with zero clues on how to continue. And many more minor annoyances (glitching through walls, glitching through each other, falling through the floor once, getting stuck in the courtyard on a very small 'hill'). The voice sync is awful, the voice acting is...not terrible, but not good either. If what they do with their faces could be called 'expressions' or 'emotions' then those are awful too. Many of these could of probably been fixed, but clearly the developer did not see a reason to.   Overall, the game is a mess, but it is certainly worth the two dollars I paid for it. I love the idea, and I would like to see more from the developer (although I'm told the sequel to this is even worse), but please polish it up, give a bit more creativity, and let us use our damn spells! If there isn't a sale on, avoid this one. If there is, anywhere from 1 to 5 bucks...go ahead and give it a whirl.
333	0	a	I'm playing this, because it's an adventure game. But I've never played a game so full of bugs. Clipping issues, falling through the floor constantly in one climactic scene, etc. I'm honestly surprised they came out with a sequel considering they haven't even worked the bugs out of the first one yet.  The concept is ok and while it's working properly it's pretty fun, but when it isn't you want to have an exorcism performed on your PC.  However, there isn't much actual story. You get assigned someone to kill, you kill them (and have exactly one way to do so), and then it fades to black and the next 'mission' starts. I was really expecting more of a sandbox.   If you are patient with bugs and like the idea of basically being the kid from the Omen, then this could be recommended. For everyone else, spend your money on a telltale game or something.
951	1	a	just completed this in 5 hours. was really good but found it easy to get stuck which meant reloading a save which is a bit annoying having to do everything again. finale was a bit annoying gameplay wise (you'll see what i mean when you play it), however it had a decent story line (if a little predictable at times). overall enjoyable game, even better that i picked it up for Â£1.50 in a sale
953	1	a	So much reverb.  Best played muted while listening to a horror soundtrack playlist on youtube.
955	1	a	Game runs smooth and its good af!!!
957	1	a	its a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in twisted evil minded â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up child game     i luv it
959	1	a	I have enjoyed this game so far and i'm glad I bought it, but I probably only bought it because it's on sale, but either way this game is a good horror game in my opinion.
961	1	a	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
963	1	a	now im i want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ susan THX :D
965	1	a	Can't kill someone with a nail gun, 4/20
967	1	a	I would recommend playing this game, it's very good in my taste! I loved the main character plain and simple, the graphics were good, and there were plenty of neat ways to kill people. One of the bad things is, any kind of hint the game supplied such as the notes in your notebook weren't that helpful about 30% of the time in my experience. There were also more than enough bugs/glitches to even count, which most of the time ended in a game over or just simply resetting the level and doing all of that stuff you FINALLY accomplished all over again. But my main pet peeve about this game was that the telekinesis power was EXTREMELY hard to use. Things would go off into random directions or the item itself that you were trying to move will just be stuck in its place.  Other than physical game problems (bugs, glitches, mechanics, etc) both endings were just terrible. I appreciated the alternate ending feature, but both endings consisted of almost the exact same gameplay content at a ridiculously difficult level lol. Worst part about it, there was only a slight difference in the ending cinematics. Both endings in general were not creative at all. When I played the first, it was 3/10. The second one I'd give maybe a 5/10. Although my review sounds more negative than positive, I do like this game and rate it above average; my critique in endings of anything is always picky anyways lmao. But over all, the story and characters intrigued me the most, so I'd give it a solid 8/10, probably would play again! :^)
969	1	a	I would recommend this game,though somewhat reluctantly,because of it's very linear gameplay and 2 annoying stealth missions. Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.
971	1	a	Nice Horror Puzzle Game Love It
973	1	a	Creepy child of Satan on a quest to murder his family. Heck yes. Tiny bit repetitive, but an overall easy play.  Death sequences are hilarious.  Still working to get the 20hr and 40hr achievements. You can beat the game in under 10 hours easy. I can only play through so many times, gaiz. :&lt;
975	1	a	It was a little entertaining, though the en was very quick and wasn't very wellmade
334	0	a	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).
977	1	a	Lucius is one of those games that tries to present itself as new and unique, but it's really just a point-and-click adventure game delivered in a 'horror' RPG package. There are some parts of this game that try too hard to be edgy or shocking, such as the couple (unnecessary) sequences of low-censored nudity and sex.  Chapter after chapter is just a simple 'Use item X with location Y until Success' puzzle. Most of these are adequately explained or hinted at, but you will have one or two that are so ridiculous and make no sense that using a walkthrough is almost a requirement. Occasionally you will have a time restraint, but these chapters are rare. Each chapter details an individual murder of someone living/working in your mansion, usually by some bizarre and unnecessarily complicated chain of events (well, the difficulty has to increase somehow).  This game is technically 'open world', with the player having access to the entire mansion soon after the first several chapters. Regardless of where you go, each murder has to take place in the same location with the same objects, and it is typically set up that you don't need to wander too far to find key pieces of the murder.  Lucius is a puzzle game for those who like a little bit of a challenge, or for those that harbor an unsafe anger for childhood authority figures.
979	1	a	its a very fun game and stuff but i didnt really like it so you should get it!!
335	0	a	Great. The game doesn't allow me to go into windowed mode or even get to actually play this. Spend your money on something else. It isn't worth it in my opinion.
336	0	a	this game sucks it is so hard and borring at some parts!
981	1	a	WTG(((WOW THIS GAME))) This is very nice horror story game. The story is very good. This game is about this boy have black magic to kill the people areound him. The Lucifer is a bad guy of this game not Lucius. The Lucifer controll him to kill people. All of this,This game is the best of horror story game!!!!! BUT Outlast is the really best Horror game. :) I didn't make it end yet,But soon. :)  Graphic:2/3 Story:5/5 Character:1/2 Total Score:8/10
337	0	a	TL;DR: This game is honestly not that great. Took me 5 hours today to do the game entirely, including all the time I spent just running around the house trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do, which counts for most of it. For 20$, I would have expected more.  Full review:  Lucius isn't entirely bad, but it is far from great, and far from justifying the 20$ price.  You start the game having only 1 power, which is telekinesis. There are a lot of items in the game that you can move and swing around, which is great, but there are two down sides to this: first, you are suspicious because of items floating in the air, while you are just standing there (but turning those crosses upside-down isn't). Second, it's pointless. You can move vases, cups, glasses, etc but it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Second power you get is Mind Control, which is honestly not as great as it sounds. Just about everyone will be 'too strong' to be affected, so the use that they say about 'mind controlling them so you can do what you want'... not so much. The only ones that can be affected are the people you need to kill, but only under some circumstances.  Third is mind erase. Basically, if you get caught, you can wipe the person's memory, but once again, only in some circumstances. Caught at night walking around? Nope. Pretty much the only time it can be used is if you are caught swinging cups with your mind.  Final power is an incinerate power. Sounds cool, yet again, just like the previous 2 powers, can only be used in some situations. In fact, I think there is only 2-3 of those, maybe 4. Not much.  Aside from the powers, there are a lot of things that are lacking. I'm all up for a hard game, but at some point, give us some clues. One of the person to kill is the person taking care of the laundry (yes, that is ALL she does, for a family of 5 plus the workers). Only info you get is 'She takes care of the laundry'. That's it. You need to kill her in a way that won't incriminate you by only knowing she does the laundry (spoiler following) to in the end kill her in her bath.  A lot of thing happens, or are said, that either doesn't make sense, or the characters are jumping to conclusion too fast. The more you advance in the game, the more those things are obvious. And yes, the following contains spoilers.  ---  At first, there is a few things that bothers me, but it really starts with a confession from a cop to a priest:  Cop: I've been having nightmares, terrible scenes playing in my head. And this family are the players. Priest: It sounds to be like this family needs help, my son. Priest: It sounds to me like the church should intervene.  That is the exact text. What do they do? They try to contact the family to support them morally. Although it is 'helping the family, that is not an 'intervention'.   Second, there is actually a scene where you are sleeping with your shoes on, and you get woken up by your grand-father that punches you in the balls. And no reaction about this last part, obviously. About the shoes, all the other nights you sleep with your slippers on.  Third, you are told by your grandfather that your father and uncle never found the hidden door in the basement while playing there as kids... Really? They played there for years, in a room about 5m by 5m (max), with one of the walls being nothing more than a curtain and they never wondered what was on the other side? They never even noticed it?  Fourth, a journalist that was unconscious, wakes up to you throwing a fireball at him. His first though? It is the reversed crosses on the walls that gives you your powers! Forget trying to run away from the 7 years old, fireball throwing kid here, let's instead try to put back those crosses in the right way.  Fifth, your 'father' finds a book about satan on your grandfather's desk. First conclusion? Your grandfather used a ritual to curse your family, and you are the source of that curse! Don't think that the grandfather, which was already sounding partially senile, could just have been weirder, or that all this is just stupid, noooo... 'It's the only logical explanation!' (actual quote from the father)  Those are only some of the points that I find illogical. There are many more.  ---  As for the achievements... Most fit in one of two category: 'play the game' or 'do useless stuff to get this'. Examples:  Play 20/40 hours. With a 5 hours game, yes it will be hard, but not for the good reasons. Break X objects. Doesn't have any purpose, but you can get it! Get caught X times. Be rewarded for failing! Kill X persons. Basically, one per person that you NEED to kill. So 20 achievements right there Run 26 miles. Yes I did get it. That's how much running in circle you do. Take 20 pictures. You only need to take one in the game, but if you click 19 more times...  Finally, you would expect a horror game (or at least a game about satan and the antichrist) to have a dark atmosphere. Well, the only thing really dark about the game is the corridors, lacking lightning. All the murders are so cliche and msot are so predictable that the atmosphere it's trying to create just doesn't work.  In conclusion, if the game was between 5-10$, it would be acceptable. But 20$ for less than 5 hours of gameplay, without replay value and with how the game works, it is not worth it in my opinion.
983	1	a	Seems there is a glitch in the game, when sneaking around to get rat poison a door won't highlight to open.  Read one could reset the game and it would be fixed, did this and nothing, another said to use your flashlight on the door then open it, this did not help either. I enjoyed what I got to play of the game.
985	1	a	mad at your mom or dad. kill them in this game, also kill your butcher, uncle, maid, maid, mechanic, cop, butler, and more
987	1	a	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!
989	1	a	It's an alright game, I mean it's kind of old now. If you like doing missions and getting steam cards from a game. This is a game for you. You basically kill people the whole time and do missions for your dad and others.
338	0	a	This game manages to: - be overly directive on the fun part (use of powers, who to kill and when) - provide a complete freedom on the boring part (I hope you enjoy looking for an item for hours)  In the end, you are just free to get bored.
991	1	a	This game is probably one of my favorite games. The second ones a bit of a disappointment, but this one got me obsessed with Lucius.
339	0	a	Honestly played it for 30 minutes before stopping for good. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to get it. The trailer was really well done and sold me. Unfortunately, the graphics are poor, the acting is poor, the script is poor, the programming is poor, even the layout of the mansion is poor. It didn't take long for this game to convince me that I was not going to enjoy muddling through it.
993	1	a	Needs quick saves as i am stuck trying to sneak around in the dark to find my Grandfather . YES , i did it .....nope , i must sneak to get super glue and back . Grrrrrrrr . Overall , it has been fun
995	1	a	finished the game it was great experience and good story and gameplay. Environment was also good but some pros on game play. Except that fewer gameplay issues totally worth the money
997	1	a	Top tier lip synching
999	1	a	good god...what have I done?
1001	1	a	fun and creepy and funny-ish
1003	1	a	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
1005	1	a	Great game but is very difficult... at least for me.
1007	1	a	I would recommend this game,though somewhat reluctantly,because of it's very linear gameplay and 2 annoying stealth missions. Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.
1009	1	a	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
1011	1	a	This game is messed up beyond anything i have ever played. You play a 7 year old who is the devil's son and you murder people. reminds me of the omen and children of the corn. Good game if you're into gory messed up games.
1013	1	a	If yo are a satanist and enjoy killing and watching people suffer then this is the game for you!  I beat this in the shortest time possible for me, i was addicted to this games story and now im gonna try the second one
1015	1	a	Great game 100x better than the 2nd don't even bother with that one!
347	0	a	Game has a good idea but unfortunatelly it is too lineer. 
1017	1	a	Mt bom
1019	1	a	Fun for a bit. Haven't beaten it, I walked into a wall and couldn't advance.
348	0	a	Bit of an overrated game. Nothing special about it, really. It's basically a blatant ripoff of the movie The Omen. Hell, it's played out almost identical. But even if you haven't seen the film, you can tell it's pretty hokey, between the crap voice acting, the rusty gameplay, the maze of a mansion design, the lack of character development, the lack of subtlety regarding Lucius and his father Lucifer (not much of a spoiler), and the lackluster gore moments. I mean I'm a gorehound, but this was pretty boring. There is little to no suspense, the plot is predicable, and the idea of making a killer child is getting tiresome, which doesn't help when you add in the satanic aspect. If you actually want this game, don't bother. EVen if it's on a Steam Sale, the price isn't worth it.
349	0	a	wow this game is boring!
1021	1	a	Great game! Hope 2 is this fun
1023	1	a	Fun stuff! Just wish there was controller support for it, (don't see it coming anytime soon) but still worth checking out!
1025	1	a	Short but...   The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, We don't need no water let the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burn, Burn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burn. 
1027	1	a	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3  
1029	1	a	Lucius is a very good horror game! Go for it. You will have a great time. :)
1031	1	a	Super sometimes stealth and sometimes bug :D (BUG TO MAKE IT FASTER)
1033	1	a	  DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine
1035	1	a	I beat this game in 7 hours, get most of the achievements in another two.  Sadly, there're two achievements over which you have to wonder: do you want to be a good boy and play this game for 40 hours (without pause) or be a bad boy and use Cheat Engine.  Satan is proud of me.
1037	1	a	very nice game, but it not horror games, just puzzle and logic games
1039	1	a	I enjoyed the game a lot, however imo I think that looking for objects was made unnecessary difficult. Overall, it's a great game!
1041	1	a	...............wow   ....................many victims   .....so funny   ......................................much kills  ..........very bloody  .................such game
1043	1	a	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
1045	1	a	You get to saw some guy's head in half. That's the main selling point of the game for me.
1047	1	a	This is a great game, you can interact with most things. Good texture/quality/graphics and gameplay. Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!
1049	1	a	I am Christian, and even I find this game amusing!
1051	1	a	Fun, interesting, very dark humor that I quite appreciate, but you can't really read the description of this game without expecting dark humor. The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.
1053	1	a	EN I have honestly to say that I was following Lucius from a long time, but at one of the last sales I've been kinda let down by some bad reviews saying that the mansion was huge and you had to find little objects and made it sound like a pixel hunter game. Last monday I bought it tho, since it was very very cheap (less than 1â‚¬) and I saw that all the bad reviews were pretty wrong. Sure the mansion isn't small, but let me tell you that if you're a 'game explorer' like me and love to go in every single place in games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim well this map will be a piece of cake and you'll learn it pretty fast. About the gameplay itself, yes there's no much freedom but it's kinda explained with the fact that the kills must look like accidents, but the puzzles ('cause after all it's a big puzzle game from a point of view, where you have to find out how to kill someone step by step) are never frustrating or absurds like in some point &amp; click adventures. If I should point a flaw it'd be about the stealth sections 'cause more than real stealth they're just a series of trial and error until you learn the patterns of the NPCs, so while I understand the willing to vary the gameplay they've been implemented poorly unfortunately. So to wrap it up I'd suggest this game 'cause it's pretty good and entertaining, dunno honestly if at the full price it's back again (18.99â‚¬ here), 'cause while fun it's pretty short (about 6-7hrs, taking my time to explore, achievements, etc.) P.s. Yes I cheated my way through the 20/40hrs achievements 'cause there was no way I was gonna leave my PC on just for that, it'd be different if the game would take that time to finish obviously!  IT Devo onestamente dire che stavo seguendo Lucius da un bel di tempo, ma ad una delle utlime svendite alcune recensioni che parlavano di una villa gigante dove dover cercare piccoli oggetti me l'han fatto sembrare un gioco stile 'pixel hunter' e quindi ho desistito. Lo scorso LunedÃ¬ perÃ² l'ho comperato, dato che il buon sconto (meno di 1â‚¬) ed ho notato che le recensioni negative erano sbagliate. Certo la villa non Ã¨ piccola, ma lasciatevi dire che se vi piace esplorare nei giochi come me ed amate andare in ogni singolo posto in giochi come Fallout 3 o Skyrim beh questa mappa sarÃ  un gioco da ragazzi e l'imparerete velocemente. Riguardo al gameplay in sÃ©, sÃ¬ non c'Ã¨ moltissima libertÃ  ma Ã¨ in parte spiegata dal fatto che le uccisioni devono sembrare incidenti, ma i puzzle (dato che alla fine Ã¨ un grande puzzle game da un certo punto di vista, dove dovete capire come uccidere qualcuno passo passo) non sono mai frustranti od assurde come in alcune avventure punta&amp;clicca.. Se dovessi citare un difetto sarebbero le sezioni stealth perchÃ© piÃ¹ che un vero stealth sono solo una serie di prova e riprova finchÃ© non imparate il percorso dei PNG, quindi anche se capisco l'intenzione di variare il gameplay sono state implementate malamente sfortunatamente. Quindi per concludere suggerirei il gioco perchÃ© Ã¨ buono e divertente, anche se non so onestamente se al prezzo pieno a cui Ã¨ tornato (18.99â‚¬ qui), perchÃ© anche se divertente Ã¨ abbstanza corto (circa 6-7hrs, prendendomi il tempo di esplorare, obbiettivi, etc.) P.s. SÃ¬ ho imbrogliato per ottenere l'obbiettivo delle 20/40 ore perchÃ© non avevo nessuna intenzione di lasciare il PC acceso solo per quello, sarebbe stato differente se il gioco avesse richiesto quel tempo per essere finito ovviamente!
1055	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
1057	1	a	10/10 would murder everyone dear to me agian.
356	0	a	I bought this and Lucius II in a bundle (I haven't played Lucius II yet) for like $1.75 or something.  For the price, I guess it's been okay?  It feels really empty, poorly explained, the video and audio aren't synced at all, and it just seems like the game is trying to keep you busy with simple tasks over and over.  It's like a poorly made Hitman clone, but with only one way to kill each person.  Rating: 2.3 / 10
1059	1	a	Anti-Christ Simulator 2012   Probably the only simulator game you can find out there with a story.
1061	1	a	Apart from some glitch encountered with the notebook and chores missions, it's one of the funniest game I've played. Awsome achievements!

357	0	a	Screw this game. Seriously, screw this game. Its twisted, vile, and EVILLLLLLLLLer than satan himself. Nobody should have the displeasure of playing the game themselves, not even the son of satan, Lucius who the game is named after. Even judging by gameplay, its a boring joke of a game. -1/10
358	0	a	Like a more linear Hitman with weaker voice acting and graphics. Avoid.
1065	1	a	This game is so bad it's good. The voice acting, glitches and mediorce graphics turn a crappy game into a hilarious one. It's so much fun to watch people scream and die while their eyes and mouth barely move. That said, I've had the game freeze and crash a few times and the controls are frustrating.
1067	1	a	This is a great game, you can interact with most things. Good texture/quality/graphics and gameplay. Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!
360	0	a	This game is so buggy. So slow, it's only 16-18 FPS when the gameplay start but it goes 60 FPS when the movie play, We don't watch the movie dude, we want to play!!!
1069	1	a	This my own likes and dislikes of the game  Likes &gt;Graphics Is great for old game &gt;Good Storyline &amp; Scenes &gt;Get to play as Villian which is rare in games &gt;Alot of Interaction &gt;After few unlocks be able to explore alot the house  Dislikes &gt;NPCS can get stuck &gt;NPCS detecting you can seem almost impossible to avoid   Is the game worth buying? I quite impressed with this game and sure is worth the buy in my opinion
1071	1	a	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
1073	1	a	Watched Pewds play it.  I thought I was womanly enough to play it myself.  I. Can't. Play. This. Without. Someone. Besides me.  Overall a great story-based killing game. Role reversal is always fun. Instead of being the Hero, you're the bloody murderer. A 6 year-old professional killer.
363	0	a	Plain tedious.
1075	1	a	great game //
1077	1	a	A fun little game that I finished in (more or less) one 6-hour sitting. This game has as much jank as it has charm, and while being very linier, the puzzles are mostly stright forward (I resorted to a guide 2-3 times for specific moments, usually when there was a very specific spot you needed to interact with) and the murder animations are incredibly brutal, for the most part.  The stealth sections are garbage, as are the 'fight' sections, but these are both in the minority. Acheivements are dolled out fairly generously to begin with, but there is a 40-hour playtime acheivement which, as I already mentioned I finished the game in 6, will require me to leave the game running on its own for quite some time.  All in all, I recommend this game because it was fun and had enough content to keep me occupied and engaged for the entire time, which is more than can be said for titles like Assasin's Creed. Get this game, but get it on a sale, because as enjoyable as it was, it wasn't without its hiccups 'and' was completed in one sitting, so value that how you will.
364	0	a	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.
1079	1	a	Great game, i really recommend it.
1081	1	a	Good game totally worth it ..
1083	1	a	If you've never played this kind of game you should give Lucius a shot. It's not perfect but it is interesting. Ok, now I'm just gonna go back to killing people.
1085	1	a	A game about the devil. Finished it in 6.6 hours. 8/10
366	0	a	Lags to the point where I can't even play it :/
1087	1	a	Actually really good. It's linear despite what it might lead you to believe. I got no bugs or anything. Story was alright, and the characters were interesting. Playing as the villian is strangely satisfying. Controls worked well, interface is good. not much to say. 4/5.
368	0	a	I wish there was a Neutral button.  This game feels kinda like an old hitman, but without all the different possibilities of killing. The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at telling you what to do or what can be done, so be ready to alt tab-watch guide rinse-repeat.  Pro's: -The idea of being the son of lucifer is fun. -Murders are often awesome.  Neutral: Graphics, It's not very ugly, doesn't look good either though. Animations... same as above.  Cons: -Most of the time you have no idea what to do. -I couldn't find any mods to make the above better, in fact I couldn't find any mods at all and it's probably not supported. -Glitches are plenty, within the tutorial I picked up an item before Devildaddy told me to, and that was it.... stuck there forever untill restarting the level. -Voice acting and lipsync often failes. -You cannot choose how to murder people, you have to do it in a single specific way the game wants you to, and the game often doesn't tell you what that specific single way is.   Conclusion: If you like the idea of being the son of the devil and killing of everyone in the house one by one, then maybe get it.  Play it in short bursts, and prepare to read/watch lots of guides..
369	0	a	I watched Pewdiepie play this on Youtube, and then I rushed play it after. And I gotta say, I think Pewds was the best part of this game. Its just not that fun. So I actually recommend that you watch him play it, and save your money. 5/10 (by yourself) 8/10 (watching Pewds)
1089	1	a	Wow &gt; luv this game  this is just the beginning there's more to come lol  
1091	1	a	Very good game and mind thinking
370	0	a	This game makes its players struggle through its endless bugs, truly awful voice acting/animation, and cheesy dialouge with overuse of slow motion that gives the game an almost comedic tone.  Never the less, I did force my way though the levels, and I still got some fun out of it, but otherwise I'd really not reccomend this. It is just too shoddily made. 4/10.
1093	1	a	I would have loved to play it however I can't due to a slow computer, I would love to know if they are working on a mac version and if they are when that would be released.
1095	1	a	Completed 02/08/2016.
1097	1	a	thsi game is fun and the creative ways to kill people are awesome. only problem i had was the camera was not what i was used to, but it was still good.
1099	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
1101	1	a	A really fun game, there are some bugs... But worth the money
1103	1	a	Even though that the deaths are scripted it is still a fun and funny game to play that will last you a while.
1105	1	a	its completely demented but in a good way.
1107	1	a	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.
1109	1	a	...............wow   ....................many victims   .....so funny   ......................................much kills  ..........very bloody  .................such game
1111	1	a	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
372	0	a	Like a more linear Hitman with weaker voice acting and graphics. Avoid.
1113	1	a	Very brutal death scenes, very bloody and very cool. However, this game has some hard missions, that can take some time to complete. Apart from that, 10/10.
1115	1	a	Awesome tricycle sim... 10/10 would play again
1117	1	a	10/10 would burn anyone
374	0	a	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.
1119	1	a	A great violent game, different ways to kill people and a common but well-told story. supernatural abilities and 2 alternate endings. 8/10
1121	1	a	Nice story, but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ physics, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics.
1123	1	a	Playing this game has been really fun. The controls are not bad at all, and it's easy to pick up the game and just start playing. However, as the majority of people who have reviewed this game have stated, many times I was stuck wondering what to do. I also didn't favor running all around the house for the chores or items needed to make a kill. It seemed a bit tedious after a while. (â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the laundry chore. Just skip it.)  But the kills! SO rewarding!  Lucius is one of the only games which compelled me to complete all of the Steam achievements. I have them all except for the 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' achievements. My only peeve with these 2 achievements is that it takes less than 5 hours to finish the game, so 40 hours is a LOT of time to fill!   Bottom line: -You get to be a cute little 6 year old who kills people. -Sweet powers from Satan himself. -You get to light people on fire. -You get a tricycle.  It's an enjoyable game. Get it on sale and play!
375	0	a	Half the time I don't know where I am supposed to go and the game is just plain slow and boring
1125	1	a	From the devil satan father, then he speaks to his son for killing.
376	0	a	Yes if you like graphic death scenes and enjoy being the spawn of satan. However the story line does take a while to set itself up and its easier if you are reading a walkthrough since you are searching a large house for your next victim and murder weapon.
1127	1	a	i love this game but hard to control at first
1129	1	a	I haven't played much yet but i do plan to but so far, i'm loving the direction its headed towards.. After i finish my story, i shall come back to edit my review but for now, i find this game very creative, fun and i am really intriguied in the way its being unfolded.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK2tOEBkJm4   I had done a video on it that probably no one cares about but this shows you the first chapter of it if you are interested.
1131	1	a	Lucius was a lot of fun. Bought 1 and 2 on sale for around 5 bucks. Definitely recommend!
1133	1	a	Even though it's an 'old' game, it's still very fun to play. Making my inner satan come out. 9/11
377	0	a	a game that is a hitman clone. it functions in almost the exact same way but can only kill targets in 1 very specific way. not to mention game breaking bugs that causes the game to crash. for example choosing puzzle option and throwing 2 specific tables causes the game to crash. last boss so to speak that you need to kill cant be done atleast not for me. all my powers were disables and could only run around
1135	1	a	If you claim to not be able to enjoy playing the son of Satan in a game where the achievements is to kill people in all the ways you can imagine to kill them - you are lying. This is an awesome game, I wish it had lasted longer.
1137	1	a	Reversed some crosses, burned some people, no one suspects anything, I'm just a nice child and surely not suspicous.  Nice story to play, don't check walkthroughs, cause it's too easy then. Buy it, enjoy, kill people have fun.
1139	1	a	Nominated for The â€œVillain Most In Need Of A Hugâ€ Award.  This poor kid just needed some luv [of jesus]
1141	1	a	very cool 
1143	1	a	It got an interesting premise since it is like the unofficial video game adaptation of The Omen. That being the premise and the fact it comes from an indie studio are the only reasons why i can consider it an OK game and understand why some people love the game.  The only things that really bothered me about the game is that still has glitches considering how many updates it has had and that is very poorly optimized. It also got some really annoying achievements that force you to waste your time just for the sake of it. You can still manage to get them all in 15 hours like i did. If you don't care about the achievements, it can easily be finished in 10 hours or less. It may say in my profile or this review that i played this game for 40 hrs or more, Hell no, i just left it running to get 2 achievements that require it.  Hell yes that you may like it. Liking The Omen movie is a big requirement though.   In my case, I did liked it. However, I also got it for 1 dollar, so, that helped its case too.  [ Nominated it for a steam award ]
1145	1	a	  THE GOOD 
1147	1	a	I'll never look at a 7 year old the same way again
1149	1	a	It's a very fun game! So delicious to play and figure out how to take care of your victims. I found the voice acting and some of the dialogue a bit poor, but it's a game worth playing.
1151	1	a	I first seen this game on Pewdepie. (who else) It took me a while to get it. I used a shiity laptop to play the game. It runs around 30 fps at max on low setting but it is playable, just get at least 16 GB and a 980 Geforce to play this on good settings. The gameplay is a Hitman like clone but with no body draging and less freedom to do whatever. The Powers are only used in a certein place in the house. The playable charater is cool and I can't help but root for him. The game does have a game breaking bug that happens in the end of the game but it could be my PC than the game. The music is great and ok sound too. Voice acting is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but in the good old school horror way. The map can get coufsing and the game barly holds your hand so some traild and error is nessary. I think the story gets the job done.
1153	1	a	So bad it's kind of good.
1155	1	a	KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY   Even if I didn't have the choice of the manner to kill my victims, the game was very pleasant for the sadistic person that I am :D  Satan/10
1157	1	a	Don't ever mess with Satan son!!!
1159	1	a	Decent gameplay and an interesting storyline, but vague puzzles, abilities being a bit confusing, and bad graphics bring the game down. 7/10. Still worth a try.  Gameplay: The gameplay worked out well and fit the game's theme. You had to pick up things and use powers while appearing to be a normal non suspicious child. If someone saw you with a gun, or psychically moving things around, you'd lose the level and have to start over. There were also side quests (or chores) you could do to get extra rewards to help you solve the levels. A weegie board to give riddle tips, a music box that gave limited use to see useful items around, but the last was a tricycle which was akward to maneuver through the halls and wasn't really worth getting.  Storyline: The storyline is well written and you can see bits of it happening while you walk around mid level. The characters all talk to you and will make comments about what all is happening which helped to expand the story. Add onto it the narrator explaining what all he saw going on and the connections he made after all was said and done being excellent really made the game worth while.  Puzzles: Not really sure they are puzzles, but the levels had you do a series of tasks you had to figure out to get someone killed. The first few levels were easy enough to figure out how to do them, the narrator explaining that something was learned from that death that was important for you to use during it. The later levels became overly vague on what you were doing, one of the levels being explained with 'She is doing laundry.' If you followed her around, she walked between a few places but you had to break something on the other side of the room to be able to kill her.  Abilities: As the game progresses, you get new powers. These powers level up as you get kills. There is no choice on what ability you level, nor is there an explanation of what these levels do. As far as I could tell, it was tracking progress through the game more than anything. To make things a little more complicated, some levels would start off with a tutorial on how to use an ability, then the level would prevent you from using it. The last ability even being removed from your ability choices after you get it. Though this was oddly done, each ability did get use at some point.  Graphics: Blocky and weird. I don't mind blocky graphics, aslong as I can tell what everything is, but a character would pick up an item in a video sequence and the object would move seperately from their hand. A little bit of effort would be appreciated in that, if it was part of gameplay and the other characters moved things around I could understand, but it was a predone video.   I had to look up walkthroughs for a few levels which frustrated me that the levels were too vague, but that could just be me. The graphics were still irelivant to my enjoyment and the abilities were easy enough to figure out the limits on my own.
1161	1	a	The game was actually boring
1163	1	a	Stuck To The Wall   10/10 Would Stuck Again ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Œ
1165	1	a	Don't mess up with children. (Sorry for my broken english)
1167	1	a	Well for $4.99 its a laugh, reminds me of the Omen Movies....there is something kinda fun roaming around and killing people as a 6 year old kid....lol Graphics are great for an Indie game, storyline short but intense, kinda game you play on a widescreen monitor in the dark.
1169	1	a	fun game but its just a story no freeplay but its fun
1171	1	a	Really awesome! The story and the solutions are already prescripted. So there is only one way to go through the game (only in the last mission you will have a choice to go for action or puzzle solving). But all in all the story is quite nice and it's all about finding the right keys and clues to do the murder. It's just fu*king great!
1173	1	a	Great game, took about 5 hours to complete.. the deaths were entertaining!   Unfortunately the Last two Achievements are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pathetic. A Big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you to the dev's for making me idle this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ forever, it doesn't track the damn time correctly so far I have 46 hours counted by steam and still haven't got the stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ 40h achievement.   Idling the game while sitting in my room staring at the player like a creep so it's not like its on the menu or anything, not even alt-tabbed and the Achievements still take â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t time to get, it's just stupid padding â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ so people think 'Oh wow all these people played 48357975893479 hours this game must be awesome I'll buy it!'  ONLY BUY THIS GAME IN A BUNDLE, I GOT IT IN A $1.89 BUNDLE DO NOT PAY THE FULL PRICE  Other than the achievement annoyance it was fun the first run through.   # Finally managed to get the stupid 40h Achievement after 60 hours -.-
1175	1	a	While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience, and any hardcore fans of the genre owe it to themselves to give it a look, provided they have strong stomachs.
1177	1	a	Tired of shooters, rpg, action, even horror adventures? Good! How about taking the role of the son of the dark lord 'Lucifer' himself, huh? Took me around 5 hours to finish it from start till the very end, and i'll be damned it was worth it, yeah sometimes it can be buggy or stupid for some reasons... or very short. But! But i'm guarantee it's expirience worth playing :3
1179	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever played!
1181	1	a	Watch my first impressions video of the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8RFJxg90ss 
1183	1	a	Lucius Is AWESOME, great story!
1185	1	a	Really freaking swaggy game right here.
1187	1	a	Awesomely creepy game
1189	1	a	this is an awesome game i ever played in my life but for my computer it laggs
1191	1	a	It's entertaining, but starts to get a little repetitive after a while. Eventually, the novelty of essentially playing as the kid from The Omen wears off and the simplistic nature of 'gain a new psychic power, kill a person with it' starts to get old.
1193	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game.

And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
1195	1	a	Ever watched the Omen and thought 'wow, wouldn't it be fun to be the son of Satan?'. Well now you can. Lucius puts you in the shoes of a little boy who discovers on his 6th birthday that he is, in fact, the son of Lucifer, and that your true father is very interested in you conituning the family business of killing people in really nasty ways so he can have their souls.  The game is third person so you will always have the little tyke in your sights as you go around working out inventive ways of offing the people living in your family mansion. You can interact and pick up various objects, explore the mansion and do quests from murder to completing chores. After all, a good little boy does all his chores, while also killing. As you progress you also gain abilities like telekensis and mind control, making the murder more wholesome; after all, no one will suspect you if that object happens to crash down on someone without any outward control.
1197	1	a	got this one during sale for like 3 or 5e, its great game, not that good looking but this game is not about it, lots of fun, good achievment, solid gameplay, 'story' if you wanna call it that way....  worth it
378	0	a	Half the time I don't know where I am supposed to go and the game is just plain slow and boring
1199	1	a	From the devil satan father, then he speaks to his son for killing.
1201	1	a	Best sacrafice sim I've played EVER!!! 10/10
1203	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
1205	1	a	666/999 would recommend this game!! :D :D â™¥
380	0	a	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?
1207	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.
1209	1	a	Did you ever watch that movie called The Omen? This is pretty much that.
1211	1	a	WTG(((WOW THIS GAME))) This is very nice horror story game. The story is very good. This game is about this boy have black magic to kill the people areound him. The Lucifer is a bad guy of this game not Lucius. The Lucifer controll him to kill people. All of this,This game is the best of horror story game!!!!! BUT Outlast is the really best Horror game. :) I didn't make it end yet,But soon. :)  Graphic:2/3 Story:5/5 Character:1/2 Total Score:8/10
1213	1	a	I have a couple ways to recommend it, you choose which one tickles your pickles:  1) Do you like detective games? How about instead of solving mysteries, you would create them? ;D  2) Do you like the dark side? If so - this will be a sinister delight for you!  3) Murder! :|  4) Aggression begone! Oh, hello Lucifer o.o...
381	0	a	how this game got 81% possitive i have no idea, because it is a bore fest. you do next to nothing, just try to find your way around a house, pick up an item or two and use them to meddle with something which activates an ugly cutscene of someone dying. this is the worst assasination game i have ever played, dont buy
382	0	a	Okay, well, I wanted to play this game to have fun, but all it was is a linear omen rip-off with stiff stereotypical characters and voice acting that did not match the characters blank expressions and stiff body language. I have play indie games where the characters were more life-like than this and offered more gameplay. I don't see how you really can just go on a demonic killing spree. You have to do things in order and kill people in order. You can shoot people, it might get you caught, but at least it might count towards the acheivment. You're limited of how and when to use your 'demonic powers'. It would have been nice for the game to have been environmentally interactive other than the mission ojective items so as the player break glass, create disturbances, and just cause mental havoc.  I got this game on sale with a bunch of other games. After playing this game myself, it's not worth the $20 it's currently being sold for and find it's ridiculous. If one must get this game I suggest waiting for a big sale, maybe one that knocks it down to $7 or less, preferable $4. Good luck!  Note: I came across this site while looking at the news page for Lucius. Even though it's a review for Lucius II, it may help alot on describing the game as based on someone else's experience much like my own and the expectations of the game and what was really delivered: From RockPaperShotgun  http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/17/impressions-lucius-ii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29   NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.
1215	1	a	Ok, so people that know me know I enjoy horror films, this was an...Intriguing concept to say the least, when it succeeds, it shines, when it fails...It crashes into a fiery wreck on the I-90. I'm going to continue to play it because it caters to my particular tastes but...Its not for everyone. It has a beautifully done open world, really crummy voice acting, an actually intriguing storyline, and for those that put up with its quirks they will find a satisfactory gaming experience which falls just short of how good it could have been
1217	1	a	for freeeee
1219	1	a	Woke up, rode my trike into the garage, doused my mechanic in gasoline, and set that n-word on fire.
1221	1	a	OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10
1223	1	a	cool and evil game lol
1225	1	a	I like this game. It's a bit buggy and glitchy but on sale it's worth it. Had to use a walkthrough for my first mission or two but it was all good. Can't wait for the sequel.
1227	1	a	It's a silly and nice game but the game  very  often expects you to make the connection of what to do to advance yourself with vague or little to no hints. Also a lot of the A.I of the people in the game are wonky a lil, leading to some frustrations, and at one point I was forced to restart game because I got glitch where the girl you kill stands up in the bathtub :(  It decent.
1229	1	a	Childhood. Birthday cake. Playground. Friends. Family. Schooling. Presents. Horsing around. Dead bodies aplenty. Huh? Now, most people would never equate dead bodies with their childhood but you will when you play as the son of the devil. Lucius is the a gem of a game beacause it flourishes with what so many fps video games refuse to admit to: that we don't need a reason to kill anyone. Okay, in Lucius 'dad' wants more souls so we have to kill people for that reason. However, like every other gamer whom has played this game the joy of Lucius lies in the simple question 'whom should I kill today?'. As I played I thought of a song from a little known heavy metal band from detroit called Meliah Rage. That song was 'Kill To Survive'. As people died before my eyes in all matter of gore I sang to myself, 'I kill for killing, cause killing is my life..... I kill to survive'. That's as much as I can remember but this game delivers that devilsih joy of just killing people. Of course if I had made Lucius it would get ban every where on Earth because there are levels of depraivity, narcisism, and homicidal intention that people in the real world sink into without remorse. I would have given the gamer not just mind control but several options to make those dummies do something disgusting. Hopefully the secong game of Lucius will set our murderous selves free and let the gates of hell consume the world. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Thumbs up.
1231	1	a	I got to hail satan and kill my parents.
1233	1	a	11/10 IGN m9s, I liket teh pert wer u 360 noscop teh illuminaty leadr
1235	1	a	So, only a day into playing Lucius I am already enthralled in starting my career as a profressional serial killer. Not only has this game taught me the necessary skills, but it has helped me master the art of confering with the devil.  10/10 would sell my soul again!
1237	1	a	Not bad at all, but a bit disappointing at the same time.   I must admit that I was never  that big fan of  Omen  movies, but I know them quite well, which made me wondering if this game will try to replicate and refer to it, as the main character, place and story seems quite, well, familiar for everyone who watched Omen.  As for the story - it's simple, slowly progressing as you make your next kills. Not much to say about it - probably could be a bit better seeing that all adults seem really clueless. But oh, this is the part of fun.   Graphics and music are also okay  - I wasn't experiencing any sudden drop rates or weird rendering bugs - it's alright. I don't pay much of attention to graphics as long as they are fine-tuned. Animations and cutscenes are good, but the fact that little Lucius is keeping his poker face all the time is weird, or scary either. As for music I wouldn't expect more. the single track that keeps repeating in background while playing is matching game's atmosphere.   IBut as for gameplay.  Eh, here we go. The game itself isn't that sophisticated, I would call it fairly easy, but... Yeah. I've been playing adventure games for quite a long time but Lucius left me annoyed at times. Looking for a small, few pixels big object to break, or item to pick up isn't the way. And this brings up another topic. There's only one way to complete game. Everyone's way to hell is planned by developers and you need to follow it. No exceptions. You can't lit on fire a cute lady that is supposed to be poisioned. You can't shoot her in the face and then mind control the cop who caught you into commiting suicide with the same gun. For obvious reasons - this isn't sandbox game and any non-linear deaths would cause the whole scripted story-line to collapse. As for length of the game - took me around eight hours to complete. Could be better. Why people aren't trying anymore? There are some bugs, some of them causing game to crash (picking up dad's ammunition for the second time).  I know that Lucius 2 is around the corner and it's promised to be different game, making up for some of it's precursor mistakes. We shall see.   6/10 - Original game concept, but disappointing gameplay.  + Game concept, because there's nothing better than killing your family members on cold, winter night. + Game length. Of course another hour or two wouldn't be bad. + Heh, son of satan.  - Too linear. - Some annoying gameplay stuff.
1239	1	a	A good horror game. :)
1241	1	a	9/10 would kill stuff again
1243	1	a	it is a bit limitted, i mean you cannot kill anyone that you want or how you want, but it's still a nice game.
393	0	a	An aglamation of interesting concepts that don't quite bear fruit. By the time you get to the middle or late missions, you're checking your diary and trying to decipher the incredibly vague clues you've scribbled down for yourself. It's like having a DM in D&amp;D running the Tomb of Horrors for your party, and he won't give you a straight damn answer no matter how well you roll.
1245	1	a	Hitman + Harry Potter = Lucius If you like Hitman you should like this
1247	1	a	Being a spawn of Satan is fun, so you know.
1249	1	a	It's The Omen meets Hitman.   You play a kid who must kill people to apease your dad. It definitely pulls from the movie The Omen. While not as good as the film, it's still fun.  It may not have the greatest graphics or then best voice acting. it's still a great time killer.
1251	1	a	Great game 100x better than the 2nd don't even bother with that one!
397	0	a	Aight
1253	1	a	Best sacrafice sim I've played EVER!!! 10/10
1255	1	a	Multiverse Hitman game where Agent 47 grew up in an upper-class suburban home rather than a cloning facility, killing his entire family in his pyjamas.
1257	1	a	Lucius is a brilliant game, what other game allows you to play as the son of satan an offspring of evil and hate. Who doesn't want to play as a demented 6 year old child with an uncanny lust for murder.  The Constant dramatic Cinematics and Blood thirsty gory ways in which the player can kill someone just add to the puzzle solving feature to this game. Lucius gives players a Non-linear gameplay in which the player can be rewarded. Doing the chores in Lucius not only adds to the gameplay and story but also keeps this boys cover in check and rewards the player with items they can use later in the game e.g. a Trike which allows Lucius to move around freely throughout the house.  Murdering in lucius also gives the player rewards handed to you by the demonic figure of satan with help from these nasty abilities and the problem solving of the player, murdering becomes all that much sweeter.  So dive right in for the demonic and demented mind of Lucius I rate this game 8.5 DAX points out of 10
1259	1	a	Evil 6 year old child simulator. Aside from your main objective of killing every living person in the house, there are an array of side quests that include helping mommy with chores, picking up panties, and riding around in circles on your badass tricycle. 10/10 would kill again
1261	1	a	This is one of the best games. I'm really glad I purchased it during this special offer of being only 2 euros.  You roam a large mansion and kill your victims in stealth by using verious items. You gain abilities such as telekenises and mind control. It is one of the best game for sure, specially after you get your ride, it adds to the great atmosphere of an evil protagonist.
1263	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tare0EnzWTA  Note : Recommended if it's going for a cheap price...   Lucius didn't have much chance of leading a normal life, right from the get go, he's the subject of a summoning ritual while in the womb, and if that wasn't bad enough, at age 6 Satan decides it's time he became a contract killer.  Though don't get your hopes up that this is childhood assassin's creed, there's no combat, or planning out your custom method for taking out the designated target. Instead each 'level' is; you wander around until the camera zooms over to your designated target, then you look at what's around that the game wants you to use to kill them. Sometimes the game helps you out and zooms in on your implementations of death too. Some of these kills get quite creative, others are pretty dumb and sadly others are obscure to the point of frustration. Speaking of which, there's also a night time stealth mission, which is probably the lowest point of the game.  As the body-count increases Satan comes more impressed with your ability and grants you additional powers. The most useful is telekinesis, allowing you to interact with things from a distance. Sadly the remaining powers are pretty limited in their uses; Mind Control does exactly that, but its a case of knowing when the game expects you to use it, who to use it on, and what specifically they are supposed to interact with, which really destroys the potential for experimentation. There's also fire, which serves as pretty much your only form of direct offense.  While the premise is pretty dumb, and working out what the game wants you to do can be laborious, the game does have some pretty interesting puzzles on offer, and what's more just the idea itself more than makes up for the lack of sparkle in the execution.  Sure, there isn't much to the world (it all takes place in a pretty large house) and it doesn't look great; the character models are serviceable, but the animations are really quite poor, and the voice acting (while there's lots of it) is pretty forgettable (except one of the maids and the terrible attempt at an accent). Oh and in the credits they list out all the free sound effects and music that was used in the game...  But for as idiotic as the plot is, it's pulled off so well! The progression from working your way up from the lower tiers of the household and the increased violence that accompanies keeps the game chugging along at a decent pace and leaving you wondering what could possibly be up Lucius' sleeve next.  The storytelling is actually pretty amazing, and the game manages to maintain the dark mood almost the entirety of it (a few of the kills are pretty dumb). An investigator chalking the initial deaths as accidental, the belief that the house is cursed, the idea that there's some kind of coverup, how the blame shifts from one character to another... It a really interesting tale. Sure the actual script isn't on point 100% of the time, but the idea stands up and shines through despite the shortcomings of the game.  Lucius, from a gameplay perspective, is not a delight to play, everything about the implementation is incredibly average to below average... But it is saved by it's plot, which is memorable and something that I've actually discussed with friends, even if only to talk about how messed up some parts are... Which is something that I haven't done with games that have far more polish. It may be asking a lot to overlook the aesthetics, but if you're willing to, you'll uncover one of gaming's better told stories.
1265	1	a	Almost impossible to figure it out without going crazy and quiting or checking an online walkthrough. Anyway, the game itself has an unique concept and storyline. +Very good for a puzzle game, and games like Penumbra and Amnesia, where you have to find items and know how and when to use them. -Bad optimization even for a game from 2012. +Graphics are above average of a 2012 game but poor customization overall. (No anti-aliazing, shadow configuration and I can't figure out if the resolution is actually the one I chose.) -Personally I expected more complexity from the game itself but the 'powers' you get you use them not very often, and they become obnoxious. +The idea of the game is spectacular and i'd love to see a sequel.
399	0	a	The hell with this. 
400	0	a	Inventory is only usable with the scroll wheel. When the game even bothers to respond to the scroll wheel, it scrolls to the very first or very last item, making the game completely unplayable. Waste of money.
401	0	a	I'll recommend only if your computer is not as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up as mine. This game works in slow motion and the I can't do the 1st mission, which is lock the maid in the freezer, byt locking the door when she enters to clean. The game is bugged for me as she doesn't enter the freezer and stay on the door cleaning and I can't close it and lock it. If your computer is as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up as mine, so please do not buy it, cause it will be a waste of money. *sighs*
1267	1	a	great and cinical game, fun. i liked it
404	0	a	It's just a cheap knock-off the Hitman series.  Study targets movements, follow directions, identify patterns, use all to kill target.  Dull.
1269	1	a	If you are burning with love of god and christ, play this game.
405	0	a	First blood was pointless and not rewarding. Next scene was like, 'WTF'.
1271	1	a	Can brake bottles of vine!  10/10 broken bottles of vine! :wasted:
1273	1	a	Just glicthed on me out of nowhere on chapter 10 and now wont let me use the invictory and do my hypnosis ....this game needs to be fixed!!!
406	0	a	This game is boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1275	1	a	I'll admit that the gameplay is a bit awful, but the game makes up for it with an interesting story and gruesome deaths. You feel powerfull murdering as Lucius while the detective and the residents of your house just can't figure it out that you're the one responsible. The graphics and music are just decent, and the game is short. Has a lot of achievements but one needs you to play (or idle) for 40 hours, where you'll need around 8 hours to beat it. It's an interesting game, but i can only recommend it on sale. For one or two bucks it's worth it.
1277	1	a	Awesome tricycle sim... 10/10 would play again
1279	1	a	I love watching peopleplaying the game. I don't like to play it myself. I love killing people, this game is funny and brings up good jokes on the way. But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!
1281	1	a	I greatly enjoyed this game. Yes, there were times when the journal was too vague to figure out but that doesn't outweigh the rest of the game. I personally loved it.
408	0	a	I want to like it, but the puzzles are far, far too vague. I'm not expecting hand-holding, but once through the tutorial there is precisely zero guidance on what to do next, it's not obvious from context. If you like having to work out literally everything about a game through trial and error, this is the game for you. Otherwise, move on by, nothing to see here.
1283	1	a	This game is top notch best game i've ever played
1285	1	a	Short but...   The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, We don't need no water let the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burn, Burn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ burn. 
1287	1	a	Rough around the edges but fun, original, and it makes you think.
413	0	a	Lucius thrives on the suspenseful build-up and gruesome pay-off of its high body count, but not much else. The delectable killings seesaw between immersion shattering hilarity and visceral jolts of brutality. The game rapidly falls apart towards the end, as all charm that was present is thoroughly eradicated. Don't go in expecting anything of substance that demands multiple playthroughs.  An intriguing concept tarnished by a shoddy delivery.  5/10
1289	1	a	Really loved the game, and obviously the fact of beeing son of the devil &gt;:3. Funny to play, average cutscenes, but not as interactive and 'free' as lucius 2 in my opinion, cuz you have to follow the rules and have limited space to work with. BUT, it doesnt prevent it to be a good game!  Probably a 8/10, and recommendable! :D
1291	1	a	evil demon child lol
414	0	a	The concept of a young devilish child reaving havoc was one that definately piqued my interest, however, sadly dissapointed with the gameplay. One of the many problems I found with this game that I don't usually have with many others is that I have to constantly refer to other sources for help. You will find yourself looking for quest items that are often way too subtley hidden in a mansion where you will pace back and forth, room to room just looking for something to get by. The problem lies in the lack of the games ability to aid the player without necessarily giving anything away (Note: You are given a tool to find items but even this is given 6 limits and can only be used in a room so it is nontheless wasteful unless you know the item could be in a specific room). Even better yet this could be solved with a non-linear format, one which provides players the ability to use multiple killing methods. This would increase replayibility and ease the painfully dullness of searching items. Some of the game mechanics lacked sense, for instance why give certain abilities only to be limited. The game sacrifices player free reign with a linear story line which isn't that great to begin with. You'd think that with multiple deaths in one home would peak the interest of the media (besides the one journalist) and feds or perhaps even motivate the family or employees to move out, but the characters all lacked sense regardless of how 'strange' or accidental the deaths are. It's no surprise that the sequel, (yes there's a sequel) didn't do well. Once the intial pique of the concept passes, theres hardly anything else that holds you there. The game needs to be rebooted, everything but the concept out the window.
1293	1	a	It seems like a great game but can't get it to start on my Windows 10 PC
1295	1	a	This game is top notch best game i've ever played
415	0	a	Erm... where should i begin? First of all, the price is way too high for this game. 20 euros? are you kidding me? i bought it for 0.94, and i still want my money back... Well, the story is... just another Satan's Son story, that kills people just because he's Satan... It seemed promissing when i saw it, but after an hour of playing... i change my mind Environments were... uhm... really large, but weird done. Poor animations, choppy transitions, non-existent facial expresions, also very very stupid AI. I'm sorry guys, i thought this game would be cool and fun to play, but gets repetitive after THE FIRST CHAPTER! '2/10 would refund' -Nick It was unexpectedly bad...
416	0	a	Not enough hinted in the gameplay, and far too much is narrowly locked down to fit the deaths of each people. The game pretends to allow you some roaming ability and general freedom as you sneak around the house, but you quickly find you're basically on rails the entire time.
1297	1	a	Entertaining game if you like being a devil and killing your family.
1299	1	a	was a good game if you like puzzel games you have to think alot, its alot of fun being the devild son when you walk around a mantion killing most of your staff.haigly recommend it if you have the pastion fore it
420	0	a	If you like puzzle games with smooth controls and a refined stealth system, then this is definitely  NOT  the game for you.   I can't think of a kind word to say about Lucien, either the titular character or his 'adventure'. The entire thing is on rails, to the point of explaining what happens before you do it â€” no suspense, not even the illusion of choice â€” and constantly swapping between flagrant handholding and dropping you into a room with no idea what to do except flail at the glitchy and painfully-limited interface until something happens.   Then there's the horrible model animation; characters's limbs and held objects routinely clip through things, and it doesn't seem like they bothered at all to syncronise movements to interactions.. Despite there being very few interactions to be displayed. The ONLY positive is the well-detailled house itself, but you'd better get used to it because you never go anywhere  else .  All in all, Lucius takes the worst from point-and-click games and combines it with the worst from 3d RPGs.. and I haven't even mentioned the part where the  six year old child  you play takes photographs of people having sex, or visits a room full of nothing but softcore pornography and sex toys. One has to wonder whether this game was made for anything other than shock value.
1301	1	a	IM SO EVIL.
422	0	a	For the price, its not a bad game. A little clunky but you get used to it after a little bit.   Edit:  Bugged achievements have really made this game obnoxious. As an achievement hunter, this game would normally be an easy 100% completion. A lot of achievements will unlock as you play through, and also a lot will trigger without doing all the requirements. But when you play and play and play and the time achievements don't trigger(see my play time) it pisses me off to the point i'm glad I got this game for free from an auction site. Don't buy it outright. Find a special or a bundle if you feel you must play this.
423	0	a	not very clear with this game...
1303	1	a	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
1305	1	a	This game is messed up beyond anything i have ever played. You play a 7 year old who is the devil's son and you murder people. reminds me of the omen and children of the corn. Good game if you're into gory messed up games.
1307	1	a	If yo are a satanist and enjoy killing and watching people suffer then this is the game for you!  I beat this in the shortest time possible for me, i was addicted to this games story and now im gonna try the second one
1309	1	a	We are part Satan in this game.   RECOMMEND  10/10 
425	0	a	Bugs, bugs, bugs, inconsistencies, stupid scenario, low fluidity, bugs.
1311	1	a	anti-christ? anarchist? kill them all. rule the world, watch it burn!
1313	1	a	  Well this game, is kind of complicated,altough it's really satisfing, the moment when you get all the puzzel's pieces and finish a level. This is a game for a vast mind, and a lot of thinking. I really reccomend this game.
427	0	a	It wasn't bad it kept me there for almost 10 hours it has no replayability though. bad powers hard to use control. the whole game is just a big puzzle that has one way and one way only to beat it Can't recommend buying also the soundtracks are annoying as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
1315	1	a	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â‚¬
1317	1	a	Nice game ! 666/10 Hail Satan |-|
1319	1	a	This game has an achievement which wants you to play the game for like 40 hours. That is not happening.  The killing is extremely linear in this game. If it wasn't, I would love this game. In the end, its ok.
1321	1	a	I wish I was Lucius 666
1323	1	a	nice game, i found this game in youtube, when pewdiepie play it.
1325	1	a	Honestly Ive played through this game and almost 100%'ed the achievments, in my personal opinion a brillaint game would definatley recomend it. I found hours flying by and me saying to my self, just one more murder. The story lines okay could be better but overal I'd definatley say give it a chance.
1327	1	a	I killed many adults like a complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ while being satanbabby 10/10
1329	1	a	this is a fun little a game where you play as a evil little boy killing the unsuspecting people in your family's manor to gain dark powers.  pros -unique concept -really embracing evil, which is not really common in gaming -nice story, but it could have been much better  cons -some powers were not very useful, one of them, telekinesis, was simply useless. the controls for it were that bad -house layout was very confusing. it takes time to get used to it, but this is a short game. -doing chore could have had more impact -the ending could have bee better  score : 7/10  just get it with steam sales
428	0	a	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.
1331	1	a	I don't think I like you, DIE!
1333	1	a	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.
1335	1	a	This my own likes and dislikes of the game  Likes &gt;Graphics Is great for old game &gt;Good Storyline &amp; Scenes &gt;Get to play as Villian which is rare in games &gt;Alot of Interaction &gt;After few unlocks be able to explore alot the house  Dislikes &gt;NPCS can get stuck &gt;NPCS detecting you can seem almost impossible to avoid   Is the game worth buying? I quite impressed with this game and sure is worth the buy in my opinion
1337	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ para â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1339	1	a	I watched Pewdiepie played this game before so i had interest in buying it. At first i was like hmm should i buy the game or not... But i was like meh.. F*ck it! It took me 6.5 hrs to finish the game.  #PlayedWithWalkthroughs #noob   Pros: -Has a great story -You can unlock cool stuff like a bike if you're a good boy! (if you do some chores) -You get to see some ;) (you'll see) -Decent graphics  -Decent voice acting -SATISFYING KILLS AND SH*T!  Cons: -Some characters in the cutscenes have late reactions (LOL) -There are some bugs but its minor. -Few powers sadly :( -The game's kinda short tho -YOU DEFINITELY NEED GUIDES AND WALKTHROUGHS TO FINISH THIS -Can be boring at times if you don't know what to do...  10/10 would Recommend this Unholy game :P  Give me a +rep in my profile if you found this review helpful :)   Thanks!
1341	1	a	Awesome game, cool content and great 'killcams' :D
1343	1	a	How to be the antichrist. I had fun killing those meat bags. lol
1345	1	a	this is a fun little a game where you play as a evil little boy killing the unsuspecting people in your family's manor to gain dark powers.  pros -unique concept -really embracing evil, which is not really common in gaming -nice story, but it could have been much better  cons -some powers were not very useful, one of them, telekinesis, was simply useless. the controls for it were that bad -house layout was very confusing. it takes time to get used to it, but this is a short game. -doing chore could have had more impact -the ending could have bee better  score : 7/10  just get it with steam sales
1347	1	a	great game.
1349	1	a	Fun, interesting, very dark humor that I quite appreciate, but you can't really read the description of this game without expecting dark humor. The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.
1351	1	a	666/10
434	0	a	It's a ok game but I expected there to be more freedom, it's all too scripted.
1353	1	a	The Omen simulator
1355	1	a	This game is soooooo badass, the graphics are cool, but overall it's just fun to play as the Devils son. 8/10
1357	1	a	.
1359	1	a	Well its easy:   - Don't play if you're a good person!
1361	1	a	- Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use 
1363	1	a	i played like 2 hours and the game is kinda interesting !!
1365	1	a	..
435	0	a	pro  - cool idea - big house to explore - music  cons  - Theres no hints where to go or what to do. - Damm big house gets boring when u have to wander around it over and over again. - Laggy - Glitchy - cant kill how u want  Buy it on sale, otherwise i dont recommend it. Liked it from the start , but after like 2 hours im ready to abandon it gets so boring.
1367	1	a	This game has me just thinking woah the whole time. The idea that a little kid has powers from lucifer and kills people, while having time to take out the 'trash.'
1369	1	a	Nice game!
1371	1	a	i realy liked this game it was so fun to play but i ran into a lot of bugs i realy liked the gameplay it was fun to run around the house and kill people but i got stuck on some parts like killing uncle tom but over all fun 9/10
1373	1	a	Oh Lucius, with his blank expression and dead eyes.   Overall a pretty fun and wellmade game, although a bit aÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶hÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶ anticlimactic by the time the credits roll. Stepping into the tiny shoes of Lucius you get the sense and feel of what made the Hitman games so inventive although once you scratch that surface, the goals are much more linear and there's really only one true solution to wiping out each member of the household. Sure you can experiment and have fun, but this will always lead back to a 'game over' screen. This doesn't make each chapter any less fun.   Honestly, I had a great time running aroung a confusingly constructed house, observing many of the twisted occupants, and then gleefully offering them to that Lucifer fella. There's a lot of fun little detail (shine your flashlight on Lucifer,) so many gruesome deaths, a bunch of chores to do, and math class.   Definitely worth the price of admission.
1375	1	a	Definantly recommended for hours upon hours of fun. This game is excellent for those who are into horror-ish ames, or, with the right sense of humor, a few good laughs.
1377	1	a	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10
1379	1	a	I was very supprised with this game. After finishing this game I look back and realize there are three things that makes this a game i can recommend. 1. The house is a character, the house has alot of detail and is layed out in a manner that makes it fun to traverse. 2. Not sure if it is intentional, but its like a bad horror movie you get to play. Some of the sappy things that you would see happen in 80's horror movies, make this game fun. 3. This game would be a complete disaster if it didn't control good, but the controls work great and make alot of sense, and the parts that are not that great make for fun to master like the telekenisis. If you can get this on a sale it makes it even better, but if not I would still recommend this game a purchase.
1381	1	a	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary.

1383	1	a	As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:  LUCIUS:  Lucius a game where you are a kid of a rich family, the son of Lucifer (your family doesnt know that, that is what makes the game exist), where you get orders from your father to bring him 'tributes' by killing people. The thing is, nobody must find out who you really are nor what can you do, so, by using your mind and your powers you have to make every kill look like an 'accident'.  Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.  PROS: +Very good story. +Even if it isn't listed anywhere, it is an open world game, you can get almost anywhere in the house at any time of the game. +You can get a bunch of items in the inventory that can be usefull at any time.  CONS: -The map is almost uselss, it has no explanation of the place nor your target. Needs too much thinking on finding out where to go. -The controls of the bike are bad, like trying to play a shooter game with a joystick bad. -The achievements are not a challenge at all, you can just do something, then replay it 4 times to get the achievemnt, doesnt matter if you get a Game Over. -The 40-hour achievent has no use at all, this a 8-13 hour game, you just have to leave the game running all night.  TL;DR It is a good, not great, psychological horror game and has a good story. Get it on sale  8/10
1385	1	a	ur an evil kid trying to annihilate ur own family.
1387	1	a	666/10
1389	1	a	Great game,very hard,but still a great one 10/10 would kill people again
1391	1	a	Good game with good plot. It's an easy game. Not much to think :) but it give me a lot of fun. Also its easy to get all achivments :) game have some bugs but its playable. for me 5.5/10
1393	1	a	If you've never played this kind of game you should give Lucius a shot. It's not perfect but it is interesting. Ok, now I'm just gonna go back to killing people.
1395	1	a	I really like this game, and feel bad about liking it at the same time. For anyone who has seen any of 'The Omen' movies, the main story is pretty much the same, for the ones that haven't, here it is. You play as Lucius (duh) the son of Lucifer (pinnacle of evil etc.) and you job as his son is to give him offerings in the form of human life. You start of easy with little accidents that leads to fatalities, and slowly work your way up with power he grants you as you go along. You live in a huge mansion with lots of staff, maids, a driver, mechanic, custodian and you even have a private tutor. Each mission introduces something new you can do or have to do, in order to act innocent you have to appear to be a good boy and do chores, which gives you presents (that's how parenting works) This game have some issues though, for me it was mainly graphics, in the form of lighting effects that were way off at times, but also some crashes, which is really annoying because you can't save. The game autosaves for you, mostly after a kill (a new chapter begins). It still alot of fun though and there alot you can do, and it takes you awhile to figure everything out in every mission. Overall a solid experience and loads of innocent blood. 6.7/10
1397	1	a	I love satan but its a bit buggy :/ get it on sale its pretty amusing
1399	1	a	When buying this game, I knew that it would either be amazing or horrible. Lucius succeeds in surpassing my expectations with it's artistic flair and gripping story. with a plot heavily inspired by The Horror Classic 'The Omen' yet cis creative enough to pump in original ideas and establish its own identity, Lucius triumphs in a storytelling view. the visuals work well with fleshed out character designs and and a beautiful mansion setting, large enough to work as a world within the game and can be explored throughout. If there was one thing to gripe about it's the controls. Lucius has only two speeds: Slow as S#it or fast as F*@k, depending on if you sprint or not. still, the game is well worth a play and I highly reccomend it
1401	1	a	This is a great game and I definitely recommend it to everyone!
1403	1	a	I feel like this game is like on the Movie: The Omen.. It's about the birth of a boy whom his family does not know the truth that he is the son of Satan.. It's a cult game but will get repetetive soon since you are exploring a small amount of world..
1405	1	a	this game was soo much fun xD  well worth the purchase
438	0	a	Got this for $2 on a Steam sale, not worth more. This is an incredibly frustrating, glitchy point-and-click I had to consult a walkthrough for on almost every level, because you are given almost no clues and controls are not straightforward (ex: really hard to lift objects with telekinesis and get them where they need to go). I frequently got clipped between front doors and cabinet doors and had to restart. Other reviews made it sound like there was more of a story; characters repeat the same line of dialogue every time you approach them each chapter, so you don't care about any of these doll-like creatures. 'Chores' are a fairly meaningless function unless they're central to the person you're supposed to kill that chapter. Since this is obviously an homage to The Omen, I was really hoping for all-out 70s references and decor, but there is none. Only thing I got a kick out of was Lucius's resemblance to Mads Mikkelsen and the soundtrack. Kept playing just to see all the ways he would kill, and because I try my darndest to complete something I've paid for, but Lucius has no replay value and little payoff the first time around.
1407	1	a	Really fun to play through, wish it was a little bit longer though! The music and the atmorsphere was really good! A game you should defenatly play during halloween! Hopefully the sequel is better or just as good, fingers crossed!
1409	1	a	An entertaining puzzle game with a unique concept. It's actually a lot of fun and features some great music and controls! However, the second half of the game becomes lazy with the puzzle design, almost as if the product was rushed. Also, you are forced to murder people in specific ways while being restricted to a small environment to explore. Get past all of this, and there's still a solid game underneath.
1411	1	a	Is an old game that I will never forget.
1413	1	a	iz good fam bcoz you gt to kill peopl for no reazon coz you iz teh devils son and dat iz fun :) dere iz also a sex scene so 20000000/10 IGN wud ploy agin
1415	1	a	A smart game with a great story and lots of character. There is many well made cinematics and good use of music. I very much enjoyed running around the classically decorated old mansion discovering how to take out each target. I had to resort to a walkthrough for just a few parts but that hasn't made the game any less enjoyable. I'm just a few chapters in and so far I'm very impressed. This is a must play for practical thinkers and murder enthusiasts alike.
1417	1	a	Surely better than the second game. Got lost more than once in that big â™¥â™¥â™¥ manor.
1419	1	a	Why Is My Game In A 3D Effect Please Help Turn It Off
1421	1	a	enjoy this games really. cos i can kill everyone as we want like serial killer. but we cant choose how we kill them
439	0	a	Idea and story of this game is not bad at all. I can more or less say that I enjoy final cinematic with murder for every chapter, but what I definetly didnt enjoy was the way to it.   Since like chapter 8 whenever I wasnt sure what to do next, I better look into walkthrought because you are constanly running from one point to another with mostly no idead what you looking for (some items are very small and not indicated in any way) with wasnt fun at all. Also technical part of game is kinda bad and most of the character are just roaming mansion and repeat 1-2 sentece, with really didnt help with atmosphere.  So overall not the worst game, but for me to be enjoyable experience, it would need much more work into it.  
440	0	a	This is a perfect example of very VERY amazing idea ... which end up being completely garbage...  Short:  Really boring logic game with loooot of searching stupid stuff and almost zero satisfaction (for me) + I finished game in 5-8 hours - I don't remember... There are achievements on playing 20 and 40 hours.... YEA!?  Long: Man! It was so sad!  Playing as a little boy, who is a son of a devil? Making convenient traps? Killing people? Wow! I really want to play this game, mommy!  NAH - it is soooo boring... We have 0 choices - we must kill exact as the game want us to do it. We must find / use the exact ducking (usually) small thing to trigger the events / the guide-notebook. Our powers are trash - they are just for triggering things mentioned above.  I hoped for some free play after completing 50% of the game. Then after 75%... maybe after 100%? Nah... I can't leave house and make a killing spree...     At least screenshots are nice?
1423	1	a	Pretty good game to kill time with. Decent graphics, many possibilities. It has it bugs/glitches but in the end is really entertaining. Strong 7/10 for me.
1425	1	a	:)
1427	1	a	Good game, very funny but a bit broken sometimes in terms of design and how the game gives the player clues about what to do. Play it with another person until you both make Lucius own the house! Bahahahahahaa! 
441	0	a	What feels like a should-be fun sandbox murder game ends up being a bunch of one-solution puzzles of murder. Would be improved exponentially if there were more possible ways to go about solving each problem. Still, it's a really interesting game, just not one that gelled with me.  You can watch our attempted playthrough here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoQVsov5Zk0 
1429	1	a	I thought this game would be good...But i can't say much because i got stuck on the first level so i'm not going to give a negitive review..yet. WHY WON'T IT LET ME BREAK THINGS OVER HIM AND HURT HIM?
1431	1	a	If you liked the movie 'The Omen' you will enjoy Lucius because it is basically the same premis. Creepy with a few jump scares but mostly milder horror/gore. I realy enjoyed playing the game and knocking off the characters one by one in increasingly elaborate designs. The 1980's graphics/coloring also made me feel like I was watching 'The Omen' and added to the overall feel of the 1972 setting
1433	1	a	so dissapointed the fact that it doesnt run n mac, BUT AMAZING
443	0	a	TL;DR for lazy people: Boring, confusing, horrible stealth mechanics. Decent story.  This game sounded a whole lot better on paper than it is in practice. You're a creepy mute kid who is apparently the son of Lucifer and you have to kill everybody in your house so your father can have souls, using diverse methods to knock off your targets one by one while making it look like an accident.  Unfortunately, finding how to do it is a hassle, there's only one way to kill each target and it's not always obvious. there are few clues and if some of them are usually simple and clear, you never know where to find the item, you have to search a huge, confusing manner to find said item and use it. Even after you found the thing, it's not always clear where and how you're supposed to use it. This game doesn't hold you by the hand.  Despite those problems, the game is rather interesting to follow as some drama starts because everybody's stumped and the detective in charge has no idea how all these deaths happen. But then comes ... The Betrayal. The one chapter that manages to ruin what little fun this game managed to offer. You have to cause a power outage so you can sneak around to get in the garage, which is on the ground floor, on the absolute opposite of your starting point. Here, you have to contend with locked doors and horrible stealth mechanics that barely work coherently. you can't see a thing but you don't dare use the flashlight in case this game actually makes you easier to spot when your light's on. All you do is try just about every door in the frickin' house while avoiding the adults patrolling with flashlight for no obvious reasons while your remaining satanic powers are drained because you manage to get spotted by someone who's at the far opposite of you in the corridor or by people you couldn't see or hear and open the exact same door you were planning to open.  This, this is what killed the game, that was barely alive in the first place. It'll probably end up being one of those curios I bought for a buck that I'll never finish, let alone re-install and that's too bad 'cause I'm rather curious about how the story ends. Oh well.  
1435	1	a	Good fun. Look forward to playing more of it. Fun for all those who enjoy puzzle-y type games.
1437	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. The game itself looks great and I love the story. One of the best games I've gotten from the Steam sales. I would recommend it to other people.
1439	1	a	Before you buy the game, please not that it is VERY HARD. There are many components you have to think of before killing each person. Unless you look up a walkthrough/playthrough/guide, it is going to be difficult.  That being said, this game is also good, and it feels like you've actually accomplished something once you've completed on of the components. So, here is a crisp list of pros and cons to help you decide if you want to buy the game or something.  Pro: Gameplay It's very important that your gameplay is a pro, that is a MUST with the community, And luckily for Lucius, it actually has unique gameplay that is quite good at the same time. You really have to think and explore, which not a lot of video games take the time to do these days.  Pro: Amount of Content There are around 16 puzzling levels that feel like a game in themselves. And if you're a completionist like me, there are many achievements for you to collect. All of which aren't to difficult but aren't easy either.  Con: Unpolished The game feels like it's in beta, with the slighlty (quite slightly) long load times and the unsynced voices. It just feels slightly unpolished and could use that extra push to get it to the finish. I also ran into some door glitches on my joutney through the game.  Con: Tutorials The game doesn't do the best job of explaing things. Pure and simple.  Pro: Story Good enough story to make you acrually want to kill people. You don't really care about the people that you're killing, Which in a sense is actually GOOD. Becasue it makes you feel like a cold hearted killer.  Overall: Lucius is worth the full price. There are better games around it's price, but Lucius feels good enough to be worth the price. I got it for 1,45 when it was on sale, and it was extremely worth it.  Also Tom's â™¥â™¥â™¥ is 10/10.
1441	1	a	I HIGHLY recommend playing this game! If your not sure it's right for your taste's though maybe you should watch PewDiePie on Youtube play it.
1443	1	a	Have you ever felt like murdering innocent strangers or even your whole family?  Have you ever wanted to be an evil, satanic 8 year old? Have you ever wanted to be in a cult?  Well, now is your chance. Play as a satanic, ungrateful little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who slowly murders everyone around him because he is part of the cult.  This game is recommended if YOU have ever wanted to fulfill YOUR dream of becoming Satan.  
444	0	a	pro  - cool idea - big house to explore - music  cons  - Theres no hints where to go or what to do. - Damm big house gets boring when u have to wander around it over and over again. - Laggy - Glitchy - cant kill how u want  Buy it on sale, otherwise i dont recommend it. Liked it from the start , but after like 2 hours im ready to abandon it gets so boring.
1445	1	a	This game has me just thinking woah the whole time. The idea that a little kid has powers from lucifer and kills people, while having time to take out the 'trash.'
1447	1	a	REALLY FUN GAME has a few issues but still fun game
1449	1	a	.
1451	1	a	Completed 02/08/2016.
445	0	a	The controls made this almost unplayable, I wish I could have used my controller though it would have only helped slightly. You move so slowly and if you try to run it goes crazy which makes manuevering around very hard and disorienting. I saw potential but I can't play this game with these controls...
1453	1	a	I would have loved to play it however I can't due to a slow computer, I would love to know if they are working on a mac version and if they are when that would be released.
1455	1	a	Truly a messed up game. You play Lucius, son of Lucifer in a house of people who were once your family. You need to kill them all for Lucifer to harvest their souls. Maids, chauffers, deputies, family, no one is safe from this messed up 6 year old. It's a VERY linear game where you need to kill people in a certain order and a certain way for a scripted event. Some deaths are very gruesome like the nailgun to the back of the head. It's a very mature game that's almost a puzzle game. A very interesting take on The Omen film. It's not a great ache but it's not bad. It's 20 very short chapters, will take you no less than 7 hours to finish this game. If you just want something to hold off your satanic killing/assassinations... this is a decent game.
1457	1	a	666/666
1459	1	a	Recommended. You are a child who are just turned into 6 years old, and you will receive a 'guest' during your birthday. You will then slowly learning, and control your evil power which is bestowed/awaked from that guest.   This game is very puzzled though. Some clue might appear on your note book. I only plaued and completed chapter 2 (during this review) and it was a good game, and satanic.  7/10 for now.
1461	1	a	This is such an evil game...I LOVE IT!
447	0	a	This is a very linear game and there is only one way to kill each person.
448	0	a	In the first chapter, you murder someone and meet the devil. In the second? You get stuck trying to figure out what to do for an hour and told to pick up your room and brush your teeth. I plan on coming back to this game eventually, but I wasn't very impressed.
1463	1	a	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM   
1465	1	a	Wow... This is a hardcore scary number one indie game!!
1467	1	a	  Well this game, is kind of complicated,altough it's really satisfing, the moment when you get all the puzzel's pieces and finish a level. This is a game for a vast mind, and a lot of thinking. I really reccomend this game.
1469	1	a	Good game it teach me how to be a psycho and how i feel to be a son of demon
1471	1	a	Old but gold I rate 666/69
1473	1	a	Recommended, if it's on sale or bundled (and if you haven't watched a 'tuber play through it first as there won't be any more surprises for you.)  As others have said, it's just linear progression with only one solution for every stage, like an older point and click adventure, While it was fun enough on first playthrough, some parts of the game seem to hold your hand only to then suddenly push you down the stairs. Though only once did I have to check a walkthrough thinking the game had bugged. (It hadn't. An item was easily missed.)  You're offered three profiles when launching the game. I played through once, unlocking every stage (all in one location, a mansion) while paying no mind to inventory items. Started fresh using the second one after learning once you acquire a certain weapon early then complete the level, it will stay in your inventory for the subsequent ones. This is where I got most of my enjoyment from, failing over and over again because I found it simply hilarious to murder every NPC. This would sometimes cause ragdoll bugs for them that were almost as terrifying as the in-game death sequences. Several death scenes left me aghast as they're fairly well done and I hadn't seen footage beforehand.  I stopped playing just before the 20-hour achievement as it'll give me a bit more incentive to play again in the future. Earning the 40-hour 'chieve w/o cheating it is right out. With the Lucius de-make coming, some people might take another look at this game and I felt it warranted a bit of warning. If you have fun with that game, it might be best to leave it at that as the story and puzzles look to be truly identical. At least low-end PC users will get a chance to play now. I'm hesitant about purchasing said 'demake,' hoping the devs use that potential income to fix Lucius II, a game I'll never finish in its current state because I'm not into masochism. That said, I still hope to see more offerings from Shiver Games and (besides mocap and audio,) their staff of three.
1475	1	a	Its a pretty good game. I finished it in about 7 hours.... (the rest was just in idle to get achievements). It has some bugs still, and maybe its my computer but the graphics are alittle wonky at some points. Either way, it was a fun game, and I'm glad i bought it.
1477	1	a	i like trains but this is good game
1479	1	a	The kid looks like a complete douch but the game is actually pretty fun.
1481	1	a	Killing people the the anti-christ with mind powers is fun &lt;3
1483	1	a	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1485	1	a	  Lucius is a game about a little boy who's a son of a  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lucifer. One of the best indie games ever seen, even the optimization is good. Worth buying anyway.
1487	1	a	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â‚¬
1489	1	a	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
1491	1	a	10/10 The Omen: The Video Game 
1493	1	a	Lucius reminds me of Hitman: Blood Money; you have a target, now find the best way to kill them. Generally I enjoyed the game dispite it being released in 2012. The game starts off by explaining that since it's your birthday you inherit the unholy powers of your father(the devil). Through out the game you must kill poeple in the manor to gain more abilities. Each chapter, you find your target and are given hints on how to kill them; the way some characters die in the manor are pretty grim, from being    crushed by a piano to being shot with a nail gun.    The game is not afraid to show it's true colours. 
452	0	a	It wasn't bad it kept me there for almost 10 hours it has no replayability though. bad powers hard to use control. the whole game is just a big puzzle that has one way and one way only to beat it Can't recommend buying also the soundtracks are annoying as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 
453	0	a	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.
1495	1	a	Hard as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and also for a bagde
1497	1	a	KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY   Even if I didn't have the choice of the manner to kill my victims, the game was very pleasant for the sadistic person that I am :D  Satan/10
1499	1	a	Reversed some crosses, burned some people, no one suspects anything, I'm just a nice child and surely not suspicous.  Nice story to play, don't check walkthroughs, cause it's too easy then. Buy it, enjoy, kill people have fun.
1501	1	a	A really misunderstood kid is Lucius, one of the creepiest kids in games but so utterly, devastatingly adorable beyond measure!!!
454	0	a	Not to bad a bit evil for me so not my kind of game
1503	1	a	Now, I've only played a bit of this game, but I would say it's VERY interesting, some parts are a bit difficult, but nothing bad.  I'd buy.
1505	1	a	51/100   Buy this only on sale and nothing else to play   Genre: Strategy, gore, protagonist, story Play-time: 5~10 hours  PROS: - Cheap (buy it on sale only) - Achievements are quite easy (buggy tho)  CONS: - Buggy as hell (have to restart sometimes) - Bad controls (played with joystick) - Low fps (my newer games run better) - Useless game hints (at least state whos gonna be the next target!!!) 
1507	1	a	First time getting a boner from a horror game.
1509	1	a	This game gave me the weirdest boner. Anyone else with me.
1511	1	a	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1513	1	a	The game is pretty fun, till it gets to the point where you can't figure anything out without some hints. Still a really cool game
1515	1	a	my lil demonic baby
1517	1	a	das pretty neat
1519	1	a	Amazing game, Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^
1521	1	a	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.
1523	1	a	im on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in rampage
1525	1	a	Ready to play the Omen, I mean, Lucius? Learn powers that you'll literally never use until you're told to and kill people in so many limited ways! Thinking of a creative way to pick off the maid? Well stop that right now! You've got to do it step by cryptic step. Half the time you won't know what you're looking at/for!  Ready to be sucked into an in depth world filled with emmersive characters? What are you doing here? There's none of that! You have an uncle and more than one maid! If you say you knew you had an uncle before chapter seven you're clearly lying.  Who can forget such amazing dioluge like 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' And 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' Your mother won't say anything else to you so you better brush those teeth (teeth brushing optional)  11/10 would walk in on uncle again.
1527	1	a	This game that put a smile on my face. ( ï¾Ÿ âˆ€ ï¾Ÿ )
1529	1	a	I enjoy playing this game if i got nothing to do and this game should definitely won the 'Villain most in need of a hug' cause even tho lucius is the main char i feel he is also the villain XD and yea lucius wants to be hugged or wants to have attention from his father.
1531	1	a	  Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.
1533	1	a	For when it is discounted by atleast 60%, i'd suggest buying it for a fun little mess around when all your other games dont seem to be filling your needs. Great GAME but only worth it on discount!
455	0	a	Not to bad a bit evil for me so not my kind of game
1535	1	a	After playing this game i literally googled 'how to make a pact with satan'.. The game has nice storyline and convinced me I could be the decendent of lucifer (praise be to him) himself.. Anyone who loves to manipulate peoples' life and be the cause of their suffering then play this game..Finished it in a few days though with some walkthrough help..
1537	1	a	reminds my of a horror move and as a 'expert' horror movie watcher as myself i realy appriceated the story line along with the pulling attraction of suspence 8/10 
1539	1	a	First time I finished Lucius it was cool, but on second time it wasnÂ´t bad but itÂ´s not game you would like to play many times...  but I canÂ´t say anything bad on it  so 10/10
1541	1	a	Zombie Driver is the same for the top-down car racing games as Zombie Shooter is for the isometric style action-RPGs: mindless fun offering you hours and hours of entertainment while ridding the world of a horde of zombies!  You play as a taxi driver who is entrusted by the government to complete certain tasks during a zombie outbreak. The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.  While story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.  Furthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I.   This game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!  This is a highly recommended game!
1543	1	a	I used to wonder what the big woop about this game was. Now I know. You get to mow zombies down- in a car- with machine guns- and rockets- and flamethrowers- and spikes. Nuf' said.
1545	1	a	If lavender tea and deep breathing don't help after a bad day, try this. Mixed with the proper metal this game's survival mode is a great stress reliever. Plus, it throws out achievements like candy making you feel like even more of a rock star. I sat down planning to spend 30 minutes killing some zombies...I walked away 4 hours later feeling as if I had been at a day spa.
1547	1	a	Pretty much the same thing as the non HD version so definitely not worth getting unless you can get it really cheap in a indy bundle which is just exactly how I acquired it. As far as I've noticed all it really adds is some boss monsters in the single player stages. That's about it.  If you don't have the original though it's a nice drive and gun game with some cool extra modes that's recommended if that sounds like your kinda fun.
1549	1	a	Played a few levels, this is AWESOME. No clever jokes, no 11/10 would blah blah, it's great, buy it.
1551	1	a	For those who just want some mindless random fun this is it. It's a simple but hard to put down game. Always a joy to run over hordes of zombies! ;)
1553	1	a	In ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and (mostly) destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.  Your missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what youâ€™ve unlocked so far and how much cash youâ€™ve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game youâ€™ll find that youâ€™re really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.  The upgrades available for your vehicles fall into two categories: weapons and modifications. Modifications affect a specific vehicle only and are these: armor, speed, and ramming (the last of these represents a vehicleâ€™s ease of turning intact infected into smears of roadkill). Weapons include such items as machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a rail gun, each of which has three power level upgrades. Weapons are provided in the form of â€œpickups,â€ meaning that you drive over a weapon to equip it and only one may be equipped at a time.  What story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although itâ€™s evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.  Once youâ€™ve completed (for me after about 10-12 hours) or gotten tired of the story mode, there are two other single-player modes to explore: Blood Race and Slaughter. The Slaughter mode is basically a horde modeâ€“you have one vehicle and you pick up powerups and kill as many waves of zombies as you can before your car is destroyed. Blood Race felt a bit like a less-fun version of Death Rally: you compete in a marathon of eight events composed of â€œeliminatorâ€ (destroy a target number of enemy AI vehicles before time runs out), â€œenduranceâ€ (survive as long as you can with a bomb on your vehicle by passing checkpoints to add time to the countdown), and â€œraceâ€ (what it sounds like). The race sections arenâ€™t really up to DR because destroying an opponent only takes him out of the race for as long as it takes for him to respawn and most of the tracks are very curvy. Even using a gamepad, the steering for most vehicles is very slippery, so sliding around corners isnâ€™t really an option for novice racers.  If you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoy Zombie Driver HD. Itâ€™s not a great game but itâ€™s not a terrible game and thatâ€™s about the best faint praise I can give it.
1555	1	a	If you liked driving around and killing people with your car in GTA 1 &amp; 2, you might take a pleasure in playing Zombie Driver. You've either got a machine gun, a flamethrower, a rocket launcher or a railgun mounted on your car. You even can choose your vehicle, e.g. a taxi, a sports car and not at last a tank in story mode. Beside the story mode, which is not that challenging, there is a racing called Blood Race and a survival mode called Slaughter. All of those are fun and the game itself is just about fun, it is certainly not a high-class game. Despite the variety of three playable modes, the game is rather short. Nonetheless it is worth buying, especially on sale.
1557	1	a	English (US) Nice history campain mode, you play as a mercenary hired for the military to aid in the zombie elemination, it is very simple and funny, looks like the old jungle strike series, however the race campain mode is terrible, it does not work proprely, your car reacts different every time it touches the wall, so its more about luck than player ability.  PROS: - Fun n simple - Lots of cars - Lots of upgrades  CONS: - Very repetitive - Race mode is terrible   Portugues (Brasil) O modo historia Ã© muito bom, nele vocÃª joga um jogo de carro de aÃ§Ã£o, bem simples e divertido, no estilo jungle strike, agora no modo corrida, o jogo simplesmente Ã© podre, nÃ£o depende da habilidade do jogador e sim da sorte, pois cada hora seu carro se comporta de maneira diferente.  PROS: - Divertido e simples - VÃ¡rios carros e armas. - Upgrades dos carros e armas  CONTRAS: - Bem repetitivo - Modo corrida Ã© pÃ©ssimo.   Nota 6/10
1559	1	a	-ZOMBIE DRIVER HD REWIEW-  This game is not bad.There is long Story Mode Stages and Blood Race Mode Cup events to get some action and Slaughter Mode to teste your drive ability and experience in this game.If you have gamer soul you can't get bored while playing this game.  Different Cars to drive and you can upgrade them that sounds good.Also you can try to reach high rank at leaderboard on all stages and modes like you want but i need to warn you i said ''if you have gamer soul you cant get bored white playing this game''before.Yea its true but this game is kinda slow like not a normal race game or different category car game maybe cause it's a 2nd person strategical driving game that makes it slow i think  So is it worth to buy it? Maybe yes or no but you can try it anyway if you liking to climb leaderboards in different games   Drive to your best score Good Luck :)  My General Point To This Game:5/10
1561	1	a	The objective of each level is to navigate the vehicle through the confines of the city while completing missions and killing Zombies.   PRO:
1563	1	a	Suddenly it's a very nice game. I'm shocked, lol. Dynamic racing action, blood, gore, zombies and interesting car upgrades. Cool.
1565	1	a	So close to being an awesome game. Manic zombie killing vehicular apocolypse, but the six inch visibility means hitting every wall in town, and the ten mile turning radius means each kill is annoying to go back for, and the two seconds of ammo capacity means guns are a pipe deam, combined with unskippable bad voice-acting... so close to awesome, but not quite.
1567	1	a	Tons of fun, and easy to just pick up and go. Dont have a lot of time, but need a few minutes of game time? Most of these levels only take a few minutes to complete. It is, however, hard to put down once you get started. Well worth the $.
1569	1	a	Good fun couple of hours  Like a hooker, but cheaper.
1571	1	a	Fun medium-sized game with detailed graphics, different from others of zombies because has vehicles as main weapons.
1573	1	a	Buy it! but beware of motion sickness if you suffer from it.  It is a top down driver shooter, where the camera will constantly swing around as you turn however it is great fun if you don't mind gta 1 type top down driving, had the game on the xbox when it first come out glad it's on steam now.  playtime might not appear like ive played it much but just was trying it out to see if its changed much since i last played it and nope im still a little bit dizzy but i'd still recommend the game for sure!
1575	1	a	Much fun to play through the storyline and the arcademode, trying to get better highscores. Most satisfying topdown and car-driving game to kill zombies. Maaaaany zombies. And so much stisfying gore :-P  Ever heard like a railgun slices through a mass of zombies big like a footballfield? No? Get the game then ;)
1577	1	a	People are often surprised about the amount of time I devoted to this game. The concept is not very complex here - you drive around, smashing zombies and surroundings, sowing destruction and collecting upgrades to your car and momey to buy even more upgrades.  Can this game be any good? Definitely! It's one of the games that I spent most time playing. It has some storyline, but it's not the reason you play this game, is it? I play it when I feel the need for speed and destruction without excessive brain exercise. In fact you can freely relax your brain in this game, you will be using your eyes and fingers, but won't need to plan any complex strategies. But when you play a game that is all about driving into hordes of zombies, can you expect anything else?
1579	1	a	(Updated 29/10/16) ... Added Video.  There are two fundamental flaws with this game...  1) It's not multiplayer. I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.  2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'.   Maybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.  Basically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades.   Most of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.  The HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...  The other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines.   First there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.  Second there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events. 1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position. 2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer. 3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.  Again if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.  Seriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.  Finally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Making of Zombie Driver&nbsp;
1581	1	a	Simple premise - zombies have resulted from a large explosion at a corporation trying to cure cancer, and everyone is infected. You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives.   Simply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further. Absolutely worth the price paid.  TLDR; Fantastic fun arcade driver game, in the vein of Carmageedon and others. Splatter zombies, equip and upgrade vehicles. 8/10
1583	1	a	Surprisingly fun! I didn't expect much from a game where you just drive around the whole time, but through fitting audio, brutal animations, powerful weapons, massive zombie doom-bringing tanks, and fast paced action, this game makes mass zombie squishing extremely satisfying. 'Slaughter', a wave-based survival mode, brings all of the weapons to your disposal early on, like the super powerful railgun, making normally repetitive zombie smashing very enjoyable.
1585	1	a	This game is like the original grand theft autos with zombies so you don't feel guilty for flattening them. It's a fun game worth the money. N.B. Recommendation moved from the 1st one as this is simply a better version with a race mode like death rally, and it's in HD...
1587	1	a	Never played the original, so no comment on how this is or isn't a dev/pub cash-grab, but this game scratches that car combat itch. Lots of repetitive zombies and sound effects (and poor voice-acting), but the positives are a nicely-bombed-out lookin' city, and a good range of cars and weapons at your disposal. The different game modes (story mission, racing, and survival) help mix things up, and a bunch of not-unreachable achievements is always a bonus.
1589	1	a	Great game! Like carmageddon, just with zombies :)
1591	1	a	I like the game, fun to kill Zombies.. light &amp; good time pass.
1593	1	a	Zombie Driver HD as the title says is a game about driving. And the problem of driving game is that most of the time they gets boring real fast. I like that game, the music is good, the graphics are pleasant enough but there are lacks of variety. You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going.  However, I still find this game fun. It's a no brainer, that's why and I like the idea of blasting away zombies with a mounted minigun, laser, rocket on a taxi,bus,limousine etc. But one thing I don't recommend is to buy it full price.
1595	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass some time reminds me alot of the game Carmageddon for N64 when I was younger.
1597	1	a	Buying this game on sale, the complete HD edition I might add.  I don't need to play this for very long to realize that this is a brainless fun game. If you like that Baldurs Gate camera view, vehicles armed Flamethrowers, rocket launchers and gatling guns all in the name of cauasing mass zombie genocide combing mbloodier kills for a higher score multiplier.  Then this is your game.
1599	1	a	So far for my first 30 minutes this game trows me instantly into a zombie mess, after that there is no tutorial (-1 point) and you must learn the controls from the settings, the game mecanics are impresive plus the graphics are good enough and working good witht the blood decals, the weapons are ranked to bad to better like the flametrower, can do some damage to the big zombies but not for a long range but shorty it will ran out of amm and than we have the rocket launcher that has low ammo but massive damage and explosive radius. Upon this game basics, this gem brings you car and gun upgrades, not so good because they kinda are unlockables and that means they can be unlocked trough the story, the enviroment is very fascinating plus that weather and day/night system makes it look even gorgeous and they couldn't just leave the game only with zombies by their selves, they added freaking BOSS fights, the controls may not be that easy while trying to aim your weapons but it's worth the try.  I feel like I haven't payed enough for this game, still haven't enough money in wallet xd. 8/10 will run into zombies if I had the chance in real life, wish me luck.
1601	1	a	I'd call it gta 2 where you can only be in a vehicle.     Its OK. That really sums it up.
1603	1	a	If you ever wanted to drive a tank during a zombie apocalypse, then this game is for you!
1605	1	a	Although it is very repetative, you get a good feeling when you drive through a horde of zombies. Each and every time.
1607	1	a	Pretty damn good top down driving game in GTA 1 and 2 style. If you liked the original GTA style driving games, this is just like them, only with content and graphics like they were made today. It also reminds me a lot of the old APB arcade game.
1609	1	a	Really fun game driving round killing zombies in a kitted out killing machine of a car, good if you just want to play something fun for a while to pass time, after a while gets abit repetitive but its good as a time waster.
1611	1	a	love this gane and it fun to play
1613	1	a	Drive, kill, blood, guns, big guns, bigger guns, zombies. And they give us a free update that made the game look better and add more zombies on screen. So there is a lot of zombies And a lot of fun!
1615	1	a	Enjoy it for what it is.   It's an isometric fast paced zombi shooter on wheels. You get your upgrades, new vehicles, races, end bosses etc etc.  Not sure if its worth the full price, but under 5 Euro's (if you have a coupon or something) is a fair price in my opinion.  Lets not forget it's fun to kill zombies in wich ever way we can.  
1617	1	a	Sooooo much better than the original. This one just feels so much more polished, and fun. There is soo much more detail now. Take my word for it, its worth 9.99 (or 4.99 if you already have the non-hd version)  I will admit, I was a little dismayed when I heard that owners of the original were not getting this HD free. However, after playing it (and getting 50% off to boot) I can see why they had to charge something, they kept what made ZD fun, and added much needed jazz to it.
1619	1	a	I'd call it gta 2 where you can only be in a vehicle.     Its OK. That really sums it up.
1621	1	a	It's okay. Repetitive and the end missions are stupidly unforgiving though.  It's fun for a while, at least. One to pick up when it's cheap.
1623	1	a	Although it is very repetative, you get a good feeling when you drive through a horde of zombies. Each and every time.
1625	1	a	Pretty damn good top down driving game in GTA 1 and 2 style. If you liked the original GTA style driving games, this is just like them, only with content and graphics like they were made today. It also reminds me a lot of the old APB arcade game.
1627	1	a	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.
1629	1	a	Running over zombies has never been more fun.  Buy this game while its on sale for $0.99  8/10
1631	1	a	A relaxing mindless carnage is the best way to describe this game.
1633	1	a	Excellent, fun little game. keeps sucking me in for a few more hours destruction.
1635	1	a	Zombie Driver HD..Title says it all Your Driving and Killing Zombies with your car! This game is quite good but sometimes gets boring fast because of standart story mode...There are diferent modes and the best is Slaughter mode I think you must survive as much as possible while zombies are comming and comming! Also you can unlock upgrades for your cars! Flamethrower power, Rockets, Speed, Armor and much more! Get it you wont regret!:)
1637	1	a	HD version of the original with quite a few improvements. They've basically fixed everything, and improved the quality of the effects. I noticed slight graphical improvement with the environment, but not much. The dialogue was barely fixed. There were still parts where I was like 'Skip...Skip...Skip...COME ON!' I want to *hick* run this *hick* game into a *hick* wall sometimes...... *hick* Seriously. Drunk people don't do that or sound like that. STOP IT!  Missions were improved, and I don't remember the original having the huge boss fights which can actually be challenging towards the middle of it. I also got the DLC with the car and the truck. The truck helps a lot, but you'll also have to upgrade the dlc car if you want to beat those timed missions with... *hick* time to spare. *hick*  One of the things people wanted was multiplayer, and I'm really hoping to see that in a possible sequel.
1639	1	a	This game is really addictive. Very satisfying to drive through hordes of zombies...oh man! You just scratched my paint.
1641	1	a	Highly addictive action/racing
1643	1	a	It`s a fun game after 8 hours working and you came home play this game 10 min and you feel much better ..   Recomand it ..  
1645	1	a	What is there to say about Zombie driver HD that has not already been said?   Coopl story, excellent concept, and easy to have fun with, but hard to master. If you have ever dreamed about racing a taxi with rocket launchers into a zombie mob, pressing fire, and driving through a fireball of epic proportions, then this game is for you.   I would suggest buying an X-box controller for this.   Drink for this game? Mountain dew, mixed with vodka and a dash of lime, with a spoonfull of strawberry jam.
1647	1	a	This game is a hell of alot of Fun ! 10/10 on the fun scale ! I like everything about this game..
1649	1	a	Haven't played it very much, but so far it seems pretty fun . . . worth $10? No. But if it is on sale for around $3 I would definitely pick it up!
1651	1	a	Very fun and easy to play game. Only downside is that it cant be played multiplayer.
1653	1	a	This game is a really great new twist on a classic style of game. The old game series where you'd fly a helicopter around, saving guys with your ladder and fighting enemies all over the map as you did little missions.  It's like those old games but with a slightly customizable car selection and zombies. Grab it if you like zombies and see it on sale, it's a very fun smaller title.
1655	1	a	I have mixed feeling about this game, overall it's good but not very well done, I'm reviewing it with all dlc available. Edit: I have beat the main story so I think I should update this review   pro : - good music - stunning graphics - ram all zombies and blood everywhere - good game without thinking much  con: - there are not much content in this game so the game feel very much repetitive, I played until the very end of the game and the last 2 levels are very predictable - the survivors that looks like asian has russian accent :D ( I think it was on mission 28 or 29) - feels like mobile game with controller support, i don't know why, but it just feel that way - the plot is kinda stupid, till the endm why a taxi driver do everything and army sit behind desk. I meant the story is pretty much predictable - I hate the zombie that can throw things, i just don't make sense at all, I keep thinking when playing where they get throwable things and able to throw like 50 meters away -- and when there are too many of them and you don't pay attention you will die almost instantly from them  other: - GPU intensive, my notebook was overheated while playing it for hours :D - CPU intensive too starting on mission 25++ - The apocalypse DLC ruins the game because new player like me didn't know anything about the game and we could pick truck monster that was overpowerful for early level.  -   stupid ending, doesn't explain anything    final score 7/10 (it was 6.5) give 0.5 because at least they put something new for the last mission
1657	1	a	If you can buy it for a dollar, buy it, you will make 1,50$ with the card, WINNING!!!

1661	1	a	A little awesome game which kicks â™¥â™¥â™¥
1663	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a race / shoot game.  Core game play is very nice. Story mode you drive around the city to shoot, race and kill your enemies. Many various of mission to give you hour of fun.  Camera is top/down view only you can adjust this if you prefure a other camere view. Controls feel very good and playing this game will me easy and fun. I still prefure a controller abvoe keyboard &amp; mouse.  Collecting guns and other items for shooting your way though the wave of zombies. Or just use nitro and drive over them !!!!!! Many upgades and new unlocks like new cars.  Good game, nice sotry mode. I give this a 8/10 score. !!!!! 
1665	1	a	Running over zombies in a Bugatti Veyron with mounted missiles and guns. Come on! How could you not like it?
1667	1	a	Oh how satisfying it is to kill THOUSAND of zombies! Got it on sale for only 1.34 â‚¬. I think they should've added some kind of a free roam mode but that's just me :)
1669	1	a	This game is so fun.I feel so manly as I run over a horde of zombies in a taxi.Get the full version its on sale atm and its worth it.
1671	1	a	This game is incrediable! for $9.99 you get a lot of game play, three different modes of play, and a awesome amount of enjoyment!! Buy today!!
1673	1	a	Squish zombies. Fry zombies. Shoot zombies. Repeat.  Oh, and you can do it in a sports car.
1675	1	a	holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i just played one hour and i can deffenatly say that this was the best 1 euro that i've spent , its such a well made game !
1677	1	a	Man I hope they will release Zombie Driver..... 4k! Get it? EH? Becasue... the reso- uhmm  10/10?
1679	1	a	A remastered version of original one with good soundtrack.
1681	1	a	fantastic game worth the money 10/10
1683	1	a	TL;DR: Take the fun of Carmageddon, the viewing angle from GTA (the original ones) and strap weapons on your taxi and you're good to go on a quest to save the city.  In Zombie Driver (HD) you are some dude who drives a taxi. Military ('if they even are the military', says the random hippie) enlists you to save a bunch of civilians in a zombie infested city. Mow those zombies! Mayor will pay you a bonus for their smashed bodies! Gruesome, silly kind of humour is cultured in the overly dramatized monologues everyone else gets to give you when you meet them.  Zombie driving gets a lot more fun once they strap a machine gun to your car. Later, you'll get equipped with flamethrowers, rocket launchers and even experimental rail guns that shoot blue, helical rays of mass destruction. Not to forget, a tongue-in-cheek car game wouldn't be complete without a turbo booster. Between missions you get to upgrade your cars (new ones unlocked every few missions) and weapons.  There are no surprises in the zombie varieties: in addition to the regular, shambling corpses, there are legions of zombie dogs, wailing slingers of industrial junk, bloated monsters of the exploding variety and of course the hulk. Naturally, it is more difficult to ram the bigger ones and especially in large groups.  Story mode has two kinds of basic missions: 1) taxi missions: go and save people from buildings around the town (usually with generous time limits), and 2) slaughter missions: go somewhere and kill everything. Here,  everything  includes the zombie spawners (introduced by the HD version): enormous Jabba the Hut creatures that blurt out more of the monsters (it figures that these are not your average zombies after all). In addition, there are the awesome cleaning and destroying special missions where you get to drive e.g. tanks, with infinite ammo of course. HD version also has a couple of bosses that add nicely into the game's limited lore.  Story wasn't the strong part of the original Zombie Driver and it has only been patched partly by the HD upgrade. It ends abrubtly but rather appropriately although leaving your contribution vague: it is unfortunately never explained why the army (or whatever they are) needed a random taxi driver to sort their mess.  Two other game modes are more like what the game was designed for: there's the copy of Death Rally called Blood Race (though you can't destroy your opponents permanently) with several different tournaments and challenge missions. Unfortunately, career mode is missing. You'll get money for winning races and can then buy limited upgrades to your car. On the other hand, Slaughter mode is an endless killing spree of perpetually spawning zombies for higher points to show off in the leaderboards. Here only death ends the level.  Game is fun and pretty awesome. However, it is easy to get stuck in corners and sometimes it is not clear what items can be driven through resulting in further stuckiness. Mob spawning can be ruthless and illogical, especially in Slaughter mode: zombies tend not to walk as fast (or at all?) when you are not seeing them in front of you in the camera and the game considers it fair to spawn a group of exploding zombies right behind you when you are reversing.  Despite the few complaints, I can give it thumbs up. Graphics are nice, sounds are not irritating and gameplay is very nice (I used keyboard and mouse). Also, the improvements from the original Zombie Driver are very welcome: e.g. they made booster a separate item from weapons, added a map and made the story mode more interesting with the zombie spawners, bosses and special vehicles. If you have doubts but are interested, you can also grab it on sale for 2 euros or less.
1685	1	a	Super Fun plan on playing more
1687	1	a	Awesome game!!! Sometimes, it reminds me of Land of the Dead meets Death Race! Lovely blood gore gameplay with tons of achievements to unlock. Graphics is also good. No need of high end gaming rig to run it smoothly. If you like to play zombie killer games with set of wheels, this is the perfect game to choose from. I'll rate this game 10/10. Highly recommended during Sale.
1689	1	a	Nice game. Upgrade your car and check how it wil run over zombies. Had a lot of fun playing this one.
1691	1	a	Pretty nice 'Carmageddon meets GTA2' kind of game. Also zombies. Nothing more to say. Just a small time-killer. 5/10
1693	1	a	Quite a fun and entertaining zombie-slaying car game. It's a top-down view (so it makes it hard to navigate unless you stare at your radar 24/7) action-packed apocalypse slaughtercity of bullets, fire, explosives and plasma. A very entertaining game for when you just want to chill out and blow everything up. And for some reason be satisfied with such a bloodfest.   Well, if you have a huge bloodlust and like cars, then this game's probably for you.  The only con I have for this game is the forced top-down view and the voice acting.
1695	1	a	too funny recommended
1697	1	a	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
1699	1	a	'It's like Skyrim with Zombie and Car without Skyrim ' IGN  10/9
1701	1	a	ZOMBIE. YOU. DIE!! I DRIVE!! Buy it, costs peanuts and plays like a boss!
1703	1	a	I payed 2.99 (complete edition) 0.4h on record atm, but i have to say thats totally worth it. Reminds me a little bit a game from '97 IGNITION (lots of hours played on this game xD), similar camera (not because the zombies hehe).
1705	1	a	éžå¸¸ã«æ¥½ã—ãã€æœ€é«˜ã®ã‚¤ãƒ³ãƒ‡ã‚£ãƒ¼ãƒ¬ãƒ¼ã‚·ãƒ³ã‚°ã‚¾ãƒ³ãƒ“ã‚²ãƒ¼ãƒ ã€‚ãƒ—ãƒ¬ã‚¤ã—ã‚„ã™ã„ very fun and easy to play. best indie zombie racing game ever
1707	1	a	Great game, i got the DLC for it gave me 1truck for 1$ good deal, very fun!!
1709	1	a	its a good game yes driveing is good nice customizeashen (spelled that wrong)     only down side is that there is no graphics lowering so for poor pc`s this is not 4 u
1711	1	a	Really fun game.
1713	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing highly addictive, alot of replay value in this game, and rightn ow its only 3 bucks with all DLC, you can't beat that!
1715	1	a	Tons of fun and challenge!
1717	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a very simple but yet brilliant game and well worth the cost, it is basically a small 2d zombie driver/killing game in which the aim is to save innocent people from the zombies and get them back into safety and kill many, many zombies overall i would give this game a 7.5/10 for its brilliant planning and gameplay.
1719	1	a	The game is fun, simple as that :)
1721	1	a	Gore Gore Gore and more Gore Great Fun Game  Nuff Said
1723	1	a	This game is a lot of fun.The missions tend to be rescue survivors or destroy this and that or collect this and lastly defend that.However when your on the missions the zombies become quite the pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ enough that it keeps you playing. I dunno if I would get this for a $10 but its worth buying the game at whatever price you feel comfortable with. Game is loaded with driveable vehicles and you can upgrade things nicely. If you like some driving plus zombie killing,this game is not a bad fit. Not the best,but good times.
1725	1	a	You start off as a humble taxi driver. Then a nuclear plant explodes. Things begin to mutate. And it all goes downhill from there. Which is kinda nice. 'Cause you'll be needing that extra momentum.  (You should totally get this game. It's a new take on an old idea and quite refreshing as well)
1727	1	a	Sure, it's another zombie game, but this one is actually quite good! Top down driving and gunning fun, for a good price and a relatively compact gaming experience. I wiped out the original in about 20 hours, so I expect this HD version to give up 40 hours of enhanced and added play.  Tip: if this is still like the original, it might be a good idea to hold off all upgrades in the story mode until you unlock the discounts. Going to find out for myself.  Recommended for single players. 8 / 12
1729	1	a	so much achievements!
1731	1	a	Love it :)
1733	1	a	This game is a load of fun. Needs a lot of work and updates still but hey can't dispute this is entertaining.
1735	1	a	So this game is basically Crazy Taxi with flamethowers and machine guns but zombies and random mutant bosses get in your way. There's also a kind of pimp my ride aspect to it with the garage and the spray paint and stuff. I weren't expecting much from this but it's probably actually one of the funnest games I've played lately..
1737	1	a	put guns on your battle cars so you can kill zeds while you kill zeds. f#ck yeah!  i loved the original release of this game and the 'HD' steam release is even better.  now there's not only the story mode but also race, destruction race and survival. i focused on the story mode and only played the other modes for the achievements but the other modes certainly aren't bad. it never hurts to have more options to extend your playtime and increase the value of the game.  the story mode includes quite a lot of levels and they offer a decent variety of missions and side missions. plus you can finish the missions and still drive around for a while to kill some more zeds and increase your reward. with a fine selection of cars and weapons it just never gets boring. the other game modes are pretty much self-explanatory.  there are some DLC for this game but they are not essential and you don't need them for the achievements. i completed the game 100% after little more than 19 hours and it was just as big fun as the original release.  if you like cars and guns and want to kill some time and zeds then you really can't go wrong with this game.
1739	1	a	Best zombie game ever on steam just they are $9.99 XD there 1 car i love it so much but money to upgrate that just found money XD
1741	1	a	I wonder if GTA1 would could be produced with these graphics.
1743	1	a	This game is really fun to play and it is worth the price, which is low anyway. I highly recommend you get it.
1745	1	a	I just want to say that I am pleasantly suprised at the fun this game has provided so far. I really didn't expect much going into the demo version when I downloaded it and played it. After playing the demo I rushed over and bought the bundle pack. I would most definantly recommend this game to people who want a break from the high budget blockbuster titles. On a scale from 1-10 I give the game about 8
1747	1	a	Pure, mindless, zombie massacring FUN.  Ending's kind of a letdown, though.
1749	1	a	Run over zombies, fry them, electrocute them, blow 'em up etc. A brainless, but enjoyable game. Story mode + 2 other game modes.
1751	1	a	Someone please mod Mercedes-Benz into the game!
1753	1	a	a single player Twisted Metal-style, top-down shooter with everything you could ask for in its genre. thousands of zombies to kill by minigun, flamethrower, rockets, etc or simply just ram and run them over and destructible environments evertywhere. almost a dozen vehicles to drive around with ,over two dozen story missions to experience wtih a variety objectives for each, and 2 additional modes: Blood Race [Racing, Endurance, and Elimanator] and Slaughter [Survival] to keep you playing.
1755	1	a	I keep coming back to this game. Great vehicular combat
1757	1	a	Look at the bloodstains right there
1759	1	a	one of the best games i played, they should make a 3d version of it
1761	1	a	  Nice Game... Good Graffics. I Like Play Games with Categorie Zombie... :) Yes... i Recommend for You!!!
1763	1	a	Great Game.  +easy Game +Fun +Zombies +Story +Bosses  -Awful Camera Movement, it moves automaticly, but not automaticly in the right way it should/ when you Turn your Car, most of the Time the Camera is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up you should make the Camera free, so you can move the Camera with the Mouse a little bit
1765	1	a	Not bad, not worth much though. unoriginal on top of that.  I'd pay $1, not much more.
1767	1	a	I enjoyed it for what is worth.
1769	1	a	Its amazing this driver can see with all that blood smeared across the windscreen!  10/10!
1771	1	a	you can't play as a zombie and drive a car, don't be fooled!
1773	1	a	Awsome game, love cars with guns, and who doesn't like killing tons of zombies.
1775	1	a	Best game ever. And a solid amount of gameplay too.
1777	1	a	killing Zombies with cars ooo what fun!!!!!
1779	1	a	Very good game! Played it for hours and hours!
1781	1	a	Pretty good game, haven't beat it yet though. Fun and cheap...the way i like my games.
1783	1	a	THIS GAME IS A WHOLE LOT OF FUN I ENJOY IT BY SMASHING ZOMBIES GUTS OUT IN CARS AND ITS WORTH MONEY AND TIME
1785	1	a	Drifting an Auroch and got stuck , Dogs at my Armored Truck..  10/10
1787	1	a	Honestly, really fun and really well done, a perfect time waster and looks great for a top down driver.
1789	1	a	it has zombies and uprades;)
1791	1	a	I have Nausea but still I enjoyed the game.
1793	1	a	Can't stop playing. Worth more than what I paid for.
1795	1	a	Cool enough to keep you busy when you need some blood
1797	1	a	Fun single player story line, shoot zombies, drive cars, mmmmk sure...
1799	1	a	Arcade zombie slaughtering 2D game,it's one of the best 2D games i have ever played.Definitely recommended
1801	1	a	good old fashioned zombie-killah :)
1803	1	a	Cheap and entertaining. Nothing special but worth the few cents to pick it up on sale, good for killing time (and zombies)
1805	1	a	Fun racing/zombie squashing game. Tournaments are fun, there are leaderboards, achievements and a ton of GORE! In case you like it. Me, I don't, but the game is well-made and enjoy-able. Oh, did I mention achievements? None are broken, so you can 100% this.  Grab the demo to test it out.
1807	1	a	This game is suprisingly fun to play. I definitely reccommend it to anyone who likes car combat games, and zombies. Cant forget the zombies.....  
1809	1	a	Cool and Bloody Game! :)
1811	1	a	WE NEED MORE CARS AND MISSIONS ONLINE GAMEMODES MORE MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS AND MORE PAINT JOBS AND MORE BOSSES AND ZOMBE CLASS MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
1813	1	a	This game is a lot more fun than it has any right to be. Top-down view, drive around the city (and other environments in the different game modes) and slaughter zombies. That doesn't sound like it should be anything special, but this game pulls it off especially well to make it a fun game.   It's definitely a great little time waster, and definitely worth getting. :)
1815	1	a	I like this for a quick thrash. Load up, mash zombies, finish a level and quit.
1817	1	a	Not bad. You drive with crazy controls and sometimes feel like your characters drunk half the time.
1819	1	a	Is this a good game? Well, you get to run over zombies... which is delicious.  What I am disappointed with though is the people behind this. Instead of just updating Zombie Driver, they went and re-branded the game as HD, updated and improved upon the game with some new content, and sold it for another $10-15.  So while I consider that a crummy move, the game is still good.
1821	1	a	8/10 Good. The game is a perfect mix between racing and zombies, simple graphics but magnificent visuals, the missions are great, the zombie killing is intense and a lot of gore. I like this game and it is worth it.  Pros &amp; Cons: +awesome car upgrades. +big map to play in. +long missions. +sooo much blood and gore  -No free roam mode.. seriously, why?? -a few variety of weapons. 
1823	1	a	I like this game:) Recently i played on pc and the game i downloaded from windows store but the version is payable. So yee I love this game:)
1825	1	a	Not bad at all when bored.
1827	1	a	If you like twinstick shooters you should like this, up there with renegade ops.  Worth grabbing with all DLC and its not expensive.
1829	1	a	A surprisingly fun game to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around in
1831	1	a	Very Nice game to waist some free time on, Online play is dead. no one on.. okay storie line for something to do if your bored, and or if you just like to kill zombies in Style..

1835	1	a	Very good game but maybe you can make it better if you want 
1837	1	a	Got this game for a song. Was worth singing.  
1839	1	a	This is a quick and satisfying game about driving through crowds of zombies. The graphics aren't phenominal but they work for this type of game.  My only gripe is the fixed, top down camera which makes it hard to drive really fast and plan out where you're heading.  If you don't have a lot of time to play videogames, this is great for a quick fix.
1841	1	a	This is a very...meh game. It isnt bad, its just it isnt very engaging. You'll get bored of it after level seven. I guess they couldnt pay for voice actors, but for the love of god you could have at least gave a little enthusiasm in some lines. I never thought I could hear. 'Our driver was eaten by zombies.' come from someone who sounded like they were bored out of their mind till now.
1843	1	a	Fast,Fun,and zombie gore everywhere!!!!! MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
1845	1	a	Brilliantly addicting game, not much thought need to go into driving over zombies. For a couple of quid you can play for hours also which is pretty good compared to most new games.
1847	1	a	This game is 10 / 10 no questions ask .
1849	1	a	It's a decent game, it's not the best of it's genre but it's a good when u just want some mindnumbing zombie crushing action, its fun to mow down a huge horde of zombies or destroy stuff with the bulldozer, missions get repeatitive tho and their isnt much depth to it other than a really basic upgrade system. but overall its a decent game, worth getting on sale
1851	1	a	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.
1853	1	a	This game is hilariously cheesy! If you like squishing zombies with cars, this game is for you!
1855	1	a	Play some heavy metal music, blow a line, and drive really fast over zombies  10/10 would blow again
1857	1	a	This game reminds me of the good old days of Grand Theft Auto, back when it was a top down game, based on stealing cars. Anyway, this game improves on that one, because you're mowing down zombies with your machinegun/railgun/bumper. Its short but you get wha you pay for.
1859	1	a	Love this game, its one of those that you find yourself going back to over and over again. Killing Zombies in a car, Blood Gore and some really nice graphics make this game just a joy to play.  7.5/10
1861	1	a	Great Game Loads Of Fun !!!
1863	1	a	A great time killer  oh and it has zombies! Everyone likes zombies don't they........?
1865	1	a	Now in HD!!! A simple and fun zombie game. It offers cool upgrades for your vehicles so you might start with an ordinary run-of-the-mill taxi, but you will end with a zombie-splattering-engine-of-doom! Best part is, it's a low price and easy to run!
1867	1	a	The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on.   It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.
1869	1	a	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0
1871	1	a	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1873	1	a	Suprisingly fun and addictive game, you can splash hordes of zombies untill you get your satisfaction. For 90c not bad not bad at all
1875	1	a	Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game . The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it
1877	1	a	Good game and beautiful game. You must try it! 10/10.
1879	1	a	This game is a blast for the most part. Just zombie smashing fun.  Really nice graphics, atmosphere, environments and awesome zombie physics. Cool other physics too.   The main game mode is great. The story is amusing.  The only part I absolutely hated with a passion was the blood race tournaments, and no event worse than the race mode. Every freaking corner or turn just becomes a friggin mess.   The cars don't have the handling to take the insane turns and cornering and you just end up spinning out or getting stuck in some random obstacle. Gotta hand it to them, they didn't ease up one bit. They really put the chaos into those races. I only put up with that madness for the achievements. I got all the steam achievements for this game, phew...  The elimination mode of the blood race isn't as bad, but is still a pain. The endurance mode just has a trick to it.   The real fun though is the slaughter mode. Just endless waves of zombies.  After a while it becomes so dense it's like driving through Times Square on New Year's Eve.
1881	1	a	Got this game for a song. Was worth singing.  
1883	1	a	Very enjoyable game, it's a top down car based arcade title where you have a story mode, races, and my personal favorite, slaughter mode.   Campaign is you're a cab driver during a zombie outbreak and you complete various missions, races and wipe out hordes of zombies while progressing and unlocking new upgrades/weapons for your vehicle.  Race is pretty much what you'd expect except (fun words to use in sequence) you can blow up your opposition to set them back/eliminate them and there are zombies on the race track.  Slaughter is a mode where you survive/wipe out as many zombies as you can in timer based waves earning weapon/repair/cash (score) drops. Various maps you can unlock based on doing well in previous ones+new cars to unlock via the 3 modes and a score board leads to an addictive 'Beat your/friends high score' mentality of old school games.  I only have less than an hour on the PC version (picked it up for $3.74 on sale) but I have 20+ hours on the xbox one version (paid $15 and don't regret it).  The game runs well on my potato so no complaints there.   Fun way to kill time/hilarious game to watch via broadcasts.
1885	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.
1887	1	a	It is a exicting game. If the person who likes car, zombies and guns!!!, well this is the game for you. Upgrade your car to the max while also unlocking new cars thoughout the way.
1889	1	a	Nothing like some Zombi guts all over you car.
1891	1	a	This game is fun to run over zombies and customise cars.  10/10
1893	1	a	This is, in every way, better than the 1st one. I think the previous edition was great but this one is way better.
1895	1	a	this game is surprisingly good, i like it. the camera is a bit iffy, but a good game overall
1897	1	a	Kill kill the zombie !! A nice drive-in game.
1899	1	a	Nice game, wondered what if this game had a multiplayer.
1901	1	a	It's currently Â£2.20 for all DLC and the game. Buy it. You won't regret and and if you do.. it's only Â£2.20.   Zombies, check. Vehicles, check. Decent music, not so much. Flamethrowers, check. Machine guns, check.  9/10 so far. No issues and works 'out of the box'.
1903	1	a	What better way to learn to drive..... Buy it !!!
1905	1	a	Truly an amazing 3rd person zombie game :D i would highly reccomend getting this game :)
1907	1	a	Fun for a couple of hours
1909	1	a	Great value for money (except that I broke my keyboard and have to buy a new one). Pros: fluid, fast paced, some variety, decent length. Cons: frustrating, some vehicles barely controllable with the keyboard (all or nothing) and others too slow, Logitech gamepad not recognized. I gave up at mission 28 (out of 36) after 3 attempts.
1911	1	a	zombie driver HD is an extremely fun game if you just love to kill zombies in really badass ways, like me!
1913	1	a	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1915	1	a	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.

1919	1	a	tons of fun blood and pew pew in this arcade style game. love it!
1921	1	a	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1923	1	a	Nice splattergame! I recommend a controller. Unfortunately, there is no Multiplayer...

1929	1	a	Brilliantly addicting game, not much thought need to go into driving over zombies. For a couple of quid you can play for hours also which is pretty good compared to most new games.
1931	1	a	Awsome game perfect for lovers of zombie killing :)
1933	1	a	Play this game its really fun. The title may sound corny at first, I thought the same thing, but its surprisingly good!
1935	1	a	Love this game, its one of those that you find yourself going back to over and over again. Killing Zombies in a car, Blood Gore and some really nice graphics make this game just a joy to play.  7.5/10
1937	1	a	A great time killer  oh and it has zombies! Everyone likes zombies don't they........?
1939	1	a	Fun remake of Zombie Driver and more stuff and vehicles to play and more achievements great game :)!
1941	1	a	What better way to learn to drive..... Buy it !!!
1943	1	a	Are you looking for a casual game which can help you blow of some steam? You should buy this game. Do you like running over and shooting zombies with armored cars? You should buy this game. Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
1945	1	a	Buy it itÂ´s fun.
1947	1	a	Reminds me of GTA 1. That's a good thing. Good controller support. Fun, totally mindless. Worth the voucher price, easy.
1949	1	a	Haha, epic fun. Don't expect anything too expansive though, comparable to web games
1951	1	a	Finnaly can have guns on my car without having the risk of falling out of the car
1953	1	a	Zombie Driver very good game when i thought.If you have a free time definitly you enjoy to spending hours.Basically you have a car and weapons and all you have to do killing zombies with guns or just crush.Story very similar and sounds ok, but gameplay very enjoying.Probably you wont boring this game.
1955	1	a	I played this expecting it to be a terrible waste of time. I am actually having a great time playing it. A great way to waste 30-45 minute time periods in between my Counter Strike matches. 8/10.
1957	1	a	Very Nice game to waist some free time on, Online play is dead. no one on.. okay storie line for something to do if your bored, and or if you just like to kill zombies in Style..
1959	1	a	Buy it and the DLC. Discounted at $2 is an amazing buy if you love tricking out post-apocalyptic cars to kill zombies.
1961	1	a	Not bad. You drive with crazy controls and sometimes feel like your characters drunk half the time.
1963	1	a	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!
1965	1	a	It is a exicting game. If the person who likes car, zombies and guns!!!, well this is the game for you. Upgrade your car to the max while also unlocking new cars thoughout the way.
1967	1	a	Didn't expect this game to be fun at all, turns out I was completely wrong. This game is a nice small type of indie where you can upgrade your ride as you smash and kill zombies while completing missions
1969	1	a	buy this game cause its good.
1971	1	a	It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.
1973	1	a	buy this game cause its good.
1975	1	a	Exciting and attractive arcade game, but late-game it seems to seriously lack unique enemy types/hazards/weapons/objectives. 7/10
1977	1	a	I thought I was a Taxi Cab Driver during an Apocalyse. Then I picked the Mayor and learned =  Don't eat the Nachos.
1979	1	a	More combat rich and much more of a gorefest-ival...see what i did there.  TOP KEK!  not that i'm going to be allowed to say this but...well â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing done....
1981	1	a	Great game. Can be played casually but can also become quite challenging towards the end.
1983	1	a	A very good game with crazy missions and lots of roadkilling the zombies, crazy choice in cars and alot of achievements
1985	1	a	This game is still good
1987	1	a	Pretty fun little game, its the kind of game you should play in small sessions and not very long ones or it will get possibly repetitive. Its the kind of game you would start up to have some good old fashioned casual zombie killing action loaded with a bunch of fun. Perfect for when you want to vent some frustration/stress. I got it on sale, got the whole package for less than 4 euros, pretty much worth it if you ask me!
1989	1	a	A very good game with crazy missions and lots of roadkilling the zombies, crazy choice in cars and alot of achievements
1991	1	a	The best top down driving shooting zombie game there is.
1993	1	a	  An awsome game indeed. Its too underated.
1995	1	a	Imagine Crimsonland, but while driving a car... running over and shooting and burning and exploding millions of zombies. Heaven.
1997	1	a	The game is solid for the price point. There are few things about it that are irritating, but nothing major. Just minor nit picks.   A full review for anyone interested can be found here, but the short version is it's worht the $10 dollar price tag if you don't mind lack of any substantial narrative.   https://basedgamer.com/review/2934/zombie-driver-hd-zombie-driver-is-a-decent-way-to-spend-ten-bucks 
1999	1	a	Well worth the Â£1 I spent for all the DLC edition.
2001	1	a	A really good game its simpale and most important fun in many ways there is few game mods and a leaderboard if you care about being number one , i bought the complete edition because it was on sale -90% and its worth it trust me
2003	1	a	worth every 99 cents xD grumpy approves!
2005	1	a	I bought this game at a deeply discounted price (around $1, I believe) not expecting much out of it. So I was happy to find that it is actually really fun. It's reminiscent of the first two GTA games - a top down driver where you're occasionally equipped with weapons but always running over crowds of zombies. The music isn't great, so I muted that and played my own tunes. Lots of fun though.
2007	1	a	Its a good game if you have a very short attention span and purchase all the dlc. running over zombies for the first 2 or 3 missions is fun but gets old fast.  If you have any kind of motion sickness like i do and get headaches from too much headbob or unoptimized games, skip this title. Not saying this game is poorly optimized, it runs fine. If i didnt get a migrane from looking straight down, and only seeing 10 feet in front of the vehicle then maybe i would consider launching this game a second time
2009	1	a	A short- or mid-length (20-40 hours) zombie driving game with several well known elements: - Story Mode (Delivery, Rescue, Elimination, Conquest, Bulldozer, Tank and Fire Truck Mission(s)), overall 30 Missions, all to take place in the same town at one time. - Tournament Mode: (Elimination and Standard Races with elements of NITRO and Super Cars International, Endurance Races against the clock), 6 tournaments with 4,5,6,7,8,6 events respectively (overall 36 single events) - Arena Mode (Endless Mode, Score and Upgrade (Armor, Weapons) driven) overall 10 arenas  Further Features: Three main types of zombies, small (person-like), tall (bully) and fat (poison balloon zombie, sound of detonation reminds of Batman The Movie Mission 4 balloon catching), more than ten cars and three paints for each car available (similarity of cars, two or three standard cars would be sufficient), destroyable environment and thats about it.
457	0	a	Well it's hard to either recommend this game or not. But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.  The positive things: - Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun! - Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo! - A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.  The negative things: - Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse. - You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun. - Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions? - Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine! - The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again. - The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.  The things that don't matter: - For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*  Things that could make this game awesome: - A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay. - More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading. - Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks. - The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions. You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.  Overall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.
458	0	a	Zombies, cars, big weapons and gore. What could possible go wrong? Well, the chunky controlls on both, mouse + keyboard and Xbox controller.  Surprisingly, it's worse with the controller, not with the keyboard.  
459	0	a	good game,louds of blood,,good story,...........but in blood rase mode game is crashing WTF/?????????????????????
460	0	a	Right, well it's miles better than the first one anyway! Which is to say, it's not a great game by any means, but it's certainly... playable.  Basically, y'know Micro Machines: Military Madness? What's that, you don't? Oh, it's this really great (as I remember it) Mega Drive tank racing game! Well anyway, this game is like that game... but not nearly as good. Go play that instead.
461	0	a	I would have avoided wasting 10 minutes, if I had cleared the mission. I would have cleared the mission, if I had killed the zombies faster. I would have killed the zombies faster, if I had a fair amount of ammo. I would have had a fair amount of ammo, if I could aim the car correctly. I would have aimed the car correctly, if I could have controls that aren't clunky. I would have controls that aren't clunky, if the gameplay was better designed.  I would have liked this game, if the gameplay was better designed. 
462	0	a	Viewpoint and Controls: Two basics that Zombie Driver screws-up. Each on their own would be bearable, but not being able to see where you're going and not being able to respond appropriately when you get there is a killer blow. The campaign is alright but you'll have more fun playing one of the normal Zombie/Alien Shooter games that doesn't hinder you with an unresponsive/over-responsive vehicle.  
463	0	a	the video shows it to be great, but the reality is that you can never really drive fast and ram zombies. the controls are so clunky, the game is too easy, and the cars drive way faster than you can possibly comprehend the map that is loaded with obstacles. if you play this game your time will mostly be spent bumping itnto walls and trying to turn around or changing from drive to reverse. its such a shame that a game can fall so ahrd on the basics like controls. maybe its because i played on keyboard, maybe not. also you cant change any graphics settings.
464	0	a	I thought this would be a great game, going around using your vehicle as a weapon and killing all the zombies. However, everything in the game is against you. When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die. You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors. Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged. Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car! At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car! The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful. You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.
465	0	a	A lot of fun for a few missions, then the problems quickly add up. I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment. I was constantly shaking my head and squinting my eyes in disbelief at the stupid little ways in which they did most things that they could have done differently/better. It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again. lol.  There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.  5/10
466	0	a	Visually cluttered to the extent that I couldn't see the track clearly enough to drive round it competitively, so either the game is too fast paced, or the track needs to be more clearly defined.  Gave up before realising that I'd driven the same race several times and that I was supposed to select the next one. It's not the worst game on Steam, but it didn't draw me in as an intuitive and fun experience. It's rough around the edges, but atleast it's cheap and works.
467	0	a	The controls for driving in this game are terrible with keyboard. I will most likely change this review as soon as I get a controller if it turns out to be good. 
468	0	a	ZOMBIES ARE NOT THE ENEMY. THE CONTROLS ARE.
469	0	a	i have had the worst experience with this game when i run it it has an unknown error ive spent hours trying to figure it out and nothing  
470	0	a	Vehicle and camera movement are awful, otherwise this would be a fun game.
471	0	a	Fun while it lasts, but alas hit 'n' run is about all you get.
472	0	a	Great looking game, great idea, but the steering is horrible, and it ruins the game.
473	0	a	Thanks to the awful camera system I only lasted five vomit-inducing minutes. I've no idea how people completed this game. They can't be human.
474	0	a	The game was interesting and certainly a unique concept but unfortunately I found the game unplayable. The car acted clunky and unreallistic. The voice acting and sound effects were less than great. Of course this game is in early release so I am sure they are dealling with this.
475	0	a	What a terrible game.  Firstly, the map has too many things I collide into. In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.  What about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.  Oh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.  I hate this game. I spent a dollar on it and I still regret my decision.
476	0	a	This game is more of an arcade type of game with not very many upgrades. Also the gameplay wasnt even that great. Honestly the only slightly cool thing in my opinion is the zombie bosses. This is more of a game for people who like a challenging driving game and pick up upgrades on the side of the rode. Personally I dislike it and I didnt know what I was expecting when I bought thankfully I got it when it was on sale for a cheap price but I still wouldnt suggest it to anyone of my friends though.
477	0	a	this game got my confused i always wanted to PLAY a zombie theni bought this and i get just automobile, you never get to see driver is he realy zombie or not?? so huge let-down for me..
478	0	a	Driving is stupid as ape. You should only use WASD for driving...
479	0	a	Graphics are HORRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY  3/10
480	0	a	2016 and still there are games where you can't bind keys. WTF dude.  Basically, if you don't have qwerty keyvboard, can't play.
481	0	a	you crash in every wall..useless speed..
482	0	a	ä¹°äº†çŽ©ä¸äº†ï¼ï¼ï¼ä¸€ç›´æŠ¥é”™ï¼ï¼ï¼ Some ERROR has occured and it can't be played.
483	0	a	the game is ok, can be boring, can also be fun. if you like cars and killing zombies can get some power up - But very repetive, you have to do some quests or side quests to move on.  If u are into cars and into racing things, this might be for you, you will also kill some zombies in the progress but don't really expect too much fun from the game though.  i give this 6/10
484	0	a	Gave it a shot- it was $2.49... its ok. cars handle differently, and hitting zombies with them has impact. Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid.   EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend.
485	0	a	So I picked this up in the weeklong sale for $3.  The gameplay seems fun. I like the upgrade system and the car handles generally well.  I asked for a refund because the camera movement is crazy and makde me feel ill. I haven't ever gotten that feeling from a game before but Zombie Driver HD got me feeling sick. So buyer beware!
486	0	a	Sweet Jesus.  from the wiki: 'Motion sickness or kinetosis, also known as travel sickness, is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement. Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]  Dizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found.'  Well, 'the cause of the nausea' has been found and its name is 'Zombie Driver HD'. Seriously, if you were to design a game to cause 'a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement', this would be it. Zombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . . . in HD (or should that be 'stimulator'? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).  I would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.  Then again, you might, (like I did), think 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it.' More power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful 'multicolour yawn' inducing set of camera options in gaming. 
487	0	a	4/10
488	0	a	hated everything
489	0	a	its not leting me play
490	0	a	I take back what I said, this 'HD' upgrade isn't so great, a lot of the new content is just filler and the voice acting is so bad that it's awful, good thing it was cheap.
491	0	a	It looks cool, it seems cool but i dont like controls, feels akward, ammo ends too fast
492	0	a	Stopped playing due to the awful camera-movement. 3/10
493	0	a	Fun but very,very,very buggy and glitchy.  Fps drops to 0 in cutscenes and at random during gameplay. The map doesn't load in the story mode. And more that I probably forgot to list.  If the devs fix these problems and I have this brought to my attention, I will change my review because the actual game is pretty fun but again, the bugs just ruin it.
494	0	a	I had really high expectations for this game because of its awesome ideas and sweet trailer. I was sadly disappointed.  The game seems to be a cheap port of a mobile game, with car handling very suited for tilt controls, or at least a gamepad, but certainly not a keyboard. The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.  Overall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off. It's probably on some sort of app store somewhere, go buy it there.
495	0	a	This game does have some decent aspects to it but nothing exceptional and the ending was....less then complimentary. If you can get it on sale for $2 or less its worth it because there is some fun aspects to it but overall the game is in my opinion not worth more then that.
496	0	a	This games was great on my other laptop. However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia). If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up. If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.   There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck. This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card). My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).  The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned). If they fix the game i will change my recommendation. However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.
497	0	a	I recieved a coupon through crafting a badge that showed me this game. It actually allowed me to get this game for a dollar. I was pleased - an inexpensive game with an interesting and fun sounding idea and an equally interesting and fun looking trailer? Sign me up.  No no no, wait, take my name back off of that. Now. I changed my mind. First impressions told me that this game was goign to be fun, to be interesting, and be overall very enjoyable. It isn't. The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken. I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right? Just as boring. Jombies drop like rocks at the touch of your car, and do almost nothing to it. I started the first arena in hard mode - ten minutes later I got the gold medal by doing nothinbg but holding the fire button and driving in circles.  Terrible game.
498	0	a	Pretty basic and boring.
499	0	a	Runover a zombie. Get yelled at by your boss. Runover some more zombies.... Thats the whole game... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in... 9 euros
500	0	a	Don't buy this game. It has its fun moments, but there are way too few of them and most of the time you're bored while playing it. The levels have no gimmicks, no variety, nothing. Just skip it.
501	0	a	Worst game i've played in a while. Bad controls, boring, not fun at all. My belief is this game started as a joke.
502	0	a	It was on offer and cheap
503	0	a	This game is so bad. Luckily I only spent 70p on it. First person mode or bust.
504	0	a	WARNING ! This game give nausea !!!  Even if you never get nausea by playing, buy this game only if you want to vomit.  Read the forums, there are discussions about that.   The game is cool, but it's actually unplayable.
505	0	a	Vrrrrrm vrrrummmmmm.... okay, why? You run over zombie stuff and shoot big creatures...  It's pretty boring. I guess I get bored too easy, I don't see it as a racing game, I mean, you can try to beat it within a certain time limit, but games that have time limits, you don't tag it as a racing game.  So what you do is run â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and then pick â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up and then drop â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off.  THis game is not worth it.
506	0	a	Repetative gameplay, annoying controls. Don't like.
507	0	a	Top down driving game/zombie killer. Recalls classics like the first GTA's and Death Rally. 2/5

Why i need to pay money from this game ??? For what ???  To see TOP 10 CHEATERS ???  WHEN DEV. remove all cheaters from TOP 10 LIST ... i change my review in pozitive review !
511	0	a	Game doesn't work with my keyboard or PS4 wireless controller. Could only play a little bit going back and forward and using the emergency break a little bit.
512	0	a	Not really my cup of brains...
513	0	a	It's a mobile game, and personally I don't want to play them on a expensive computer.
514	0	a	Controls are crap. Not sure at which disount I got it, but I think it was a waste.
515	0	a	even Mobile Phone Grapics are way better
516	0	a	the ground is always blue and glitchy  i would not play this for 50 cents p.s its also really buggy
517	0	a	Don't spent your money for sh*(ts
518	0	a	not really that great of a games. So many better options out there. Design is really lacking. Doesnt create a desire to keep playing.
519	0	a	This game gets boring really fast and reminds me of free games you play on a phone! I got it for 99 cents and would have to say I wouldnt play it if it were free! Not worth downloading onto a gaming rig at all and I laugh at reviews that say it is great.
520	0	a	To be honest, I wanted a Netrual button over here, its unffair to say that this game is crap, but there are some points that avoid me to enjoy this 100% Tobe honest I have played only the single-player campaign. need to say that for cons this game is well balanced, has a fair challenge, great graphics and has a nice twist on the over-used zombie formula. But the game has some very annoying issues, first of all the campaign drags itself far too long. 30 levels with many many missions types repetead over and over again,how many scientis do I need to rescue ?  And : Stop at the marker  Zombies left in the area : 2 Stop at the marker Zombies left in te area : 3 Stop at the marker Zombies left in the area : 1 
521	0	a	It's okay to play for a few minutes at a time but it gets very repetitive. Bought the game on sale so it's worth the $2.50 but I wouldn't pay full price for it.
522	0	a	Wou;ld've liked this game more if it had more mission variety since 70% of the missions is mostly rescuing survivors.
523	0	a	Don't bother buying, did not start properly. Despite trying ways suggested in the support forum I could not get this game running. Emailed my problems to the support team but no answers from them.
524	0	a	ZDHD didn't agree with me. The gameplay is too shallow to be entertaining, environments to crowded to enjoy the top-down driving aspects. Controls didn't work too well for me, either.  All in all: Stay away.
525	0	a	The HD version officially makes the game not fun anymore. It ruins it. Sure the graphics and atmosphere are much better, but it's now escort missions and uneeded boss fights. Not to mention it likes to grab the camera away from you to see the objective like you are some dummy. Oh and you can't pause to look at the map anymore, which is by far the most annoying thing.
526	0	a	As I write this review I'm on the verge of vomiting. Not because I'm being over dramatic, but because I'm literally nauseous from playing this game. I thought it was just me until a read another reviewer suffering the same symptoms. The graphics, theme, and content of the game are fine. But it's the gameplay that made me sick which consists of you driving endlessly round, and round, and round... Oh gosh I'm making myself sicker just thinking about it.  Perhaps if the maps were bigger and had a better layout, I would have no complaints. But because of my negative experience I say stay away from this game if you get car sick easily. It's too bad because I was looking forward to this game. At least I only paid something like $2.  By the way I just took a pill for motion sickness and I hope it kicks in real soon.
527	0	a	Ignore all the positive reviews, this game sucks. I only played it because the steam trading cards this thing gives , have a pretty nice value regular cards about 20 cents and the foils over 2 bucks. if you want some steam money , then buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ while its on sale, grab all the cards , and never talk about this game ever again
528	0	a	The looks nice and is quite interesting. Although I have DLCs with additional missions and so on, I didn't used them. The game bored me after about 15-20 missions. It's all about killing zombies. Without co-op it's not worth playing longer than just to relax few times for about 20 minutes. Also the ingame font is really small on big screens and resolutions. And since you can play with controller it should have better fit for big screens.
529	0	a	The game is kinda fun but the biggest weakness is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing driving, which makes up about... all of the game. The only reason this game is so bad for me is that every 10~ seconds of holding down the button to turn left or right the car will randomly say 'hey i see you wanna turn in that direction, welp â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you.'  Seriously in what world does a driving game not listen to the directions you give it. I mean the shooting is ok and so is the whole gun and repair mechanic but the fact you cant drive three feet without your car suddenly not listening to you is impossible.
530	0	a	I had a coupon for this game and I think I paid $2.50, I'm kind of regretting spending that much money on this. I mean it was an entertaining game, the problem is its not worth the money you pay, not even $2.50 like in my situation. A few days before I got this game, I had 2 coupon codes for 2 other games. One game was in the $10 price range and the other game was in a $5 price range. In total, the price was $1.75 (these coupons were bigger). One of the 2 games (the $10 one) I would've gladly paid $7 or even $10 at max for, while the other one (the $5 one) I would've paid $3.75 at max for; this game I would've paid at max $0.50. So I guess its a good game, just not worth the money you pay.
531	0	a	Every generation has their own 'Citizen Kane', mine was 'Citizen Kane' and actually, so was every other generation's when you think about it.  Zombie Driver HD (ZDHD) is very honest in its marketing, I appreciate that. Let's all golf clap for ZDHD. Now, on to gameplay:  If you enjoy driving, with Zombies around - this game is for you. If perhaps you prefer a more cerebral experience - why on earth are you reading reviews for a game called 'Zombie Driver HD'?  If you're into a tablet port where things go splat - great, here's your game. Enjoy, splat some zombies and have fun. I don't doubt that you'll have fun as this is a fun game - just not for me.
532	0	a	It honestly just feels like a mobile game. The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is    run over zombies and    try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent 'plot'. You just drive over zombies. It's not god-awful, but even on sale for $3 I want my money back.
533	0	a	Game is broken as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and devs refuse to help or tell you if theyre working on an update or a fix.  I couldnt not be more dissapointed..hope this game gets pulled off steam.
534	0	a	My Playstation 2 called from the garage and wants it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game back.
535	0	a	Game is great. But wont work on my win 7 64bits and nvidia cart. Game goes crazy avery time after few min.
536	0	a	You will never find a game like this where the designers had to cheat to make it work. No matter how shallow an angle you will stick to the object you hit. You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.
537	0	a	Fails every time to start. Steam integrity check finds 1 corrupted file every time and re-downloads it. Fails to start again. Everything else on my PC works fine, no viruses to make the files corrupt and such.  -/10  Once it starts and is running I'll evaluate it.
2011	1	a	I won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra series.  Black Plague is the second of their three-part Penumbra series, but in this man's humble opinion it tops even their most successful of games.  Yes, I said it. It's better than Amnesia. Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia. It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work. But once I finished it up I wanted more. I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it. For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice.  This game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes. But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story.  I won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment.  I highly recommend this game.
2013	1	a	When in doubt, throw a brick at something.
2015	1	a	This is the kind of game you'll have to play with a pair of headphones and no source of light because only then you'll experience its true power.   The game's overall story is deep, unpredictable and intriguing, making it very interesting, which is a big plus for a horror game. (It even has a few emotional moments!) Even though at the beginning there is a short recap of the events that took place in Overture, I highly recommend playing the first game first in order to have a full understanding of the story. (You can only buy the package containing both games, so why not give it a try?)  Both games are similar in terms of gameplay, but Black Plague improves a lot on about every aspect of the first game, making it more solid. There is no direct way of fighting with the enemies in this installment, so the combat system, which, in my opinion, wasn't that awful, should no longer be a problem for those who complained about it. Another important aspect of the game are puzzles: being the second episode, Black Plague is also filled with intelligent puzzles that require reading (in-game 'notes') and thinking, but this time they are just a little easier than those found in Overture.  The graphics may be a little outdated, but there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't break the immersion; they are decent and have successfully created a terrifying atmosphere that will constantly make you scared of the unknown. (For that to work at its full potential, I recommend lowering the gamma a bit, until you can't see anything in places without any source of light.) With its impressive sound design and voice acting (at least for a low-budget game), the developers managed to create their own world filled with few, but believable characters.   For such a low price, I can recommend the Penumbra games without a doubt! This package is a must-have for every horror enthusiast, as it delivers a frightening experience!
2017	1	a	The sequel to Overture, Black Plague further tells the story of Philip which eventually comes to an end. In fact, it turns out, this is not the final episode (as Requiem includes further chapters) but for me it seemed like the final chapter of his adventure.  The story now continues and tells us much, much more. Running and hiding is even more frequent and from this episode we can clearly see the couple of places that inspired Frictional Games to make Amnesia. The game is also somewhat longer.  Since this is an essential part of a great survival horror trilogy, look for discount on the trilogy pack (if there's any) so that all episodes can be purchased at once. The story and gameplay are both well worth the ride!
2019	1	a	Amnesia's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up little brother. Same, interactive environment and just about the darkest storyline anyone could ask for. The soundtrack/lighting can give you a headache at times, but then again what sort of horror-genre game doesn't? Sound was a bit buggy in general; had to restart the application a few times. Puzzles are immensly challenging, roundabout corridors will keep you guessing, and the voice acting (which a lot take for granted) was superb. The entire game took me about five hours to complete (excluding idling at the main menu), and the ending was strangely satisfying. Overall: 9/10, would replay.
2021	1	a	  'Every time, itâ€™s harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.â€    Penumbra: Black Plague is the second of three episodes in the Penumbra series. While continuing the compelling storyline from the first instalment it also improves the characterization of the protagonist. Furthermore, the excellent music background contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are challenging and enjoyable, without being illogical or forced.   Without the awkward combat system of the prequel, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.     Trivia:    Penumbra: Requiem is the third and last episode in the Penumbra series. Originally intended to be a trilogy the series was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. In the end, the third instalment came in form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and put the focus more on the puzzles.    Amusing quotes:      â€œIs the emergency figurative or literal? A figurative emergency might, for example, involve an undersupply of coffee to the vending machines. A literal emergency, on the other hand, might involve flesh eating monsters rampaging about the facility.â€      â€œSoâ€¦ you are running around with a human body part in your backpack, and I am supposed to be the bad guy?â€      Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.

2023	1	a	Well, as a second review, I want to make this as positive as can be. Penumbra points out the pefect imperfections of human nature. Dark areas with whispering, slithering, crawling and screaming in the background allows for a more 'intimidating' experience. Enemies are fuel for nightmares, conjured up from the fears of fellow humans. The general atmosphere will make your heart pound and make you sweat. The good ol' fashioned jumpscares (how few they are) will last in your memories and well, deep into your dreams. Nightmares* excuse me.    Now, the ONE (1) bad thing I had was not game-ruining; a simple lighting error with the shader. A simple fix of course. Lower the shader resolution to medium. Bing, bang you're back in action! If you left in the first place.   My computer is nothing close to a gaming rig, however, Penumbra runs at above 60fps with hardly (meaning none) any lag ingame, don't be deterred if you're using a less-than-perfect machine.    10/10 would rebuy, reinstall and replay it over and over.
2025	1	a	Black Plague was excellent. It gave the player a real sense of horror and inability to do anything and the way the whole plot goes from this game is excellent and shocked me. The gameplay and puzzle solving is supurb along with the genuine sense of horror you get from it. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes horror games and amnesia definitely gets its gameplay style from this game.
2027	1	a	Holy crap! Age hasn't slowed this game down one bit. It's still just as unsettling as ever. I remember playing a demo of it awhile ago and thinking that the lighting effects were really impressive, and they still are honestly.   The game runs just fine on modern machines as well, so you can purchase without fear of having to do some compatibility mode nonsense.
2029	1	a	This game is scary and has a short story.  Game has some glitches which make for a more scary experience.  I enjoyed it, reminds me of the System Shock and Metro series , except you cannot attack but only run and hide.
2031	1	a	I always find it fun to be terrified by naked dudes.
2033	1	a	I can't describe how awesome these games are.... Any ideas, Monkey?
2035	1	a	Like it's predecessor, Penumbra Black Plague is environmentally interactive, even being able to break glass bottles, throw boxes off cliffs, and play jenga with bags, barrrels, and books. Unlike the last game, the sequel seems to have gone more the paranormal route but still have elements of survival horror. I was glued to this game to find out the mystery behind it all.   Unfortuntely, I cannot say the same for the expansion Requiem. It seems it was just made for puzzle solving and adding a severe mind**** to everything you have just played/experienced. I basically just rushed through the puzzles in the hopes I would get something more from it. I don't know.    NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.
2037	1	a	great game maybe the spookiest game ive ever played, story is cool too
2039	1	a	This game much like the first is really good. I did not like it as much as the first game, but not by too much. I thought the story was still very strong, but they definitely were going for a much more 'helpless' feel and more focus on puzzles than lurking around in the dark avoiding enemies. Though actually, when considering the end of the game, this theme actually makes a lot of sense...There's definitely a lot of evidence of why they went with no combat in Amnesia after they made this. It made this game feel way more out of your control and more terrifying.
2041	1	a	Turn the lights off, put on your headphones and immerse yourself in the experience. Look past the 'game' and you'll never look back. Black Plague is why the Penumbra series will always sit a little higher than Amnesia on my list of favourites.
2043	1	a	Black plague is amazing, but beware - Requiem is very different, frustrating and probably not even worth playing.
2045	1	a	If you took Portal and turned it into a survival horror narrative you would have the Penumbra series.  Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd installment in the series and the best hands down. The heavy focus on exploration, lack of weapons, brilliant level design, ambient sound and fantastic voice acting make it a well rounded experience that paved the way for games like Outlast and Amnesia: The Dark Descent (this studio actually made that game).  If you love horror you owe it to yourself to play this. People who assume horror can only be jumpscares will laud FNAF as a 'masterpiece' but that game looks like a sunny day at the park compared to the viscreal scares of Penumbra: Black Plague.
2047	1	a	The Return of Frictional Games.  No Hammer, No Dynamite and Forget the Pickaxe.  The second half of the penumbra saga is well executed.  From the immersive audio narrative to the freaky monster encounter Penumbra: Black Plague will keep you on the edge of your seat.  My only complaint is that content wise it still feels like the second part of the first game and more enemy type would of been cool, but a side of that now were talking this is one hell of a horror game  8.4/10 Verdict: Run and survive the horrors that await.
2049	1	a	If you miss the true survival horror game type, look no further: you found Penumbra - Black Plague.  Runs great in Windows 10 (64 bit), in ultrawide resolution (2560 x 1080).
2051	1	a	Penumbra was the first survival adventure series I played. I enjoyed every one thoroughly.
2053	1	a	WIth the ending still fresh in my mind I felt like writing a review as I did with the first game. Frictional loves their psychological horror and it shows. If the first game dealt with the unknown and trying to understand what this is all about. Black Plague is about going about fixing what happened. Only nothing is what it seems and everything is out to kill you even the voices in your head. Without spoiling anything its a lot more puzzle based than I remember Amnesia being. Onward to part 3!
2055	1	a	Amazing continuation of Overture. Perfect story, atmosphere, and horror. There is no better game out there, not amnesia, not any game.
2057	1	a	So, heres my story:  There was a Steam sale on the Penumbra franchise, along with Amnesia, right? So, I got them for free, and decided to play this one first (even though it's the second game). And along with the many frights and COUGHtearsCOUGH, and confused damn puzzles. I came home from school, and spent the whole day, trying to finishing the game. And I did!  Other reasons I love this game, is because theres no jumpscares! But: Scary story, Frightful enemies, Upsetting twists &amp; turns, mind boggling puzzles, and great spooky atmosphere.  Buy it now! (Or for free in my case...)
2059	1	a	Clarence treats you like a gay cellmate   He likes you, but does whatever the hell he wants to you
2061	1	a	This series started the birth of Frictional Games, and Amnesia was its rise to fame. Never have I ever seen such detail and emotion in a horror series such as this. Both Amnesia and Penumbra will forever be in our memories from years on. If you're reading this, play this game and Immerse yourself into it and see the beauty that is within.
2063	1	a	The monster has his own â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ shoved up his â™¥â™¥â™¥.  69/10 -ign.
2065	1	a	Penumbra Black Plague is the second entry in the Penumbra trilogy. Maturing from the action-puzzle of Overture, Black Plague is a survival-horror. With puzzles. It has great scenes and is worth the time it takes to play. If you are looking for a good story and a survival-horror that is not as scary as Amnesia (by any means) pick Black Plague up!
2067	1	a	Love this game do yourself a favour and buy the game
2069	1	a	Love this game do yourself a favour and buy the game
2071	1	a	Huh! Unlike the console horror stylings of Overture, Black Plague feels more akin to, say, System Shock. A combatless System Shock! Does that make sense? Maybe not.  Anyway â€“ the writing is surprisingly light-hearted and comedic than the first game or horror games in general. One particular character is basically writtten like a devilish, sarcastic Stephen King antagonist. That may or may not be to your liking. Humour tends to spook away the horror.   All in all, I appreciate how they went a different way with Black Plague, and in its way this is an extremely worthwhile game in a world where sequels tend to tread same ground.  REQUIEM, though... so, you know how sometimes there's like a '10 new levels!' or a 'time trials expansion' pack to a story-driven, self-contained game?  Yeah, Requiem is one of those and it's sort of a snore. Basically, it's Penumbra: Aperture Science â€“ nine boring 'hit the lever' puzzle stages with a fourth-wall breaking female computer voice cracking jokes on someone's behalf. Art assets seem to be recycled from the earlier Penumbra games and their scrapped content, and the ending doesn't really relate to the main game story. It's basically a crock.
2073	1	a	The first one was good yes but this one is   a video game also  
2075	1	a	Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.  Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd game in the series. It improves upon many aspects of Overture, and is the best of the 3 games.
2077	1	a	I never thought there exists such kind of spooky that I actually enjoy Would sell my house to buy a new Penumbra game right now
2079	1	a	Classic! And an amazing one at that. Loved it!
2081	1	a	deep story always was to scared to play one of these best was the second 1 with talking mind.
2083	1	a	Puzzles and creepiness is even better than the previous game. Great story. It's better to not search too much about it and just go play it and enjoy it
2085	1	a	Imagine Half Life without firearms or even your crowbar. Black Plague features a significantly different art design over it's predecessor Overture. Featuring less abandoned mines and spider infested caves with underground facilities with advanced technology and a mutant plague virus that threatens the world. Sound familiar?  Black Plague however distinguishes itself in numerous ways to Overture. For one it's significantly more character driven. The original only had two major characters, the player and the enigmatic Red who wasnt even modeled ingame. Here you have a skitzophrenic voice in your head and zombies walking linoleum hallways.  Really what can be said about Black Plague? It suffers from the same problems as Overture, and vis-Ã -vis it features all the improvements so dearly needed for the game. So really... it's just a sequel that feels like it needs to be packaged with Overture instead of seperated.
2087	1	a	Penumbra Black Plague is an improvement over its predecessor Penumbra Overture. Instead of fighting random animals, you will encounter mutated humans. Unlike the first game, there is no possibility of combat against them. You are defenseless against them, upping the ante on terror and suspense. The music is still excellent and the controls are solid once you get the hang of them.  This particular package, Penumbra Black Plague Gold Edition also includes the final game of the trilogy, Penumbra Requiem. Unfortunately, it is the worst game in the series -- easily. In this game, I never felt any suspense but mostly frustration because it was loaded with convoluted puzzles (the worst part of the series) and completely lacking any monsters, therefore no sense of being followed (the best and scariest part of the series). I didn't feel a need for wrapping things up with the main character's storyline, which is what Requiem does essentially. Requiem's biggest sin is the fact it centers around the main character completely as opposed to continuing the plot from the previous game, leaving no room for any scary moments whatsoever.  Overall, this game is worth the purchase. Personally I think the series ended well with Black Plague, as there was closure in its conclusion. But if you want to play the whole series for the sake of completion, go for it!
2089	1	a	Get this game. Best Game. 11/10. I would buy again. Might seem spooky. It IS spooky but purely psychological. gg 11/10
2091	1	a	After the first one I felt in love with this kind of game experience. Gathering notes, exploring the facility for the artifacts. Like I said about the first one, it has a great atmosphere of despair. You feel like you are alone in this god forsaken place.  But like in the first game, after one or two enemies encounter you forgot about hiding tactics. You just dash your way through the hallways, and avoid enemies by jumping. The game has one or two encounters when you need to use your brain to defeat or avoid enemies. But beside this two exception there is nothing to fear from monsters.
2093	1	a	One of my favourite games ever,much better than the first and while not as polished or as scary as Amnesia I prefer it since the theme of a secret facility and abandoned mines are much more interesting to me than the usual haunted house/castle in Amnesia.    This Game continues from the first and the story is still a intriguing,mystifying and scary story,better puzzles and harder too since you are usually in danger while doing them so you are distracted and might do them in a shaky rushed way.The gameplay I feel is slightly more refined and the physics system is still innovative.   Since you can't fight back and the enemies are quite fast so the best method is to hide in the shadows terrified the infected with the flashlight will see you and bash you in with a crowbar.  Still a staple for any horror fan,cheap too even bundled with overture.
2095	1	a	I am enjoying this game a little more than Amnesia so far.
2097	1	a	One of my favorite games
2099	1	a	A fun and scary adventure horror game. Reccomended if you like horror where you are un-armed and have to sneak.
2101	1	a	Scary stuff, d00d.
2103	1	a	It's scary and atmospheric. Unlike the first game, the enemies can't be killed by normal means, so you have to run and hide.
2105	1	a	Penumbra is a Great EMO trip into the dfepths of unknown horrors, creepy normal looking object and horrific images, and suicidal thoughts of dispair. what makes Penumbra Great, it soaks you into the story and you do feel for the characters. how many games do that!! 
2107	1	a	Like the first part, Overture, Frictional Games again manages to capture the true essence of survival horror improving from last time by incorporating better sounds, atmosphere and a somewhat tighter story with memorable characters. The voice acting was superb throughout but while the humourous moments helped lighten the mood faster in order to regain that 'SHOCK' moment more often, I felt that this rushed approach wasn't well executed nor received. The total removement of the combat system is what I think makes this game far superior than its predesseccor. You have to run and hide rather than club your enemies to death. The best thing about Black Plague was by far its script, it never fails to keep the player both captivated and horrified. The end message was well thought out and delievered although the overall shortness of the campaign may disappoint the die-hard fans who were looking for something a bit longer. Overall, this game is superb and fully deserves your time and money.
2109	1	a	Shake your glowstick at deformed horrors while a 1920's mobster cackles at you. You also might â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself.
2111	1	a	exceptional game if you are really into Lovecraftian horror. Even the name of the game engine is HPL!
2113	1	a	Perfect blend of horror, puzzle solving and irritating atmosphere. Attention: Probably will cause heart attacks.
2115	1	a	perhaps my favorite game, this still creeps me the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out even after playing it through 4 times. no wonder though since Frictional Games are the video game gods of horror games. play this or eat â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2117	1	a	I'm really liking this so far! Making my way through this mysterious place by solving a series of puzzels, and being hunted down by some 'thing'. It's great! And there needs to be more games like this, but in coop mode! Ahhhh that would be awesome! Anyway! This game is a thumbs up from me!
2119	1	a	As the sequel of Penumbra: Overture this is an amazing series and Black Plague continues that great scary feeling that we all loved in Overture!
2121	1	a	Really underestimated the level of horror T___T lotsa fun!
2123	1	a	A psycholgical horror game in the same vein as Amnesia. An earlier development than Amnesia, it's graphics are far worse and the controls are klunkier. If you liked Amneisa you'll probably like this. It is a three part game, so keep that in mind when buying, and pick it up on sale.
2125	1	a	Just as brilliant as it's predecessor, but with a rather anti-climatic ending.  I also don't get the hate surrounding Requiem. Sure it wasn't that great overall, but it did a good job wrapping up all the loose ends in BP.
2127	1	a	Loved it, The beating heart of the Penumbra series. The pace of the game was quicker and darker. Some great twists and turns and the ability to fight back has been taken away since the first game. Better than Overture by far but the strong story makes both games playable. Only 2nd to Amnesia Dark Descent as a horror in my books. Requim is the series going all jar jar binks on itself and is more frustrating than scary but it game with black plague so whatever.
2129	1	a	nice game horor many mystery
2131	1	a	Black Plague is great, but for love of all that is holy don't play the next one Requiem. It is god awful, has no atmosphere and is nothing but easy jumping puzzles. It doesn't even add anything to the story. Skip it.
2133	1	a	Other Penumbra games are fine but this one seemed like an early sign of perfection in Amnesia.
539	0	a	This review comes from someone who played Amnesia before any Penumbra game, so make of that what you will. I'll try to keep this short.  I'll start off by saying that, on the technical side, the game is pretty darn good. The engine itself (as evidenced by its use in more recent games by Frictional) holds up very well to this day. Black Plague was released in 2008, so it's not incredibly old, but, in an age where I have to check whether or not entirely new games will actually run on my specific combination of hardware, I haven't had any trouble in the slightest getting the game to run. No crashes, no graphics issues, no slowdowns, nothing like that at all. The only problem that I have with it in that regard is that you can't change the FOV, but that's set  just  high enough for it to not be a problem for me, at least.  A lot of the game revolves around physics-based puzzles and they've definitely put enough effort in to make sure that the physics engine works as perfectly as it should do. Objects feel like they weigh as much as they should, moving objects around isn't a chore and the game knows when you want to put an item in a specific place and locks it there without any hastle or feeling like it's doing your work for you.  On the subject of puzzles, for the most part, they work well enough. The solutions are invariably completely intuative (no, you're not going to tie a balloon to a banana and feed it to a monster to get that computer running, you're going to find working drives and format them), and, on the off chance that the answer is simplified a little so that it doesn't get in the way of the game mechanics, it still makes perfect sense and there's a way to find out how to do it. As someone who frequently gets frustrated with adventure/puzzle games and has to turn the Internet off so that I don't cave and look up the answers (i.e. an idiot), I figured everything out for myself pretty quickly, save for one puzzle near the beginning which made sense in retrospect. The only problem I have with the puzzles is that many require finding multiple specific items, and, without fail, every one of them will be hidden behind a couple of other physics objects that are stacked in an odd and very conspicuous way.  Now, unfortunately, there are two very big issues that I had with the game that, while they weren't quite enough to stop me from playing, they are bad enough to me that I wouldn't personally recommend the game. The first is the story: the story of Penumbra: Overture, while not groundbreaking, was at least intriguing and subtle enough that it kept me very invested through the whole game. In Black Plague, that subtlety goes right out of the window from the beginning when it gives you a very clear and safe view of the new monster, then, sometime later, the player character develops an internal voice in his head whose main purpose seems to be to explain every plot point several times over in case you didn't pick up the hints. There were several times when I read something interesting in a note and got as far as thinking 'I wonder if that means-', then he'd immediately chime in and say that that's exactly what it means, please don't try to work it out for yourself. It honestly feels like Frictional realised that they could afford voice actors for this one and just decided to throw in literally anything that they could think for them to say, no matter how dumb or obvious, on top of the quality of the voice acting giving Bethesda a run for its money. I also counted four times in the first hour or so where the player character had the  exact same  realisation about himself. Add in how, for some reason, they decided to throw in an almost constant barrage of downright embarrassing attempts at humour (seriously, one computer asked if I was sure that I wanted to do something, then if I was  really  sure, then if I was  really really  sure...) and I got to the point where I just couldn't consider this a horror game anymore.  On that note, my other problem with it is that it really doesn't feel like a horror game in almost any respect. It's very dark (lighting-wise), yes, but... that's really it. It doesn't take long to realise that you're in almost no danger whatsoever. I think that I came across four things in the entire game that were able to hurt me, disregarding an obvious tripwire 'puzzle', and the very few enemies that you do encounter can be outrun, avoided, sneaked around and generally outsmarted with no effort at all. I appreciate the rudimentary stealth mechanics as a massive fan of the Thief series, but the enemies in Black Plague are exactly as intelligent as the dogs in Penumbra: Overture, which is to say not too bright.  In conclusion, I suppose that, if you just want puzzles and can appreciate something of an adventure/puzzle game in first person (some mechanics actually brought back memories of classic point-and-click games, but much better-polished), and can also tune out the excuse plot for those to exist, then I can definitely recommend the game because I enjoyed those parts a decent amount. If you're looking for a compelling horror experience, then, as far as I'm concerned, you're probably not going to find it here, although I've met people with a completely different opinion to mine. I'll also note that it's pretty short; it took me slightly over six hours to finish, but you get the entire Penumbra series for Â£7 at full price, so that's absolutely more than fair for that length.
2135	1	a	Less polished and scary than it's successor Amnesia, but still a horrific experience combined with problem solving puzzle elements.
2137	1	a	Took me back to the days of true gaming horror, I loved it. Sure it took me a while to fix its resolution but that is just a very minor negative.  Immersive story, chilling atmosphere... And monsters.... yeah.
2139	1	a	Penumbra is a must have for horror fans and feared by all, young or old, black or white, boy or girl doesnt matter u will â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in ur diaper anyways
2141	1	a	I walked down the long and scary tunnel... I saw light... I thought i would be free...But. Something was behind me. I turned around and i saw something horrible that looked like a human with a d*ck larger than an elephant trunk.   I decided to run to the light as fast as i could but suddenly i felt something on my legs. It was the thing that where behind me that was grabbing my legs.   He captured me and ate me.   10/10 would play 'Penumbra: Black plague' again. No doubt.
2143	1	a	What can I say, this game is terrifying and had my blood pounding through my viens every step of the way.  This game uses an awesome item control system that makes opening doors and draws easy and fast. Items can be moved in the way of doors to give you time to hide and the leaning was actually useful in a game for once. I also really liked the whole sanity system where you lose your mind looking at the ... things?  The graphics are not the best but considering time of release thats expected and also I found the quality gave the game a scary feel and atmosphere. The story was deffinatly good but confusing at times and I found it did not fully explain the concept of the ... things?, where thay came from, what they are, why they are here and why they attack you. However this could just be me being an idiot.  All in all I think this is one of the best horror games there is and even if you don't like a scare get it anyway and scare your friends when they come over.
2145	1	a	Predecessor of Amnesia, I actually liked this game more. It has more puzzles and actually forces you to interact with the enviornment, something Amnesia rarely did. While Amnesia certainly created a more atmospheric game, Penumbra is less slightly less atmospheric with more emphasis on puzzles. Also, Penumbra has a much better story line than Amnesia. (9/10)
2147	1	a	Very erie and one of my favourite Horror series yet. Would recommend for anyone that wants a spook ;) 8/10
2149	1	a	6/10  Pros: +No Microtransactions +Creepy +Fun +Exciting  Cons: -Garbage ending  Overall: Decent game  --------------------  (REQUIUM) 3/10  -No monsters
2151	1	a	A really scary game to play O-O
2153	1	a	This game isn't loved enough. ;n;
2155	1	a	Even better than the first episode (Overture), this IS a GREAT GAME ! I loved it, almost perfect ! :)
2157	1	a	Great game! :)
2159	1	a	Pros: +Ketchup physics +Glowstick for raves +Tuurngait know how to turn up +Your boy Clarence got your back  Cons: -2spooky4me -Tuurngait won't turn up at my glowstick rave -Clarence is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥  I r8 8/8 no b8 m8
2161	1	a	After Playing Only 20 minutes of this game I can already tell this is going to be spoopy.
2163	1	a	Removing that awful combat system was a huge step up over the first game. You've got your obscure puzzles and fetch quests, but they're better than your standard video game fare and the game is, almost as stressful and terrifying as Amnesia. Keep a walkthrough on hand if you're a scared little â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like I am.
2165	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my pants, 1 hour into the game.  11/10  Would â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in pants again.
2167	1	a	Its really good puzzler / survival horror. Not as good as Amnesia : Dark Descent  but still if you loved Amnesia you will love this one too.  Honestly i wish there were more atmospheric first person puzzler / survival horrors with stealth elements like this one. A well made horror can even make a simple wild dog encounter be a creepy, terrifying experience.
2169	1	a	One of the best horror games available among Amnesia and Black Plague's predecessor Overture.
2171	1	a	A good game, made by the same people who made Penumbra Overture and Amnesia. If your into puzzle horror games then this is what your looking for, Its puzzles can be simple or just damn too confusing. However the horror makes up for the puzzles giving Penumbra a dark atmosphere, Its story line isn't something to follow as most of the time you will be interested then flat out bored of it because its mostly go here do this and then go there and do that. Overall Its a good game and would recommend it.
2173	1	a	I love it When naked â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ alien wacks me &lt;3 Pls more &lt;3
2175	1	a	 True gem of Survival Horror genre. Frictional Games did great job!
2177	1	a	its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in
2179	1	a	I bought this game with literally the only reason in mind, to say, this is far far better than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Amnesia. If you liked Amnesia, this game will blow you out of the water, and it's sad to see they're making another Amnesia and not another Penumbra game. Basically just think of these as Amnesia, with a better story, better graphics, less shitactular gameplay, and with a playable view. Like seriously, Amnesia is 50% filter, 30% camera shake for the fear. If you want a scary game, get this, if you want a mediocre overrated semi-scary game with no story (or rather, a boring one) and hate fun, get Amnesia. The game is basically a horror game with puzzles, an interesting story, and well, that's about it. If you want to be freaked out, get this game for sure. Amnesia IS NOT, anywhere near Black Plague's league, ignore the hype, if you can't , get both games at least. 9/10
2181	1	a	7/10
2183	1	a	completely awesome
2185	1	a	---Review for Penumbra:Requiem DLC--  A bit of a disapointing end to the trilogy.  This installment forgoes monsters and focuses entirely on puzzle solving, which wouldn't be a problem except for the Portal-esque manner in which it does so. Unfortunately, the rationale for why the test levels feel so artificial just isn't any where as good as Portal (nor are the puzzles as good as seen in Portal).  The setting is the same, although less dynamic and panic-inducing than previous installments, but there's little to no plot progression. We get a small glimpse of the fate of the character we've been playing right at the end and that's all this installment adds. I was rather hoping for more.
2187	1	a	oh clarence bb u get my panties in knots~~  lots of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in this game they're really shriveled up though  good game for just getting into horror 8/10
2189	1	a	Just as many surprizes as the first game! Slightly more intense and more survival tactics needed to win!
2191	1	a	10/10
2193	1	a	Amazing series i recommend it to all people who are looking for a good written scary game. 
2195	1	a	 What I liked:     Best Control interface( Using the mouse to swing open doors, and to physically throw items)    Great Atmosphere, and tension moments   What You Need to Know:      This game isn't scary to me at least ( I have yet to find a movie or game to scare me enough to not sleep at night)    Part of a trilogy (I didn't play Overture and couldn't get into Requim)    The ending is satisfiing enough to not need to play Requim    Puzzles are somewhat easy, not good enough to be one of the GREATS    Amensia is better in every way to this game, but this is good just for the decent story and atmosphere    My Score:
2197	1	a	Penumbra Overture was pretty good. There were some very awkward parts, like the fighting. But all in all pretty good. These days though the graphics are looking dated now.  Penumbra Overture was better since you couldn't fight anymore. It made the game more creepy, though again, graphics are a bit dated. The Penumbra story lines are pretty interesting though not necessarily the most interesting I've played through.  Penumbra Requiem was terrible. It's a completely different game that involves puzzles that's honestly just not very fun. If this pack was just Penumbra Requiem, I would NOT recommend it. But the first two are a 'Yes' recommendation so the pack will be a 'Yes'
2199	1	a	Fun while making me want to make a crusty garret
2201	1	a	this is the continue from overture but this time the dogs are gone but it gets worser theres monsters in the hostpital and u have to find your way out buy it to test your skills
2203	1	a	dis is good shtuff m8, b3tr boi b4 u dY but seriously i bought and played this for the first time 2 days ago and i really just love this game to the bone.
2205	1	a	Really scary but you can throw rocks at a zombie, then it's not so scary.
2207	1	a	Resolution problems... But otherwise, it's a good game.
2209	1	a	Best horror
2211	1	a	great game
2213	1	a	Resolution problems... But otherwise, it's a good game.
2215	1	a	Best horror
2217	1	a	Amazing storyline, makes you observe seemingly insignificant details, puzzles are amazing!
2219	1	a	You know what is awesome about this game? Everything!  VocÃª sabe o que Ã© incrÃ­vel neste jogo? Tudo!
2221	1	a	Solid, pioneering bit of horror FPS. The first game I'm aware of to use the FPS 'grab and interact' style of gameplay which later made Amnesia such a firm favourite (this being the predecessor). I just complated it today, and it really does sell atmosphere incredibly well. The graphics are really dated at this point, but it didn't stop the scares coming thick and fast. Lots of really clever twists, and a story that didn't disappoint me at the end. I absolutely recommend this to horror genre fans.
2223	1	a	While writing this review, I found it hard to write it without just saying 'It's Penumbra: Overture, but without the hit-or-miss combat system and with more reasons to be frightened of the world.' Because that's precisely what Penumbra: Black Plague is. It's the example of what a successor should be. It sticks to what worked in the original and removes what players didn't like. For example, Penumbra: Black Plague maintains the terrifying atmosphere and adventure game elements of Penumbra: Overture, but removes the (overly reviled) combat system. There was also some new additions, with one specific addition being a character that constantly messes with Philip's mind (and by connection, the player's mind).  Anyway, continuing without connecting it to Penumbra: Overture, Penumbra: Black Plague is just a excellent horror game, and the clear step toward Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game starts off immediately, with only a brief cutscene explaining the prior events. From that point, Penumbra: Black Plague is practically a nonstop horror show of twists, turns, evil science, hallucinations, and an ancient evil. As cliched as I'm making it sound, the whole of the story is highly creative, with an increased atmosphere as well. It's just as terrifying as Penumbra: Overture, if not slightly more. The removal of combat helps, along with enemies that won't give up the chase and hallucinations that constantly make you question reality. As for the gameplay, the removal of combat makes Penumbra: Black Plague feel identical to the classic adventure games of the 1990s, such as Tex Murphy and Myst. It's a change that is highly welcome, as it becomes amplified with decent exploration, hidden collectibles, and great puzzles. It's a very tense and terrifying game with a great story and more than decent visuals.  Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition also gives you Penumbra: Requiem, a small expansion pack to Penumbra: Black Plague. The expansion is decent for the most part, trading the old-school adventure approach with gameplay more akin to Portal. The puzzles do mesh well with the gameplay, creating some intricate, multi-part puzzles. However, the atmosphere is pretty much gone here and, while still occasionally eerie, it's not nearly as terrifying as the original two games. The story does try to tie up all of the loose ends, which it does reasonably well, thanks to two endings that are up for interpretation. It's a short stint, but worth looking into if you want to see Philip's story to the end (or ends).
2225	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is quite simply, a continuation of Penumbra: Overture. It might as well be considered one single game. The engine seems to be the same used in the first game, and most mechanics are identical. The atmosphere continues to be dark and creepy, with the addition of some new surprises that surface throughout. Everything is basically the same, with only the plot and storyline developing further. The one major improvement in comparison to Overture is the amount of thrills found in this iteration. There seems to be more action and more atmosphere overall, which makes the game more enjoyable, more creepy and a bit more scary. The story progression isn't as interesting or original as in the first game, but at least it has much more detail and much more depth. The voice acting also continues its high quality performances. Loading times are atrocious and much longer than in the first game, which tests patience. Some of the puzzles included in this game aren't as logical as in the first. The unintuitive puzzles are more complicated and mostly involve trial and error during a particular segment of the adventure. There are also more absurdly hidden items and mechanisms, which makes this game much more difficult in terms of its playability as an adventure game. There is also more interaction between the player and other characters in the story, which quickly dissolves the feeling of being a solitary person in a creepy and scary locale. The developers decided to get rid of the melee combat instances completely (found in the first game), which I agree is for the best and makes the game more tense and more fluid. There are way too many interruptions for plot development voice acting. Without ruining the experience with spoilers, I will say that these voice acting pauses occur almost at any given time, without a focus on storyline turning points. They can get a bit distracting at times. Not having the ability to engage your enemies in melee combat makes the game so much more tense and exciting. The ending is very good and adds to the story rather well. Penumbra: Black Plague is better than Penumbra: Overture in every way, as it corrected some of the developers' mistakes and made the gaming experience more enjoyable as a whole. This is clearly the best adventure game I have ever played; totally exceeding Penumbra: Overture. Once again, the game runs a little bit short, but I suppose it is of adequate length after all, since it is an adventure game with lots of theme and mood. I am now looking forward to the third part in the series.  Penumbra: Black Plague is good.
2227	1	a	This game continues where overture leaves off. You continue the search for your father while completing puzzles and problems. The only difference now is being stripped of all weapons you must run instead of fight.
540	0	a	I wanted to like this game, but couldn't. TLDR: It wasn't that much fun overall. Not really much of a horror game (not scary). I found the voice of Clarence to be rather annoying. The puzzles were bothersome at times. The ending took turn way out into left field.   Longer review:  I will start by saying that although the first installment of this series (Overture) has its flaws, I was able to finish the game without a walkthrough and the story was interesting. Black Plague on the other hand improved upon some of these flaws, but ended up making a worse game in my opinion.   Story: Black Plague continues about where Overture left off. However, it goes in an entirely different direction by involving some organization that is apparently a gloabl order. It felt like much of what happened was created after the first game rather than having been the plan for the story all along. By the time I reached the ending, it felt like the story had gone into a whole other direction. And then there is Clarence. He is a voice in your head that (if you play you can figure out how he got there) was just really annoying. I understand the overall contribution of Clarence to the plot, but I would have done it differently myself. But perhaps his annoying voice and dialogue were exactly what the writer(s) wanted to show. Overall, it wasn't satisfying for me.  Gameplay/Puzzles- The gameplay and object interaction were pretty standard if not better than Overture. I definitely think that Black Plague was better off without combat. The enemies were not difficult to face, but rather acted to obstruct you on the way to your next destination. Overall standard gameply. The puzzles were problematic for me as I wasn't really into the game and was in a hurry to finish it, so I often would miss an item that was needed to solve the puzzle. For example, one puzzle required a book or note to tell you how to complete it, but I never saw it and thus was frustrated as to why the puzzle made no sense. Thats on me, but I probably would have liked the puzzles more if they were actually realistic.   For example: at the beginning of the game when you need a soda to short circuit the wiring in the refriderator room; I didn't realize putting in some random and crushed coin into the vending machine would get me the soda. I couldn't go back to get it because the boards over the spike pit had fallen. And there were perfectly fine liquids in the room. Why couldn't I have just used one of them?   Anyways, the puzzles were not always consistent with the objects you could use to complete them. I personally didn't find the puzzles to be realistic at times (not that this game is meant to be real of course)  Horror: There weren't any parts that I felt scared or surprised. The environment had good horror elements, but I could always see enemies coming and never really felt any danger unless I couldn't solve a puzzle fast enough. But the death trial and error system helped bme to not worry about death. Simply put, the game wasn't really scary. Just dark and spooky maybe.   Graphics: Its an older game so I didn't expect anything great. I am sure it looked fine when it came out. The graphics aren't detrimental to enjoying the game.  As I said at the beginning of this review, I didn't find the game to be enjoyable or fun. The story evolved in a way that didn't make much sense since there was no foreshadowing of it in the first game. There were some links of course such as the 'infection' it self, but I think it all fell flat by the end. I guess if the game goes on sale and you don't have any better options available, it is not that expensive and will provide a few hours of gameplay. There are many positive reviews, so you may enjoy the game. If you are looking for a solid horror game, this is not it. It is important to note that the devs did make substantial improvements in these areas in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
2229	1	a	I think I mentioned this in my Overture review but this game blows Amnesia: The Dark Descent away in terms of its plot and actually being a proper horror game. That being said it relies a pretty good amount on you playing the game properly and not just sprinting through it as fast as possible.  Anyone that played Overture (you should play Overture first) will be glad to know that there's less chase sequences in Black Plague. Some of them I couldn't tell if I was actually being chased or not, I wasn't gonna risk it so I hurried anyways. No hordes of spiders chasing you through small tunnels at any rate.  This game is kind of similar to A Machine For Pigs oddly enough in how it handles the plot, I suspect Chinese Room took a lot of inspiration from Black Plague in how they designed AMFP. Though don't get me wrong there's a plethora of ways to die in Black Plague, unlike AMFP which you basically had to try to get something to attack you.  If you enjoyed either of the Amnesia games you'll enjoy Penumbra as well, you just have to keep in mind that it's an older title running on an older engine.
2231	1	a	cool

541	0	a	I simply couldnt get into either Black Plague or Overture. If you, like I, come to this title as a heavy fan of Amnesia and SOMA and are looking for a comparable experience, I feel that you will be disappointed. Simply put, I feel the production quality of this game is significantly low enough to seriously break the immersion of disbelief at times. Some examples of this are: laughably crude 'dream' sequences that look like something out of a bad Amnesia custom story, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ poor animations and character models, and fumbled horror elements. A sub-example of the last item is one time I kept getting caught by a patrolling monster, eventually the horror was lost and it became more of an annoyance. Another would be  The same caliber of story that Frictional has delivered is all here. The gameplay mechanics are also near identical. But unfortunately it doesn't have the polish to pull off the same experience as their follow-up titles. I think if you able to look at this as its own game in addition to having a serious appreciation for single-dev/handful-dev indie horror titles, you will like this alot. But if you want the same caliber of experience as the aforementioned counterparts, it simply isn't here.
2239	1	a	Pretty spooky, mate. Also, puzzles......so many â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing puzzles.....
2241	1	a	Not as scary as Amnesia, though it cuts pretty close.
2243	1	a	Not as scary as Amnesia, though it cuts pretty close.
542	0	a	Does not work. The level after first encountering the alient keeps restarting to the first level upon enterting the loading point inside the vent.  Its impossible to continue the game like this.
2245	1	a	Ending sucks more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ than Elton John on a U.S. Navy Vessel
2247	1	a	This has got to be scarey to play first time, recommended!
2249	1	a	spooked my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off
2251	1	a	was fun and scary, i beat it.
2253	1	a	Before SOMA or Amnesia, there was the Penumbra trilogy of horror games made by the same creators, Frictional Games. Penumbra may have been the first but it doesn't disappoint even to this day. Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
544	0	a	The story is kind of dull, there are some annoying bugs (effects and screen size for instance) and some very frustrating mouse controlled puzzles.
545	0	a	i bought this game expexting it to work...as it turns out wen i first loaded the game it cut off half of the screen and i couldnt see the entire game! it was as if it was zoomed in too much and no way to zoom it out again! i suspect it could be an install problem but i have no idea how to fix that. i dont want to delete the game because i dont want to have to pay money to buy it again. im hoping there will be an update that could somehow reinstall the game and i could play it, but im not entirely sure. i will update this review if anything changes. for now you could risk buying it (afterall i think it may just be my pc but i cant say for sure because i cant check). if you do buy this game and you have the same problem i would appreciate if you could tell me and i could work out if it really is my pc or not. many thanks.
546	0	a	This isn't the most horrifying game I've ever played, but definitely one of the most horrible ones. I really enjoyed Overture and I just had to play Black Plague after finishing it. And in the beginning I really thought it was better. But nooo, the developers had to introduce some really annoying things. It's nice that weapons have been removed, the were really unhandy. And not useful at all in this game - not because the new, scarier-than-the-Overture-dogs-looking enemies are dangerous. They're the opposite. They are so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing slow. Just run past them, 5 seconds later they won't know where you are. Then there's Clarence. Some kind of demon who possesses you in the beginning and comments everything you do. I guess his comments are supposed to be funny. They're not. They aren't informative, they aren't interesting, but they are really long and distracting, sometimes they even block the controls so you just stay and wait until he stops annoying the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of you. He even spoils the most 'emotional' moment in the game. The gameplay, too, becomes annoying. Try solving some riddles while having to run back to a hut every 10-15 seconds so you don't freeze to death. It's not even difficult, it's just extremely tedious. The riddles become really uninspired and in the end I mostly played by a walkthrough because I was done with this piece of crap. And lo, this ending! Instead of just staying on the 'horror' plain, the game suddenly ascends onto a pseudo-metaphysical plain which doesn't fit to the rest at all. I would've liked to laugh, but it was way too stupid.  I'm still going to play Penumbra: Requiem, but only because it's a 100% puzzle game without annoying enemies that just slow you down instead of making things more difficult.
547	0	a	Slightly better than Red Lake. Slightly  Ok, I wanted something interesting and thrilling. Got something weird randomness with a buch of jump-scares.  Moving and stacking objects:  Maybe the worst thing about this game. Occasionally you'll have to stack some boxes to jump over laser-triggered mines (which were put up by a delusional person, judging from their locations). And mines only go off when you pass through them, they ignore objects for some reason. So you'll have to put one box on top of another. But jumping on them will often move and destroy the structure. It is annoying as hell.  Puzzles: [Mild Spoilers] If you want to get through that door, you'll have to inject some kind of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ into your arm and pass out. When you get up, the door will magically unlock. I don't think I need to add anything else.  Jump Scares: They speak for themselves really. The only thing the game can frighten you with are jumping images and loud sounds.   Additionally, it is just raw. There is a point where darkness literally bites and kills you. You have to cover two holes in the wall to avoid that....

551	0	a	When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.  High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.
552	0	a	Black Plague: I don't understand how people keep raving about this game, when I kept getting objects STUCK IN the floor, objects I needed to solve puzzles. At first I thought it was a feature to add to surrealism, but then I got stuck on the wrong side of said object in a tunnel and couldn't solve the puzzle to move on. Maybe I'm spoiled since I played Amnesia first and then backtracked to Penumbra, but..the physics failure made this unplayable for me. :(
553	0	a	This Linux port is not OK. I gave it a try for 40min, but in the end I gave up. It's the experience that turned me away.  First I started it to see if my Intel card can take it. Surprinsingly, it appeared to work very well in 1280x1024 (good framerate for this type of game, decent texture quality). I had to configure it from using Pulse Audio to ALSA, but that's OK. A lot of applications don't get the Pulse Audio integration right. Then I grabbed a coffee and prepared to go through this game from A to Z. I wanted to experience all its features.  The first hickup: multiple monitors. I have a second monitor connected to my laptop. The xrandr/xcb support for this is working perfectly (all applications [thus far] supporting multiple monitors have no issues). But this game simply doesn't get it right. The list of resolutions is weird (I don't know where it gets those), I can't predict on which screen it will start and if I increase the resolution past 1280x1024, it will use both monitors in one large canvas with the game centered. It's unusable. Thus, I'm stuck with a low(ish) resolution.  The game tries to start in fullscreen mode, but today it started doing a decoration-less window mode. Very unusual. There does not seem to be a truly _windowed_ mode, which most Linux users will prefer specifically because fullscreen with X is a very complicated affair.  The next hiccup: the sound. There's a constant 'click', as if the game constantly misses the deadlines when feeding the audio sink.  The next hiccup: CPU usage. Even though I'm in the main menu, the application consumes 100% of my CPU time. I appears to be constanly rendering something, event though I can't see anything noticeable changing. But maybe my driver is not so stellar. Actually, I'm sure it's not. When switching from X to the terminal, the CPU usage drops to ~6%.  The game itself: I started with the tutorial. There's a step where I have to put a box into a coffin. Took me four tries to do that, because the box dissapears all of sudden. Eventually I managed to drop it in the coffin, but it made me woder if there was any QA involved in making this port.  At this point I was pretty bummed and I was ready to do something else, but I kept doing the tutorial until my system rebooted (my laptop's fans didn't keep up with the generated heat; but that's an unrelated hardware issue I have). Hence: this review.  All in all, the game looks very interesting and _maybe_ I'll try it again later, but it's a pitty that I had to step into all these issues which remind me of the Xfree86/artsd era. Maybe it works better on a desktop. Who knows,
554	0	a	Played it over a year ago when orginaly purchased it. And now it wont launch. It downloads just fine but will not lauch. Thanks for the waste of money steam.
555	0	a	Game constatly crash, Steam 3 of 5 times report that the game is not installed, so I have to delete and reinstall again.  'Requiem' expansion is more a platformer then a horror game.
556	0	a	You may like the Penumbra trilogy if you loved Amnesia. Same Lovecraftian undercurrents, but everything feels much less polished: awkward combat, bad puzzles, etc. Overture and Requiem are still worth it. Black Plague however is just painful; it's a series of uninspired puzzles without any actual story, and it doesn't work.
557	0	a	Idk why but there is something wrong with the game. I can't play it, it crashes before I even start playing. Yet I would recommend it but I would not buy this until steam fixes it. Or you can just not play this game at all, so I would recommend it just not right now because I can not play it and steam has been doing nothing about it.
558	0	a	This game will not launch please fix this.

564	0	a	This is a horror game, in the sense that its horrifyingly bad. It uses some old mouse system of interacting with things, meaning to open something you click it with the mouse, hold the key, then move the mouse somehow to open something. Opening doors is a chore in this game, if real life was like this we would never be able to leave our homes. Then again the first room in this game is designed so badly many people never make it out of the room. Better off the games controls are some of the worst in the industry. This game has daddy issues, as in its about finding out about an absent father or some nonsense, yea its not that interesting.  Ha, I bet when the dev made this he was sitting there all like, man these controls are awesome, I'm so awesome, noone did this before, look how awesome I am. Too bad its not awesome, and the reason noone opens doors and things like this is because its annoying. That is the feeling you get from this game its annoying, this game should be called Annoying: Black Plague Edition.   Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00
2255	1	a	You play as Phillip in the second tame of the Penumbra series. This one was definitely my favourite, I loved the story to this game that I still remember it very clearly months after finishing the game. I found that the game was lovely, had an interesting atmosphere, with fitting sound effects and mediocre graphics.  There were a few little puzzles included here and there that you had to complete to progress in the game, but I liked that most of the puzzles weren't pressured by the presence of monsters/dogs. I like to take my time on puzzles.   Once again, a very good buy and game from the Penumbra trilogy
2257	1	a	A voice in your head keeps calling you a monkey.  10/10
2259	1	a	Penumbra is, and always will be, my favorite series from Frictional Games. Brilliant story telling, brilliant characters, and brilliant puzzles. All three games are worth every second.
2261	1	a	Great sequel to Overture. Builds on its strengths, and removes its most important weakness (the combat). The bright laboratory rooms are a welcome change of environment.
2263	1	a	This game was great, you have to think thru the puzzles, out think the aliens and watch out for traps. The puzzles are not so much, move here, step here, but they seem like pratical things that you would have to do to acomplish a goal... really enjoyed this game and thought it was very creepy..
2265	1	a	The best way to describe this game? My heart just cried the whole time.
2267	1	a	omg â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my pants with joy! 10.10 AS
2269	1	a	One of the best horror/puzzle games I've ever played and in my opinion it's the best one in the whole series of Penumbra. The underground laboratory and housing setting adds much immersion and the 'creatures' that lurk down there do so as well. The Storyline is above-average in my opinion it's not God-Tier but its pretty good. There isn't much I can say about this as there is not much to say without spoiling it but I highly recommend this if your looking for a pretty good fright or just a good game to immerse yourself in.
2271	1	a	It's good. Stop looking at me like that...
2273	1	a	Killed by a barrel. 100/10
2275	1	a	I love the Penumbra series! The physics-based gameplay mechanics are brilliant and definitely the highlight of these games. Theres some great scares and an intense atmosphere. Buy this series!!
2277	1	a	The level design can be a little dull at times. But the gameplay is a significant improvement over its prequel (Overture) and even sequel (Requiem). This game set the standard of horror of what would eventually become Amnesia The Dark Descent.  
2279	1	a	The scary â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is back from where you ended in Overture, and this time... You will be scared more than how much you were scared â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in Overture.
2281	1	a	This game, similiar to Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Same creators) Is great for the horror fan. Nothing screams 'horror' more than not being able to hurt whats chasing you. Use your wits on complicated puzzles, or hide from a pursueing enemy, this game is high on my list of must downloads!
2283	1	a	If you liked playing Amnesia, then you GOTTA try this! This is so awesome, with a good story in it.
2285	1	a	Incredible atmosphere and manageably terrifying. Some clever gameplay and quite an interesting story. I really loved every minute of it. Picked up all 3 Penumbra games, but decided to give this one a go first. Delighted I did. Just gotta get the courage up to play the other 2 now and I'll be sorted.
2287	1	a	One of those games that makes you realize every thing you see can be used as a weapon, and how you can't do that.
2289	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague might not have the best graphics, but it makes up for it with gameplay. Penumbra was developed by the same company that made Amnesia, and has many of the same aspects. It has enemies that roam around randomly, and puzzles that make you think WHILE being hunted down.   In my opinion, the story for Black Plague is much more interesting than Amnesia's. The characters have amazing personalities (Clarence), and you will grow attached to them throughout the game. Some puzzles are unnecessarily hard, but I am proud to say I beat it without using a walkthrough.  If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, or Outlast, Definitely try this game.
2291	1	a	it was good but not as good as Amnesia the dark descent
2293	1	a	Overture was fantastic, but unfortunately Black Plague is just not as good. Black Plague seems to fall into the problem of going much too far into the story and then seems to end in a jumbled mess. Don't get me wrong, the game is great and should definitely follow finishing Overture, but originally meaning to be the 2nd game in a Trilogy definitely took its toll.
2295	1	a	Great game! You don't find any weapons in this installment of 'Penumbra', thus the emphasis on sneaking is always there. Enemies can't just be ambushed from the shadows as you can in 'Penumbra: Overture' to clear out an area and make it safe.  If you want a scary and stressful time, get the Penumbra pack! Also, keep an eye out for 10 statues hidden throughout the game.
2297	1	a	If you get immersed into the story of the game instead of just the game play...you gotta check this out...I love immersing myself into story lines...and now I'm stuck, because I'm too scared to play by myself alone. :)
2299	1	a	Pros. Great game, scary, atmospheric, psychological, Fantastic physics system, lots of sarcasm. Cons. Too short, slightly dated graphics. 8.5/10 Does what it does well.

2303	1	a	Better then the first
2305	1	a	Better than overture, pretty scary but it's fun.
2307	1	a	Perhaps the most frightening game I have ever played. Though there is nothing particularly original in the design, it is executed extremely well. The game maintains a constant feeling of helplessness and extreme paranoia interspersed with moments of well-executed levity.  The engine is rough around the edges (though it is less apparent here than in Penumra's previous episode, in which the combat was poorly executed), I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to cower in a corner saying, 'Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!' and then have a sleepless night.  In fact, I'm writing this review because I can't play the game anymore because it's 9 pm and I know if I play a second longer I won't get a wink (of sleep or otherwise).  You may want to play Penumbra: Overture before playing this game, as the plot continues from where the previous episode left off, but it is not necessary: the game can stand on its own. And Penumbra: Overture isn't nearly as well-made.
2309	1	a	A masterpiece ... I'm speechless .............. it's not a game, it's a philosophy
2311	1	a	This horror game is one of the three games there are in the Penumbra Series that I think is the best of all of them. In the first game, Penumbra: Overture, you set to find your father in hopes that he's still alive. Clues lead you to an abandoned mineshaft that is crawling with monsters, but you make a friend down in the mines, Red.   SPOILER PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PENUMBRA: OVERTURE!     Red dies.     After you leave the mineshaft, you were struck by a monster when entering a shady looking corridor, that event then leads to Penumbra: Black Plague.  Penumbra: Black Plague takes place in the Archaic Elevated Caste, a complex built deep underground connected with the mine to aid in archaeological research. Researchers have found a virus that wiped out the whole caste, except for  Amabel Swanson.    ( I don't want to talk anymore about the games because I think I will spoil the rest, so you'll have to play for yourself. I extremely recommend this series if you are into horror games, and or the Amnesia series as it's made by the same developers. ) 
2313	1	a	+ Great story following Penumbra: Overture + Great graphics, music and atmosphere + Even more scarier sequel + Great puzzles
2315	1	a	A fitting end to the series.
2317	1	a	A game that will make you scared to leave the room you are hiding in after the monster leaves
2319	1	a	Great sequel to Penumbra Overture! Very nice story line! Loved it!
2321	1	a	I like it better than Amnesia, it is more focused on puzzles and atmosphere rather than jump scares. Storyline is very well made and emmersive. Really sp00ky at time i have to say.
2323	1	a	Penumbra the black plague is my 2nd favorite horror game of all time its intense. and i got the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ scared out of me when i had headphones on in the dark when a load creature burst threw the door after me. great game 10/10
2325	1	a	Truth be told, this game is no where near as scary as Frictional Games' Amnesia. I think this is a strength though because I was actually able to complete the game without chickening out like I did during the Dark Descent. The story is relatively well written too.
2327	1	a	There's this room that gave me a heart attack. Like jump out of my seat and yell while stomping your feet. It was a lot of fun! Great to play with a group of siblings and/or friends watching.   tip: Hook up pc to big screen, surround sound, have comfortable seating, light up keyboard (recommended), and lights off.
2329	1	a	Isn't the most scary game ever, but still this is one of my favorites just like amnesia, the physics of the game and such other
2331	1	a	very very scary game i recommend buying this one
2333	1	a	I love this game half to death it has some parts where you need to just look up and cheat but it gets your brain moving and has you filled for more as you go through alone in the dark and most spooky thing you will play.
2335	1	a	'Christ...go here,go there,fetch this,run me a bath...typical broad,atypical circumstances.You think fate has anything to do with this?Fate is merely the war cry of those too scared to think for themselves.'  Clarence-2010
2337	1	a	A very overlooked game, but still very enjoyable with an intresting story and genuine scares (few, if any jump scares).
2339	1	a	This game series is a really good intro into the horror genre: It doedn't rely on jumpscares, and is really well made. Another thing I personally love about this game is how much lore there is around it, so if you like that sort of thing, this is for you. Overall, I reckon this game is around a 9/10, but it's hard to judge it on just one aspect of it.
2341	1	a	The scariest and best overall Penumbra title. It abandons the complex gameplay of Overture to deliver a more linear and horror-focused narrative, which in my mind is a good thing. Weapons have been stripped out, leaving you defenseless against the horrors that lurk within the Research facility. Light sources such as glowsticks have been nerfed, and enemies are far more deadly. Puzzles are excellent, and Penumbra's overarching plot never fails to grip and intrigue.
2343	1	a	Although it falls to the same faults, it continues the exceptional story of its predecessor. Black Plague easily satisfies those looking for (more) scares and light puzzles.
2345	1	a	I'm stuck in this game. R.I.P walkthrough's on the internet.
2347	1	a	Scariest series i have ever played! Better than Amnesia...
2349	1	a	I've already played through this game twice before.  It's very spooky. I would say it's even better than Amnesia, being the high point of Frictional's horror games.
2351	1	a	Very very Scary... very
2353	1	a	This game killed off like over half the population of medieval Europe. That's the scary part.
2355	1	a	I just gave Overture a negative recommendation due to the comparison with this game, which I feel is a huge improvement, and so I thought I should come and rate this one positively to reflect that comparison. In my opinion this game provides everything Overture has to offer and more. Even the story of the first game was explained in this one, making it complete on its own even without playing Overture.  The story and characters are great, and the game wouldn't be what it is without them. It's definitely scary and both the scare factor and story compliment one another greatly. The puzzles are a nice addition, especially when also combined with the other two aspects. Definitely recommended.
2357	1	a	Graphically lacking and the story doesn't make sense to me (probably as I don't read in game literature or really follow story lines too well anyway) but the gameplay is amazing. Good puzzles, if not a little obscure in places, and fairly suspenseful. I've not completed the game as yet as I keep getting distracted by things like work. So far only met a couple of monsters but the AI is pretty good. I'd rate this one a good 4/5.  I may even finish it one day along with the rest of my games list. Aaaah to dream.
2359	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is basically a prototype version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This is not a criticism; just know that if you are coming hot off of Amnesia there will be some steps backward.  Having gotten rid of the ability to fight back in Overture, Frictional Games makes a much more frightening game in Black Plague. The enemies you encounter in Black Plague are gross-looking, cannot be killed, and sometimes carry light sources to see you in the dark. Unfortunately, they are also dumb as rocks and there are plenty of objects you can jump on top of, safely out of reach, and look around to solve your predicament. At one point, I managed to glitch a mattress in a doorway to keep a monster out of the room I was in.  Without spoiling too much, there are plenty of moments that made me jump or feel uncomfortable and the plot balances 'scary heeby-jeebies' with actual plot development, letting the horror set in by implications of the happenings around you rather than the monsters you find haunting you.  Overall, Black Plague is a vast improvement over Overture and from a design perspective, it's interesting to see how Frictional Games went from that game on to their more popular game, Amnesia. If you like Overture, Black Plague is better. If you like Amnesia, give the Penumbra series a shot (and check out the fan-made Penumbra mods for Amnesia; they take place after the official Penumbra games).
2361	1	a	An incredibly solid follow-up to the first game. Puzzles are still fun, hitting the sweet spot of not being too hard or too easy, and the story and its twists are fantastic, supplemented by great characters/dialog. The combat from the first game is gone, but most of the time you're still finding creative ways to deal with the monsters, there's only maybe two or three that you just flat-out avoid. It's certainly very up there as far as Survival Horror is concerned.
2363	1	a	SHORT REVIEW INCOMING PENUMBRA BLACK PLAGUE is one of the best horror games ever made. If you want to play a game like AMNESIA this is the game for you. Great atmosphere, awesome story and tight survival horror gameplay. Some of the puzzles are incredibly smart and getting chased by monsters is a breath-taking experience. By far the best PENUMBRA game.
2365	1	a	Certainly not the best or most groundbreaking horror game, but it was fun for me and i enjoyed it.
2367	1	a	i didnt even have to walk out of my room to get rid of my constipation      10/10 would get the crap scared out of me again
2369	1	a	scary as hell!!! i hate jumpscares.
2371	1	a	This game is probably one of the best survival i've ever played, years later I still have spooky memories, Philip's story is still in my mind
2373	1	a	Frictional certainly knows what they're doing when it comes to horror games (being the same guys who made Amnesia), and this is no exception. Itâ€™s a very intense, trilling game that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The story is simple in an excellent way, as it should be for a horror game. The physics puzzles were fun and kept me thoroughly immersed the entire way through. For only $10, this game is definitely worth it.
2375	1	a	If you have a great imagination this game will be scary as hell. Just as much, if not more so than Amnesia.  Wicked game.
2377	1	a	Just as good a scare as Amnesia: The Dark Descent
2379	1	a	This game is in my top 10 if not 1. The gameplay and story can't be beaten.
2381	1	a	Totally Amazing Game. I loved it from start to end, Black Plague is seriously more scary than Overture (which had its moments) and action that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Although this game isn't as scary as 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent' it still made my heart race and made me jump a few times. If you have some spare money, or in the mood for a nice horror/thriller game. This is the one for you.  Gameplay 8/10  Scare Factor 6.5/10  Story 7.5/10  Action 9/10  Overall 8/10   p.s. if you haven't finished Overture before playing... prepare for spoilers ;)
2383	1	a	This sequel definitely has more terrifying enemies, but they're pretty much the only enemy in the game. Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is the random humour of the character Clarence; it can really detract from the uneasiness you should feel. Still a fun and interesting sequel regardless.
2385	1	a	Made by the Amnesia bros this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is baller as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2387	1	a	Some the puzzles and graphics are stupid, but by and large, this game nails down the progression frictional was going for in Amnesia:The Dark Descent, You can easily see the concepts that they were shooting for in making an extremely tense and terrifying experience, and it's terrifying. This game I can say is easily as scary as Amnesia, While the engine is pretty dated and the puzzles sometimes make literally no sense, the whole game can be greatly appreciated for the Horror it conveys. The tension is constant due to a limited understanding of the plot and creatures, and they really drive the HP Lovecraft horror into the mystery of the story, and even after the final curtain, you will ask yourself what the hell even happened. A great 7/10.
2389	1	a	this game is awesome, and also not as scary. thats good, i'm suprised.
2391	1	a	An interesting story with quite a few scares, don't let the dated graphics and repetive music stop you from playing this game. Just like Amnesia, play in the dark with headphones and have the gamma very low.
2393	1	a	An Amazing title. Pioneering on a single concept of hand gesture gaming this game showcases great talent of a small independant studio. The game immerses you in a dark story of discovery on an abandoned facility. the gestures work great and the game is, for a lack of better words, Scary. you should pick up the whole series.   8/10
2395	1	a	A game's version of a B-Movie. Graphics aren't that great, but the game style, the environment, and the underlying tones more than make up for it. Highly recommended, very very scary game.
2397	1	a	bestest game ever its scary play now PHYSICS.
2399	1	a	Very good game, much scarier than the original penumbra overture. I particularily liked the voice in my head, gave me something to look forward too. Enemies were a lot smarter and scarier although just as easy to avoid for the most part. The way the story played out was average. The end felt a little rushed but continued into the expansion pack requiem so I can't complain. The way items and puzzles were laid out was pretty bad, mostly because you get nearly no hints and have to deal with it yourself. I'd play this game again after a while, still have to beat requiem which I'm looking forward too. The game also felt quite a bit shorter than the original, with the exception of providing a more detailed story line.  Storyline 5/5 Characters 3/5 Effects 3/5
2401	1	a	Insanely scary. If you loved Amnesia you NEED to get this game.
2403	1	a	Black Plague ends what Overture started. Get ready for even more thrilling game experience, and this time, there is no way to kill enemies. Black Plague takes all the goods Overture had and adds even more to that, making it absolutely must-play-experience for horror lovers.
2405	1	a	Black Plague - a great 2nd after overture with a few more scares and some more challenging puzzles  - the expansion - 'Requiem' - was a bit of a let-down simply because it only featured puzzles. The first two had a great balance of scares and puzzles which greatly elevate them above the expansion.
2407	1	a	Easily the best game of the Penumbra series. The movement is pretty smooth, the puzzles are a good challenge, it scares you while pacing itself and the story is good. The game is a tad bit buggy sometimes, but glitches don't occur often, so it's negligible. Unlike Overture's stupid combat system, there are no means of self defense. This, paired with the humming of machines and flourescent lights and other ambient noises makes the environment very creepy. A major flaw of this game is the budget: it's not too long and isn't very pretty looking. But who the hell cares? I think that might be the reason this game got such a low metacritic rating. But if you judged it on how scary it is, take the the total points of the Dead Space Series, divide by three, then add 10 and that's the score this game deserves.   Short Review: Scary, fun/10, definitely worth playing.
2409	1	a	Penumbra Black Plague is an amazing game, better than its original: Penumbra Overture, in my opinion. If you've played Amnesia: The Dark Descent or the original game than play this game aswell.
2411	1	a	Scariest game I have ever played. It's great if you can handle scary games.
2413	1	a	I recommend Black Plague based on the scarcity of good horror games, but it is very flawed. It is much better than Overture, with combat completely removed, scarier enemies, and more varied locations. Penumbra actually has some scary moments this time. Problem-solving is generally better than in Overture, but again, logic can be inconsistent. Early on, the game teaches you that barricading doors with heavy objects doesn't work as the basic enemy simply flings the door open, but later, you have to do just that. Some sections seemed to be added just to worsen the game: a freezing outdoor segment that drains your health when away from fire, and a tedious computer puzzle involving the sorting of programs into circuit boards. If you can tolerate these annoyances, then Black Plague's interesting story and atmosphere make it a fairly good horror experience.
2415	1	a	Fantastic game, I'd even say I liked it more than Amnesia. A very important note for everyone though: PUT THE GAME ON HARD MODE. Anything below hard allows you to survive 6+ hits and even KILL the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ monsters with little effort.  The atmosphere and setting are way better than anything Amnesia could hope to be, but the level design is mediocre at best.
2417	1	a	Amazing game. A must have for any Amnesia fans. Penumbra: Black Plague features (as I call it) a pick up anything that you see layout. This enables the user to turn this horror game into a comedy by throwing random stuff at the monsters. The puzzles are tricky, but not too hard. I would recommend this to gamers that want a rich storyline, with horror elements, and challenging puzzles. Overall it is a great game.
2419	1	a	Anyone who is a fan of the first person Horror Survival genre should play this game! Itâ€™s a game that creates moments of genuine fear. It doesnâ€™t rely on â€˜jump tacticsâ€™ that truly are the â€˜plagueâ€™ of horror these days. Good luck!
2421	1	a	This is a must play for any horror fan, goes double for lovecraft fans.
2423	1	a	Far more mind stimulating than Amnesia but a different kind of scary.. like not okay...
2425	1	a	good game, sequel of the first. if you like horror adventure mood, this is for you, you won't regret!!
2427	1	a	such scurry, much fright, wow.
2429	1	a	Some seriously creepy moments and sufficiently thrilling insanity story-wise. Removing combat was a key move by the devs.
2431	1	a	5 hours to beat. very well done. very immersive and very scary. a great lead up to amnesia.
2433	1	a	This game is really scary not on the level of Amnesia, which by the way is made by the same people.Horror games i am very used to i have played many horror games and i am used to the concept but this game scared me at points especially in the beginning where you have to hide from monsters, along the lines of Amnesia u have hide in this game. The atmosphere and sound work so well together it kinda had alot of puzzles that's the only negative thing i buy a horror to get scared not to do a bunch of puzzles but still worth the buy u will get freaked i promise.
2435	1	a	Pros: Very well done horror, more than simple jump scares. Immersive, almost no hud during gameplay Puzzels are significantly harder than amnesia's  Did away with the first games weapon mechanic. Scary-ier IMO than the first one.   Cons: Requires first game to get full experince. It gives a story recap, but it wont feel the same unless you have beaten the first. Some parts require finding an item, that if not found quickly can lead to wandering the entire complex for 2 hours before looking it up online to find you threw a damn couch cusion over it.  Rotation motion is very difficult to do properly  Overall, very good game if your into story-horror games. It improves on almost everything that was wrong with the first one. Still some issues with rotating an object or handle.  Combined, I think the Black Plague and Overture are scary-ier than amenisa.   The Requiem addition is kinda bad. I dont want to give anything way, but it didn't do much to advance the story for me, and isn't nearly as scary. If Requiem wasn't free with this, I would vote to skip it.  
2437	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague, being a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, is of course a continuation of the same story with very similar gameplay. Considering how much I enjoyed Overture and that both games are on the short side (I finished this one with 6.3 hours logged in Steam), that was very much welcome. I got Overture with the first Humble Indie Bundle, and by the time I got around playing it the included offer to get the rest of Penumbra cheap had expired. Luckily it was part of the Halloween 2011 Steam sale and I finally got my hands on Black Plague and Requiem. If youÂ’re at all interested in horror and puzzles I highly recommend the Penumbra games!
2439	1	a	This is for those who like the concept of horror games, but dont like being scared. This game has a great atmosphere and puzzles, but its not what id consider scary. But i enjoyed it, although it can be rather boring at times. But hell, 9.99 for all three (Penumbra: Overture, Black Plague, and Requiem), its worth it.
2441	1	a	Scary as hell! And fun. XD But confuseing as hell at some points XD;
2443	1	a	Actually â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing scary. Play dis.
2445	1	a	Awesome game. It's brilliant and terrifying - just buy it.   Out of Frictional's current main releases (fright factor): Amnesia: TDD, Pemumbra: BP, Amnesia: AMFP, Penumbra: O. So, basically, Penumbra is a precursor to the Amnesia games. And you can tell. It's the 2nd scariest game franchise ever (the first being Amnesia - but not by a lot).
2447	1	a	Continuing the story of Penumbra: Overture, Black Plague puts you back into the parka of Phillip as he winds ever deeper into the mysteries of 'The Facility'. Hounded now by freakish, infected creatures - the compounds former employees -you must deduce your way through security systems and pray the earthen horrors that wait just outside the concrete walls don't hear your footsteps echoing through the empty corridors.
2449	1	a	Really good &amp; intense game, I really enjoyed it.
2451	1	a	The better game in the series, not as scary as Amnesia but you still might â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ your pants.
2453	1	a	If you like being scared crapless and feeling helpless this is the game for you. Fighting 99% of the time is not a option so out smarting your enemy and using stealth is a must. If you like feeling like a super soldier and plowing through your enemies this game will make you feel like a 5 year old school boy sitting in a cold dark tunnel crying for your mommy as a pack of rabid dogs or nut job miner gets ready to tear you apart. This game is probably best played with friends or else your going to be so paronoid and freaked out that youll be afraid to turn the lights off.   Basically if you want to know my experience of the game i spent most of my time huddled in a corner flicking my lighter or flashlight on and off to afraid to go around the next corner because i could sense i was about to be brutally slaughtered by some unknown force.
2455	1	a	Scared the crap out of James, Scared the crap out of me, This game is not for the faint of heart, But the story unfolds brilliantly. 
2457	1	a	Yes, I would recommend this game. Its story, whilst not featuring any cutscenes, is one of the most engrossing and terrifying ever told. The enviroment is perfect and it plays out like a FPS- Point and Click. Literally everything about this game is excellant. If you don't play this before you die you life wasn't worth living.
2459	1	a	Black plague is hands down my favourite game and part two after penumbra overture. A survival horror with an original lovecraftian plot, unique gameplay style and an umbelievable antagonist unsurpassed by any game.
2461	1	a	Even freakier than Penumbra: Overture. Well worth checking out. Only outdone by the recent Amnesia: Dark Descent.
2463	1	a	spookier than the previous one (Overture) about a 7 hour game, good challenges. I didn't find all the artifacts. better all around besides the graphics. It's look fine on max but I thought they would get a little better. 8.3/10
2465	1	a	I CAN'T PLAY THESE GAMES IM A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2467	1	a	The best Penumbra.
2469	1	a	The roots of Amnesia are undeniable in this standout entry from Frictional's sci-fi series. If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the 'buddy' is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.
2471	1	a	Penumbra: Overture's story and style were wonderful, but being able to just beat most of the monsters to death greatly undermined the horror element. The developer listened to complaints, however (which is something I wish the bigger companies would do) and produced Black Plague, which single-handedly fixes all the major problems with the original while continuing the intriguing story that I loved so much before. No longer can you expect to fight your way out of a tight spot, so your only options are stealth and pegging it. As a result, the atmosphere can get RIDICULOUSLY intense and your opportunities to relax become increasingly few later on.  It's not quite the masterpiece of bone-shaking terror that Amnesia would become, but it's still bloody petrifying and easily worth looking into, particularly if you've already suffered through Amnesia and fancy even more abuse.
2473	1	a	Unbelievably enjoyable. It will make you think as well as make you panic. It's also not that expensive.
2475	1	a	Before Amnesia there was Penumbra.  Even though it was Frictional's first foray into game development, the team showed their almost perfect understanding of what makes a game frightening. Just like its younger brother Amnesia, Penumbra succeeds at making you afraid of the dark all over again with creepy atmosphere and that feeling of dread that hangs over you as you desperately fumble your way through darkness.  If you enjoy survival horror -- and if you enjoyed Amnesia -- then turn out all the lights and prepare yourself for Penumbra.  Don't forget to lock your door...
2477	1	a	Very good horror adventure game, predecessor to their newest title Amnesia. I finished all 3 games in Penumbra series, and they are really thrilling and compelling. Best played at night in the dark, quite room!
2479	1	a	If you're a fan of the old survival horrors like the Resident EVil series (before 5) and Silent Hill then this game is a must. Immerse yourself in this awesome world. Have to warn you tho there are a few minor glitches if youre running a old comp. And its best not to go for head on combat in this game. Run, hide, use your wits in order to survive this horror.
2481	1	a	Very immersive, creepy, disturbing, puzzle horror game. I never played OVERTURE, the previous game. But there is no real need as the previous game is explained in segments throughout this one.  I really enjoyed this game. More than I did Amnesia, for the simple fact of the Date its set in. Amnesia is more like, reading an old book. This one is set in a year I recognise, or close enough, feels modern and through that I found I got into alot faster and enjoyed it more.   Grab what you need and Run for the hills. This game has no weapons. You can throw items at enemies, but they dont die, they will just be distracted while you run away. But dont let the lack of combat put you off. This game is about the STORY, which is great. And sucking you into a nightmare, which, it does very well.  Highly recommended for any horror fans, or anyone who played Amnesia or similar games.  9 / 10
2483	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague only strengthens the game mechanics of its predecessor. Most of the petty imperfections from Overture are fixed. If you enjoyed Overture, then DEFINITELY pick this up. Otherwise, this game merely supports your decision towards purchasing its prequel, Overture.  Gameplay: 19/20 ... AWESOME Story: 8/10 ... GREAT Graphics: 5/5 ... PERFECT Sound/Music: 5/5 ... PERFECT Controls: 5/5 ... PERFECT  Overall: 93% (42/45) ... AWESOME
2485	1	a	The second chapter in the Penumbra series brings back more of the same psychological horror that was put on display so brilliantly in Penumbra Overture. Some of the mechanics were tweaked a little to make the story flow better but all in all the game is just a continuation of the first. That's not to detract at all from what is offered because Black Plague is just fantastic.  Like Overture, if you're at all a fan of horror then this is a game you shouldn't overlook. You'll be just as satisfied with this as the first.  As far as Requiem, which comes with Black Plague, I'll just say that it is Penumbra's Godfather III. Frictional isn't trying to do more of the same here, they are simply showing you how the Penumbra story ends. Don't misunderestimate this title.
2487	1	a	A must have if you already own the first part of the story (Penumbra: Overture). Another great piece of a truly horrifying game.
2489	1	a	A somewhat short, but overall more focused sequel to Overture. If you want an atmospheric adventure game with a unique, 'hard science' feel to it, look no further.
2491	1	a	A great sequel to a great game; this one is definitely scarier than the previous installment as it has more 'determined' enemies and an even more ominous atmosphere, not to mention the chilling elements that have been added here and there. If that wasn't enough, the environment has been entirely changed around, complete with new characters and objectives. The only way to see what happens to the brave Philip is to play this game and find out.
2493	1	a	This is better than outlast
2495	1	a	More like it! A lot better than the first. A lot like Amneisa: the Dark Decent. Love the dream sequence and the end trials, also that you are slowly losing control of yourself. A pity they did not use the gasmask more when you where being hunted. That would have been true Claustrophobic horror.  The second part. Requeim is not like the others. Its like a third small extra game where they put all the puzzels with they could not fit in the other games. You go around bigger puzzels and when you are finished go into a portal and get to the next puzzel. You do that like 9 times. Not really any story or any enemies. Feels a bit like portal put more scary minus the portalgun. They try to make you feel like there are enemies that can hurt you around, put there never is :P
2497	1	a	pretty epic and scary i think you guys will like it if you like scary games C:
2499	1	a	Fantastic game. If you love survival horror, look no further.
2501	1	a	Try it out. It's pretty good. They don't hesitate to throw you into a bad situation in the first half hour
2503	1	a	If you like solving puzzles and being stalked by scary-â™¥â™¥â™¥ monsters then this game is definetly for you. 
2505	1	a	I recommend this game to everyone who likes thriller or horror like games this game is one of the scariest game know to man in my option.
2507	1	a	These are some of Frictional's earliest games and they are awesome! Penumbra Overture comes with this pack, and is highly not recommended to buy it by itself. This also comes with requiem, which is kinda like the short sequel to Black Plague. This pack is totally worth the ten dollars. Honestly, it's worth more.
2509	1	a	I think that people ignore this game and give all of their praise to Amnesia is CRIMINAL... Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.  Don't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help. If you liked Amnesia at all, then you'd at least like Black Plague.
2511	1	a	Fun enough to play through a few times..at most. For it's release date, nobody should expect it to play super well or look great. Go into it expecting to enjoy the suspense and the story, and you'll be satisfied. Yes, its scary at some points; in your first playthrough, you get to realize you can't do anything to defend yourself except run and hide, making the game all that more terrifying.   The Other game that comes with BP, called 'Requiem' has absolutely no enemies, scary moments, or plot; It's a series of repetitive puzzles.   7.5/10 for Black Plague 1/10 for Requiem
2513	1	a	When you buy the gold edition does it now come with Penumbra Requiem Because I got the other 2 but also Requiem? Not complaining great game I rate it 10/10
2515	1	a	To start: I used to add a header to every one of these reviews, but it oftentimes made the review too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page. Also, since this game comes with Penumbra: Requiem, I'll talk about that game in this review as well.  Gameplay (Black Plague): Truth be told, you should probably refer back to the Overture review if you wanna know about the mechanics of the game. Since this is a sorta episodic game, I won't go into too much detail again about the mechanics. Just know that they remain largely unchanged. What has changed - and definitely for the better - is the atmosphere. Oh man, it's a lot better this time around. Again, it's not quite Dark Descent territory, but it's pretty dang good. The extra enemy variety helps out a lot as well. Another thing that has changed for the better is the puzzle design. They do require a bit more thought than the average puzzle in Overture would, but the puzzles still make logical sense and are less prone to breaking. All in all, it's the same from Overture but a lot better. 8/10.  Gameplay (Requiem): If ya like puzzles and not being scared... go play Portal 2 or something. Seriously; I don't even know why this became a thing. This game is mostly puzzles with some platforming here and there, but there's no monsters. There's no atmosphere. It's pretty much Myst if you've turned the Gamma down to 0.1 or something. That's not a bad thing, though; a lot of the puzzles in this game are quite good. It's just not a Penumbra game. Also, the atmosphere... they're just taking the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at this point. There's a Donkey Kong parody in there. No, I'm not joking. There's even chippy music. As if the game wasn't far removed enough from the Penumbra atmosphere. Again though, the puzzles are pretty good. It's just not a Penumbra game. 6/10.  Story (Black Plague): A lot tighter of a story than Overture's. Clarence is a pretty neat and genuinely terrifying character/concept. Likewise, there's actually a couple of pretty heavy moments toward the end (for those who know what I'm talking about, pun well intended). Everything's pretty well explained and the ending wraps things up quite well. No need for a sequel. 8/10.  Story (Requiem): ...and then this thing happened. Again, just... why? The story doesn't even take itself seriously. For anybody who bought Requiem from retail; I'm sorry. I apologize on behalf of Frictional (not affiliated). The characters are just silly, the premise doesn't make any dosh garn sense, the payoff is underwhelming, and it's just generally a mess. At least Dark Descent redeemed them. 3/10.  Graphics (Black Plague): Again, a lot more of the same but better. Enemy design is the biggest standout as far as graphics goes. As for the technical side, same engine; same reliability. 4/5.  Graphics (Requiem): None of the enemy design from Black Plague. At least areas are pretty varied, even if the framing device doesn't work. Again, for the technical side of the things, it's the same as Black Plague. 3/5.  Sound (Black Plague): I'd say it's about the same as Overture's, which is to say very good. Enemies sound a lot more terrifying now, so that's a plus. Clarence sounds proper mental this time as opposed to cartoonishly mental. Good stuff. 5/5.  Sound (Requiem): Way too try-hard. So much attempted atmosphere for so little worth fretting over. It gets kinda ridiculous, honestly. Ah well; it's not like anything else in the game was cohesive. 2/5.  Overall scores for Black Plague are 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Good stuff.  Overall scores for Requiem are: 6/3/3/2; 4.7/10. Not good stuff.
2517	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague is an excellent sequel to Overture.   The Penumbra series is filled with psychological thrills and creeps that doesn't rely on jump scares.  Black Plague fills in the lack of dialogue missing in Overture.   Requiem is an quick puzzle-like expansion on more information about where/who Philip and some ect. chatacters in the series, that include no monsters whatsoever.  If you enjoyed other games by Frictional, Amnesia You'll enjoy Penumbra as well.
2519	1	a	Not scary, but fun :D
2521	1	a	Great stuff
2523	1	a	This game scared the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of me countless times. Buy this right the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ now
2525	1	a	Just as good as the original. Great story and gameplay. 8/10
2527	1	a	One of the games that are able to scare a sh*t out of you. Truly recommended.
2529	1	a	Interesting horror and exploration game.
2531	1	a	Though this game has outdated graphics, somewhat confusing puzzles, and some of the most derpy monsters in any horror game I've ever played, it makes up for it with an amazing atmosphere and story. Though I never was truly scared, my heart skipped a beat more than a couple of times. If you have played Amnesia or the first game you will enjoy this game to. 8/10
2533	1	a	A genuinely scary puzzle/adventure game. There is no combat in this one, and it profits greatly from that fact.
2535	1	a	This game gave me Tuurngait.
2537	1	a	Awesome puzzle/horror game. Play it.
2539	1	a	An athmospheric horror-game with a terrifying Soundtrack.
2541	1	a	After completing Penumbra Overture, I decided to play this game to further adapt myself to the horror genre found in games such as these. Unlike the first one, this was f***** scary. One look at that monster and I knew that this wasn't going to be easy. Of course my desire to finish the game got the best of me so I continued onward and became used to the creepy environment and that monster, so much in fact that I didn't even try to be stealthy and just ran for it. Great gameplay, great story, and great environment.  Overall: 9/10
2543	1	a	The sequel to overture has our protagonist pick up a fairly bizarre 'sidekick' that provides for some comic relief and plot development among other things. Puzzles are a bit trickier this time around but still pretty sensible. This time you have no way of fighting the monsters which, like the previous game, is a bit of a non-issue since you can run to certain doors to escape them.
2545	1	a	It is a good game. It has got some creepy moments and some decent design. Being the best game in the penumbra series however i can't recomend the other games much, and this game is not without fault. It unfortunately falls apart near the end and i almost gave it a negative for that reason... This is no Amnesia1/outlast but it is still worth a spin if you saw most of what the genre offers and are a horror game fan.... Keep in mind it's an old game too, there are better games to spend your cash on but it's so cheap... What else can i say... It's an old indie game. Keep your expectations in check and appreciate it for what it happens to be.
2547	1	a	This game and its two sequels are the most frightening games I've ever played that are not Eversion. Heavily inspired by Lovecraft.
2549	1	a	Hands down, this is the best survival horror game. I know everyone likes to be loud about Amnesia, which is a fine game, but Penumbra will always come first for me. If you like survival horror, or like games that really make you question sanity, this is the game for you.
2551	1	a	I love Frictional because they recreate what I always loved in horror games: atmospheric psychological creeping on you. With the Penumbra series as their debut and then Anmesia as their hit success.
2553	1	a	Amnesia: Greenland Edition
2555	1	a	This game will surely scare the hell out of you. Play at night time with everyone asleep and all the lights off to make it more interesting. Loved it ! I only wished I had play the games in order lol
2557	1	a	A fantastic game, it takes a step up from Overture by introducing two new characters and seamlessly contuining the story. Not only did it become an atmospheric horror game by taking away all weapons, leaving you completely vulnerable to the enviroment and your enemies, but introduced such a level of character depth that I began to feel and sympathize for the characters, becoming even more immersed into the game.  An absolutely amazing playthrough, I cannot wait to begin the last installment, Requiem, and to see what unfolds and happens to Philip as his story comes to an end.
2559	1	a	Yo, if you wanna play this go f***ing get extra undies cause this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ will f**k you up...
2561	1	a	9/10 Good story but takes a lot of time to figure out the puzzles...
2563	1	a	Black Plague is superior to its predecessor, Overture, in that it has a more intriguing plot, a creepier atmosphere, better thought out puzzles, and a dark sense of humor that enriches the game. It is easily the best of the original trilogy.  To read a more detailed review, please read:  http://breakingcanon.com/games/penumbra-black-plague/ 
2565	1	a	Because of excessive complexity of the puzzles at times it seems that you are stuck to the fault of a game bug. Maybe I'm too stupid for this game, but it is quite unwelcoming to newcomers. Maybe this is essence of game.
2567	1	a	Such a good sequel it made me scream. Twice.
2569	1	a	certainly in my top 5 of the best adventure games EVER to exist that Ive played and I must have played possibly 100's in my 25 years of regularly playing adventure games. Its so good it has an uncanny way of transporting you in the game. You dont need virtual reality it does a good job of that alrteady. would be even more amazing to play though no doubt. It reminds me of amnesia the dark descent. Mainly in that though there are monsters you have no weopons in which you could defend yourself. I actually think its slightly scarier to play than amnesia.
2571	1	a	So much for thinking I could go through it straight faced. 
2573	1	a	Ghoul peenor. Ghoul peenor everywhere...
2575	1	a	Black Plague is an awesome game if you want to pee yourself! However don't get penumbra requium if you think there is horror in it, Black plague was good though, scared my nuts off at first, but with any survival horror game, i got used to it after a while.
2577	1	a	This sequal took 3 hours more then the last episode. It was really an awesome experince, 100% recommended to anyone who loves horror + puzzle solving.
2579	1	a	Penumbra: Black Plague picks up where Penumbra: Overture left off, but with a mild twist; you're playing as Philip from the first game again, but this time, the game is presented as a flashback. After discovering what became of Philip at the end of Overture, we find he has an entirely new set of problems to deal with, and as it turns out, they're much larger in scale. This time around, Philip is joined by a voice in his head that goes by the name Clarence, who simultaneously makes things feel a bit less lonely and increases the general menace of this new realm to explore.  Set mostly in an underground bunker of sorts, Black Plague is a welcome change of pace from all the rocks, rocks, and more rocks of the first game, but has equally ingenious puzzles and challenges to its predecessor, albeit with more modern tools and components at your disposal. This time around, encounters with enemies are a bit more frequent as well, and given the higher intelligence of the area's enemies, these encounters are also a bit more frustrating.  Despite being slightly more annoying and less looming-fear-based, Black Plague goes a long way toward explaining what's going on in Penumbra's setting, and what set off the events that drove Philip underground in the first place. The explanation for the primary force in motion is tied into real-world folklore as well, adding a tinge of realism to an otherwise fantastical situation and making it feel uncomfortably close to home.  Interacting with the world around you and the world itself both feel a bit more polished this time around, with visual upgrades to all your environments and a more responsive set of controls. Music in the game tends toward the ambient end of things and is well-placed, managing not to step on Black Plague's excellent sound design. While it seems to be the standard for horror games, do try to play this with headphones (or really good surround sound) to get the full impact of the audio, as it's clear they put quite a bit of work into it.  Included with Black Plague is Penumbra: Requiem, a puzzle-centric expansion of sorts that ties up a bunch of loose ends still dangling from the first two games while not quite being the third entry in the trilogy Frictional intended. Despite its short length, it's a good end to the series, and finishes the Penumbra games' slide from the real to the absolutely surreal.
2581	1	a	To anyone who has not yet played them, Frictional Games' Penumbra trilogy is a very appealing mix of thrilling horror and engaging storytelling that will capture you within its world and probably leave you pretty unsettled at various points of the games. By now, most folks have probably gotten desensitized from the large catalog of horror games that have been released since then, and any initial shock the games had (Overture and Black Plague) at their release has probably diminished due to the fact that the bar has been raised for how macabre and grotesque these horror games are being designed. So, to any survival horror fan wanting to give these games a go at this point in time, remember to look at these games as historical foundations for how survival horror games now are. Redefinitions of the genre, in my opinion.
2583	1	a	If you're looking for something different, look no further than the Penumbra series. In these games you are just a normal helpless dude trying to figure out the mystery behind what's going on in the story. Weaponless, you're forced to problemsolve puzzles and hide from your enemies. These games offer a very creepy atmosphere and a 3d interactive world. The ambient audio is what draws you in the most, so I recommend playing this in the dark with headphones or surround sound. The best one is Amnesia: Dark Descent. Give it a try if you're looking to take a break from shooters and use your brain.
2585	1	a	At first I thought it was going to be a first-person point-and-click so I got excited. But I soon learned the horrifying truth... that this would be a horror game! Environmental hazards, item puzzles, confusion, darkness and fear of the unknown... I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.
2587	1	a	Penumbra: Overture had rabid dogs sprinting towards you at high speeds in dark, musty mine shafts; Black Plague has plodding naked people with giant heads wandering around fairly bright environments and this annoying virus ghost thing that never shuts up instead of good old Red. Aside from several nice setpieces I wouldn't consider it a scary or tense game compared to its predecessor (the slower enemies and better-lit stages make running past them a viable option in places where stealth was intended), but as a first-person adventure game it is a fairly solid, good-looking experience that's aged well and worth playing since it's bundled with Overture.
2589	1	a	Man, the memories with this game. Remember picking it up on GamersGate quite some time ago, and loved the absolute hell out of it (90% of my playtime went into that version haha). It's not only an excellent sequel to Penumbra Overture, but it also manages to stand on its own legs as a really competent horror adventure game. Getting rid of the awfully clunky combat was a good idea, now this game focuses on hiding and evasion more-so than its predecessor. The game doesn't last very long however, so don't expect a grandious adventure like in Amnesia, but damn, the story might be short but it's a good one.
2591	1	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2593	1	a	Only play if you dont mind soiling yourself.
2595	1	a	I really enjoyed all 3 games, although sometimes the direction is vague it's a classic worth a playthrough. It's not Amnesia but a good series none the less.
2597	1	a	 Penumbra: Black Plague  is the second and longest official installment of the Penumbra horror epic. It begins immediately after the end of  Penumbra: Overture , with the protagonist, Philip, awakening in a locked cell, having been incapacitated by an unknown entity.   Black Plague fills in the sketch of the story begun in Overture, eventually unveiling the truth of the hidden facility disguised as a mine in northern Greenland, the method behind the madness of its inhabitants, both human and bestial, and finally Philip's father's dark secret.  The game far surpasses its predecessor in the vastly increased level of terrifying surreal elements: in Overture, I was mainly running from spiders, hiding from mutant wolves, and being stalked by a madman. By contrast, in Black Plague  I waded through pools of blood to manipulate monstrous forearms growing from the walls and was forced into hallucinatory visions by a foulmouthed mental hitchhiker while fleeing for my life from disease-infested monstrosities.    Gameplay-wise, Black Plague keeps the best aspects of Overture, and improves, refines, or discards the worse. All of the immersive, horrifying elements that made the first game an indie hit are maintained, along with environment-oriented puzzles and physical interaction via manual manipulation; Overture's clumsy combat mechanic has been completely removed in favor of more trap-based encounters with hostile creatures.   By modern standards, the game is a bit graphically dated, but the writing and the ambience were more than enough to keep me fully immersed ( and fully tensed ) as I explored the hallways of the facility and the dark passages of Philip's mind.  Penumbra: Black Plague is a psychological horror classic, and I recommend it to all fans of the genre.
2599	1	a	This is by far one of the best survival horror games I've ever played. The first Penumbra game was pretty good, the third was mediocre, but this one was definitely the best of the three. The atmosphere is chilling, the soundtrack is excellent, and the story is pretty interesting. I think it's mostly the soundtrack that made me like this game so much. The music that plays when enemies are around and/or are coming after you gives me goosebumps. It's that kind of music that you randomly remember in the middle of the night and become terrified, and it's those kinds of aspects that I look for in a good horror game. The only complaint that I have about this game is that there isn't any way to skip the dialogue that plays throughout the game (from Clarence) and sometimes it gets rather annoying hearing his voice every couple of minutes. For someone who is playing the game for the first time, I can understand why they'd want to hear the dialogue. However, for someone who is playing it again after having beaten it just to experience the atmosphere again, it gets rather old hearing his voice. Nonetheless, this is a fantastic game and is far better than any recent horror games I've played. If you're a horror fan, I highly recommend this game. You won't be disappointed.
2601	1	a	Love both black plague and overture, Requiem is like it but shorter without any enemies, considering how little your paying for all of this i see no reason to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about requiem. Playing them in order and in one sitting is the best way to do it, turn off the lights and enjoy. Should take 10-12 hours for all of them.
2603	1	a	This game concludes the first. It uses the same excellent mechanics system that I've fallen in love with and has a much more intriguing storyline to boot.  This time you come face to face with a virus and you get to play the events out as the virus takes over. I'd say that this was less scary than the first, but once again, there were moments when I was hopping out my skin.  I forgot to mention the puzzles in Overture's recommendation - They were clever, and Black Plague carries on the same style puzzles.   With this game you also get the 'epilogue' Requiem. I've been told not to think of it in the same way as the other two Penumbra's, but as its own game. Currently, I can't and therefore it was a touch disappointing, but once you've completed the main story you may as well see the epilogue of it, and frankly, I'm glad I did.
2605	1	a	Cool sequel. Cool story. 8/10  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVHAPkh_vjE  
2607	1	a	  Penumbra black plague was the best #1 horror game ever... THIS IS good.. and this is BAD with white graphics... useless. i bought the game for money
2609	1	a	Beautiful game, greater than amnesia only thing I find bad is that no custom story's are available but, this game came earlier so its just a seen from me :D anyway great game very good story and good feeling 9 out of 10Â°!
2611	1	a	I spent 11 hours on this one and 8 hours on Overture because I spent about a good 36 minutes hiding in one place...     GG
2613	1	a	So a quick 'review'. PROs and CONs first. Then some comments &amp; random notes I have about the game.   PROs:
2615	1	a	I really liked playing this but I was a little dissapointed in Requiem, nonetheless after all this time still very enjoyable!
2617	1	a	My hands are too cold to open that hatch. It's too cold out to take a tinkle-break. You'll have to open the hatch to take a tinkle-break, they said. But they were wrong. Very, very wrong. My Rating: 7/10
2619	1	a	Be prepared to have your mind BLOWN!
2621	1	a	I like the Penumbra series a lot because the atmosphere in the first two games is always haunting and scary. Another good aspect are the several puzzles that keep you busy, so it's not hiding and running away all the time troughout the game. There were moments, where I seriously thought 'What the hell?!' and some dicisions you have to make in the game, make you feel really bad/sad. I started playing Penumbra: Overture, the prequel, with low expectations, but the story had me drawn under its magic spell right from the beginning. For a low budget game, this game truly stands out of the crowd, it really deserves more attention. I highly recommend trying the Penumbra series for yourself.
2623	1	a	Run around holding a glowstick while alien-zombies with long curly dongs try to eat your brains while a schizophrenic crack-junkie inside your head keeps you company. Simply a masterpiece
2625	1	a	The second entry of the Penumbra series, Black Plague forces you into an even more disturbing and frightening situation than before. More puzzles and environmental hazards abound as you attempt to find your father and escape this forboding place, and the game gets much more difficult from there. Your ability to fight back had been lost, which makes your attempt to survive against un-dead-ish human beings and a gaint worm much more difficult. Your very psyche becomes a battleground in the game, making it an even more engaging and distressing experience. Much more horror and atmosphere makes this a much more enjoyable (if that is even a good word to use) than the previous Penumbra installment. If you like this entry, be wary of buying the next and final episode.
2627	1	a	Black Plague is the sequel to Overture where the story continues. Everything is pretty much the same as the previous game. Some slight improvements on puzzles. By improvement I mean slightly harder puzzles. Sounds and atmosphere still take you to the thrill factor. The main storyline unfolds here in the end. However, for me, felt like I was left hanging.   Same negative comments as before, AI are pretty lame and weapon handling still sucks the same.   Game definitely deserves to be played if you played the first installment.
2629	1	a	My hands are too cold to open that hatch. It's too cold out to take a tinkle-break. You'll have to open the hatch to take a tinkle-break, they said. But they were wrong. Very, very wrong. My Rating: 7/10
2631	1	a	I think that this was the best Penumbra yet in terms of gameplay and story development. The first game set the tone, atmosphere and story really well and ended excellently. This picked up from where the first left off and really took off- the experience was terrifying and yet so fun at the same time. Frustratingly, a bug prevented me from finishing it on my own computer.
2633	1	a	This is the game that changed the horror genre once and forever. It became the point of no return. This is indie low-budget game that influenced the industry up to AAA blockbusters. Outlast, Daylight, Alien Isolation, all these run-and-hide horror type games grew up from Penumbra and tried to evolve its mechanics in some way or another with no doubt. Nevertheless this game started it all, started so called new golden age of horror games.
2635	1	a	*installs game* *opens game* *snowstorm* *sees a metallic hatch* *goes in* *finds way to mines* *goes to office* *thinks 'no spooky at all'* *comes out from the office* *sees a dog* *closes the game* *cant sleep*  Gr8 m8 i r8 8/8
2637	1	a	Forget Amnesia, this is Frictional Games' underappreciated child that needs more recognition. Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Decent, this game brings more feelings of terror, two-fold the amount Amnesia had on me. In Penumbra, you cannot just run and hide from a situation to make everything okay, in most instances you are faced with a challenge to complete all while being stalked by a demon dog or infected crazies, which can be extrememly overwhelming. The storyline is intruiging, and the visuals are pretty good for a low-budget horror game. The monster AI can be a bit stupid at times, but it doesn't really take away from how terrifying they are. This is a game you will truly find yourself immersed in, and I would recommend it to any horror game fanatic (who doesn't already own it).  9/10
2639	1	a	  The most important fact here is Penumbra isn't a Amnesia game!     Originally posted by  Frictional Games :
2641	1	a	Ah, Frictional Games' first-ever. It's definitely a great horror game for beginning horror lovers. Its atmosphere is dark and menacing, and in general it functions well enough to be both a game and a trip through Hell. It's not too hard, and it's too traumatizing, either. It's a good medium for fun and scares alike. However, this is Frictional Games' weakest game, too. There is only one thing that truly spoils the horror and gameplay in this beauty, and if you don't know this, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, if you want to enjoy the game without spoiling the feel, don't read the following. This is only a gameplay issue which makes the game trivial if you know it. Again, if you do not know this game and have the slightest idea of playing it, you should not read the following:   The main enemy of the game, the undead dogs, aren't truly a threat at all. In all other of Frictional Games' games, monsters cannot be hurt and you are forced to avoid them. However, in this game, the only two monsters -- dogs and spiders -- can be killed. The spiders you are meant to kill; however, you are obviously meant to be stealthy and undetected by the dogs, but the problem is that you can kill them far too easily by simply stun-locking them with melee strikes of a pickaxe or hammer (which, somehow, do the same damage). In addition, they have bad hit detection, and you can sometimes kill them while standing on something just barely above their reach -- even a wall railing you can jump on. When you know how weak the actual horrors are in this game -- even on hard mode -- then all the stealth and threatening atmosphere that was intended for these dogs just becomes a face-mashing party.    In my first run through this game, I didn't know the above and I enjoyed the game well. However, after playing it a second time with the above knowledge, I got bored before even getting a quarter into the game because it felt no longer like a horror game.  In short: It's a great horror game for beginners if you don't advantage yourself with knowing a few of the game's functional faults. However, if you're already too familiar with such, then you should probably start with another of Frictional Games' better works.
2643	1	a	A really great horror game, but considering that it's pretty short (took me 4h to complete), you should get the sequel Black Plague at the same time. If you like Amnesia then this is definitely the game for you.
2645	1	a	My (very frightened) review:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJtX1P0OtGw 
2647	1	a	With this game, you will never have to buy laxative again! Or be bothered by dreams of extoci trips into the Arctic! (remember 3 things though: 1: turn off post effects, or you will have a white screen, without graphics. 2. set shader quality to Medium or Low, or for some reason the graphics look extremely ugly. 3. set contrast to maximum in your screen settings, or the game will be very bright at all times regardless of how low you set the gamma to)
2649	1	a	I don't allow my dog to come in my room after this game.
2651	1	a	One day I'll make it past the first enemy before alt F4ing and crying.
2653	1	a	Really good. This was my favorite of the first three games of the series. It has a good story, good atmosphere, some nice puzzles, had a good length and had a great ending. Definetly worth a try.
2655	1	a	Frictional Games Begins.  Penumbra Overture has it flaw and it really does feel more like an overture than an actual full game. But with that said Penumbra Overture is a solid horror game that should not be mist.  7.4/10 Verdict: The pickaxe is your best friend don't underestimate it.
2657	1	a	play penumbra or i'll let wild geese into ur room at night
2659	1	a	My recommendation: Try it/Get it on sale.  Pros and Cons:  + Great atmosphere + Interesting puzzles  - Small variety of enemies - Not as scary as some of the later games from Frictional  You play as Philip, a 30 year old physics teacher. After his mother's funeral, he receives a letter from his father, who has been presumed dead ever since Philip's birth. In his letter, he asks Philip to destroy certain cryptic documents, but out of curiosity, Philip decides to do some research and finds out the location of a mine in Greenland. He then goes on to investigate the mine on his own, which is where the game begins. Penumbra Overture is a blend of survival horror, psychological horror, and adventure game. You will solve puzzles to progress further, while avoiding and outsmarting enemies. While there is a combat system, the game encourages you to be stealthy and cautions. Combat is pretty clunky and ineffective, mainly because Philip is just a regular guy, not an action hero. Puzzles are interesting and done well, but I did get stuck once or twice (however, I was never good at puzzle games anyway).  What makes this game shine is its atmosphere, sense of tension, immersion and isolation. Mysterious story only enhances that, but since this is the first episode in the series, not much is explained. Most of the information comes from notes lying around the place, and you better read them if you want to get the full back-story of the area. In the terms of technical features, the graphics and sounds are solid and do the job, and the physics engine works well. Level design is decent, but since you are in a mine expect to see a lot of similar areas. Voice acting is not the best, but it's not cringe worthy either. Music is pretty good, it really keeps the tension going on and improves the overall atmosphere.  Because of the nature of the game the AI is not that complex and that's perfectly fine - enemies patrol the area and if they spot you, they'll chase you. My complaints would be that after some time, enemies started to annoy me and get in my way. Probably because the enemy variety is pretty weak - there are only three different types of them and two of them are encountered only once or twice. Also, I didn't find this game really scary, especially in comparison to some of the later games from Frictional.  Overall it's a solid game, worth your time if you're a fan of adventure games with horror elements. It does a good job of setting up the basis for the series.

2661	1	a	Reached the excavation level.  Two wolves saw and chased me.  Jumped on a crate, laughed in their face.   One of the dogs went up a nearby platform, jumped on me, knocked me off, then devoured me.  Sat there with a dumb look on my face.  9/10, would get outsmarted by dogs again.
2663	1	a	Back to 2006 where I first bought retailed version of Penumbra Collection.  Frictional Games started to release one of most intense/psychological horror first person game which become the trend for many FPS type horror. But what does, it's not about jumpscare. Penumbra introduces player with questions and goal of Phillip. Even there's no character development, the most the time each piece of his answer is revealed during playthrough. Overture still left many questions as it's first episode of series.  The solid parts of Penumbra are atmosphere and puzzle. Plain map designs but feels uncomfortable and hopeless. The puzzles play as major role of the game. It's fun, creative and encourage player to think outside the box and learn from environment. The combination of point-and-click with real time interaction are well executed. However, when it comes to combat the player don't have much choice beside guarding position and spam your weapon due to clumsy control.  Penumbra: Overture is small, interactive fun and left you with some intense moment and storyline. I enjoy everytime I picked it back in action.
2665	1	a	The first episode to Frictional's survival horror franchise that put them on the map. This series, much like Amnesia, is a true blue example of how horror is done in gaming, only this series gains points of not having an arbitraty sanity meter, but then loses those points for an awful combat system that thankfully, is optional half the time. The puzzles in the game are a nice relief from fetching â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly designed slabs of stone to be placed inside indentations in walls and are actually solved through common, real world sense, such as just plain smashing that locked chest open with a rock using the dynamic click and drag world interaction system. Finally, the story is compelling, and you'd be surprised how much you'll find yourself caring for the only support character you meet, even if he's just a voice over a battered old radio. If you're a horror fan and are sick of the uneventful â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that's passing for horror these days, you owe it to yourself to catch up on this series!
2667	1	a	Easy to beat, but worth it imo. I really liked the story, the script, and the creepy vibes that the; sound, graphics, and story gives off, which is almost all that matters to me in a horror game.
2669	1	a	I used to love dogs  Now I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hate them
2671	1	a	This series was a glimpse to the upcoming Amnesia: The Dark Descent. First part had a lot of thrilling moments throughout the game, good storyline and character movement. Loved playing this game and would recommend it! 8/10
2673	1	a	This series was a glimpse to the upcoming Amnesia: The Dark Descent. First part had a lot of thrilling moments throughout the game, good storyline and character movement. Loved playing this game and would recommend it! 8/10
2675	1	a	Scary but the 'monsters' aren'ts all that scary if you just go beat them up with a hammer.
2677	1	a	Story was great, atmosphere was scary-likeish and it had even better controls than Amnesia. LIked.
2679	1	a	buys game installs it plays it for 30 minutes gets mauled by a zombie dog avoids zombie dogs in a blocked of area zombie dog destroys the wall in player gets rekt walks around for 2 hours trying to find a password that was in the journal goes to ign guides and finds the password goes in the blocked area thats locked with a password gets killed by spiders and chemicals keeps trying to stay alive keeps dying gets a pickaxe kills all the zombie dogs completes the game 14/10
2681	1	a	I've started playing Penumbra, but the older I get, the more of a little girl I seem to become with horror games. I haven't completed yet, and I doubt I will, but it's scared the life out of me and done it's job well.
2683	1	a	I consider Penumbra: Overture to be one of the first 'true' horror games I've ever played. It fascinated me by taking an entirely different approach to the subgenre of survival horror, removing nearly all elements of violence or gore, while concentrating on a terrifying atmosphere and environment. Frictional Games manages to create suspense by solely focusing on the feeling of isolation and helplessness in a most hostile environment. Instead of just throwing one jumpscare after another at you, Penumbra plays with the fear of the unknown, and knows exactly at which time to strike. This combined with the puzzles and sophisticated physics engine ensure a perfect pacing between tense and relaxed parts. The music and sound design is remarkably well done for an indie game and can compare to genre classics like Silent Hill without doubt. Penumbra: Overture is a real insiders' tip for me if it comes to survival horror games, and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.
2685	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is arguably a prime example to the tired idea of 'It's not how much time, but it's what you do with it.' Throughout the 4 or so hours I took on this first playthrough, I experienced genuine fear as I crawled through the dusty abandoned mine that would set the stage for most of Philip's first chapter. It's not a stretch to call Penumbra: Overture a terrifying game. More terrifying than Amnesia: The Dark Descent and more on the level of Alien: Isolation, Penumbra: Overture makes you dread turning every corner for fear of a flesh-eating dog or deadly spider. The atmosphere is amplified by the well-told story and excellent sound design (especially the soundtrack). The gameplay is also done really well, aside from the half-baked combat system and few difficult moments (like the first spider cave). I will be coming back to Penmubra: Overture for years, but the atmosphere, story, and sound truly sell the game. It may be 5-6 hours long (maybe more depending on how you play), but it's a well spent time.
2687	1	a	Having recently played Thief Gold, I was surprised to find more similarities between the two. Philip isn't much of a fighter, but can sneak pretty damn well. The game manages to surround you with an desolate and eerie atmosphere, as you keep descending ever deeper into the complex systems of the underground mine. The puzzles can also offer a good challenge that will leave you satisfied once you crack it down and the documents, scattered about in the mine, are also fun to read to keep up with the story and your surroundings. The engine to interact with your surroundings is pretty unique, as well.  On the other hand, having heard that Penumbra is a massive scare-fest, it was a big letdown. The only semi-real scare you can have is when you meet the first dog and at the very end of the game, which is also quite abrupt and will remind you that Episode 1 is in the game title for a reason. Once you manage to dispose of a few enemies, the horror part really goes down. For most of the time, you are in complete control of the situation, you can work out the patrolling routes of the monsters and ambush them, instead of the opposite. You can also utilize the terrain and various objects to your advantage.  I would recommend Penumbra: Overture as a good atmospheric adventure/puzzle game, but not horror.
2689	1	a	Very spooky game. More spook than Amnesia. Very spook.
2691	1	a	This was an amazing game. First in the series, I enjoyed this game very much. I found that the graphics weren't all that great, but the gripping story made up for it. You play Phillip, unaware of his surroundings who decides to venture out and regrets his decision almost immediately.  I thought the story for this game was great, the audio was great and the general atmosphere of the game was phenomenal.   A great buy and a great series
2693	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a very very intresting, fun and immersive game.  If you liked Penumbra Black Plagu, Amnesia or horror games with more an aspect of exploration with the threat still there, you'll love it.  The best part is that if there are enimes around, the game makes it obvious. It allows the player to actually explore the enviroment!  9/10. Spiders are very creepy!
2695	1	a	I've never had so much fun running from dogs~!  Seriously though, you should buy this game. For this being the first horror game by Penumbra that I know of, it is really good. The combat is a bit weird, and may screw you over at times, but you aren't suppoed to be fighting the enemies to begin with. My favorite part about this game's combat is definitely how you're supposed to use the weapons, swinging your mouse in the direction that you want to swing the hammer or pickaxe. While there isn't much variety in enemies, just spiders in about two or three places while your main enemy will be the dogs, it is still fun to get past them. Your only companion in this game, Red, has dialogue that is amazing from how it can range from Metaphorgotten to just borderline insanity. Personally, I prefer the Penumbra games over Amnesia and am disappointed that the story to these games is finished, although I can see why. If you're into horror games with a side of puzzle-solving, you should get this game. The main menu music is also simply beautiful in my opinion.
2697	1	a	Penumbra Overture is an absolutly incredible game. This is the first installment to the Penumbra series and it's one of the best (right next to Black Plauge of course :P)   Rich in story: This game just makes you keep wanting to play it just to find out how the story pans out!  Scary and Heart Pounding: The Atmosphere is amazing, it's dark, creepy and mysterious. The game is also super heart pounding. When you're finally hidden from an enemy you just wish you never have to leave the hiding spot you're in to run from the terrifying creature chasing after you!  The feeling of isolation: The only contact you'll make with someone is through a radio to a character known as 'Red'. You'll never see another person, but you'll have the knowledge that someone else is in the same facility as you, and to get to that person is your final goal. It feels lonely walking around the facility, even with that final goal in mind...  I could go on and on but we'll leave it at that.  I give this game a 10/10 - my third favorite horror game and maybe even one of my favorite games in general!
2699	1	a	If you like Amnesia, this is the developer's first game and it lays the foundation for what came later. It shows in a lot of ways, but it is by no means a terrible game.  For starters, this is the only game Frictional Games has made that feature weapons and combat. This is a good thing, as Overture's combat is clunky and broken. Swinging requires you hold left click, pull to the left or right to prepare a swing, and then swing in the opposite direction to hit. The hit detection is very short-range and the swing area is small. However, the most commonly encountered enemies (dogs) are easy to kill as you can use boxes to stand out of reach of their attacks and simply stun-lock them with your weapon until they die.  The atmosphere is creepy, but all of the story is through notes and you never really encounter anybody else. Aside from some rare jump scares, there's nothing terribly scary because the combat AI is so laughably easy to manipulate. There are spiders in this game, which might make you freak out if you have arachnophobia.  Luckily, the game is puzzle-oriented and there are only a handful of areas full of enemies. Most of the puzzles are figuring out a process of doing something such as turning on a generator or determining a four-number door lock by translating it through Morse code. The Morse Code puzzle is probably the most difficult out of the bunch and merely requires a pen and paper (or notepad) to write down possible combinations; all other puzzles involve manipulating objects in your environment and following some written instructions.  The story ends on a cliffhanger in Overture, so it's recommended you ALSO play Black Plague, which plays much more like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has much better story presentation. Requiem is technically the third game in the series but is only tangentially related to the other two.  So if you're looking for a horror game that involves atmosphere and puzzles rather than focusing on combat like Condemned or Resident Evil, this is a good place to start. It runs on just about anything at a respectable framerate.
2701	1	a	Just finished this game again after all these years; since I first played it... And it's my first game to critic on this blog: Almost forgot how a survival-horror felt!   Penumbra: Overture is a stealth-based game with some horror and puzzle elements. The creepy atmosphere's well done with other elements like stealth mechanics and combat system. The game is linear (thanks to god), it sticks with its teasing story, makes you feel like a detective, an escape artist and a very vulnerable person (this last factor distinguishes you from being Bruce Wayne lol).    Game's short critic may be like these:  Graphics: 5/10 Sounds: 8/10 Story: Nice  Atmosphere: Gives chills My Playtime: Approx. 5 Hours   CONCLUSION: The game offered us something new, a unique trial practice and it came out well done. My note for it: 7/10  P.S. I'd suggest you to buy these as a pack and please play it according to chronical order like: 1. Penumbra: Overture 2. Penumbra: Black Plague 3. Penumbra: Requiem  Have fear and good luck!
2703	1	a	one of the best survival horror/puzzle games i've ever played, highluy recommended. it doesn't treat you like you're stupid and expects you to be able to read, use deductive reasoning and problem solving skills. has a very engaging plot and is sh*t-your-pants terrifying at times. just play it, it's great.
2705	1	a	It may be a bit old, but this game was outstandingly brilliant! Great story, brilliant atmosphere, and an amazing but eerie survival horror game. If you're a survival horror fan, then I'd definitely recommend it to you.
2707	1	a	This is the best dating simulation game in existence!
2709	1	a	This game does right where all the games that have been trying to copy the Amnesia formula do wrong. Granted that's probably because it's by the same devs who made Amnesia, before they made it, but still.  The atmosphere of the abandoned mine is absolutely fantastic, and combined with the music perfectly captures that feeling of being alone, and being watched. The puzzles are nice, you have to actually pay attention and think stuff out, and it doesn't delve into 'just spam every item in my inventory'. Another huge plus for me is the combat. Against more than one enemy you'll easily be overwhelmed, but if you get creative with your approach you stand a fair chance one-on-one, and it's a welcome change from the now-standard 'see monster, hide from monster, wait for monster to leave' approach horror games tend to use. Finally, the story, or more specifically, the main other character you interact with, is fantastically written, and if you get emotionally invested in your games like I do the twists near the end will hit you like a wrecking ball.
2711	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first part of Penumbra series, being called Episode One as back then it was planned to make Penumbra a trilogy. Ended up being a duology plus expansion pack. It's a First Person adventure game with horror elements and combat and it was made by Frictional Games in 2007. Yep, same people who made Amnesia, you should feel this one being similar somewhat.  Actually, one should note about Penumbra tech demo, which Frictional Games people created to show off their engine. It had similar plot intro as in Penumbra, hero wanting to find answer about his dad in a mine set somewhere in snowy lands, and then you wander around in dark industrial corridors. And then meet a somewhat cute monster who is like a mix of slug and bat. And then solve puzzle. And then in the end get lamely knocked out in a small room covered in blood. And well, it actually excited people enough for developers to consider of making a commerical game based on tech demo. After all, it used physics engine where you was the one dragging things around and being able to manipulate with more detail. Like, you grab a side of valve and then have to circle it around accordingly. And then horror games in First Person weren't widespread back then either. Oh, and people being spooked by the cut enemy.  As for how scary this is: Not much. It's not completely realistical and tame, but it doesn't try to screw with your brain with paranormal scares. It just sets of a really dark spooky atmosphere, but once you realize that whatever will be trying to get in your face is just a normal enemy, then well, you will relax. It still can scare you though, in the beggining. I think that game has enough for it going so even those who don't like being scared will feel it's worth playing.  And it does feel like a not-high budged episode one of series. It doesn't have much going for it. It's actually repetetive in how it's maze after maze, password after password, note after note. But at least it's still nice to explore and still has lenght of a fine game. Even if it ends on clear cliffhanger. And there are no models for any other human. Even though you will 'meet' Red. And may like that chap. Who is about as likeable as companion cube. And yea graphics are fine for that time. Does good work with shadows and lighting. Can be muddy. It actually has more than one light source. With one being infinite. Not to mentioning that a lot of areas are well-lit anyway that you don't really have to use them.  Yes, it still makes use of that physics engine, which was pretty nice at the time. Though puzzle-solving part of a game feels so disconnect from whatever horror premise. And it's not used as much as one would hope. But hey, it still gives feels. You can feel how heavy the box is when you are dragging it and can't lift it off the ground. Other parts of puzzles makes you combine items like in your everyday adventure game.  It also has combat and monsters. Or more exactly - dogs. They usually patrol the main parts of mazes and you find a few tools and items that are used on dogs. They are here to make you sneak and hide around corners of a maze, to make you afraid, with combat system that is clunky. But in short, it gets tedious really fast to go from one point to another point while hiding from them, so I would just murder them. It's actually extremely easy, you can exploit them. Or you can whack them directly and time it so they are pretty much stunlocked. So another flop.  But you know, back at 2007 it still was an unique First Person experience. And still is a good fun, even if weaker than the adventure horror games nowdays. Actually, I don't like being scared much, so I enjoyed just having a nice dark atmosphere, exploring and puzzling. Not to mentioning fine music and ambience. And fine pacing at times.
2713	1	a	The puzzles are challenging and the plot seems interesting. One of the best survival horror games I've played.
2715	1	a	This game was really quite a treat to play and had a lot of very subtle nuances to it. The atmosphere in general was very moody and held a lot of unease and anxiety which was really nice to see from a horror game. The game itself is not 'scary' but it's most definitely horrifying. The plot is also really good and I enjoyed reading all the notes and figuring out what happened to poor old Philip's father.
2717	1	a	Really excellent game. The combat is atrocious, but it's totally possible to sneak past any enemies without too much hassle. Great story, terrific immersion, and generally a really quality experience that puts you right in the shoes of the protagonist. Despite any graphical or gameplay issues, I had an undeniably good time playing a game that I really couldn't put down for more than a half hour at a time. Highly recommended, and I'll be moving on to the sequel as soon as I finish this review.
2719	1	a	This review contains minor spoilers, mostly of the beginning of the game.  Penumbra: Overture is a first person horror adventure game and the first part of the Penumbra series. You play as Philip, a physicist who teaches at university. After his mother's death he receives a letter from his supposedly dead father whom he barely remembers at all. The letter contains a key to a safety deposit box as well as the instruction to destroy everything that's in the deposit box. When Philip opens the box he finds several document and maps, some of which he cannot even decipher. The findings point to a location in Greenland though. So, instead of destroying everything Philip packs his things and leaves to follow the traces his father has left behind. After arriving at the location he manages to find an abandoned-looking mine.  Penumbra: Overture plays in first person perspective. The player can manipulate objects by clicking on them and then dragging the mouse accordingly. Doors and drawers are used in the same fashion. This system was later refined and used again in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you have played that one you have a pretty good idea how it works. Many of the puzzles are solved by manipulating objects in the enviroment. It is also possible to pick up various objects and pile them up to briefly block a door or throwing them as a distraction. Philip can also crouch and hide in the darkness - a skill that is very much required. While combat is possible I'd highly advice against it. There are only melee weapons available and those work in the same way as manipulating objects works. You have to actually swing them around using the mouse which is very awkward, difficult and therefore risky. The combat is the one thing I really dislike about the game. Luckily it is avoidable in most cases.  While exploring the mines Philip has to mainly rely on stealth and wits. As already said combat is very dangerous and in most cases not worth the risk. Also, there are certain enemies which are so massive that you cannot possibly hurt them in any meaningful way. So for the majority of the time Philip has to lay low, hide if possible and run if necessary. While staying hidden works most of the time there are some parts of the game where you have to get away as fast as possible. This really helps with spicing things up and making the player feel unsafe. Many of the puzzles revolve around manipulating physics objects but there are also some which revolve around finding information and acting accordingly. So you have to example figure out how to assemble an explosive charge, find all necessary ingredients (or substitutes), assemble the device and use it to clear a cave-in, so you can move on. There are several other puzzles which can only be solved by exploring the environment and gathering the appropriate information. Those are very engaging and reward the player with a true sense of accomplishment after figuring out the solution.  Penumbra: Overture features a really creepy atmosphere. You are all alone in the abandoned mines with no human being around but still it is obvious that people have been there until very recently. Whenever you apparently get really close to meeting another human being that chance is taken away from you, so for a majority of the time you can only rely on yourself and on the voice of a crazy sounding man who contacts you over the radio from time to time. While he sometimes sounds really nice he seems very unstable and probably not the person you want to rely on when it gets serious. Overall Penumbra: Overture does a very good job in emphasizing Philip being isolated in a hostile environment.  Penumbra: Overture is the first half of a two-part game (Penumbra: Requiem is rather a spinoff which does not directly continue the main story). The story continues and reaches its conclusion with Penumbra: Black Plague. Because of that you will not be able to figure out the whole backstory after having played only Penumbra: Overture. There are find several hints to find, though. While I think that Penumbra: Black Plague is even better than Overture, Overture is still a really good game.  If you like horror games and/or engaging puzzles this lesser known gem is something you should really try out.   More reviews  here 
2721	1	a	You'll Nervously Wonder  Penumbra: Overture; an eerie survival-horror bolstered with an excellent sense of atmosphere and accomplished physics.  Will you jump in fright? Perhapsâ€¦  Youâ€™ll enter mysterious hatches, open mysterious doors, and shine your flashlight into mysterious darkness.  As you play youâ€™ll nervously wonder if something might be down in the darkness with you.  What if you run into something?  If you do, will it be something that can kill you?  So youâ€™ll often crouch and hide in the dark from everything because youâ€™re actually scared.  Then something will make a sound nearby and youâ€™ll promptly fill your pants. 
2723	1	a	If you forget about Overture's awkward combat system, then this is a masterpiece. It has great puzzles and a creepy atmosphere. Definitely pick this up and its sequel, Black Plague.
2725	1	a	Penumbra is a Great EMO trip into the dfepths of unknown horrors, creepy normal looking object and horrific images, and suicidal thoughts of dispair. what makes Penumbra Great, it soaks you into the story and you do feel for the characters. how many games do that!!
2727	1	a	One of the best horror games I've ever played.  The sense of foreboding, atmosphere and SPIDERS combine to create a game you don't want to play, but can't help doing so.  Some really memorable parts (the ending sent chills down my spine)  Really impressive, and a textbook example of what can be achieved on a tight budget.
2729	1	a	You may like the Penumbra trilogy if you loved Amnesia. Same Lovecraftian undercurrents, but everything feels much less polished: awkward combat, bad puzzles, etc. Overture and Requiem are still worth it.
2731	1	a	An awesome survival horror game, though short. With the package of Black Plauge for 10$, it's work it. Only downside I could think of is rather low replayability and it only took me about 5 hours.
2733	1	a	Let me just say, this whole series has been my favorite game series of all time. Exept portal.   But for a game made in 2007 it still plays fine and looks ok.   Its made by the creators of Amnesia so you know the story is going to be good.  I recomend this game to an Amnesia fan or just a common person wanting a good cheap game to play.  Oh yeah, it only costs $10 for the whole collection.
2735	1	a	I tried playing Amnesia multiple times but was terribly bored and not sacred (though I could never last long enough to get to anything that actually happened I guess). I was afraid that Penumbra: Overture would be similar, but luckily it was not.  The graphics are not amazing by any means, but this almost just adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. In fact, most of the horror elements of the game are just by sheer creep-factor, suspense, and tension alone. The story and atmosphere do most of the work, but they do it pretty well.   Combat is a little difficult - weapons are melee-only and swing pretty slowly. Weapons movements are not very fluid, but once you get used to it it's not terrible.   Overall, it's worth playing, but know that you have to continue on to the next games in the series to get any sort of conclusion to the story (based on having just finished Overture, apparently the first in the series).  One thing though - a lot of the combining inventory items and figuring puzzles out seemed almost impossibly difficult. I don't use walkthroughs very often at all, but I did for the majority of this game, and I have no idea how anyone could get through it without a walkthrough. Maybe I was impatient, but I think I definitely would have simply stopped playing the game if I wasn't 1) brought in by how scary it was and 2) the ability to use a walkthrough - otherwise I definitely would have put the game down and wouldn't have bothered. It's just not the type of game you *want* to spend tons of time on - you just want to play it. Perhaps I should play through Amnesia with a walkthrough...
2737	1	a	Great game if you like tricky puzzled, I get so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off on this game yet I come back because I'm curious about the story.  Recommend that you play this before Amnesia serie, you will notice a huge bettering in the controls. Controls feels a bit tricky in Penumbra.
2739	1	a	I bought the Penumbra pack back when Jesus was playing full-back for Jerusalem and made a number of attempts to get into it, but it never really grabbed me for whatever reason. Years later, I found myself in the mood for something a bit different and thought I would take the opportunity to clear some of my backlog. I'm glad I did.  The combat system is awkward but you can make it work once you get used to it. The physics are good, and are implemented well into many of the puzzles you will come across. The graphics are solid, not amazing but they get the job done. The audio is fantastic, the skittering of mutant spiders and low growls of zombie dogs gave me goose bumps on many occasions. The story is ok, you will find yourself doing a decent amount of reading but it keeps you interested and steadily builds atmosphere. I played it on Ubuntu 14.04 and it did not skip a beat, it was probably one of the smoothest gaming experiences I have ever had.  I thought of it less as a horror game and more as an adventure game that scares the bejeebies out of you. Penumbra Overture is terrifyingly creepy, and I loved every minute of it.
2741	1	a	Ever since I played Amnesia for the first time I've become a sucker for good horror games. Don't confuse that with games like Resident Evil where you can just shoot everything and move forward I never felt that was scary. If you can fight everything that shows up than its not really that scary. Amnesia is the first game that I played where you are completely helpless. Hide or die is the motto.  Then I found Penumbra super cheap and got all 3 episodes for little over a dollar. I been meaning to play it for ages but now I actually am. Overture is the first episode in the series and while its not as scary as Amnesia yet its still pretty intense. Yes you can fight but combat is so awkward and clunky you want to avoid more than fight. Besides most of the monsters are unkillable so fighting them is just to stun so you can escape. The story is confusing and disturbing. This ended on quite the cliffhanger and I'm looking forward to continuing the series in Black Plague.
2743	1	a	A frightening, puzzling, enigmatic, but quite enjoyable game that will haunt you to the end.
2745	1	a	A good puzzle solving game with horror elements.
2747	1	a	It's likely most people played Amnesia first before trying this, and, going in, they will find a lot of very familiar mechanics. The crate-pushing, object-throwing, drawer/lever-pulling, and wheel-turning physics and puzzles were all here from the very start. And, for the most part, they work pretty well. 'Most of the time' because, well, there are times when it becomes a hassle, as they still hadn't a completely polished engine and had yet to implement features that would make things less hassling. There are quite a few doors, mainly the heavier ones, that can be fussy to open or shut, turning wheels is more of a pain here than what it'd be later on in Amnesia and, worst yet, no rotation function. You know those stacking puzzles that involved crates, barrels, planks, or similar objects of some variety you needed to use to reach certain areas? Sometimes they'd be in a position that made them not ideal for stacking, until you found you could hold 'r' and rotate the object around until they were optimal for climbing. Unfortunately, here, if you have to stack something (which isn't too often thankfully) it's a matter of throwing and bashing them around until they are positioned how you want them. So what is the 'r' key used for here, then? It's 'interactive mode,' which allows your cursor to move freely about the screen, turning off mouselook. A very useless function I'd say.  Now let's talk about your light sources. You have a flashlight which uses up batteries which you'll find occasionally lying around throughout the game, a glowstick which has unlimited use, albeit a slightly shorter range than the flashlight, flares you can throw to light the way, and even a weird sort of blue-tinted 'night vision' you get from moving around while crouching. So yes, light sources are near-endless, and considering that the game is actually fairly well-lit a good amount of the time, you likely won't find yourself using these often, even at the recommended gamma level (either 1 or 1.1 works). And when you DO need light, I found myself just using the glowstick. It suited my needs just fine without a flashlight and can be used infinitely, making the flashlight somewhat pointless. And that's another flaw, for a game that takes its namesake from a type of shadow, treading through dark places is hardly ever a concern, especially since you don't play a nyctophobic yet until Amnesia a few years later. Making light a more precious resource would definitely have given the game some edge.  So with light and darkness not being an issue, the main challenge of the game is navigating its large open spaces and avoiding patrolling attack dogs, with a couple other enemy types you'll encounter occasionally too. The dogs here are aggressive and persistent, and can even climb stairs (how about that!), so you either need to be very good at stealth, hiding behind dark corners and waiting until they walk the other way, or, if you want to take a riskier but perhaps in the end easier-on-you approach (since you'll be backtracking and wandering around a LOT, trust me), you can fight them off. This would be the first and last game of Frictional's to feature combat, and it's probably for the better. The game is notorious for having terrible fighting mechanics, and not without reason. Your main 'weapon' will be a pickaxe, which you use by holding down the left mouse button and swinging it in the direction you want it to go. The problem besides it being slow and awkward to pull off, is it's also imprecise, short-ranged, and of little help against your much faster opponents who will often attack in groups of more than one. There is a supposed exploit where you can just stand on a box and kill the dogs that way, since they cannot reach you, but I found they just avoided me altogether when I did this. What IS nice though is there is more than one way to take out an enemy. For one, you have explosives, such as the occasional dynamite to collect or plenty of pressurized gas canisters you can hit with a hammer or pickaxe, throw them over and cause an explosion (good if you can time them right), or just say 'screw it' and pick up a big heavy object like a rock or a barrel and repeatedly throw it at the enemy until they stop moving (I found myself using this tactic more than any of the others). Later in the game there's even an area where, if you're good enough, can trap a dog and blast hot steam in their face until they fall over. It's satisfying, but a pain, to pull off, so throwing heavy crap around may be the way to go.  The second most common enemy is the spider, and they perhaps are the most annoying by far. They are this game's 'tiny enemy that hops everywhere and is hard to hit.' Every game that wants to annoy you has to have one of these things, right? Like Castlevania and its stupid fleamen. Anyway, the spiders are a nuisance and you encounter them mostly in tunnels you crawl through, and since you're unable to run when crawling they are all the more aggravating. And they often come at you in packs! Very wonderful. Usually you'll see a batch of eggs where if you get close they'll hatch and hop right in your face. If you think you can just throw some dynamite in a nest to kill them, nope, that'll just hatch them faster. The enemy that will cause many a death and headache for the player. The last enemy you face (won't spoil it) is much, much rarer, cannot be killed, and is Frictional's first stab at a panic-inducing chase sequence, and it's executed well I have to say. You never see it coming, and there are at least a few things you have to do along the way to slow it down if you want to survive.  As for 'plot,' there's not much of it per se but you do gather a lot of background information through notes, a tradition Frictional would proudly continue onward after this, some listing procedures, a lot of them clues for puzzles, and some chilling accounts of some terrible events that happened and the last things written by the people documenting them. The actual story, followed with Black Plague of course, starts with you receiving a letter from your father, presumed dead 30 years ago, with instructions to burn items contained in a lockbox, which include a map and other cryptic documents. Instead of doing this you head over to the map's marked location, leading you to the mess you're in, good job! There is also one other character you communicate with (or, rather, he communicates with you since you never answer back) via radio transmissions named Red, who occasionally offers direction but mostly goes off on insane tangents (and as you find documents of his and read more and more about his plight you will understand why), the game's one truly memorable character.  The one aspect this game excels at I believe is in its puzzles. Not exceptionally difficult but thoughtful and logical, and some maybe more challenging than what's in Amnesia. My favorite is the explosive mix you have to concoct, and gently carry it over a precarious chasm, risking blowing yourself up if not careful. There is definitely a lot of 'put x item on y thing' inventory puzzles, some requiring tons of backtracking through confusing, repetitive maps with few landmarks, but on the whole it's all very well-executed.  Not a particularly scary game, a few moments aside (more under-your-skin creepy, which is still fine by me), and can be clumsy and frustrating in the worst of times, with the annoying combat mechanics, stealth and friggin' SPIDERS, with some dull map design and too much backtracking through them for my liking. But despite that is it still worth a go? I'd say yes, with its innovative designs, great background story if you have the attention span for note-reading, &amp; well thought-out puzzles and atmosphere. Recommended for Amnesia fans who've yet to play this and curious as to the company's start, and fans of atmospheric horror games in general.
2749	1	a	I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ myself. And you can go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself too! For only 8.99 â‚¬ (may vary), you can get a nice brownish line all the way from your zipper to your butt-pockets! A nice moist feeling and a funny smell; is what you get when playing this game! This game will, with guarantee, give you the time of your life - and might as well take it and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it nice and gentle.
2751	1	a	This is definitely the scariest game franchise there is, and this is coming from a guy who has been a fan of horror/scary games for a long time, i have played almost every horror game and franchise there is (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Clive Barker's, Fatal Frame, Condemned, Siren, Clock Tower, Alone in the Dark. System Shock, The Grudge, Cold Fear, etc...) and no franchise or game comes close to Penumbra, scariest one i have ever played for sure, the only game that could surprass it is Amnesia.  Overture is the scarier one
2753	1	a	Weird, completely atmospheric game. Combat is terrible, though, so do yourself a favour and avoid the more mandatory bits by renaming the dog files in your Penumbra steamapps folder.  A little clunky and odd, but completely worth playing, even if just to see how far the makers of Amnesia have come. Has some great sound effects as well as a surprisingly good story.
2755	1	a	Well Penumbra Overture Iam so happy to add this game to my horror collection it is among the most unique and satisfying horror game of all time the atmosphere is nothing short of brilliant and will have you squirming in your chair the whole play through. The game play is very unique and similair to Amnesia which by the way is one of my favorite horror games as well but penumbra takes a different approach when it comes to horror and builds the terror as you play with each moment and every solved puzzle bringing you further into the madness that is penumbra. 10 out of 10 a must have for horror fans.
2757	1	a	A bit spooky, and a bit puzzly! A quite short, but a very enjoyable journey!
2759	1	a	Yet another Horror Puzzle game at its finest. Grotesque creatures stalk your every move while you figure out which way you need to go, as well as solve any puzzles that are between you and your way out.  Frictional games don't disappoint in these games as they will always keep you on your toes, like a midget in a urinal. The only downside that I have seen is the crude combat that exists. Throwing certain objects, using a hammer to strike them, or just simply sitting on top of a crate where they can't hit you but you can hit them kind of takes away the helpless feeling that Amnesia has. However, the sequel to Overture pretty much elminiated this making Black Plague an improvement.  Overture is Part 1 of the Penumbra trilogy, and I also recommend playing the others as well (Black Plague and Requiem).  9/10
2761	1	a	Amazing! mind boggling puzzles with good mechanics make this game so special. The atmosphere in the game can also crush a persons mind very fast.
2763	1	a	Such a good game. I'd take this over amnesia any day. A little repetitive with the dogs following the same path constantly. And a very random placement of items. Occasionally getting so frustrating that you quit and come back finding it in an obvious place. Either way well worth the money spent. I think I'm going to play the second game very soon!
2765	1	a	I came to this game because I was so impressed by SOMA.   I can say now that the Frictional team are masters at creating an atmosphere of genuine terror and authenticity (when viewed through the lens of 2007 technology), emphasizing story and thinking rather than egregious violence.  However, by any standards, the gameplay is laughably bad at times. 'Combat' is either trivially stupid (tossing a can at a dog 5 times) or impossible (swinging a hammer at a spider). The puzzles range from simple to impossibly counter-intuitive. If you find yourself spending more than 5 minutes wondering what to do next, don't hesitate to look it up somewhere.   The story also leaves something to be desired. There seem to be several subplots woven together, but I saw no real arc or connection between the story's beginning, middle, and end. Maybe the dots are connected in the sequels?   Enjoy this game if you're interested in seeing the roots of Frictional's more modern work. There is also something to be said for it's atmospherics, horrific story, and historical value, but not much. Don't expect too much out of it as a game. Like SOMA, some elements of the gameplay actually chip away at the value of the overall immersive experience.
2767	1	a	Such a good game. I'd take this over amnesia any day. A little repetitive with the dogs following the same path constantly. And a very random placement of items.

2769	1	a	hey who's this guy - HGHJgasfjksdgfksdfg
2771	1	a	best horror/puzzle game ive ever played in a long time. Great story.
2773	1	a	Deep in the uncharted planes of northern Greenland lays an abandoned mine. You start out the game as Phillip, a physicist who got a mysterious letter from his father who has been dead for 30 years. In the letter are coordinates to an abandoned mine, so you decided to go check out what your father has been trying to hide since his death. Upon arrival, you find yourself alone, scared, and   defenceless  . As you explore the mine, you decend deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Earth. Along the way, you slowly start losing grip on what is and isn't reality. I would give   Penumbra Overture   an 8/10. This game has a really great atmosphere and setting. The main down side to this game is that it can be a bit buggy from time to time, but 90% of the time it runs perfectly.
2775	1	a	This game, took me 7 hours and 36 minutes. And all of it, was amazing. On to number 2!
2777	1	a	Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.  Penumbra: Overture is the 1st game in the series. It's decent, but has some rough edges and doesn't quite come together fully.
2779	1	a	Great atmosphere and story.
566	0	a	The game largely forces you to do combat with dogs and spiders, a generally unscary but annoying experience given the horrible combat controls. Avoiding them was suggested, but enemies are not anywhere near scary enough to warrant hiding. Amnesia's Grunts and Brutes always warrented hiding, a big difference. Small amounts of steam coming from pipes should never be used as an environmental killer. It feels wimpy to die to it. The puzzles are too short and easy. Honestly the game feels like a chore. Going to give Black Plague a shot after this. Currently considering Overture as Frictional's warmup attempt at a comercial horror game. Amnesia was stellar though.
2781	1	a	Very scary game
2783	1	a	The original Puzzle Horror game from Frictional games, Penumbra: Overture is the start of a trilogy to remember. I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent first (having learned of it through youtube hype back when it was first released), and then when I found myself craving more and searching on Frictional's website, I came across this gem. There is a free demo of this game available from said website, and I recommend playing that if you want a taste of the game before you buy. It is very much like Amnesia TDD, although in a slightly brighter yet just as grim underground mine. The atmosphere is eerie, and the story is captivating and can really make you emotional at points (it did for me, anyway). I definitely recommend this to those who want horror games that play like Amnesia: TDD. Or, for those who are just discovering Frictional's work, Penumbra:Overture is a wonderful place to start.
2785	1	a	Amnesia if it was a bit less polished and had more physics puzzles. Overall fun but I'd be sure to buy the trilogy because it ends on a cliffhanger.
2787	1	a	so lik in ths gam u r so pro mlg swagr pro tht is acrkeyolojist and u figt big wirm an tri 2 solv mistery. 99999/10 wuld plai entir serie again. I swr u betr biy this gam an thn pik on friktIonul gam becuz they suk an wont mak nue penembra gam omj wth
2789	1	a	If you stay and read every note you pick you will see that this game has an wonderful story line. I would recommend this game to everyone.
2791	1	a	Awesome game! Must buy X3
2793	1	a	Really cool horror game, makes you feel really helpless and unable to defend yourself (until you get the pickaxe at least).  10/10
2795	1	a	Weapons, yay- oh wait, theres giant â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing worms.
2797	1	a	Just like Black Plague, this game deserves a spot in every horror fan's heart. As this is the first game in the series, I'd suggest to start with this one. I also like the Penumbra games way better than Amnesia as I think that the story has more depth to it. Enjoy!
2799	1	a	Amazing game if you like a good horror game once and a while this is the game for you, Freaking awesome story, Scary dogs that try to kill you Black plagues zombie things were better though. just get this game NO get the full pack which includes all three of the penumbra games, why are you still reading this go look for the collection pack!!
567	0	a	TL;DR - Starts strong, good atmosphere but quickly becomes repetitive. Some great puzzles, but most are frustrating, and don't seem to make much sense. Worth a play if you're buying the whole collection. Not worth a buy on its own.  This is a hard game to review because it's one of those in between games. I don't want to thumbs it up, but I don't want to thumbs it down. The first couple of hours of the game were pretty good, the build up and atmosphere was done really well. But when it got into it I wasn't scared throughout the entire game which is kinda disappointing. I think it's due to bad AI; once I realised with the dogs you can just stand on top of a box and beat them to death they no longer became any sort of threat. The game very quickly became boring and repetitive as each section of the game is pretty much the same. Big area leading to smaller areas, guarded by dogs with some sort of puzzle to solve to continue. That was pretty much every area in the game.   The puzzles in the game are hit and miss. There was a puzzle fairly early on that involved Morse code and the way the game got you to solve it was excellent, I felt like a complete genius after solving that. It wasn't a frustrating puzzle, took a little while but solve it. But then most of the other puzzles were absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Later on in the game you grab 6 chemicals which you are supposed to mix in some sort of order to create something (I'm trying not to spoil anything best I can). Right, and literally nowhere is there any clue in what order to mix them. I'd grabbed all the notes and everything, read carefully, and couldn't work out anything. So, I passed the puzzle by trial and error. Mix this with this, nope. This with that, nope. 5 mins later... Yay I solved it!?   Also, there is this really annoying worm creature that you occasionally run into where you have to run away and escape from right. Well, it's one of those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ chases where it's literally impossible to solve first try. You have to die, get a little further by working out what to do, die again. Progress more than you did but die again. Until eventually you know exactly what to do to get away from the creature.  The way I see it, if you're going to buy the whole package of the games, then it is worth a play. I wouldn't recommend buying this to be honest, or at least buy it in the sales.
2801	1	a	this game was about me telling my dad that Saving Private Ryan was an overrated movie. He stormed off to Greenland and hacked me. My dad found out about the word 'noob' and he likes to call me that now. I get texts from him saying 'Hey. Noob. Hahaha' yes dad you're a comedian straight from 1999. Wanna play Quake?? Imbecile trash.
2803	1	a	Amazing game if you like a good horror game once and a while this is the game for you, Freaking awesome story, Scary dogs that try to kill you Black plagues zombie things were better though. just get this game NO get the full pack which includes all three of the penumbra games, why are you still reading this go look for the collection pack!!
2805	1	a	Takes about 4 - 5 hours to complete (Atleast for me.) Great horror game, maybe in the best I've played. It comes down to this and Amnesia, both made by Frictional Games. I'd recommend both.
2807	1	a	Okay,yes,this game is old - well,lets not say 'old',lets say,it's a 'classic'...yeah thats it ,this game is a classic and for a classic,I've got to say its still a great looking game ! In my humble opinion,this is one of a handful of games that has deeply inspired a lot of the present day games of the genre. . . The game has an overall atmosphere of dread. . . It does a wonderful job in the fright department without resorting to cheesy,un-needed jump scares and gore. . .  We play as Phillip,a 30 yr old man searching for his presumed dead father. . .Phillip talks to us throughout the game and the voice acting is above par I think. . . The story unfolds by way of notes and letters,journal enteries and our own thoughts,voiced again,by Phillip and Red,that talks to us over a PA system and walkie talkie. . . I need to say something about Red (no spoilers) ,he is stupid-funny ! ! I sat at my laptop and honestly laughed out loud so much from what he says to us ! ! Don't get me wrong,Red is an annoying butt monkey,but he does it with humor or at least I think so. . .  The game is set in Greenland in an abandoned mining research/living facility and,like I mentioned earlier,we find various notes,journal enteries,research papers and so on. . . And thats how we find out what the hell happened to all the people that used to be there,including Phillips father,where they went,why they went there and just what in the world could have gone oh so wrong that they're all long gone. . .  There is lots to do,explore,learn,find,solve and run from. . .We even get to do a little killing,but the controls for the combat system are somewhat sucky and should be avoided if at all possible,except when you absolutely have to and there are times you have to.  So,in my opinion,I must say I really loved this game and it had a story that I was invested enough in,that I thoroughly looked forward to finding the next clue so I could advance the story and find out all of the who,what,where,when and whys . . .  I 100% recommend this game and the rest in the series,as they only improve upon what I think is a great story. . .  I give this horror/survivor game an 8/10,   Happy Gaming Everyone !!
2809	1	a	solid game gave many spooks 7/10
2811	1	a	The game ends in a cliffhanger. It is very clear that this is episode one, as it is stated both in the menu and by the main character in the end. Still, it's a very good game and I'd say it almost works as a 7-hour length demo of the Penumbra: Black Plague.  The story of a man seeking for his father in some vast and deserted area with mutants has been seen often before, but I think that Penumbra's story isn't concentrated on the things you hear from the main character, but instead hidden inside the articles and letters you find throughout the game.  I don't have a lot of time to analyze the awesome athmosphere or the great ending this game has, but I can say that this is a very considerable purchase. I haven't played Amnesia (yet), and this is a very good introduction to the Frictional Games' view of physics and story.  I recommend this title.
2813	1	a	Ok, after so many years I was finally able to play the whole chapter. I am very sensitive to horror games....I was never able to go past the first levelm, I tried many times and I always stopped. Once I got used to the 'fear' system of the game, the game stopped being too scary for me and I started enjoying instead of seeing it as a torture (this is a message to the chicken people like me who are scared by such games).  Anyway, the game is cool enough. First of all, keep in mind that this is a Chapter. The game has no end, it is a cliffhanger ending so if you are one of those (like me) that hate unfinished things, keep in mind that even if you don't like the game so much, you will have to play all three chapters (overture, black plague, requiem) to see the end of the story.  This chapter is quite short (6 hours are enough). Puzzles are nice, physics serve well that purpose. Graphically it is pleasant. Sounds is also still good enough for today's standards and controls are interesting. Can't say about the story because I have to play 2nd and 3rd chapter yet, but what can I say....so far so good ! 75/100
2815	1	a	Hit a dog with a hammer. 10/10
2817	1	a	A great game made by Frictional Games. A good story line and graphics.
2819	1	a	Is that their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? How would you react if someone chased you with his â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out? Just keep running! ;)
2821	1	a	This is the first of a trilogy made by the makers of Amnesia, so if you've played Amnesia then you will find pretty much a lot of similarities from that franchise in these games in a more modern day scenario (amnesia was set in the middle ages, this is modern, so instead of a lantern with oil, you have a flashlight with batteries, although you also have a glowstick with unlimited power, but obviously not as powerful as the flashlight) with a somewhat interesting (and honestly confusing) storyline. If you're looking for a single player game that is cheap and will have you thinking to solve puzzles and that you'll play around 10 hours on (in each game) I recommend the Penumbra trilogy!
2823	1	a	the overture is the first game in penumbra series and its also first game by frictional games and you can see its their first game  story-you go into the mine where you trying to find something that leads to youre characters father because he probably did some research and something screwed up,and then he dissapeard (i guess)  along the way you encounter youre only enemy in this game........Dogs.......zombie dogs. yeah and then there is a giant worm but he wont chase you throghout a whole game so whats the point but lets talk about zombie dogs.who the hell thought they will be good enemies?! if you kill them they respawn but even with that theyre not good enemies.youre always quicker so you can lose them and if you will see dead end ahead of you,well dont worry just throw stuff at them they will stop.God even spiders youll meet are more terrifying.  thats not the games only flaw.youll might love the envoirment of the mine but me...well im sorry but it was quite boring envoirment,it felt all the time same for me  with that what i said you might think i hate the game but actualy i think its quite decent. puzzles are decent and made me think for a while and even though i said that enemies sucks,atmosphere is really great and it actually feels like a horror the story isnt the best but also not the worst  to sum up the game is decent but ill rather reccommend playing second one because i think that second one is better but if you want to know what happened in the begining go ahead and play it.its quite short so even if wouldnt like it you can end it in less then 3 hours   not bad start for frictional games  6,5/10
2825	1	a	Pretty much the same as Black Plague, but less content. 7/10
2827	1	a	Started playing the game with some nicely done exposition about a strange mine in Greenland or something? The bugger I was playing as was stupid enough to go there alone and I ended up trapped in that same mine. Spooky ghosts were making noises and whispering into my ears.  Then I found a doggy in the mines and it tried eating me and at that very moment I broke my ALT and F4 keys.  11/10.
2829	1	a	very atmospheric, however after you realise the limits of your enemies it does lose some of the suspence
2831	1	a	Full of surprizes, and many puzzles involved within a survival time!
2833	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the little baby of the horror-game 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent'. If you like horror games, buy it.
2835	1	a	I had braught this game because i had seen some of it on youtube, much to my surprise i got all 3 penumbra's. Obviously i wanted to play them in order, so i started up the first one. it told me i had to enter in a special codewhen the game had started up, then i was told to enter a code when prompted. i was never prompted to enter a code and the game wont play... any i deas of how to help???? (i would recomend this game because it looks really good and thats just how i am)
2837	1	a	I finished this game some time ago I think late 2013. Yes it took me 6 years to finally play this and when I did I was so glad I played it, this is the precursor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and it's really nice to go back and see the evolution of Frictional's horror games and how they did so well with Amneisa. Anyways this game is really good while it is not amazing in terms of horror it really stands on it's own. There are no incredible grotesque monsters to hide from and the creatures you do encounter can be dispatched with weapons found, the puzzles are incredibly simple and the atmosphere does well to put you on edge.  Overall I think this game is deserving of the attention of all horror fans and I highly recommend you play the others in the series too.
2839	1	a	Really good story I have to say. I played it through and I enjoyed. Join to journey and play Penumbra Overture :).
2841	1	a	Nice game! I love it 8/10
2843	1	a	You will never hit a spider in this game.
2845	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is one of the best adventure/survival horror games I've ever played. The only real flaw with the game is that the weapons are pointless and the game would be better without them, and this mechanic was rightfully removed in Black Plague and Requiem. The story is Overture's greatest strength; you are thrown into a world of mystery, and the game does everything it can do build up atmosphere. Overture focuses on fear of the unknown, which works very well for it since most of the questions brought up would be answered in the later games.   Overture is my favorite of the Penumbra series and is my second favorite survival horror games of all time (only to Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.) I whole-heartedly recommend it, as well as the other great Penumbra games.
2847	1	a	A great indie survival horror adventure that'll have you squirmin in your seat.  Extremely under appreciated this game has a lot to offer in overall creepyness and atmosphere.   Add in a story thats actually interesting, good grahpics, and some good story beats to keep you moving along and I'm happy I picked this up.   Probably easy to find it dirt cheap.   Highly recommended to fans of the Amnesia or Slenderman games.
2849	1	a	this game is 2spooky4me
2851	1	a	...it may be a quickie, but the interesting story, creepy atmosphere, and complex puzzles make for a great little horror game. Although, if you're going to play, be sure to grab the next two installments because this one will leave some questions unanswered. I can't wait to dive into Black Plague!
2853	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a first-person game about Phillip (the player) who ventures into an abandoned mine in search of his father. The game takes a dark turn when Phillip is trapped and forced to survive the horror of the mines while looking for clues.  Overture is only slightly scary in my opinion, but that's just fine. It's more about survival, and is incredibly realistic. What it lacks in scariness, it makes up for in realism.  For example, the main enemy is packs of demonic dogs that stalk the player. You can fight them, but it's hard. You aren't a superhero, and you can't just click to swing your instrument of destruction over and over. You have to time attacks carefully, and swish the mouse in the direction you want your weapon to swing.   Another example is the physics engine. Like Amnesia, you can pick up/throw/push almost anything by cicking on it and dragging the mouse in the corresponding directon. You feel like you're really there, like your character has wieght and realness. This makes the game totally immersive, and really heightens the 'survival' aspect.  You'll have to solve puzzles and escape monsters all the way through while feeling helpless and alone--so it perfectly captures what the survival horror genre is about.   The mad rantings of your only friend, Red, wrap it all up. Red is wonderfully voice acted and his insanity is creepy, eerily setting the mood.   If you want a dark, macabre, realistic, true survival horror game that doesn't pull punches or hold your hand, Penumbra: Overture is it. 10/10.
2855	1	a	Classic. Loved it.
2857	1	a	Dog and spider wacking simulator.
2859	1	a	Builds a great sense of horror through simple design choices; no weapons, complete isolation, and immersive atmosphere. A survival horror game that requires a lot of forethought and skill to actually survive. Very unique experience with great puzzles and a story that continues straight into the sequel, Black Plague. If you're looking for something to scare your pants off for a few evenings then this and it's sequels are worth getting.
2861	1	a	whoa it's a giant worm in a giant cold â™¥â™¥â™¥ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cave and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
2863	1	a	 Penumbra Overture , the prologue of the series, sets the atmosphere for its sequel, as you are put in Philip LaFresque's boots who decides to take a trip to the desolate northern Greenland, after receiving a post-mortem letter from his father. As expected, this experience will turn into a nightmare for Philip as he will find out more than he would have ever wanted or imagined.  The game has a nice pacing as it progressively introduces you to new elements in its story and gameplay, making it an enjoying and not time-consuming horror survival experience. We can also notice this early Frictional Games' passion for creating a good story, riddled with a deep psychological theme (even more noticeable on its sequel).  A true classic of the first person horror survival games. Revolutionary. Unsettling. Recommended.
2865	1	a	Before SOMA or Amnesia, there was the Penumbra trilogy of horror games made by the same creators, Frictional Games. Penumbra may have been the first but it doesn't disappoint even to this day. Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
569	0	a	Play Amnesia instead.  This game plays exactly like what it is: Frictional Games' first shot at a full video game. The horror, atmosphere, and story elements are as good as always, but there are additions to the game that just make it worse. 1) The AI is terrible. 2) Being able to attack/defeat the monsters takes away from the horror.  Their later games keep all of the good parts of this game and remove all of the bad.
570	0	a	Short Review Incoming: PENUMBRA OVERTURE the first installment of the Penumbra series is a good horror game. The atmosphere is amazing and really eerie. This and the sound-design is what makes this game for me. It's creepy without any kind of disturbing imagery or jumpscares. On the other hand: The gameplay is rotten â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The puzzles are not really well thought through and most of the time you have no clue what to do. And the combat... OH boy the combat. It's dreadful. Hit detection seems like it's non exsistent in this game. It isn't really fun to play.  I would say skip Overture, read a plot summary and start with black plague which is a much better game!
571	0	a	This is the first of the Penumbra Series.  I was an avid fan of Amnesia: the Dark Descent, and wanted to try another Frictional Games piece.  This game is somewhat disappointing.   Without giving away too much of the story: - There is only one or two types of enemies during the entirety of the game, making their patterns highly predictable and once you find a way to exploit their terrible AI, they fail to present any challenges.  - The story is written as if an edgy teen indie team created it. The story must be intentionally vague, as (SPOILERS) the ending literally finishes with 'to be continued.' As a player, you never actually know what's going on. Sure, you know where you are and that you want to escape and how you got to where you are: the basics. The more you play, however, the more unanswered questions you end up with. - I want to give this piece the benefit of the doubt and consider the entire series in my review; perhaps the second and third games answer all of these questions and creates a fantastically crafted story. Unfortunately, the first game alone does not produce that faith in me.  Although the game is an older 'classic,' the story and mechanics are ridiculously simple, repetitive, and ultimately boring. Perhaps after the other games, I will feel better about the series, but this game is not worth playing alone.  --EDIT--  The remainder of this review is after I have completed the second game - Black Plague I will reserve my criticism for that specific review, but because the sequel answers many questions and is a good game, Overture is a necessary evil for the means of continuity in the series. Long story short, Black Plague is far better than this game, but you should play this too for the best effect.
2867	1	a	Okay, so the best thing about this paranormal/survival horror game is the one thing many games out there don't have and which is my biggest peeve: ENVIRONMENTALLY INTERACTIVE. Yes, Finally, a game designer had a brain. I hate when there are things in the room and they are just made to look pretty and not be messed with, like part of the building's structure. If you see a book, you can pick it up. If you see a mattress, you can toss it, use it for a puzzle, launch it over a cliff. Glass can be broken. Hell, throw a barrel at your enemy and watch him stumble. How control how you pick it up and where you want it to go, Go play jenga with barrels and bags of garbage. XD  As for that, the rest of the game is very enjoyable in a very dark and strange way. The lighting, the atmosphere, the game dynamics. Very nice. Never had an issue with the game, including gameplay, puzzles, exploring. The game's sequel Black Plague is also just as enjoying, but not so much as the expansion Requiem.  I highly recommend this game.     NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.
2869	1	a	Just play it ... srsly
2871	1	a	has a hammer 10/10
2873	1	a	Sometimes confusing, sometimes too scary
2875	1	a	this game is mediocre
575	0	a	GAME HAD PROMISE UNTIL THE TWENTIETH LABYRINTH FILLED WITH DOGS AND SPIDERS LOL
576	0	a	I know this now comes as a pack and can't be bought seperately so to not play it would be wasteful, but in my honest opinion Black Plague is far better and this doesn't have much worth in playing except for experiencing the lead up to how the second game starts.  This is because after only maybe an hour in everything becomes quite repetitive while nothing much happens story-wise either except for three short excursions that were fairly interesting but buried within the repetition. *edit* [Hardly a spoiler/Not a story spoiler]:  After the encounter with the first monster, they become annoyances that are tiring to deal with. If you're looking for the adrenaline rush of scary encounters, you'll get maybe two out of this.   Also, for the most part, what happens in the story in this game is explained in the second game. What you do get is more insight on a particular character and of course more notes to read. The ending felt quite underwhelming.  What I will say that I enjoyed more in this game is that the notes you find are much more helpful (and usually necesssary) to your progression compared to Black Plague which means there's less of a feeling of 'I have these useless notes that I could read but I'm not that interested in'. However, the puzzles are also sometimes just a matter of wandering around which detracts from them.  To conclude I wouldn't say you should definitely avoid this game, but that it provides a lot less than Black Plague does in almost every aspect. I feel that skipping this game improves the quality:hour ratio and you don't miss a lot by doing so. If you do decide to skip it and then feel interested in coming back to it, by all means. There are a few sections that are worth playing.
577	0	a	It'd probably be a good game if it didn't stutter like crazy when walking+looking simultaneously. How disappointing. A potentially good horror game... ruined by broken controls. Black Plague is also plagued (lol). Wish I could get a refund. If Frictional Games would somehow patch the game, or come up with a remastered edition, I'd gladly give it a try.
578	0	a	Control method sucks. In this game you don't hold objects they kind of hover below your hand. After about 30 minutes of trying to open that fecking hatch in the snow I gave up out of frustration as the rock kept dropping willy nilly and I was not able to control its height or position with any accuracy. Why do developers have to mess with tried and true control methods i.e. grab something and securly carry it until needed. Oh and make use of the laws of physics and allow you to throw or drop an item with at least a little accuracy. Just....frustrating.
579	0	a	Crashing Loading... Screen :D And All system Reuiements have!:=O Can U fix this :-X
580	0	a	I really wanted to enjoy this game, and the others in the series, but I can't. I like the mechanics and the atmosphere, but there are too many issues in the game fore me to find it enjoyable. The puzzles are extremely obnoxious, and I found myself running through a maze over and over again trying to find the last item for something to move on, and it just lots its charm with frustration. I'd like real puzzles, not an I-spy type game. I don't know, I think it is more or less a good game, but I've got issues with it.
581	0	a	Penumbra series are quite good games in general. THey are a bit old but the story and adventure part of it is done quite well and is engrossing to a degree. The puzzles and quest are quite well done though a little illogical at times and can be monotonous, but overall they get you thinking.  The horror side is mehhhhh! The game is predominantly in the dark and the creatures are from a B grade horror from the 50's but it does set the mood at times, especially with the audio effects etc. The graphics are very ordinary compared to modern capabilities but for the time they were okay. The AI of the dogs etc is appalling and quite comical but again its primarily due to the era of the game. The part that kills al these penumbra games is the controls. Its beyond bad. They tried to be clever and realistic by making the use grab item and swing in an arc to open boxes and doors, or try to line up items using the mouse but overall kill the game.  You cant actually line any thing up so when trying to smash one of these crazy wandering brain dead dogs you end up doing the cha cha and relying on pot luck. Luckily as stated the AI is near non existant so simply get on a box etc and just swing and mash buttons and eventually the job will get done. Its a pity really because I was getting into the game itself but it just gets frustrating and unplayable. It would be great if they ever revamped the series as it has the making of a good game, but unfortunately I think this game is long forgotten. If u can pick it up cheap and have the patience of a saint when coming to control etc then I'd say you could do a lot worse. If its a action adventure your looking for then give this a wide birth! Steam should put a star system as I'd give this game 2 to 2 and half stars out of 5, but can not recommend for most people. 
2877	1	a	was fun and scary, i beat it.
2879	1	a	10/10
582	0	a	The torrent version works better than this, it keeps crashing after this one bit and everytime I exit the game it changes my monitor brightness to the max, It's like a constant flashbang had to turn my pc off and on just to fix it.
583	0	a	Penumbra Overrated. The atmosphere is great, the puzzles are ok and the enemies, plot, and stealth elements fall flat.   This is not a spooky game. The atmosphere builds it up to be, but disappointing enemies and trial and error game play takes all that away. Your enemies are guard dogs &amp; spiders, and very rarely a big worm thing, that's it. Some supernatural or especially fierce enemies could have added a lot of tension, but nope, just doggies. If you were dropped in the middle of the game with no explanation you would probably guess you were playing a poor wolfenstein clone.  Certain parts of the game are only possible to complete by reading a walkthrough ahead of time or by dying over and over until you determine the correct sequence of events (especially the rockworm at the end). This repeated trial and error type game play replaces any feelings of suspense with ones of frustration.  The plot starts off strong and mysterious, falls a bit flat in the middle and leaves with a confusing ending. This game had potential but at the end I was glad I had finished it just so that i can say i beat it and don't have to touch it again.
2881	1	a	The spooks are real.  'Like Amnesia, but underground. 7/10' - IGN
2883	1	a	If you like Amnesia you will like the Penumbra series EVEN BETTER!  Just trust me on this one. It's scarier at times, the puzzles are a little harder, and there is just such a fantastic story that goes along with the series.
584	0	a	It's too slow. I couldn't bear playing it long enough, just because it was just too slow to move on.  It has atmosphere though. If you're into point and click adventures it's probably for you, but I don't recommend it.
585	0	a	Impossible to play. Fully updated drivers and thoroughly researched how to fix this but the game crashes upon launch. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you
586	0	a	OH HAI WE HAVE A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ AND COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE 2007 UI, LET'S MAKE ALL OF OUR PUZZLES EXTREMELY COMPLICATED!!!!!!!!  NONE of the puzzles make any sense. Every single different one I have had to use a walktrhough BECAUSE the interactions with items are NOT PREDICTABLE AT ALL. Sometimes you can pick up shovels, but in the next level you cannot. Why? I don't know, probably because the makers of this game wanted to make all the puzzles complex, but had to save space. I do not recommend this game for anyone who does not enjoy having to use walkthroughs and tear out their hair trying to figure out â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ levels. I've been stuck on a level for THREE WEEKS. This is absolutely ridiculous.   Don't make your puzzles so complex and elaborate IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FORM OF STABILITY IN THE INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR ITEMS, JESUS CHRIST.
2885	1	a	This game is not that scary, But it seems to be full of puzzles and stealth. I cant wait to finish it! If you want more jumpscares, Black Plague is for you.
587	0	a	this game sucks
588	0	a	This is one of those cases where Steam needs a 'Maybe' button, but since binary is the only option (and my experience of the game is bent slightly towards the negative) i'll have to go with 'No' and then proceed to explain why.  You play as some dude trapped in a mine underneath the freezing cold of Greenland. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: You arrive to an 'area' of the mine, which consists of a few rooms connected by halls patrolled by monsters. You can see the map of the area in numerous locations in the halls (some are almost next to each other... was it so hard to have the protagonist carry the map around and view it with a simple button?). You visit the rooms, find clues, closed doors, broken machines, etc. and must then proceed to solve these puzzles in order to progress to the next area. You cannot visit previous areas nor move on until you completely clear the current one.  You get some makeshift weapons, though you're not supposed to use them and instead sneak by the enemies by crouching and moving carefully in the darkness (BOOORING! it was slightly exciting the first time but seriously, there's some parts which you must navigate back and forth, and having to sneak carefully EVERY SINGLE TIME? c'mon), though i ended up developing a strategy to kill all the monsters so i could then move freely about  What i disliked the most was the story to game length ratio. The whole plot is summarised in two sentences at the beginning of the next game, and it really feels overstretched at some points (a lot of times i was like 'ugh, can something happen please? i'm just here solving all these puzzles and nothing happens story-wise')  Audio, video and ambience are OK, but definitely not scary (and i always played with headphones and at night with all lights off). I really hope they didn't intend the locations to be frightening or disturbing, because if they did they fell very short of it.  Finally the puzzles can be divided in two categories: traditional and physics-based. Traditional puzzles are like 'this machine is broken, find the parts, place them in the correct spots and start the machine with a specific sequence of steps ambiguously described in this text' and they always feel too easy. Physics-based puzzles are like 'an electric fence is blocking the way' and you must move things around (boxes, planks) to get through. Now i don't have anything against pysics-based puzzles, but most of the time there's no indication whatsoever that you're facing one of these, so you can spend some time wandering around an entire area until you realise that in the room in the complete opposite side of the mine has some stuff that MIGHT be the physics puzzle that you need to move on.  tl;dr more annoying than innovative, and definitely not scary at all.
589	0	a	I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a horror game after a couple hours with it. The game has its moments of horror, but they only slightly stretch passed the initial reactions to it. The beginning does a good job of keeping you in the dark in terms of story and atmosphere. There's a sense of confusion and loss that doesn't leave; however, this eventually turns to a sense of confusion based upon the lackluster combat and wonderment of why you should be scared. The enemies aren't difficult to run from, I found myself just running through areas avoiding enemies because of the horrid combat. Along with the weak combat, you'll get lost fairly easily as there's little to no direction regarding your goals.  The game is short, so if you're looking for some cheap thrills, then I'd recommend it, but if you're looking for an engaging story and continuous horror, look elsewhere.   5/10
2887	1	a	I pooed my pants
593	0	a	When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.  High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work, which is limited. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.
594	0	a	WHile I adore games like this I cannot recommend this title for any price other than $5 or below. The graphics and the texturing is horrible. The gameplay is ordinary and unscary. The areas are bleak and bland. The music and sound effects however are great. The overall game feels empty and just cohesioned with long tunnels and hallways that merit littlle interest.   I will give credit to the concept; which is marginally if not minimally presented in a generic package. The best way to describe this title is...............DRYY!!
595	0	a	Primitive world interaction, clunky combat and an empty, mazelike level design make this a hard game to recommend. There's still an interesting sense of horror here, and it's great to see the Amnesia developers in their formative years, but there's not much value outside of that.
596	0	a	The story was fine but I couldn't help feeling it was a little boring. Who wants to spend an entire game down deep in monotonous mineshafts? The scenery doesn't really change and the baddies aren't so well-animated. I'd say go for Amnesia instead.
597	0	a	Penumbra Overture is a strange one. It is classed survival/horror, but I felt neither of those. It felt more like a trial-by-death rage game. Try to do anything, you die, until you die enough times to feel out what specific actions you need to take to not die so quickly. Granted, I played on the hardest difficulty so it probably would have been quite a bit more manageable on lower difficulties, but the lack of direction killed it for me. Not on a macro story level, but on a micro encounter level.   For example, hopefully without spoilers, one level immediately drops you into an encounter where the character states, in subtitles, that they need to seal 'that door' whilst looking at a door that obviously can't be the target of the statement. You are then in a large room with somewhat of a gauntlet arrayed before you, and if you take more than half a second to look around, even to get your bearings for the first time, you are dead. It took me at least a couple dozen attempts to coincidentally use that half second in the right spot facing the right direction to realize there was a button. Then I died again. And that was just the first leg of the gauntlet. There were at least two of these situations, together probably representing half of the time I put into this short game. Half the time the game decides to ignore its own mechanics, such as an enemy completely ignoring a distraction that should have worked, and had worked on previous occassions, for no discernable reason. There were also several cases where I would be hiding behind cover, such as a box or around a corner, waiting for the chance to sneak by, and the dog I was hiding from would suddenly start growling and teleport right next to me to rip my throat out. This game made me feel as though there were some hidden timer, and I weren't allowed to go more than a half-minute without dying, usually for no fault of my own.  The controls aren't very intuitive when it comes to the use of tools. I often found myself swinging short or my goal, or in a different manner than I wanted, which in itself got me killed quite often. There wasn't much story, nor was I particularly captivated, but this is only the first chapter in a trilogy. I did like the character Red very much however, in both his voice acting and portrayal. I will also admit that even with all these things, once the credits rolled I was surprised to find how small the crew was, and for the team size I think the game was pretty good.  Context aside though, as the game itself stands I don't find myself compelled to recommend it.
598	0	a	It's the first commercial release from Frictional Games, the guys who made Amnesia: TDD. There are a few high points in the game, like the good voice acting of the character named 'Red' and also unsurprisingly the atmosphere is great. But on the other end of the scale the 'combat system' is completely broken and the game has very loose ties to the personal story of the main character, because the whole game focuses on this 'Red' guy who in the end is very unimportant.  The sequel Penumbra: Black Plague is far superior, and at points is even better than Amnesia in my opinion. I know this is supposed to be a recommendation, but I quess I can also recommend people to stay away from games, so this one right here is definitely one you should skip.
599	0	a	i have played the game for about half an hour. i did not find it scary, i did not like the large amouts of text.
600	0	a	I like Amnesia, from the creators, but I found this game awful. Awkward controls, maze level design, and not scary at all. The combat system is useless, and we have to fight a lot with rabid dogs, and spiders. Don't waste time on it, play Amnesia Penumbra was developed, when Frictional games had less experience.
601	0	a	Ths game is kinda weak. I got myself worked up for the first 30 minutes of the game, not realising there wasn't any thing to chase me yet, and then when they got to their first 'scare' it was just a spider the size of my hand just crawling past me. Then, when a REAL threat came around, it growled which startled me (this was when I was still excited about getting the game), but I crawled around a corner and saw it was a bloody ( yet still unintimidating) dog the size of my spaniel, that I could run past without it noticing. Then later I decided to whack it with a hammer that I got very early in the game and it FELL OVER AND SURE AS HELL TOOK ITS TIME TO GET BACK UP. Later I got on a crate where the dog couldn't get me but wanted to, so I kept hitting it with the hammer, and it DIED. That left me free of the dog until I went to another area, skipping and singing, 'ding dong, the witch is dead.' I just wish they made a better, scarier, maybe IMMORTAL, at least, monster. Plus, the riddles are SO FREAKING HARD. Had to watch PewDiePie play it to know wtf I was doing. But don't listen to me completely, I haven't beaten it yet, and I heard it gets more intense. CONCLUSION: Not a scary game (to me) but don't be COMPLETELY persuaded. Also, definately play this if you wanna play this game's sequal, Penumbra: Black Plague, which IS quite scary, but you won't understand a single thing in it if you don't play this; Overture. If you absolutely DO NOT GIVE A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about the story, go ahead and play Black Plague, but you'll be left with a crap ending that you won't get or like if you don't play Overture.  Ok, I've played the rest now and it got a LITTLE more scary.  Just a couple parts with a huge worm. Long story.  So, all in all, I'd just get Black Plague and just enjoy the scares.  6.5/10 wud play baseball practice with some spiders agin
602	0	a	ONE HUGE NEGATIVE!!!!!!!!!!! I paid $10 hoping to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ my pants while clnching the mouse for dear life, I farted out of boredom.  TWO THINGS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Story by notes and books is awesome. Puzzles remind me of Silent Hill in difficulty.
603	0	a	a bad 'stick one object in another' game
604	0	a	First of all, I am a big fan of amnesia.I really like the genre.It's the only game that scared me that much.I thought it would be the same for this game but....... I was wrong.I mean seriously dogs and spiders ?I know it changes in the second episode but DOGS AND SPIDERS??? I expected some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up zombie thing not a dumb dog that is just pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥.I have also experienced some bugs in the game which were pretty annoying(objects going invisible etc.) but I believe the reason is I am using a Mac(a.k.a. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ computer ) .I hope the second game is much better than this one.I will update the review when I finish the game.
605	0	a	This game was literally a turd. I mean everyone knows that the rest of my recommendations have been jokes thus far, but in this case I'm not lying. It really was terrible.  For the sake of all that is good and sane, don't buy this. Or at least try a demo or something.
606	0	a	What a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a game. This might have been really great but the gameplay mechanics is just so stupid and frustrating that I can't take any more. Try swinging a hammer...Come on, was this made so clunky on purpose? If so, then it's a lame way of making the game harder. AVOID unless you are some kind of a masochist and like reloading because a bloody basic thing like using a hammer makes you wnat to pull your hair out. The story seems so interesting, but the way controlling your character is made is just totally unacceptable.
607	0	a	The game looks good, but when I open it on my pc it is very bright, even with gama and all other settings either on low or off. I also have tried playing it on my mac (version 10.9) only to find that it opens to a black screen and then quits. I have tried looking for solutions but to no avail. Until I can even play the game, I must not recomend this game, for a game that does not even work is not worth buying.
608	0	a	Dog Catcher Simulator.
609	0	a	TO SCARY DONT BUY EVER! I HOPE PEWDIEPIE PLAYS IT IT WOULD BE FUNNY XD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ GAME LOL
2889	1	a	10/10
2891	1	a	I finished the game ... and i finaaly can recommend this game .... its a very good game wid the tym of its release the graphics is good .. wel vcant comapre to now a days ... well a gamer lyk me who heavily belive in stroy lines and gameplay i really amazed by the presentaion as well as the gamelplay... some jump scares here n der but the most postive thng is its story n puzzle solvings ....some are very easy but it took tym to figure out ... i dnt belive in revealing the story .... its for those who play n discover by them selfs ..... all in all a great game .. the only hetd thng for me is its control to attack or distroy by using axe or anythng is annoying...... love frictional games ...well cant wait to play its sequel black plague..... its actually continue to the next game so i suggest u sud buy all collection
2893	1	a	The practicality of its puzzles is P:O's strong point. The problems and their solutions all feel firmly rooted in the world you are exploring, and solving them elicits a nod of satisfaction for their intuitiveness. Beyond that, the gameplay is rather lacking. The enemies that can be combatted present zero threat or challenge, resulting in a severe lack of tension throughout the journey. Fortunately the exploration and mystery is the far bigger draw and well worth a playthrough.
2895	1	a	Nice game with a lot of puzzles. This is more like a psycological horror game than a scary game. You may have to read all the 'notes' you find as you advance in the game to get on the mood.  If you liked games like Amnesia, Silent Hill, or Half-Life you will like this game  Recomendation: Play it by night with your earphones and the ligths off.
2897	1	a	The Penumbra series is awesome. Like Amnesia, but with more puzzles, more of a challenge, and more darkness (believe it or not).
2899	1	a	Great horror game. Its only negative is the clunky combat interface.
2901	1	a	This game really freaks me out when I first play this game like about 3 or 4 years ago. Nice atmosphere and great gameplay.  8/10
2903	1	a	I've played and beat this game many of times, and I always come back to it. If you didn't know by now. The people who made the Penumbra series, Frictional Games, also made Amnesia and the upcoming SOMA. If you like puzzles and horror games. This is for you.
2905	1	a	This game is really great. I must say this game for it's time is awesome, compared to Amnesia it is not all that much, but what can you expect since this game was created earlier. Penumbra really leaves you wanting more.  Penumbra is different from Amnesia, since you have weapons and can fight. It is a different experience that should be played. The fight mechanics are a little wonky and some of the puzzles are a bit odd, but it still is a great game. Overall I think Penumbra Overture gets a 8.9/10  
2907	1	a	these games are AMAZING!! dont expect insane cutting edge graphics, but the atmospher, the sounds, everything keeps you on edge. by far one of the most impressive horror survival games out there. puzzles are alot of fun, and pretty realistic   absolutely hands down worth the money
2909	1	a	This game is a must for any puzzle/horror fun who wants a thrill ride fueled with mystery. Some times the game glitches out during puzzles, forcing you to reload a previous save. Save points are quite few and far between so beware, if something seems off and you've already tried everything, then its most probably glitched and you will need to reload. Other than that the story is interesting and mysterious, tempting you to see it through to the end just so you know what happens.
2911	1	a	Pretty scary. That is, if you find spiders and zombie-dogs scary.
2913	1	a	Literally and Metaphorically: RED Dead Redemption Great game, on to their next! 8/10 
2915	1	a	The Penumbra Series is BRILLIANT!!! The graphics hold up even almost 8 years later. The story is amazing! There's good scares and great puzzles that make the series challenging. The best part about these games is the gameplay mechanics. The physics puzzles are great and even something as simple as opening a door is immensely satisfying and adds greatly to the realism and immersion into the creepy, frigid underground world. If you like the Amnesia games, get the original!
2917	1	a	I bought this game and it's 2 sequels on a sale because they were really cheap. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. The combat in the first game is shoddy and hard to control at best. However, the story, the ambience of it and the beautiful story led to an experience I can honestly say I havent felt before.
2919	1	a	If your going to get this game, be prepared to Hide and Run for your life. As this game will make you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bricks at every corner you come across.
2921	1	a	Awesome horror game. Predecesor to Amnesia but has a completely different feel and story line.
2923	1	a	This game becomes automatically less scary once you realize you can kill the monsters with a cool but poorly executed combat system. Thankfully the puzzle designs make up for that. If you're looking to see how Frictional got their start, check this one out.
2925	1	a	Awesome Game from Frictional Games, Many Jumpscares, Good Atmosphere, and also good story. This game is Just Awesome and scary!
2927	1	a	Grab your best headphones, turn out the lights, and prepare for one of the most nerve wracking adventures to ever hit PC! :)
2929	1	a	Downloaded this game (and it's sequels) in preparation for Amnesia. A good game, (if a little short) atmospheric, puzzles can be a little irritating, but satisfactory once solved. However, combat is plonky and players should stick to stealth, I also noticed that health regenerates (I was playing on easy) I never died in the one instance of accidental direct combat. Other minor complaints are that when I started the game up I had to tinker with the graphics just get some colour and clear picture.  All in all, enjoyable experience. Makes me glad I bought it in a bundle
2931	1	a	Great game, really fun
2933	1	a	It isn't often a game as polished and riveting as Penumbra comes along at all, let alone from a debut effort by an independent studio. A lack of weapons makes enemies far more terrifying than most survival games, demanding some ingenuity rather than an itchy trigger finger, a feat few games succeed in pulling off so well. Along with a tense, immersive atmosphere that is equally unmatched, Penumbra: Overture is a spectacular, uniquely engaging experience. The less that is known about it before starting it, the better the experie... I've said too much.
2935	1	a	Good game, first in the episodes. Don't know why they just have them numbered instead.
2937	1	a	A very short game but there's a reason why people are afraid while playing it. The atmosphere is perfect so that seeing a dead body is either scary or striking, the enemies in the game are incredibly difficult to kill so that you'll actually use the (very forgiving) stealth system and when the game wants to let you know that you escaped on the edge of your teeth, dear lord you feel it.  Also there is a rather striking moment late in the game involving your friend Red. I saw it coming and it still sparked some emotions.
2939	1	a	I love this game. As someone who played Amnesia before Penumbra, it was nice to see the precursor to Amnesia. The controls are identical, the atmosphere is terrifying and it's quite fun to imagine yourself in the protagonist's place. The main thing I'm slightly iffy about is how the story starts off. The warning that is shown when you first open the game is vague, but it makes you want to know more.    Would play again and again and again.
2941	1	a	 (Original post date and time: Jan 15, 2013 @ 11:25pm)  Penumbra: Overture is very much worth the money! This game is scary, but it doesn't rely on random scares(jumpscares) most of the time to make it scary, this game relies on it's environment and ambience to give the player that unsettling feeling so they can get the full experience out of the game! If you enjoy horror games, this will most likely feed your hunger for horror and some!
2943	1	a	It's the best one out of the Trilogy, that's for sure. The atmosphere is probably what will scare you the most, that and your own anxities about what could possible be waiting behined that locked door. The puzzles are enjoyable and somewhat challenging to solve, you must think outside the box to solve a couple of them. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game and it scared me a couple times, which is hard to do.
2945	1	a	GET IT!!!
2947	1	a	Generally I'm not a big fan of horror and/or adventure games. But Penumbra definetely got me. I won't call it a horror, but it's example of brilliantly done dark atmosphere. After finishing Penumbra Overture I felt not scared but rather depressed. Which games rarely suceed for me.  I suppose you should check it. Penumbra Overture is worthy gem.
2949	1	a	+ Great graphics and sound effects + Awesome gameplay and story + Fun and new controls + Scary enemies
2951	1	a	Wow, A horror game that actually gives you a weapon
2953	1	a	this is the perfect spooky simulator. if you wish to get murdered by the spookiness then this is the perfect game to play
2955	1	a	A zombie dog saw me so i jumped on top of a box, and hit it with a hammer till it died I opened a door and a gigantic worm tried to eat me A gigantic horde of spiders tried to eat me when i climbed in a tunnel  Then i played this game 10/10 would almost die then play this game again
2957	1	a	This is a fun game. The only thing i dont like about it is that its not very scary.....
2959	1	a	My name is Phillip and I just fell down a hole. Things are going as expected. Hour 1 -  I set off to Greenland due to a video game style reason. Hour 2 - I arrive at Greenland and start freezing to death. Hour 3 -  I found an abandoned mine shaft, so I climbed down but then the ladder broke. No turning back now. Hour 4 -  I found a rock, I called it Dave. Hour 5 -  Found a dog, I panicked and threw Dave. Hour 6 -  Dave shatters into pieces and makes the dog lose it's sense of balance.  rip dave
2961	1	a	. . .
2963	1	a	This game is one of the first Horror games I ever played. If it had been any other, I may never have fallen in love with the horror genre itself. I believe a good horror game needs buildup: A proper story, atmosphere... any game can tell a story; it takes a hell of a good game to make you feel like you've lived it. I reccomend this game, and give it a 9.5/10. It set in stone a standard that many games would follow after, such as Outlast, and it's own successor, Amnesia, with it's surivival/psychological elements.
2965	1	a	I love horror games, especially first person horror games, and I REALLY wish I could write a better review for this one. I understand a game where the atmosphere is important, that's what gives the game immersion. All Penumbra: Overture had was immerson techniques used by lights, textures and audio. I thought that in itself was really cool, and halfway through playing I was wondering when the 'scares' were going to happen. They never came. It took me four hours to get through this game because I wanted to get everything I could out of it. Overture is not a bad game in any means, but it lacks what every horror game needs: horror. I'd still recommend it, though. Just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it won't hopefully scare someone else's socks off! If you choose to get it, have fun! However, if you're aso wondering why there aren't any scares, play through it for the experience. 4/10 for me :(
2967	1	a	Penumbra Overture was one of the first horror games I have ever played. After playing it again... I can honestly say it still holds up! Nothing but love for Frictional Games!
2969	1	a	This game was so much more than I expected. Challenging puzzles and the gameplay is stealthy and exciting even when nothing is happening. The story in itself is totally worth it, certainly recommended.
2971	1	a	This game went largely unnoticed, but if you want to experience fear like you've never known you must try this game.
2973	1	a	This game sp00ked my guts off
2975	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a great horror game that combines puzzle and first person elements to create a suspenseful atmosphere. You must lead your character throughout an abandoned underground military base while thwarting the horrors that dwell there and discovering clues about your past. This game is unique from others in the way it creates tension. It is not so direct as other horror games, but I guarantee it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2977	1	a	An immersive and satisfying horror experience. If you like the core gameplay mechanics of Amnesia then this will be a treat. This first chapter of the Penumbra Trilogy blends a comptent and well put-together narrative with expertly crafted puzzles, and will scare the pants off you.           (Until you find out you can kill the monsters, that is.)
2979	1	a	there arent any shotguns in this game!  FAIL  3/10
2981	1	a	Pros: +atmosphere and climate +interaction +player can't fight - only way to survive is hidding +quite good graphic +awesome music and sounds +well done puzzles +common length (~7 hours) +wild dogs and worms (instead of real monsters or humanoidal creauters) are really dangerous and may be scary for someone  Cons: -can't see hero's legs (look down)  
2983	1	a	Thanks for giving me nightmares from those WORMS!
2985	1	a	The atmosphere might be laking (in comparison to Amnesia) and you might be able to defend yourself in this one but the story is a lot better in there than in Amnesia, Red is a cool dude!
2987	1	a	Had to hide from these dogs most of the time, then I'd wack them when they were distracted, and the spiders got me paranoid â™¥â™¥â™¥ f***, but were fun to kill   7.8/10 too many dogs
2989	1	a	Wow 2spooky, very scared, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dogs 11/10
2991	1	a	Great game. but maybe only buy when on sale.
2993	1	a	Somewhat clunky but very scary horror game. Black Plague is the better of the two.
2995	1	a	got no idea what to say,well this is amazing game its not even a horror couse you got weapon and you can protect your self,there is also no scares (jump scares or monster jumping at you) and that is very disappointing for me :( , but still the story is amazing + its an a hard game just like the second one-The Black Plague.  and its got one bad thing about it(controls tottaly s*cks balls), hitting key with a pickaxe or the hammer-you have to like move you hand from left to right to hit, k this game totaly s*cks balls but the story is amazing if you want a real horror expirianse you should play the Penumbra:Black Plague and its an a great deal to get this 2 cool game only in 10$. :)  The Rate about the game is = 8/10 and The Black Plague = 10/10  very recomend to buy this 'Penumbra Collectors Pack'.
2997	1	a	I killed a pack of zombie dogs with a pitchfork, then got squished by a ginormous rockworm.  It really is just like Greenland.
2999	1	a	Alright, so that was my first horror game!  I still remember my hard beginnings with the kind of old game mechanics and the old graphics. BUT from the beginning there were -atmosphere -horrorfying music -scary tunnels -and stinky zombie dogs u have to kill with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pick that swings 5sec after u swang the mouse, that was quiet difficult to handle but the game was getting more exciting after every minute I played, and the storyâ€¦ no joke, I almost cried at Reds third diary page, so intense feeling for digital person I even never saw in the game   Conclusion: Awesome, more than worth the money, great finale
612	0	a	This is the first entry in the Penumbra series. Unfortunately, it is very boring and non-scary. I recommend watching a video or reading about it if you want to play Penumbra Black Plague.
3001	1	a	Though it took only 3.5 hour to finish the game, the game is just awesome. This game might not have enemy but the puzzles are amazaing and its physics based which makes it interesting. I'm satisfied.
3003	1	a	8/10
3005	1	a	Amazing survival horror game. Game length is rather small, but in this case it's quite alright. Final chapter of the game was a blast!  Pros:     Sound effects are disturbing and delightful at the same time.      Interesting story.     Smart puzzles.     Claustrophobic atmosphere.     Unique controls.     No jumpscares.     Partial powerlessness   Cons:     As I progressed through the game it becomes less and less horror due to repetitive encounters.  
3007	1	a	So you get this feeling, not a haha feeling but a calling feeling (I'm sure we've all expirenced it before..... Maybe..... Probably not). Anyway, you have this inexplicable feeling to journey to Greenland and find your father.... or something. And what you find is completly expected (Snow). But wait, its not just snow, there is also ICE! After a blizzard that nearly freezes you colder then a cave man you find a door. Its not just any old door though, this door is heated (how else could you open it). Now, you are in a stange hallway with a flickering light! How scary! Then there is some blood, then there is a worm, then there is an incinerator, and then the end. But hey, it was kinda fun.
3009	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a first person adventure/stealth game for cynophobics: you can sneak past the dogs or if you really, really hate the beasts you can sneak behind them with a pickaxe and bash them to death by wildly flailing your mouse around and hoping it hits something. Given how clumsy this was, the developers abandoned combat in the sequel and everything they've made since. This is either their great discovery that revolutionized horror gaming or a gigantic mistake that led to the genre abandoning resource management and becoming a puddle of samey, poorly-designed walking simulators with bad lighting.  Regardless, it still nails the sensation of being trapped in a not-quite abandoned Greenland mine, at least to someone who has never been to Greenland or lived off dead spiders and dog meat in a mine shaft (if you have by any chance experienced either of these and feel that I am mistaken, feel free to let me know). If this sounds appealing to you and you don't mind the possibility of having to load someone else's save after the game refuses to acknowledge that you plugged a power cable in properly, you will probably enjoy Penumbra: Overture whether it spooks you or not.    Also, pay attention to the store page's screenshots. They reveal some enemy encounters ahead of time while also picturing several that never actually happen in the game just to keep you on edge. Stuff like this is brilliant and I'm surprised there aren't more horror games that do this.  
3011	1	a	One of the best horror games for PC. Must play for any horror fan.
3013	1	a	Do you remember when wolfeintein and Doom came out and basically invented FPS games? Years later came Half-Life and completely revolutionized the genre. The Penumbra series is the Half-Life of horror games, nuff said.
3015	1	a	Best logical horror game ever!
3017	1	a	Shadowy, creepy, unsettling and has a great atmosphere...
3019	1	a	 True gem of Survival Horror genre. Frictional Games did great job!
3021	1	a	10/10 would kill dog with pickaxe again.  Pros: -Eerie setting -Great audio -Interesting enough to have me do a playthrough in one sitting -The puzzles can be pretty interesting -Lots of collectible notes, some necessary, others just for story/info  Cons: -Short enough for one sitting (But then again, it's only episode 1). -Running back and forth between areas for puzzles got repetitive. Would have thought this would make it longer... -Story seemed interesting at first, then it just went off track and had nothing to do with the intro.  Overall this gets a 7/10. Enjoyed it :) Looking forward to playing the next episodes (in one sitting).
3023	1	a	This game is like a FMV console horror game from Sega Saturn or Sony Playstation except it's in realtime 3d. Honestly, it shares so much with Enemy Zero or Hellnight and its more streamlined ilk. You've basically got puzzle rooms interconnected by a corridor sequence and on you go dodging death and solving puzzles.  The mechanics may not have aged well, and the second chapter (Black Plague) retcons plenty out of this one, so don't get burned there. The horror premise is well-worn and the setting is honestly inspid, but it's a decent game all in all.
3025	1	a	Overture actually aged fairly well! Explore abandoned mine shafts with fearsomely mutated creatures. Taking them head on is not advised, so you must use stealth and physics to defeat them. Defeatly worth a play, especially if on sale or in a humble bundle!
3027	1	a	The one that started it all. We can only hope that Frictional games continues to bring us more great survival horror games in the future, just ignore the game's terrible combat system.
3029	1	a	Wonderful games. I love the tension when playing it alone.
3031	1	a	It has great scares and hard puzzles.
3033	1	a	A nice immersive horror games that doesn't rely on cheap scares and relies on atmosphere and immersion to make the player feel like he is really hopeless and fighting for survival, the game is fairly short in length which is a bit disappointing but the areas are well thought out and for a game that doesn't have a big budget i think they have done the best with what they had i give it 81/100 and my own personal hooray!!!
3035	1	a	If you love Amnesia the dark descent you will LOVE this game!!!!!  Story 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 replay:Well once you beat it, play it again to see how quick you can finish it again. Price: Get the triple pack you get all the games just 20.00!!! Great deal!!!!
3037	1	a	Quite spooky and puzzles are moderatley challenging. play with the lights out for the full immersion obviously. Amnesia might have been claimed to be the scariest indie game of all time but this is what came before it by frictional games.
3039	1	a	I love horror games and if you like classic horror games and dont mind outdated graphics this is definately the game for you!
3041	1	a	A gamed stacked with lots of clever puzzles and horror elements, Penumbra Overture is guaranteed to give you an amazing experience.  
3043	1	a	It's good and pretty scary, until you find out how easily you can kill all the dogs and bypass all the threats. It's essentially a survival horror stealth game with one of the most clunkiest inefficient combat systems out there that is purposely bad to make you feel utterly hopeless. A great idea to drive the horror with poor combat, sort of like how Resident Evil took use of the bad camera angles to gimp and make the characters have a weakness. However, poorly executed, could be way better if the combat is scrapped entirely or gimped even more.  Ignoring all the flaws, it's still a very good horror game.
3045	1	a	Great episodic series. I've only played Overture so far but I can safely say that spiders were never so menacing in a game before! The sound design and graphics are quite good and the story is compelling enough to keep making you want to play it; delve ever deeper (literally) into the mine that the first part of this series (Overture) almost entirely takes place in. Also, the puzzles and game play mechanics (such as being able to smash open a locked chest or closed door with a hammer or pick + having a glow stick, a flashlight, and even flares at your disposal to light your way, are all great features as well)  Can't wait to play the rest of the series!
3047	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a pretty darned cool game. Frictional games, creators of the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent made this Penumbra a few years before ATDD, and it doesn't disappoint!  Scary atmosphere, and compelling scriptwriting make it a joy to play. The plot isn't particularly believable, but which horror game plot is nowadays. The controls feel a little clunky at times, and the combat system (which was thankfully done away with in Penumbra: Black Plague) is entirely optional, meaning you can attempt stealth playthroughs of the game.  Grab the collection if its on sale, its worth the price!   8/10!
3049	1	a	great immersive gameplay that is bone chilling
3051	1	a	Buy it, fantastic game
3053	1	a	If you havn't played this, but own Call of Duty, I won't value any word you say.
3055	1	a	Prepare to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ yourself. Seriously.
3057	1	a	Was pretty good, asmopheric and a little scary! The audio makes it kind of obvious when you should be sneaky though...
3059	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a really narrative and thriller story. Its storyline is truly uncommon, and it has the ability to catch your attention from the first moment you play it.  No one should miss it, is a great piece of work.
3061	1	a	Killed a demon dog with a rock 10/10
3063	1	a	While not as good as its sequel, Penumbra Overture is still a great game from a great indie company. If you like horror games, great storylines or have played Amnesia: The Dark Descent than play this game.
3065	1	a	If you don't play this game we cannot be friends and I will not respect you as a proper human being.
3067	1	a	I played this game because I loved amnesia: the dark decent. i didn't have much expectations on the game, but I liked it in the end. It ok, but its worth playing it to play the second game, 'The black plauge', thats the really good one. In the beginning when you are walkingt through a dark tunnel its scary but after that you are mostly in lighted rooms. But there are some fun atmospheric and scary moments. Like the lake, the worm chase and the room with the UV-Lamp text. There are basicly just 2 enemies. Zombie dog and big spider. Your attack is really bad. When fighting the zombie dogs you get a lot of diffrent things to lure them but to kill the enemies the easiest way is to just stand still att hit them when they attack. Hate the spiders, they are so annoying. &gt;_&lt; The story is hard to follow, but you grasp it and can but the parts together in the second part. Also the flashlight is so muth worse than the green tube whih never runs out of battery. But in 'black plauge' they made the green tube worse so you have reason to use the flashlight. ^^
3069	1	a	Definitely a great game, nice addition to my collection. But my workstation windows XP doesn't want to let it play. . any help?
3071	1	a	If you love the Amensia series you will love penumbra , similar game mechanics so Amensia players will be ready on using controlls , like amensia it has puzzle solving , creatures stalking the various halls and mines and has great atmosphere
3073	1	a	classsic scary game , stealh and puzzle in a strange twist! play with lights off and headphones on
3075	1	a	From my blog  http://www.dyle.org/blog/game-penumbra-overture   Finished Penumbra: Overture 2 days ago.  Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).  You are at the search for the mysterious death of your father. He worked at some mining complex at Greenland and that is the place the game starts right with the entrance to the pit at the gameâ€™s cover. In the next 4 chapters you delve deeper and deeper to reveal the strange and frightening secrets of this place. Along your journey you find various items to use and even some weapons which you desperately need: this place is haunted by zombie-like dogs, gigantic worms and spiders the size of racoons. Eventually you discover excavations from alien origin and make contact to the sole survivor of this place: â€œRedâ€ which apparently has gone mad.  As the game was created by Frictional Games the mechanics are very, very similar to Amnesia. This game is older and when playing you can see the polish the developers did to Amnesia.  Compared to Amnesia this game letâ€™s you actually kill your enemies, though it is a though job. Which is sorta strange, since the game changes dramatically once you know how to kill all these dogs in the corridors. Then the dominant opponent turns into a â€œpiece of cakeâ€ and whatâ€™s left are the riddles to solve. However getting a grip on these Zombie-Dogs is not an easy task and it takes you several (!) attempts to figure out how to get rid of them.  I can imagine why they dropped the possibility to kill enemies in Amnesia: here the game stops been frightening at this point.  The riddles in the game are of different qualities. Some are stupidly easy and for some you simply get false hints, which is bad. I remember myself in chapter 4 been chased by a big worm. The game tells you to â€ â€¦ to seal that doorâ€. Right then you find a crate on the right side. When I jumped up the crate I couldnâ€™t reach the door mechanics, but the worm didnâ€™t appear. So I thought Iâ€™m on the right place and tried over and over and over and over to get somewhere from that position. Wrong! I needed to simply push a button on the left side of the door! And sealing the door didnâ€™t help either â€¦  Such quirks appear occasionally in the game: game mechanics great, story telling nice, riddles range from childish to misleading.  Still, walking the strange mine renders some nice and creepy impressions, 7/10.
3077	1	a	the first settlement of the penumbra trilogy! wonderful horror amosphere, good gameplay, very gloomy and subcitve locations.  monsters are creepy and the idea of seeing better while resting is very positive and give the gameplay a nice perspective.  if you like horror adventures (this is in first person) then go for it
3079	1	a	Penumbra's brooding and downright compelling atmosphere will suck you in from the moment the ladder below the hatch breaks down and leaves you trapped in the lugubrous mining shafts. Give this game a try.
3081	1	a	A shaky start to the series, but still has its moments.
3083	1	a	8 hours to beat. very well done. very immersive and very scary. a great lead up to amnesia. (also a sequel)
3085	1	a	While the first half of the game is extremely scary, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. I think that imagining what was going on in the game was much better than the actual reveal.  That said, this is a fantastic game. The atmosphere really draws you in and gives a sense of being alone in the dark. The level progression layouts are well-designed, allowing you to visit the same areas multiple without it feeling repetitive. The enemies are tough without being impossible and some of the puzzles are real dome-scratchers. The weapons system is neat but has one drawback- each attack is super slow and it's easy to get killed by an enemy because you couldn't swing your weapon in time.   For people who don't want to go head to head with them, there are also multiple ways to incapacititate or evade enemies. Much of the game is stealth-based, making the creepy, ominous atmosphere even more tense. You never know if you're about to walk straight into something that wants to kill you- and will.  The story was interesting, remaining a complete mystery until almost the very end of the game. The story setup was brief without being rushed, allowing you to get right to playing with a million questions you want answered already.  Great horror FPS, runs great on older laptops with integrated graphics, great voice-over acting, great game. For an especially sweet deal, buy this game during a steam sale for about $5. You won't be disappointed.
3087	1	a	Pros: Very immersive, almost no hud.  Does a very good job at making intense chase scenes, require you to think on your feet and not just simply 'run away fast enough'. Puzzles are significantly more complex than amnesia's.  Lots of interatable items.  Cons: Has a weapon mechanic, which leads to some good puzzles and chase scenes, but also allows killing of monsters. The mechanics of using weapons are also really bad in some cases. Requires the second game to get full experince. Requires finding very specific items, which if not found quickly could result in you searching for hours for them, only to look it up online and find you threw a couch cusion over it.    I would recommend Black Plague over Overture, but both games are solid story-driven horror games. Combined, Overture and Black Plague make for a scarier experince than amnesia IMO.  If you have really bad arachnophobia, it may be a bit unsettling to know that spiders are very common in the game.
3089	1	a	There is nothing more captivating knowing each step you take may lead to danger or another piece of the larger puzzle. Striving to keep forward, travelling deeper into the abyss and it's creatures... No way out. You must carry on.  Unlike it's newer cousin Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Penumbra Overture is a different kind of scary. Different, but good.
3091	1	a	This game is interesting with great atmosphere. This is the prequel which is leading up to the superior Black Plague (but you should play this one first)
3093	1	a	A creepy, modern dungeon-crawl. Overture will keep you running and hiding from a multitude of enemies; frantically race your way through an old mining complex, listening to the babbling madman on the other end of your radio. Clutch your tiny hammer in fear as an enemy slinks by, leaving you undetected... for the moment.  Interestingly, the only Penumbra game in which you can actually fight off enemies! Let them have it while you can, the later titles don't allow such behavior...
3095	1	a	You can fight back, kind of
3097	1	a	A spirtual precursor to Amnesia. I found the Penumbra series had great atmosphere, and a hopelessness that Amnesia couldn't replicate.
3099	1	a	Frost worms, mutant spiders, no will to live, strange LSD poison? Yeah I put my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in one of these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing frost holes and all I got at the end of was a pat on the back and a new pair of pants that wasn't smothered in all my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   5 Mua'dibs out of 5
3101	1	a	This game is f****** scarry!!
3103	1	a	May not be as scary as say Amnesia but this is one survival horror that you shouldn't miss. Its fun, challenging and very very creepy. Combat is difficult so you can't always rely on the 'weapons' you get, which makes the game interesting because a game isn't a horror game if you can easily fight your way through all your enemies. This game was great. I hope to get Penumbra: Black Plague very soon.
3105	1	a	Awesome game, I loved every minute of it, terrifying, good puzzles, gretest atmosphere ever. Definitely one of my favorite game so far !
3107	1	a	The first game by indie developer Frictional games will leave your head hurting and your heart racing. A suave and compelling story compliment the brain teasing puzzles and terrifying atmosphere. A must have for any fan of the survival horror genre.
3109	1	a	Really fun and suspenseful
3111	1	a	An entertaining game, if short. Nowhere near as scary as Amnesia, especially when you realize you can just ice pick the dogs (the only enemies whatsoever) to the face and kill them in 1269345867345 swings.
3113	1	a	Dude... This game is awesome. Well, it's awesome, if you like to get scared. This game ACTUALLY made me go 'Oh god, wtf... oh god... OH GOD! GET AWAY FROM ME! GODOGDODGODGODGODGODG JESUS CHRIST HOLY-- holy... jesus.' Then there was this time where I was running and way like 'GOD OH GOD!' and screaming and stuff, then my friend decided to say in my ear in that creepy a** voice of his 'Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't escape me, I'm the gingerbread man!' and I was like 'SHUT THE HELL UP!' This game... is... in my opinion... SCARIER THAN AMNESIA. Amnesia is more of the psycological horror, and there are those zombie things, but it's just... unsettling. Penumbra, is that, PLUS a freaky a** dog that is HALF MAULED, AND creepy notes everywhere that say things like 'I came down here with four of my colleges and learned a few things...' then later it says '...and humans are tasty.' And you know what is next to that note? A big stain of blood... alright?... And two pairs of BLOODY BOOTS! NOT COOL MAN! And when you read this note, guess what you're hiding from? THE FREAKING DEMONIC HALF-EATEN DOG!! So yeah. Creepy atmosphere, freaky scary creatures, and it ACTUALLY managed to scary me. ME! I'M the one, who laughs at people when they say that Slender is scary. I'M the one, who reasons with people to say that Amnesia isn't very scary, but it's pretty startling. The devs knew what they were doing. The story is pretty good, too. The graphics... They're good for what they use it for, and for 2007, but it's really not that great, and I notice texture glitches everywhere. Bottom line is, if you like to get scared, this game is for YOU.
3115	1	a	Under-appreciated, not very well known game that set a new standard for storyline and freakiness. Check it out.
3117	1	a	This game is really good and you should get it when ever you can!
3119	1	a	No food, water, shelter, or living people. Everything's broken, man-eating dogs on the prowl, and your only means of survival are flares, duct tape, a flashlight, and AA batteries.   What life must be like in North Korea.
3121	1	a	Worth playing even though there are some design issues. My main complain is the combat (or what's there of it, at least). I know it's suppose to be a stealth game but there are times when you have to fight and the controls are just a mess. Still, worth checking out for the storyline, which is intriguing.
3123	1	a	Much fun, such scare. very wow. 10/10
3125	1	a	4-5 hours long. Chilling if played right. Combat sucks and the physics sometimes sucks
3127	1	a	Scaring and original.
3129	1	a	Great atmosphere with controls that enhance the atmosphere. If nothing else, admire its game design. If you want a scary game, do it.  Very point-and-click adventure kind of mentality. Puzzle, find the maguffin, use maguffin, GET SCARED, proceed.  There is combat, but it only hurts the game, I think. It is my only complaint. So if you'll let that slide, it's a great buy.
3131	1	a	But you have to play it with headphones, in the dark, silent, and best slightly cold room.
3133	1	a	Penumbra Overture is a chilling first person horror adventure that utilizes creepy lighting, music, and sounds to keep the hair on the back of your neck standing. The story isn't grade A quality, but the presentation is where it shines--revealing pieces slowly while purposely withholding information. The game isn't continuously scary, although it does offer several moments of adrenaline pumped fear as you push forward into the unknown. It offers some decent puzzles, good physical interaction, and fabulous choreography of events with sounds. Keep the lights off, the sound cranked up, and immerse yourself into its eerie atmosphere. For the best experience, combat should be avoided.
3135	1	a	The Penumbra series is amazing.
3137	1	a	If you're a fan of the old survival horrors like the Resident EVil series (before 5) and Silent Hill then this game is a must. Immerse yourself in this awesome world. Have to warn you tho there are a few minor glitches if youre running a old comp. And its best not to go for head on combat in this game. Run, hide, use your wits in order to survive this horror.
3139	1	a	The game that started the wierd wonky horror FPS game. Your best skill is running. It feels dated, but can still give ya the jumps and the story is interesting. Buy Amesia Dark Decent, it is like this but much better.
3141	1	a	Frictional games is a low-budget, underrated video game company. Their soundtrack is what makes this an great game instead of just a decent game. This game has a slow start, but is one hell of a ride overall. I recommend this to any fan of the survival horror genre.  Gameplay: 16/20 ... GREAT (I might be â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but the solutions to puzzles are very unclear) Story: 8/10 ... GREAT Graphics: 5/5 ... PERFECT Sound/Music: 5/5 ... PERFECT Controls: 5/5 ... PERFECT  Overall: 87% (39/45) ... GREAT
3143	1	a	I started playing it and got bored. Thats it.
3145	1	a	awesome game for people who like horror
3147	1	a	Great atmosphere combined with a intriguing story at a cheap price. The combat is incredibly clunky however you are a scientist not a fighter, run and hide and use your mind to find your way to the truth. A rough gem, but a gem none the less
3149	1	a	This game is short.... but it's amazing. The atmosphere, the gameplay, the puzzles... the game is awesome. It really gets you thinking. Can't wait to try out the others!
3151	1	a	It reminds me of the game Chronicles of riddick but with less shine and action, being both very nice looking games. It is more suspense than terror than Amnesia. Is short, around 4 hours but it is an episode, and the expansion incorporates elements of FEAR. Nice use of 'natural' mechanics to move objects, open doors, etc. And the riddles are nice but not too difficult. 3.8/4
3153	1	a	Simply amazing. The best terror game I have ever played, and I have played a lot of them. It requires some serious thinking, but I consider that a plus.
3155	1	a	This game is brilliantly subtle, you'll love it (and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bricks).
3157	1	a	A bold, unique adventure / horror game. Well-written, well-designed, well worth the price of admission.
3159	1	a	More rough around the edges than Amnesia, but worthwhile for fans of that game. I think I slightly prefer this setting and storyline to Amnesia's, as well.
3161	1	a	If you're looking at this game, it's most likely because you've heard of or played the famous Amnesia: The Dark Descent made by the same developers. Penumbra: Overture is Frictional Game's first game and it definitely shares characteristics with Amnesia.  The mood and style of the game is similar to Amnesia. The lighting and eeriness of the locations set the tone of places you'd rather not be at. Notes are scattered throughout the game, providing background history of the places you travel through. The game is also physics based, but unlike Amnesia, you are allowed to have weapons, which does suggest that there is some form of defense. However, the physics nature of the game requires the player to manually swing melee weapons by moving your mouse back and forth. Nothing quite as fun as swinging in panic! In addition to these, there are quite a bit more puzzles to solve, but nothing that is frustrating and some have satisfying complexity.  If you're buying this game thinking you'll get the same experience as you did when playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will be off the mark. While it does share Amnesia's atmosphere of horror, its level of execution isn't the same. A play through the game shows that a lot of thought went into finding ways to instill fear into the player, but it's unable to maintain the same pressure throughout the game. If you want to get the same scares as one would get playing Amnesia, then you'll be disappointed. But if you're interested in playing a horror game or seeing Frictional Game's earlier works, then it's worth picking up this title.
3163	1	a	This Game is great for the price of $10 and the fact it comes with the games in the series is great. As for the Horror Survival part of the game is geat how if you don't feel like hiding you can walk up to an enemy and BEAT THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OUT OF HIM WITH A PICKAXE. Great story though the horror is Ok because he pretty much tells you that something is comming.
3165	1	a	very good game 8/10. loses 2 points due to the completely preposterous combat
3167	1	a	Pretty decent game here. Survival horror game where you use your brain to think of ways to progress through the levels/areas opposed to the mindless shooting crap with a gun while running around type of horror games out there. Not very much intense action involved in this game, which makes you slow down and concentrate and look for things while being creeped out by the strange atmospheric sounds and visual surroundings. This game is best played in the dark with sound up, all makes the experience much better. The game is rather short, beat in in about 4 or 5 hour, but for what you pay to get this game makes it all worth it. A title I suggest my friends to pick up if you dont mind getting spooked.  Raiting: 7/10
3169	1	a	the first horro game series by frictonal games and I was scared at the first time
3171	1	a	This game is amazing, you have to try it, it is from the creators of amnesia. 
3173	1	a	although the graphics are a tad dated, its still a 10/10
3175	1	a	HOLYâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥INGSHITGODAMN
3177	1	a	I don't care that they give you a hammer. Run. Run away from everything.
3179	1	a	 Good : Great atmosphere. Have to play the sequels to get a complete picture, but the story is looking great so far. It has definitely caught my interest and I'm eager to play the next game in the series.   Bad : A bit too much dragging of items around for 'puzzles'. Combat is extremely clunky; you can go towards a more stealthy approach, but killing things gives my heart peace. Much shorter than expected.   100% recommend this game. I got a STALKER vibe while exploring and I loved it. Also check out the movie 'Devil's Pass' for more of the same vibe (it's like Stalker meets LOST).
3181	1	a	The Penumbra series, created by four men from Frictional Games, and stands somewhere in the top ten of my favorite games.  The game starts off with you looking for your father, but you get lost in the frozen tundra and end up in the mine. Everything seems normal at first, just an old abandoned mine you thought? You're dead wrong. After exploring for alittle bit, you begin to feel safe, thinking nothing is in the mine, thats when it strikes when you're least expecting it. First the hounds, then the spiders, soon the worm will be coming after you as you make your way deeper and deeper into the mines, unlocking the secrets of what happened here.  You'll stumble across a radio, and a man named Red will become your light in the darkness, and guide you through the tunnels and mazes of what once was a military facility.  Even though the controls for combat are frustrating, you have a better chance at attempting to sneak past the enemies of the game. For that, I give it a  9/10
3183	1	a	A cool adventure game that is pretty scary. the combat is kind of weird, and hard to get used to, but it is a great story and Penumbra is a fun series.
3185	1	a	Considering it is a low budget game, I gotta say it's a pretty darn good game. But the puzzles are hard and your not left with alot of help either. 7/10
3187	1	a	Not that scary.
3189	1	a	Great stuff
3191	1	a	It kind of loses the scary factor when you realize you can kill the dogs.
3193	1	a	i loved the game. i have played penumbra requiem, black plague and overture but this one is the best and most interesting. is there a chapter/episode 2?
3195	1	a	thought this game would be a scary then i tongued a spider and saw a dog slam its head in to a door twice  10/10 never laughed harder at a horror game in my life
3197	1	a	Coolest horror game in my opinion. Great horror experience all the way through.
3199	1	a	A good balance between plot , puzzle , and ofcorse horror! It has a very good story and a good scare. Despite it's age, it is one of a kind.
3201	1	a	I have seen several let's plays of this game and now that I have played it myself I have realized a few things. -Compared to Amnesia: the Dark Descent the controls were a little sloppy (for me at least), if not, it was at least not the most efficient set up. (Now this isn't so much as a negative system, but it might be too efficient causing to no longer be efficient). -The only story of this game is: get through the mines. Now while you traverse the mines and caves you get hints at what the next game will hold. Red also explains what has happened and what is still happening. Now ... to actually get or say this has any plot to it: you have to read the notes, and listen to Red. -Another comparison to Amnesia: the Dark Descent is in this game you almost never have a time of absolute darkness to where you cannot see in front of you.  -Although the puzzles were good and some were very easy; unless you have seen someone else, have maps of the game, or even have a walkthrough ... there are no initiatives for directions of how to work the puzzles (although Red does help a little it is very easy to miss his times of speech especially when being chased or if you are in hiding). There or the 'To Do''s but unless you have clicked on something that requires reminding, it is very unhelpful/useless. -Now this game is the first commercially released game that Frictional Games has done and therefore deserves a high rating of amazement from an avid gamer to the company. I definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a game to play.
3203	1	a	This game is one of my favourites. Due to it's release date, the graphics are dated, but I do not find this to be a poblem. It is a very dark, crepy game with a great storyline. Some of the story may not be perfect, and objectives can be unclear and hard to complete. Over-all, I loved it, but it is not perfect. From me, it still receives a 8/10.
3205	1	a	First play time.  Starts game Brakes ice from the hatch with a rock and goes in. Thinks 'well this isnt that scary  Goes from tunnels to other side of blocked door Something bashes the hatch  Jumps in the air thinking 'what the literal â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was that?' Goes in the hatch  Hears scary sounds  ends the game  Second play time Continues to an old office  Goes in to a skype call with friends  Gets out of office  sees a dog Thinks 'WTF is wrong with that dog it has shiny yellow eyes and looks like a zombie dog' Gets from storage to explosives Dog comes to the place where i am Dog sees me Runs and jumps on a box Kills the dog with a hammer  Says to dead dog zombie 'Hahaha i killed you' Immediatly hears scary sounds  Says 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game' Closes the game Goes outside Sees a dog Says 'OH MY GOD THEY FOLLOWED ME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥' Barricades doors goes under bed doesnt sleep for a week  10/10 Would do it again :D
3207	1	a	Alright so Penumbra is Pretty scary even if you set your Brightness to high because it uses Horror Noises and Scares to Scare the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the Player. It's Very good but not the kind of game i would play often because you can not defend yourself very well in this game and the Other two, Black Plague and Requiem you arent able to defend yourself at all.
3209	1	a	Interesting horror and exploration game.
3211	1	a	Nice game. It combines a fairly well-done script and story arc with the sneaking elements of the Thief series.
3213	1	a	Terror lurks behind every corner...in the form of dogs and spiders. Seriously, the only enemies in this game are dogs and spiders. The puzzles and story are okay, but really, this game is only worth playing so you can get the first part of the story to the amazing Penumber Black Plague.
3215	1	a	I came to this game way after both Amnesia so I had a little idea of what to expect even if it wouldn't be as polished as the later game.  I wouldn't say the atmosphere is all that scary compared to Amnesia, but the sense of exploration and piecing the story together yourself is much the same. The certainly isn't a game you just blaze through. If you don't spend the time reading the notes and such left around and immersing yourself in the lore you'll find the game a bit empty.  The good: intriguing early story; some smart puzzles; manual interaction with doors et al for good sense of immersion.  The bad: a bit 'was that it?' at the end (though obviously this is only the setup to the rest of the series); lack of variety in enemies; controlling the tools/weapons can be a bit obtuse.
3217	1	a	this is a very fun game to play at night really scarry
3219	1	a	One of the best first person horror games ever. Hands down. With that being said, after I finished Amnesia, I couldn't even try to play this game.
3221	1	a	Good story, definitely worth playing. At times a pretty intense horror game.
3223	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played, the situations can range from well lit puzzles to hidding from monsters in the dark. Great storyline and gameplay, and the terror aspect is amazingly horrifying. All in all I would say it is definately worth a buy. 9.7/10
3225	1	a	What a scary and sometimes cheesy little FPS horror puzzle game. I recommend.
3227	1	a	ONE SCARRY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, and you get to learn morse code :)
3229	1	a	Game is over-all, pretty cool. Don't worry if you're scared of horror games, this game really isn't scary. Instead, it's filled with puzzles and has quite the intriguing story. Definitely gonna playthrough another time, 100% recommened.
3231	1	a	I throw a chair at a dog.
3233	1	a	I got this game because someone suggested I play it and they told me it would scare me. And it did. and I had fun. So get scared, have fun and get this game
3235	1	a	I was told that this was the first game Fricitional Games made so I decided to try it out to get past my fear of horror games. To my surprise, this game wasn't as horrifying as I thought it would be. Pretty solid gameplay, story, combat is a bit off but the fact that there is combat at all was surprising.   Overall: 8/10
3237	1	a	You think Amnesia is scary?  Think again.
3239	1	a	I love this game. Nice puzzles to solve, nice story. Sorry Red :(  Also loved Black Plague but not Requiem, that was a disapointment. I guess thats why it's free. But definelty recommend the package for the first two games. Ä°t's worth paying for.
3241	1	a	Rough around the edges but still amazing .
3243	1	a	I'm a dog person but that first part made a bit come out. Headphones, no lights in the room, trust me you'll get the same reaction. These guys know their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3245	1	a	Despite being more of an adventure/puzzle game than a survival horror game, it does what it does very well, very intelligent puzzles that at the same time aren't too frustrating. The story telling is very good and makes you care about character you may or may not meet, and builds up to an even better story/game which is the black plague. 8/10 because the enemies are almost the same throughout the game and are very easy to run away from which takes the horror elements out once you get familiar with them.
3247	1	a	Not really scary when you get into the game.The story's good.Some puzzles are really hard.Overall a pretty good game! 8.5 outta 10!
3249	1	a	As a librarian, I love to see how things evolve into different forms overtime. I am an avid fan of horror games, and it was a treat to see how modern gems have stemmed from these classics.
3251	1	a	Deep puzzles and situations, genuine fear and isolation you'll never see another human for the whole of the game but it's that very part of the game that I loved. The 'hands on' mechanic where you have to do all the moving in the world by dragging the mouse makes you feel more part of the world you're stuck in. Penumbra: Overture is one of my favorite games from the same incredible company that made Amnesia: The Dark Descent which is probably the scariest game I've ever played and this is a stepping stone on the way to get you prepared for that.
614	0	a	Penumbra is like amnesia the dark descent Except that the graphics are bad. Except that the story is less intersting. Except that you can fight the monster with an horrible gameplay. Except that you get lost everywhere Except that the autosaves are at the wrong place  So if you like horror games, start with Amenesia the dark descent. Then if you liked this game and want some more, crawl the internet to find mods. But don't play Penumbra.
3253	1	a	Come on honey(dog) just love me
3255	1	a	(TL;DR at the bottom)  Eh, if I were to sum up Penumbra: Overture, I would call it a watered down version of Black Plague, wich again was a watered down version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. You can tell quite clearly that this was frictional's first attempt at a game, and I would say it's their weakest game (after AMFP of course). The mix of combat and stealth feels kinda off, like it was tacked on, as it feels incredibly stiff and uncontrollable (yes, I realize that's to highten the tension, but I'll get back on that). Because the combat just wasn't very playtested it seems, there are some pretty obvious exploits to make game incredibly easy and pop the tension like a balloon. For example, if you stand on top of a crate/barrel, you are invincible, and you're free to smack the living â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the dogs when they're trying to reach up to you. I found this exploit extremely early on and decided not to use it to get a better horror experience, but just knowing that I had this ridiculous advantage just removed the scare factor for me.  On top of that, overture suffers from the same thing as Black Plauge, wich is balance between horror and puzzles. Where BP improved a little bit on this front (I would say 65% puzzles and 35% spooks), Overture is more like a 80/20. Because of that, Overture doesn't really feel like a horror game (and even less so if you use the exploit mentioned). The entire game is laid out like this. There are about 3/4 large areas with puzzles to be solved in order, with most of the puzzles requiring an item on the other side of the area (I would guess to stretch the lenght of the game out). Now this would be fine if you had a constant mix of horror and puzzles like A:TDD, but in Overture you enter an area, kill the dogs, and then spend like 30 minutes solving the puzzles (though, a few places throw in spiders, and the last level with the giant worm. But again, these just aren't that scary, considering you have a small arsenal and the monsters are genuinely unfrightening, predictable and easy to overcome).   If you're a fan of puzzlers though, you'll feel right at home here, as Penumbra: Overture at heart, is a puzzle game with a spooky mid-tone.  TL;DR  Pros:  + Great atmosphere (at first, anyway) + Genuinely challenging puzzles + Alright story + Great voice acting + Superb writing (except for a few typos)  Neutral:  = Extremely heavy with puzzles = Ok graphichs (Quite muddy and low-res, but it gets the job done, therefore I didn't have the heart to list it as a con. The lighting is great aswell)  Cons:  - Short (3-4 hours) - The weapons are poorly implemented - Predictable and non-threatening enemies - Repetetive gameplay - Some odd level design here and there    I'm on the fence with this one. I mean, it's a good PUZZLE game, but not a good HORROR game. I'm just barely giving this one a reccomendation, as there are ways of playing that make it scarier, and it's stealth aspect, but if you're looking for horror, look elsewhere.  Overall: 6/10
3257	1	a	The best in the series I think. The game is by far one of the most fear striking games I've ever played. Name any other horror title - Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Condemned, The Suffering, FEAR, Doom, Clock Tower - None of them compare to what I felt playing this for the first time.  Your pride is on the line for this title, buy it, and don't think twice.
3259	1	a	Awesome! Puzzle esque horror game with great atmosphere &amp; story. 9.3333/10.
3261	1	a	Scare yourself silly.
3263	1	a	Wolf Hunting Simulator
3265	1	a	My name was Eric. I went to the snow. Found a hatch. I then found myself in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory!
3267	1	a	I managed to block a door with a couple barrels before a zombie dog got through. I then preceded to hurl insults at the dog ('Yeah thats right beotch, you dont want none of this').  The dog then blasted through the door and the two barrels blocking it and ripped me to shreds.  11/10 would face zombie dog John Cena again.
3269	1	a	After completeing this title a little over 5 months ago (After putting it off for a long time) --- I can quite honestly say: if you haven't played it, please do... Being the same developer, it is the direct spiritual predeccesor of Amnesia and, quite frankly, brought Amnesia to it's success. Without the technology developed from this small series, we wouldn't be experiencing the horrifying, dark, immersive 3D experience that we know today. This game never got that much credit, where much credit is due. I would LOVE to live to the day where survival horror saw more games akin to this. If you REALLY want the pants scared off of you - I'd highly recommend it's successor - Black Plague. 10$, you can't beat that price for such a beautifully crafted masterpiece.
3271	1	a	Run from the dogs: The Simulator  Haven't played Penumbra games as first Frictional game I played was 'Amnesia: The Dark Descent', which I really liked a lot. So going back to older Frictional games was quite odd.  Anyhow, game is horror'wise quite weak and the 'combat' is just horrific, but the storytelling &amp; puzzles make up for it. Considering this is first frictional games game &amp; it's almost 10 years old then this game is quite good. So obviously it isn't as polished gameplay'wise nor looks as amazing in comparison to newer Frictional games titles, but that was a great start and there are 2 more chapters to this game.  Though i found it easier to run &amp; lead dogs rather than avoiding them altogether. Seriously.. those damn dogs.. Ending was somewhat sad as well.   Want a game with interesting Puzzles &amp; Story then sure, play this game.  In a nutshell: +Interesting story +Great puzzles +Fitting atmosphere -Isn't as 'scary' as hoped for -Horrific combat  7/10
3273	1	a	With poor visual appeal, the whole game just screams 'LOW PRODUCTION VALUES' when compared to contemporary titles.  However, far from it for Penumbra to succumb to low-production values on every front, the voice acting of the characters is phenomenal. Coupled with the game's inherently interesting plot (for those who simply can't walk away from a narrative like this) Penumbra boasts a wonderfully well-written and well-made storyline.  It brings complex puzzle-solving gameplay with a pall of eeriness cast upon the game that leaves you wanting to take a few steps back every time you make one step forward.  In addition to this, right from the beginning, for those interested at all in analytics, the game harps, rather subtly, on human nature. Howard, Philip, Red, all well-animated characters (figuratively speaking... of course) provide the game with a less-than-subtle hint of humanity.  All in all one of the most well intriguing and captivating games I've played in quite some time.  
3275	1	a	Good puzzels , creepy stuff (if you don't kill all dogs with barrel like me...) and well written story. Red/10
3277	1	a	Great game, not that scary once you get used to it but the story is so damn good, it really drags you into it so that you can't stop playing. Definatly a recommendation for people who love story driven games with an eye for details.
3279	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first horror game, and game in general Frictional Games made, and it's a perfect start!  Story- In Penumbra Overture you play as Phillip, a 30 year old male Physics Teacher. Phillip, after his mother's funeral, gets a letter from his father, which contained 'pleas of forgiveness', but also the location of a bank Phillip had no clue exsisted, including instructions to destroy several documents that are held in said bank. When Phillip goes to pick them up, but he reads them rather than destroy them, because of human curiosity, and due to this he investigates more, eventually leading Phillip to leave his home on a 'grand' adventure. I'm not going to say anything else, The rest can only be learned if YOU buy the game and play it!  Gameplay- In Penumbra you have a few 'options' to combat the enemies (mostly dogs) that stand in your way. The game tells you that hiding and being sneaky is the only real option, however depending on the difficulty you CAN kill the enemies (which is a BIG flaw IMO) with hammers, dynamite, and more. While trying to avoid the enemies (or jumping around because you killed them all) you have to solve puzzles, and go to different locations. The puzzles are usually easy, I rarely found myself looking up solutions to them, as normally the answers are told to you if you READ THE INFORMATION THE GAME GIVES YOU. Make sure you ALWAYS search a room/area indepth.  I can't really think of anything else to say about the game, It's an amazing game, and a perfect start for Frictional Games, there are 2 more games in the Penumbra Series... Black Plague, and Reqium.  I recommend you get this game if your a fan of horror, adventure, puzzles, or you are a fan of Frictional Games! Always remember 'If fate frowns, we all perish'
3281	1	a	first game [prolouge] of the penumbra series, very good! I recomend playing this game first, I played black plauge first and I think you would absorb the INTENSE plot a little faster. this game series is like the precursor in the spirit of Amnesia the Dark Descent, and lemme tell ya, the plot of this series is on par if not superior imo to amnesia, very fluid gameplay and story. its a bit older yes, but its so optimizable its rediculous. buy this next time its on sale if ya got dosh its great.
3283	1	a	One of the best horror games i've played, but it does has some flaws.  On the bright side, the atmosphere is fantastic, the music and sound effects are really well made, it gives the game a constant feel of dread. I found myself scared to advance in several ocassions. Even though the game game has a interesting story, at the end it only raises more questions than answers ( but there is a sequel called Black Plague, i've played a couple of hours, so far so good). Also, the character named Red, is one of the best things in the game, and the voice acting was great. The physics based controls and gameplay are also one of the (and maybe the best) best things of the game.  As i said, the game has some flaws. The game is rather short. Unless you get stuck somewhere, you can finish it in under 6 hours. The combat is a major flaw, and my biggest complain. It is poorly made and barely effective. The best resource against an enemy will be to run like hell. Also, once you figure out how to kill an enemy, most of the suspense and tension gets lost.  Overall i recomend it, it's an interesting game, and even with it's flaws, is still very scary.  7.5/10
3285	1	a	Definitely for you if you are a fan of Amnesia-style survival/horror/puzzle games
3287	1	a	Penumbra Overture is the first entry in the Penumbra trilogy. While it lacks a diverse cast of enemies, has somewhat repetative level design among other trivial flaws, it serves as a solid exposition to the plot. It has memorable sequences and requires the player to think on their feet to survive and solve puzzles. If you are looking for a game that mixes action and puzzle, all while telling a great story in a creepy setting, this game is for you!
3289	1	a	Scaryish but doesn't run correctly on my computer at times.
3291	1	a	Great little horror series.
3293	1	a	 Penumbra: Overture , as the title would suggest, is the opening chapter of the first-person horror epic Penumbra, from the creators of Amnesia and SOMA.  Originally released in 2007, P:O was one of the early standouts in psychological horror, and laid the foundation for many of the concepts and mechanics that have come to characterize the genre, notably: a relatively weak, 'everyperson' protagonist who has no choice but to rely on running, hiding, and sneaking to avoid and bypass effectively invincible hostile creatures; consumable light sources that force the player to balance ability to see against likelihood of being seen, as well as exploration against safety; use of auditory and visual effects to communicate the emotional state of the player character; strong emphasis on immersive audio design; environmental puzzles that require the player to brave dangerous or disturbing situations to collect the necessary components and/or clues to solve them; and the application of the Lovecraftian principle that a nebulous suggestion, filled in by the player's imagination and dangled at the edge of awareness, carries much more potential for terror than something explicitly portrayed in graphic detail.  The story begins as the protagonist, Philip LaFresque, receives an unexpected letter from his presumed-dead father, urging him to destroy a set of cryptic documents. Upon investigating them instead, Philip applies his Library Use skill, discovers a reference to a mysterious location in Greenland, and, apparently armed with only a flashlight, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and his wits, sets off to uncover the truth.   In terms of gameplay, the player interacts very directly with the environment - doors and drawers are manually pulled open and pushed shut, levers manually raised and lowered, wheels manually rotated. In addition to H.P. Lovecraft, the game draws heavy inspiration from Half-Life - in terms of physical interactions, fans of board smashing, crate stacking, and barrel arranging will find plenty to like.   There's even a crowbar engraved 'Freeman.'    P:O is enjoyable and complete by itself, but its ending segues directly into  Penumbra: Black Plague , and players who enjoy the overture should definitely continue. The game shows its age graphically, but the Penumbra series's strong writing and eldritch atmosphere make it a classic for fans of Lovecraft and stealth/survival horror.
3295	1	a	Penumbra: Overture is a solid survival horror from Frictional Games. Everyone knows frictional games from the massively successful and terrifying Amnesia: The dark desecent. While I have played some Amnesia I personally really enjoyed Penumbra. While the graphics are dated, and Amnesia is overall a better experience, Penumbra delivers scares and is a really good starting point for the studio. It's cheap and short, and it is 100&amp; worth it, even if you are going back to it. It's a great game.
3297	1	a	   'The Origional Amnesia' 
3299	1	a	great game with a great challenge, the dogs man.......THE DOGS!!!!
3301	1	a	I started this just after finishing Amnesia, so unfortunately for me it had a 'been there, done that' feel. But it's worth your time if you have a survival horror itch to scratch.
3303	1	a	  dogs are scary... I like to play the game back and over... AGAIN
3305	1	a	THE WHISPERING NEVER SHUT UP!!
3307	1	a	This game is great! Everything about it! But you have to play in the dark and alone, great experience! It's a bit horror, but not jumping out of nowhere horror.
3309	1	a	I am being a sneaky snek getting spooked in this game
3311	1	a	Best game ever, required for the series. perfect storyline, perfect atmosphere, better than amnesia, absolutely amazing. by far the best horror game that was ever created.
3313	1	a	This is Amnesia's older brother, graphics and elements are OK but they really did a great job at creating a unchilling atmosphere, it's a creepy puzzle game!
3315	1	a	A truly materful work of horror where by the end the monsters trying to kill you are no longer the most terrifying thing!
3317	1	a	First chapter of the Penumbra Series.  After a mysterious note from his passed away dad, containing clues. Philip (protagonist) sets out to Northern Greenland to find out more about this mystery and the past of his father. I like the fact that the game takes place in Greenland. Deep down in a long abandoned mine. A very unique choice for a location. Being a with snow covered uninhabited place makes a perfect set for a horror game.  The beginning of the game got me right on spot. The story started off rather sad but had me curious about what was next. Was rather vague at first but piece by piece it started to connect. Not to forget that this is part 1 and part 2 will give even more depth to the story.  Every level has a couple rooms that contain valuable information and/or objects that you require to venture further. In between these rooms there are dark halls and corridors with danger lurking around every corner. Some levels have some very difficult puzzles that took me a while to figure out. It felt like an accomplishment each time I managed to solve a clue and make progress.  According to the developers, playing in the middle of the night with headphones will grant you a full immersive experience. I did as they say and it sucked me right in. Psychological horror at its finest. Not a lot of jumpscares to freak but mostly the atmosphere. And spiders. :) Have fun  
3319	1	a	there's some bad bugs/exploits in this game, but this game is pretty much superior to amnesia in every way 10/10 go play this right now
3321	1	a	I never thought I'd like a horror survival game, but this was great fun! The gameplay mechanics used in this game are fantastic and I wish more games used that style.   The storyline was quite good too. You get led through an underground mine by a man at the end of a radio transmitter. There's enough new things to find to keep you interested.   I didn't find it nearly as scary as I was expecting, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't jump every now and then. :P
3323	1	a	Best horror and puzzle game for all years ;)
3325	1	a	An excellent game, and a must play if you like terror games with immersive atmosphere.
3327	1	a	Like zombie-dogs and giant spiders? You sure won't after playing this game.
3329	1	a	Before Amnesia, there was Penumbra, a series of games that put you in the dark-cold caverns of a secret facility where many questionable things have occured. While not a blood and gore type of game, Overture makes the player feel very uncomfortable right from the start, throwing danger and death quickly into the player's path. While the controls are simple, some are quite difficult to master, such as utlizing a weapon to defend yourself. The number of enemies is limited to less than a handful, but despite this the game has you question your every movement, thanks to the help of a man-eating-giant-worm and the unstable areas of which you tracel. The atmosphere is good, the graphics okay, and the story is relatively puzzling. Unless you are too frightened, you will likely want to purchase the sequal.
3331	1	a	When playing a survival / horror game, atmosphere is definitely a key factor in immersing you in the game... which Penumbra Overture does just fine. Puzzles are simple tailoring the games' story line. The sounds are also simple yet enough to send chills down your spine.   What makes takes this game back is the stupid AI of the dogs and the awkard handing of the weapon.  Graphics ain't top notch but it's still worth a try to play the game.
3333	1	a	Simple game. Great game atmosphere, it really has that creepy theme or atmosphere; but not that scary.
3335	1	a	Beautiful game! Everything is amazing and beautiful! I just can't describe it... just play it!
3337	1	a	This is Amnesia's big daddy. Without this, it probably woudn't have happened (well, later). Some people like this more than Amnesia: The Dark Descent because of the story alone. But some people don't like (since the metascore is 73/100) because some people believe that the enemies encountered and how you can actually combat them back are... not good enough? Pretty bad reason to hate this game.  Buy it. Don't care about the other's opinions, try for yourself and see it is worth. Awesome atmosphere and experience.
3339	1	a	scary af
616	0	a	Yes, this RPG is 'old-school'. And believe me: I *know* old-school computer RPG's, which I've been enjoying since the Commodore Amiga days. So, I know what kind of hardcore design and grueling challenge and slogging gameplay I'm in for, with an RPG like this. But there's good old-school, and there's bad old-school - and this is *bad* old-school.  The best qualities of this game are its story and dialogs, and its dark, gritty atmosphere. The artwork and music are good, for an old-school game. The turn-based combat is okay (though I've seen far better). But it's all ruined (for me, anyway) by the ridiculous numbers of restorative potions you have to guzzle during and after combat, even if you play on the game's 'easy' setting. Not even in Diablo did you have to use and manage *this* many potions. There's the ubiquitous health potions and mana potions, but there's also stamina potions, which are the worst offenders.  Just about every action (especially the combat actions) requires a certain amount of stamina - and your reservoir gets used up quickly. (Running out of stamina in the middle of combat is a frequent and dire problem.) Once you've cleared an immediate area of opponents, you can stand around and do nothing, which will slowly regenerate your stamina. (Or you can switch to walking around at a snail's pace, but then your stamina regeneration is lowered to a glacial pace.) But there's no 'rest' key to press, to speed up the process. There's no 'camp' option, either. Nor can you trek back to town and sleep at an inn. (Although you can pay the priest there to restore all your health, stamina, and mana, but that gets to be prohibitively expensive, and he's way on the other side of town.)  So, you the player literally have to sit there, staring at the screen and waiting for your character's stamina to regenerate. Oh, you can go take a quick bathroom break or go grab something to snack on, or whatever, while your stamina regenerates, but the number of times you'll find yourself having to do this is beyond ridiculous. Really, the game pretty much *forces* you to rely on stamina potions - and lots of them.  There's also a heavy (albeit lesser) reliance on health potions and mana potions, and those too you'll have to upkeep in your inventory by the dozens as you continually burn through them. (And if you have a henchman or two, fighting for you, you'll burn through the health and stamina potions even faster! Because they need them too, as often as your character does.) You'll end up dedicating a third or more of your ample inventory just for upkeeping potions.  Eventually, you'll find magic items (rings, amulets, belts, etc.) that can speed up (by, say, 20%) the regeneration of your stamina, which helps a little. Other items will even allow you to ever so slowly regenerate health and mana. (Otherwise, health and mana do *not* regenerate at all!!) But those items are hard to find and prohibitively expensive, the first dozen levels or so of your character's progression. And even when you do acquire them, you'll continue having to burn through potions by the scores as opponents get tougher and exploration gets deeper and more protracted.  Well, after around 10 hours of gameplay (including trying first with a paladin and then re-starting with a rogue), I think I'm going to toss aside this computer RPG and move on to the next one in my queue. I've played more than enough of this type of game to know if it's worthwhile, and for me this one is not.
3341	1	a	Inquisitor, a dark medieval role-playing indie game that had been in development for 13 years before its official release. Therefore, you can expect to find the traditional indie RPG stuff with slightly better graphics (since the developers had time to improve them).  Let's start off with character creation. You can choose among 3 main characters: the Paladin, the Priest and the Thief. Each one has his own unique story despite the huge amount of customization in attributes and skills you have. Now, about physical appearance you can't change much. You are presented with 4 faces (or portraits) for each character and you can't neither change facial features nor the character's body details. Despite this fact, you'll realize that the absence of these possible changes won't even be noticed. You won't even be able to tell how the face of the characters look like and since every single item that you equip on your character is shown as you play, you can't tell if he has large shoulders, hairy legs or if he lacks a finger. Still in character creation, as I mentioned, you'll choose to use skill points and attribute points. But that's not it! There are 7 books of magic in total and depending on the character you choose, you can pick some of those schools of magic. There are 4 permitted schools of magic and 3 forbidden ones. I won't get in much detail here so you can explore this for yourself. You can, of course, choose your character's name and you're ready to go!  Inquisitor will take you to a fictional God's Kingdom on Earth and you're sent to Hillbrandt to investigate something for the Holy Mother Church. The way you do it is completly up to you. You can be a neutral investigator, you can follow every single God's rule during the Inquisition and you can even be an evil guy probably just looking forward to torturing innocent people for his own amusement. Yes, there's torture in this game! There are 4 torturing devices you can choose to use during the game, you can use all of them on the same person if you wish. But if you want to keep your allignement on the Good side, be sure that the culprit hasn't given you the information you want and that he's not innocent, otherwise you'll be hated even by your superiors.  This game is divided in 3 fantastic acts and it has a very deep story that will immerse you pretty easily. Now, the concept of story telling is based on dialog that you'll have to read. And trust me, you DO NEED to read everything! If you're expecting a game where you'll have shiny things to tell you that's where you need to go or that's what you need to find; if you're expecting colourful arrows on the ground or even someone telling you exactly where you need to go, then be advised, this game is not for you even if you like reading a lot. You'll be lost most of the times, not knowing where to go, so one thing you can do is explore the areas and dungeons hoping to find what you want. There lots of quests for you to complete and those quests are so well connected that the world feels really alive. You'll have main story-line quests and, of course, side-quests to complete. There are tons of dungeons and many areas, lots of monsters that keep respawning from time to time and heretics! The game is expected to last 150 hours or so to finish but it'll take you much longer than that, since you' re the one who has to do all the thinking about where to go or what to do in spite of having an in-game journal to help you slightly.  Graphically speaking, the world is beautiful despite all the evil and Hell spawns you'll fight. The areas are so detailed that sometimes I felt like just sitting back and enjoying the view. The artwork of the dungeons is gothic-like and it isn't like anything I've ever seen. The music is phenomenal and very well adapted to the areas you're in. The sound in general feels very realistic and the quality is so good that you feel like there really are flies orbiting your head!  The combat mechanics though are pretty standard and straight forward. There's nothing new to it. You have melee weapons of different types, ranged weapons, shields and throwing daggers/axes, lots of magic seals to use and spells from the various schools of magic you can learn. There's also the brewing skill for you to master if you're into that kind of stuff. If not, just buy the potions from the village merchants and you're good to go. You can learn the smithing skill to and many utility ones you'll find for yourself.  Now one thing that I both loved and hated was the difficulty level of Inquisitor. The game is insanely difficult, specially in combat! And that's fine, we all like some great challenges once in a while. But the most annoying thing for me was the dungeon difficulties. Those places sometimes are huge and they're filled with monters you've never dreamed about and despite that the 'boss' monters can kill your whole party with a single spell and you don't have any time to react at all! Imagine one of those 'big bosses' surrounded by 5 of the most difficult monsters of that dungeon....Yeah, exactly, pretty impossible. So, in that regard, I feel like sometimes the difficulty level of the game is unnecessary.  So, my personal rating for Inquisitor is 8/10! It is indeed the best of its genre in my opinion and the only big downside I can find is the insane difficulty that sometimes is just too much to bear. Even though the character creation is not special, it is pretty acceptable and it doesn't even influence anything at all (speaking of character appearence, of course). Now, go to the Realm of Inquisitor and uphold the laws of God in His Kingdom on Earth as you see fit! The heretics must be stopped otherwise the Holy Mother Church will and that can never happen!   Reviewer's note: when you level up, just press C already (character menu) and if you want to pick items up, press Alt, so you can see them easily by reading their names.
3343	1	a	I've only finished the first act so far, but that already has taken me nearly 20 hours to get through and the amount of reading and the depth of this game are fantastic. I definitely look forward to playing the rest of this game and would recommend it to any fan of neo-retro video games or serious role-playing game fans.
3345	1	a	Hardcore. Not for those with short attention spans, no time, weak willed or the illiterate. The amount of text and pace of the game might rankle some but persist and you'll find yourself enjoying a very well written and awesomely atmospheric iso RPG that while unforgiving means you feel genuine satisfaction when progressing the storyline or clearing an area of enemies.
3347	1	a	Inquisitor looks old, plays like and a 90's RPG and will be spewing very long blocks of text at your face. If that doesn't turn your off, keep reading because there's much more to it than that.  You can kind of guess this game is going to take some time to finish from the get go and that impression would be right, I'm only around 20 hours in and there's a lot to do and a lot to see. In the first act, you're helping the local branch of the church to solve several cold cases of mysterious murders and unexplained disappearances, tracking down heretics and allies of the devil. The game takes the form of a really old school isometric RPG, not too dissimilar from Arcanum. You will be wandering into an original world mixing a middle-age central europe setting with medieval-fantastic aspects. Think 'The Name of the Rose' meets 'Lord of the Rings'.  The game will have you speaking to a lot of people to fill your journal with information and clues and to collect evidence, picking and using skill from your character sheet, selecting and equipping spells and managing your inventory. While the mouse driven interface can get a little bit confusing, hiding some vital parts of your character sheet under what looks like very small tabs on a 1080p monitor, you can use (and definitely should learn) the keyboard bindings for most actions.  The variety of items you will come across is just mind numing. From potions and spell scrolls, to weapons and armors, all items have different levels of quality, need to be repaired and maintained in working order, and combined to ensure your survival against the spawn of the devil and the creatures of the wilderness.  The combat, while on par with the 90's tech powering the engine, is nothing really exciting and can get quite frustrating if you're trying to use skills and spells on top of your trusty sword. The special effects (confusion, blindness...) while incredibly creative, can be very off-putting to say the least.  What really sets this title apart from the modern games that pretend to be RPG's today is the writing. Sure there's a lot of it but it's both well written (or should I say translated) but is also engaging an immersive. It's likely that you will want to know more about the world... and the NPC's will be more than happy to tell you all you may want to learn. I found the conversations with certain characters to be a reward in and of itself.  The music is nothing short of amazing, taking a really classical route with an early baroque feel, far removed from the generic post romantic and modern orchestral music. A choice fitting the universe in many ways.  It should be said that Inquisitor also does a better job at analysing the psyche of its character and reflecting some of the dark parts of the human condition much better than any other hipsterish indie non-game. Most of that exploration flows organically with the gameplay, the setting and the artistic direction of the game. Just for that I think anyone with a passing interest in character development in games should at least take a look at the first act of this game, just to see how to do it right.  I love this game and I would recommend it to anyone loving old-school RPG's, however, remember the introduction of this review, it might not be your thing and that's totally understandable.
3349	1	a	  â€œThe most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.â€    Inquisitor is a classic role-playing game experience that stands out from the usual RPG genre, because it does not hold your hand in any way. The storyline and most quests in this game provide only a few clues how to solve them. It will be up to you to collect all the information from the locals and connect the dots, until you have a clear picture of the situation.  The characters you meet alongside your journey will test your integrity, righteousness and moral standards. And on several occasions you will find yourself in the position, in your role as an Inquisitor, where you have to decide between the right way and the just way.  The strong role-playing aspects of each of the three classes in combination with the religious &amp; mystical elements create an authentic medieval atmosphere, including fantasy creatures in form of demons and other hellspawns. What this game lacks in graphics it gains twofold in detailed descriptions of events and NPCs throughout the game.  While it provides the classic hack &amp; slash features, the combat is pretty simple and straight forward with little tactical depth. No voice acting, an inferior inventory system (e.g. no potion stacking) and the partially unbalanced combat mechanics should be mentioned as further disadvantages of this classic RPG.  Overall, if you are willing to get over the initial hurdles of an antiquated graphical presentation and some inconsistencies during combat, there is a very deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. And there is something rather refreshing about being an Inquisitor that is not the good Samaritan.    Amusing quotes:    â€œThe worst monsters of all are the people, Father. Of course you could admit that orcs and other hellspawns are Satanâ€™s brats longing to dip their fangs and claws into human flesh, but believe me, people are much more dangerous. The people who cast away faith and are worshipping idols, mammon, fornication and bloodshed. When you meet an orc you know your lifeâ€™s in danger. But when you meet a man, you canâ€™t be sure although heâ€™s smiling today, he wonâ€™t cold heartedly murder your own daughter tomorrow. Believe me, Father, beware of people!â€    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Inquisitor (PC) Role-playing game + hack &amp; slash  (Dark Fantasy) â€“ 2009
3351	1	a	Inquisitor provides one of those rare experiences of satisfaction and achievement in gaming. It doesnâ€™t hold your hand, it doesnâ€™t overcompensate for impatience, and it is not a title a small child will be successful in. What it does have is brilliant atmosphere, an engrossing story, intricate plots and intrigue and requires you to really think about what your next move should be. The obvious time and effort the developers put into the title completely makes you forgive them for the often frustrating combat mechanics and steep learning curve. Inquisitor is the Dark Souls of isometric RPGs.
3353	1	a	I took a long look at some of the negative reviews and if you have read those there are some things you should consider. First off there is quite the learning curve to this game so if somone has less than 40 hours played I wouldn't trust their positive or negative review.  When I first got this game I spent about 20 hours starting, then stopping, then picking it up again. I restarted several times (an ARP curse of mine) finally, nearly, beating the first act with the thieft on hard difficulty. I reformatted my computer shortly after, lost my save file and hadn't played the game in almost a year. About two weeks ago I started a paladin on Normal difficulty and am about half way through the second act and going strong.  This game presents one of the most mysterious, yet compelling stories out of any game I've ever played. This is its biggest pro in my opinion. Once understood and givin proper time, the combat is okay. Not great, but not bad. I'll give a list of pro's and con's:  Pros: -Story is deep, mysterious and as you uncover more secrets extremely rewarding. -Well written and well thought out. -Unique Spells that serve you in interesting ways. -Unique and well written music. -If you actually read the novel length dialogue, characters are MOSTLY interesting.   Cons: -Loot system is on the con side of things. Pretty generic and seems, so far, that there are things to look for and things to ignore. -If they are going to leave the potion system the way it is, please, just please, let me stack them. -Duribility on gear is poorly designed and should be revisited imo. -Buggy. Nothing game breaking but enough to force you to save and restart the game a few times during a session.  Conclusion: If your looking for a unique story, good music, and decent gameplay arpg give this a shot. If you can be patient through the learning curve you'll be happy you gave this game a shot. It offers many hours of gameplay. I would guess im about half way through (could be off there) and I'm about 45 hours in. 7/10.
3355	1	a	Inquisitor is a stange game. Aesthetically  it is not particularly pleasing, considering we have titles like Diablo III, Tochlight, Torchlight 2, Grim dawn, Titan quest etc. Visually speaking this is comparable to Diablo I and II and even then that may be a stretch. This game contains insuferable amounts of lore, text after text of information that honestly most of us could do without. However, It wins on it's story and the intrigue the story brings. The amount of control you have over how to manage your charecter is nice. The ability to customize stats and skills is refreshing when playing an on rails AARPG like Diablo III.  I would recomend this for those of you who are not scared of hard games with a steep learning curve. Graphics are also a downfall so don't expect it to look pretty. The story (if you love story driven games) Is fantastic and is its primary selling point.  Ticklepants
3357	1	a	Inquisitor is a great old-school RPG game for those who wish to step in the boots of an medieval inquisitor solving crimes against God and King. The game is a little tough from the begining since you don't have many good items or money, but that can be quickly solved. The game has many maps with a nice number of dungeons crawling with enemies waiting to be hacked to pieces. The story of the game is long, exciting, full of twists and turns and can really suck you in. The quests may be a little hard since you practically have to do everything from scratch (You start from zero just like a real detective investigator) but when you solve them they give you all the more pleasure for doing so. The combat system is simple to understand, hard to master and unfortunally a little buggy and unbalanced but that shouldn't be a problem. I would recommend this game to every true RPG player. In short: + Storyline + World + Variety of texts, weapons, armor &amp; spells - Combat system - Difficult quests (but this is the charm of the game, should be under +)
619	0	a	Drink all the potions, run away to slowly making it to the edge of the map where you can fast travel (seriously, leaving a dungeon midraid is such a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥), so you can buy more potions while unloading all the useless crap you picked up, so you can go back into the dungeon to drink more potions while braving hordes of orcs. Oh, and don't forget to repair your equipment. Just one more tedious aspect of this game. The whole inquisition/investigation thing is interesting, but the automap and quest log aren't very clear about where things are. This makes for a lot of aimless wandering, looking to see if you missed an NPC. I also recommend knowing how to pick locks, because bashing open a chest or a door takes forever: your character frequently misses (it's a door, how can you miss it?) and does little damage. Also, once you turn down a quest you can't take it back up again. So if you're a roleplayer, and you turned down a quest because you didn't think your character would care that some dude's wife is missing, you won't be able to start investigating her once it appears the missing woman is actually at the center of a sinister conspiracy. If you liked Diablo, you may enjoy this game. But it's not that great.
3359	1	a	This game is a dark deeply made game that is spooky and hard, nice old school feel to everything. but this game is bugged and you cant change yhour key bindings if this thing was stable it would be incredlible.   truly a shame for such a wonderful piece of art, but it does play stable for some. please dont let me deter you from buying this game.  to the developpers TAKE A MOMENT AND FIX THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE, YOU WILL BE DOING THE WORLD OF RPG A FAVOR !
3361	1	a	Wow, I just finished this game after almost 200 hours of gameplay, (197 to be exact). The game does not necessarily take that long to complete but I really enjoyed it and wanted to explore every dungeon, kill every enemy, read every detail of the story and lore of the world, and complete every side quest. Honestly, it could probably be completed in 140 to 150 hours. This very involved, isometric, action RPG offers a lot for your money and has a very engaging story. It takes place in a fictitious continent strongly modeled after medieval Europe, with a theological system loosely based on Roman Catholicism. The name of Jesus is changed to â€œThe First Prophet,â€ but there are crosses and crucifixes decorated throughout the game.   Without giving away any of the story, you are a paladin, priest, or thief, (your choice) who is asked by emissaries of the Holy Mother Church to investigate a gruesome murder in the northern territory of Hillbrant. From that starting point, you are drawn deeper into a dark, heretical plot that goes all the way to the capital itself. An evil centuries old plot is underway that involves black masses and demon resurrections. Heretics are planning to summon Satanâ€™s four chief demons into the world who in turn plan to reek chaos as well as having other intentions that I wonâ€™t give away. The story, while quite graphic at times, dealing with such issues as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, necrophilia, Satan worship, torture, ect., is incredibly engaging and gradually unfolds and reveals itself to the player over the course of three acts, spanning three areas of the continent. Each of the three acts is nicely balanced between combat and story.   In the story part of the game, you act as an inquisitor for the Holy Mother Church and you need to talk to everyone in order to gather clues so you can determine who the heretics are. Once you gather enough evidence, you can extract confession by means of torture and then burn them at the stake. The combat system is, in my opinion, the weakest part of this game. It is quite clunky and initially, (until your character builds some dexterity) will result in the majority of your strikes missing. It takes getting used to as it is not as fluid as other action RPGs. But once you get the hang of it and you build your character, it is just fine. Fortunately, one thing you will not have to do in this game is grind for experience points and gold to build your character. Each of the three acts is divided into various areas that you must explore and clear of enemies. Once the enemies are cleared, you do not have to wait for them to respawn and repeat killing the same enemies over and over again for experience, (only a very small percentage of enemies respawn anyway). Clearing each area once will provide more than enough experience to build your character sufficiently to progress through the game. But keep in mind, this game is HARD. The battles are not easy at all, especially the ghosts and specters that are introduced to you in act II, (which require magic to beat â€“ since I was a paladin and weak at magic, I had to use flame sword and seals) and the werewolves introduced in act III. You will find that fighting monsters in groups is a bad idea and most of the time you will have to resort to hit and run tactics where you slowly walk up to a group of enemies, lure one or two away from the group at a time, and kill them individually. If you are anything like me, you will be using that tactics for most of the game. Also, even though this world is strongly modeled after medieval Europe, they also mix traditional rpg monsters and mythology in the mix such as orcs, trolls, ect., explaining them as hellspawns, remnants of a dark and foreboding pagan world long since conquered by the true faith, or monsters summoned in black masses, ect. Of course, there are also plenty of demons from Judeo-Christian and gnostic literature as well. It makes for an interesting mix.   I found the magic system in the game to be impressive, not so much because it was terribly complex, but for the fact that a world modeled after medieval Europe, where magic would be considered heretical, would have a magic system at all. On top of that, there are in fact SEVEN schools of magic in the game, each one consisting of spells that are each given their own history and background, (as are all the items in the game!) If you choose to play the game by the rules as I did and be obedient to the Holy Mother Church, then there are four approved and sanctioned schools of magic that could better be described as feats of faith and divine intervention. There is magic of faith, magic of miracles, divine magic, and inquisitional magic. If however you choose to dabble in heresy, (at risk to your own soul), then you can also learn pagan, heretical, or the ever dreaded Luciferian magic. Playing as a paladin, I didnâ€™t get to use too much of the later levels of magic, but what I used was quite effective in the gameplay.  So my assessment of this game is that it was very engaging, very involving, very well written with a fantastic story, and quite lengthy. Be prepared to invest some time into it. The mechanics of the game were quite rough around the edges and takes some getting used to. You will get stuck often, and when you do, the GOG and Steam forums will prove to be a God send. One thing that this game requires a lot of, (throughout the entire game but especially around the beginning) is that you carry LOTS AND LOTS of health, stamina, and (if youâ€™re a priest) mana potions with you at all times. You will find that dungeon exploring consists of you getting as far into the dungeon as you can until you run out of potions, (which you will burn through quite quickly), making your way back to the surface, buying more potions, and progressing further into the dungeon. Get use to that cycle. Also, there are a few bugs in the game that have yet to be polished out, all of which you can find solutions for on the GOG and Steam forums. One bug in particular that effected some players, (including myself) involved a crucial NPC named Tinthan who is necessary to complete the main quest, not always showing up where he should be in act II, thus not allowing you to progress in the game. If that happens to you, itâ€™s an easy fix that can be resolved by typing the following console command:  - Press ~ (next to 1) - Type \addbeing_afriend Tinthan -1 -1 - Press â€œenterâ€ - You can also find the solution here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/where_is_thintan/?search=Tinthan   This game has tons of atmosphere, lots of charm, and gives you many unique options and story driven tasks. Its soundtrack adds to the atmosphere very well and comes with the game. It sets the mood well and I even put it on my iPod. Throughout the course of the game, you will fight for or against Satan, defeat corrupt priests who sold their souls, perform exorcisms, summon the dead, summon genies, (save them for bosses â€“ trust me), torture heretics, explore a continent, read a novel, and of course, (my personal favorite) rescue damsels. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and have fun.
3363	1	a	I do not usually play isometric RPGs, or in this case, aRPGs. I have tried to get into Diablo and Diablo 2 back when they just came out, but it was something about the game relying on loot more than storyline that gave me the wrong feeling about it.  Now, this game is similar to Diablo, I agree, but that is only at the first glance. As you look deeper, it actualy is very true to the roots of proper Medieval RPGs. The atmosphere is grimdark enough to be comparable to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout 1. The world is very hostile, and you will get your a.s.s. handed to you on hourly basis.  The art and overall design is done with great detail. The developers have lovingly and beautifully drawn every little bit of scenery, monster part and menu art so graphics-wise the game is quite pleasant despite being two dimensional.  The quests have good depth in terms of narrative and plot twists and there is no right or wrong ending for majority of your investigations (main quests are very non-linear in this aspect, it is quite similar to L.A. Noire - you never feel 100% sure about your decisions). You can easily accuse the wrong person of heresy or behave in a non-christian way and face the consequences of your actions later in the form of a reward or an enemy ambush.  All in all, I never thought that I would like this sort of old-school aRPG style of games, but this one is done so well, that its atmosphere conveys the roleplaying aspect much better than most FPS shooters with RPG elements. I'd say that you truly feel like the character you are playing.   The only real disadvantage when compared to modern RPGs that I've noticed, besides the obvious aged look, would be that the inventory system isn't designed to be user-friendly. For example, your potions take up sometimes 2/3rds of your inventory space, and that is just for a single trip to one level of the dungeon on lower player character levels. It gets better as your character gets more experienced, but the need to buy a few dozen potions just to safely roam PvE areas never really disappears.
621	0	a	This game in one word : TEDIOUS  First of all, the good points of the game : 3D iso old school RPG, interesting story (at first at least) with some well thought mechanism such as the whole idea of invastigating, torturing and burning evil citizens.  Now, the cons.... the first you see in game is the awkward combat system. Well you basically spam blindly and it works (kinda) - I should add I played this game as a caster. Not enough to make a bad game, right. You want some more ? Ok ! So, let's talk a little more about the combat. You begin as a total weakling : your spells hit no more than on time on 5 or 6 and do ridiculous damage. And then you pass from lvl 6 to 7 (or 8 to 9 don't remember) and you become a divine incarnation who OS every mobs.... at least till the end of the first act (well technically you do continue to OS every mobs in the second but that's for later). The companions you can gather are at first invaluable as you just cannot kill mob alone in the beginning (they can)... and just as you become overpowered they become useless... no, more than useless.... a huge pain the back ! They are so useless you'll soon want them dead (as you cannot ask for a companion to leave).  Oh, I forgot to speak about game breaking bugs, like there's 'rank' depending on stats and skills levels, and item use and ability unlock as you progress... That is... IF the game accepts to acknowledge your progress. Often, even when you do meet requirements you would not have the rank granted. And the only thing to do is wait till you level up to spend another point in the skill and pray this time it will work. You just don't imagine the impact of this bug : basically it means you cannot equip the new items, use new spells or ability you need.  The quest system is awkward too : sometimes you need to do things in the proper order to unlock a dialog, sometimes you need to carry an item, sometimes just find it is enough... And there's never anything to guide you. The resource management is awkward too... you want to cast spell : wait. Regain HP : wait.   Well... all in all I had a pretty good time during the first act : you wander the areas around the town, explore dungeons, cemetery... resolving quests randomly, you delve a little into the story... And then you encounter the end dungeon of the first act. A HUGE pit mine with many many floors... so many you will need to do several round trip to the town to empty your bags and repair your stuff. And of course, to do the round trips you will be required to cross the entire dungeons with each and every floor. You just cannot imagine what it is like. Suffice to say the vast majority of players who where willing to give this game a try (and not discourage by the combat system, pacing and bugs) stop there.  And then the second act. You begin in a big town, I cannot judge the story as I stoped in there but it begins like the first act. No, the tediousness of this game stopped me there ! I thought the game will be less tedious after the big dungeon but no ! It's getting worse ! You will never have any space in your inventory due to potions managaement and the need to keep some very big clue you find for quests (oh but you do not know if it's usefull or not, nor when it will become usefull), and.... I was beginning to die again. Oh my char was still overpowered but I could not kill 2 groups of ennemies (and there's LOT of them) without my armor breaking, forcing me to either continue naked and dying from spiky damages, either do a round trip to town...   All in all the game shine by it atmosphere and some good ideas but that's all. All is tedious in this game : fight, use spells (why is there so few shortcuts ?), use items, carry items, companions management.... Too bad there was something to do here but this game miss the target...
3365	1	a	This is a game with very high qualities and very low shortcomings. If the glass is half full or half empty that is for you to decide....but in the end it is still a half full (or half empty) glass that you are served, keep that in mind. The highlight of the game is a very good story very well told, thick convincing atmosphere that stands way above the norm. The gameplay is a mixed bag, thats where the half full/half empty thing comes into play. There are many things that are very rough around the edges like the game areas that are very small and you can just exit them by mistake simply getting too close to the edge. The combat is difficult and requires using a neuron or two thats the good part, the bad part is that its still very rough around the edges, feels like it was made years before the first diablo. Gameplay-wise it feels less polished than similar Sega Genesis games back in the day, but it more than makes up for it with a fantastic story and atmosphere. If story and atmosphere (and a rather high difficulty level) sound appealing to you then go for it, its well worth the money even at full price. If polish and fancy are your cup of tea then stay away even on discount.
3367	1	a	It is exactly what it says in the game's description. It's brutal and unforgiving, and will genuinely challenge you. It has a great sense of immersion and depth. The combat is awesome, as you need to be focused to survive. Oldschool graphics - but you can't help but love the game for it.  I would definitaly recommend this, especially for the price tag!
3369	1	a	As stated earlier, potion drinking simulator. This game has a really bad combat system, companions are useless and are only used as meat shields.   9/10 writing - very well written 9/10 plot - very easy to like, a lot of twists and secrets 9/10 atmosphere - feels dark, bloody, demonic as intended 3/10 combat system - potion drinking simulator, really not what you're going to look for in this game 6/10 sound is satisfying - nothing out of the ordinary 
3371	1	a	It is a serious, demanding and unforgiving game with a unique setting and a dark atmosphere.  Tedious, frustrating and almost unbearable at the beginning, but enjoyable, rewarding and immersive from the middle to the end.
3373	1	a	A story driven isometric rpg, if you dont like to read a lot you probably wont like it.
3375	1	a	INQUISITOR! Yell it out in a funny accent that nobody in the living world actually possesses, and you will feel good about yourself. Do it over and over, because this game is really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good. It is extremely well written, something that makes you not give the smallest nugget that the excellent story is making up for the lower-grade graphics. INQUISITOR! (roll the R, roll the R) has the most refreshingly original subject matter I've seen EXECUTED PROPERLY in a game for a long time, and the actually mechanics of how you choose to solve the cases and mysteries you encounter are so far from anything else I've seen in what is essentially, a classic-style isometric RPG, that INQUISITOR! stands in a league of it's own to me. 'Why haven't you played 300hrs of it then?', I hear you ask. Well, it's because... IT'S REALLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HARD. My first playthrough I decided that I would try something a little different from what I usually do, and knowing that 'mages' are always the hardest class to keep alive, I set it to easy and picked the monk. Wrong choice. I died so many times I lost count and found myself quick saving every time I killed ONE of the plethora of monsters out in the wide world. The only reason I persisted was that the story was just THAT good. I played along long enough that the little deamon that lives in the back of my brain kept saying, 'If you're the good guy and you're torturing people for confessions, imagine how much fun it's going to be siding with the devil!' And so that is what I did. And it was glorious. And made me feel a little bad sometimes. But I got over it. If you like a challenge and you're looking for something really FRESH in the world of RPG's, buy INQUISITOR! You won't regret it.   OOOOOOO! There's a 'No' option for recommendations now! Time to review Sanctum of Slime...
3377	1	a	This game is actually really good. There is real depth to this game and like the diablo series randomly generated items ranging from potions to rings. It feels like a cross between Arcanum, Baldurs Gate, Diabo while making itself a rich experience of its own. NPCs either like you or dont and you unfluence dialogue by your skills or your choices. If you see this on sale its worth the the regular price, I grabbed this on sale thinking id get an hour but found this experience to actually draw me in over and over.
3379	1	a	Requirements to play this game: be masochist. Pros: - good story - 'old school' Cons: - still buggy as hell, getting stuck on the wall for the 1325th time starts to get annoying - heavily favors non-melee characters due everyone and their mom having some on-hit debuff which in most cases you can't dispel (not that it would matter anyway since they just re-apply it) - pots, pots, pots and more pots, either use 3/4 of your bag space for pots or prepare to return to town often, well you're going to hit the town often anyway since your bags will be full very fast - overpowered casters who can floor you faster that you can react - evidences that eat up huge bag space. I understand that stuffing 3 *BEEPspoilersBEEP* in a back bag would be rediculous in real life but in most games, quest items are on their own space  So then, recommended? Well being some sorta masochist, I finished the game just because I don't like to give up. I know some will like this game, I did here and there, but if you lack greater patience, don't bother. With no patience, you will end up whacking your keyboard to pieces and smacking your fist through the monitor. That being said, it's 0.89â‚¬ right now when I type this, so trying the game costs you next to nothing.
3381	1	a	This game supposedly took 10 years to make and it shows, firstly by how dated the graphics are. If you can't stand older graphics then stop right here and find another game. Another way it shows the 10 years, though, is by how much sheer content the game has in it. The dialogue in this game is almost exhaustive. So much to learn from almost every NPC in every town, all of it well written I should add. The combat is what you're expecting, simple, not too complicated. The music is great and thematic whilst the sound effects are mostly okay but can be offputting (women moan when you speak to them.) Overall I recommend this game to people who enjoy reading and being immersed in a game's world. This truly feels like a living world and if you decide to embark on this journey, make sure you have a lot of time on your hands and a willingness to take things slow.  TL;DR Version:  Graphics - 3/10  Gameplay - 8/10  Audio - 4/10  Replayability - 7/10  Story - 10/10  Polish - 9/10  Overall - 7/10
3383	1	a	This game achieves a more completely immersive atmosphere than most of the AAA, high-graphical games in my library. The limited color palette, the music, the sounds, the well-fleshed mythos and characterisations, even the somewhat bizarre UI- they all contribute to an overarching and deeply compelling feeling of doom. The setting is essentially an alternate medieval Europe in which demons and angels and monsters and spirits walk the earth, and the arts of magic and miracle-working are available to those willing to study. I chose the priest class, as I typically do when it's available- but this is no D&amp;D or WoW priest class. The character progression system is largely open. But its workings are esoteric and draconian, and I find it very rewarding to slowly understand and pursue possibilities. I turn and bless my companion before calling forth lesions on the skin of enemy: the process is largely invisible in-game beyond some floating numbers, but the narrative elements pull it together so perfectly that I am absolutely convinced. Yes, combat involves drinking lots of potions. And yes, the game involves a lot of reading. There are occasional minor mistakes in the translations but frankly the writing is far better overall than it is in most American games, and the mysteries and characters are more well-constructed than an any but the best point-and-click murder games, not to mention your typical rpg. This is NOT an action game. It is a brooding, creeping, sturm-und-drang literary roleplaying mystery game. And I highly, highly recommend playing it.
3385	1	a	Soon after I found out about this game I was drawn to it, and I got it on Steam and started playing. The story pulled me in. I enjoy the atmosphere,darkness and incredible music. I recommend this game to those who enjoy a challanging and rich story driven rpg. This game isn't for casual gamers and it does have some frustrating bugs that I run into every now and then. I've had a blast with Inquisitor.
3387	1	a	Recommended for fans of old CRPGs from Infinity Engine era and beyond. The developers really managed to make a game resembling that golden age and keep it highly playable. Story is slow, but interesting, adding the fact that it mixes true history with fantasy. If you've heard this game has tons of text in it, then you've heard it right: huge amounts of texts and little to no voice acting to give it that extra flavour we got so used to. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that many NPCs say essentially the same things with different words regarding specific topics, you'll want to read it all if you're really involved in it. Combat is your regular d20 and functional, but as all things in this game, visuals incuded, it feels a bit dated. Still, a wonderful nostalgia trip.
625	0	a	Potion drinking simulator. Good writing but once you get into combat area's it's fight, get poisioned, drink potion. Couldn't take it anymore. Usually finish games like this. Hardest CRPG I've played just because of it.
3389	1	a	If you've ever typed 'tl;dr' then don't bother buying this game. However, if you're willing to invest some time and attention, this game is worth it.
3391	1	a	I bought this game in some bundle before 1 year. I don't install it after i bought it. And i made a big mistake. It's a perfect game with a long story and exciting gameplay.
3393	1	a	Good game. Took an orcs scalp and his friend killed me.
3395	1	a	One of the best games that I have. If you like real roleplaying, you should buy it.
3397	1	a	I got  Boots of Saint Baudolino  for reading through bunch of text! 10/10, Instant classic!  Now the snark is out the way, I'd argue that playing Inquisitor in the year of our Lord 2015 really  is  a surprisingly enjoyfull experience and I'm immersed entirely in the atmosphere and the world.   Yeah, it's... curious to play such a game precisely now. We've got Pillars of Eternity, Divinity - OS and Wasteland 2 that are true heralds of the modern renaissance of the classical text-rich, immersive isometric(-ish) WRPG and still more beautiful games like Tides of Numenara to come, and playing Inquisitor feels extremely similar and evokes the same good pleasure responses like playing any of those games, or reading a great rich fantasy novel.  Sure, graphics show it's age and are nothing to celebrate, but the updated UI and modern resolution support make playing it an enjoyfull enough experience and deep world-building and atmosphere are (so far) top notch and I don't see any truly meaningful differences in playing Inquisitor from reading Wasteland's descriptions, enjoying PoE's diverse dialogue trees, or being delighted by unexpected char perk from making some decision in Divinity.   Yes, I recommend it.  Cause it made me exclaim in tiny sweet delight for obtaining those before mentioned boots and for hearing an interesting story.. erm.. to boot. Cause I leveled up by two levels solely by killing bats around the first hub area. Cause I was then experiencing sweet 'agony' of choice - where should I spend the points - in stealth, or in thieving. Cause I got to be the medieval detective and because of it I got to hear at least 10 different ways of different people saying somebody had his   manhood/â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥/genitals/Willy/unmentionables/...   stuck in his throat. Cause playing it I get the same feeling I get from (subjectively) the best game I've ever played - Fallout 2.
3399	1	a	Recommend? Hmmm...  If you get it on sale you may like this for the interesting plot (i.e. you don't really know initially who the heretics are, and how to get the proof against them). Overall, it feels like a badly implemented cross between Icewind Dale and Diablo 1, with less side quests than IWD but more plot depth than D-1. Also, character advancement is pretty rapid, you can easily get over Level 20 or so in ACT 1.  But: - Graphics are VERY outdated for a 2012 game, looks like a much older game that hasn't aged well - UI is pretty clunky (no sort in inventory, etc.) - Limited types of weapons, armor, etc. - Balancing seems off: melee/ranged combat can be far to easy, but as soon as you meet multiple shamans/mages, it can get surprisingly dificult, with your main character becoming confused within the 1st second of combat. Poison works for an ungodly length of time with few counters, etc. - Few 'side' quests - Income is very limited compared to cost of consumables - Many game design decisions are... well... let's call them old-school (no Town Portal spells or similyr)  May still be considered OK for a low budget production. Without the storyline it would not be recommended at all.
3401	1	a	Inquisitor is an old-school RPG with a unique setting and gritty style. It was fun to play but its grindy and often needlessly confusing nature spoiled the immersion for me somewhat. I would not recommend this game to someone who wasn't already in love with classics like Baldur's Gate, NWN, etc., as it's a difficult game to get into initially, but if you still enjoy those top-down RPGS and are hungry for something new, Inquisitor may scratch that itch. If RPGs are a hit-or-miss thing for you or if old-school gameplay with all its muddiness is a turn-off, however, this game will probably not be your thing. 6.5/10
3403	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It has immense, richly developed lore. Every last God-forgotten potion, or minor item, has imaginative description, just like in Baldurs Gate. Dialogues are good and non-lianear, you can side with or against many NPCs, you can choose to befriend them, torch them in a Holy Flame or let them loose. General mood and gameplay are close to Diablo 1, very dark and intriguing. So, my concusion is that this is not some cheap attempt at depth, as it may seem simply because this game is being sold at 80 percent off very often. This is actually a finely crafred RPG, which may appeal to both BG and Diablo camps of gamers.  EDIT: This game is my nomination for first Steam Awards in category Best Unknown Game.
3405	1	a	Great game! Tough as Hell. Even as a priest I used more seals than magic... until I hit magister levels, and those high-level spells changed the game. Takes a while to get some good old-fashioned AoE spells. Pagan magic rocks!
3407	1	a	Harkens back to the good old days of Arcana: of Magick and Steamworks Obscura. Writing in the game is thoroughly developed and well writen. Very old school DnD-esque; if you like that sort of thing.
3409	1	a	Great old-school game. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s will hate it. Thats all. BUY. IT. NOW.
3411	1	a	You stand at the precipice of eternity, the darkness ever encroaching. You must keep the faith, less you be lost to those who bear the mark of the beast, orcs, Murderers, rapists, beastmen, or Daemons who've found their way into our world through the fornification of men with the great enemy.  'Trust no one, not even yourself. It is better to die in vain than to live in abomination.'  Inquisitor is an old school journey through a 13th century world beset by the ruinous powers of Satan, himself. It is your task, to root out this evil wherever you may find it, sparing no tool in your mission to defeat the depravity you will encounter. The breadth of your search will take you from small hamlets to great metropolises, but do not be fooled, evil cloaks itself both in stygian shadow, and obfuscates the less than stalwart gaze with the glow of the light.   May God be with you, nothing less will suffice.
3413	1	a	I came in with fairly low expectations, but was pretty impressed. It is a bit of a diablo clone and the graphics might not be the most up to date. However, the graphics never detracted from the game for me and I found the story/writing quite well done.
3415	1	a	This game is Called Inquisitor or by the player name: Potion chugging simulator and you also get to torture heretics in dungeons and later burn them in the pyre! The story starts with a mysterious murder of a merchant in a small village called Hildebrant and you lead this investigation under the command of the local Inquisition and church.  
3417	1	a	I spent the first 45 minutes killing bats and collecting treasure. I can't wait to begin torturing people.  9/10.
3419	1	a	If you love your hardcore old-school RPG's and all the good and bad that goes with em, you will love this game.
3421	1	a	an extreemly enjoyable game, i'm only a little way through it and i love it, the story is suberb, the art is great (though ver VERY dated but i dont have a problem with that) its enjoyable, very much, it gives a real sense of achevement when you finish a quest or get some evidence, or burn a heretic, altogether a great game, and the soundtrack is wonderfull, the gamplay is good, and the story is compelling it takes the idea of an RPG back to its roots and does it great justice, in summary get it if you love story and atmosphere, the deluxe edition is just excelent with the books and art books and the soundtrack is angelic, so yeah, its great
3423	1	a	Saw this game on STEAM sale, got it for my steam collection played it, finished and reviewing it.   Graphically the game isn't ground breaking and it's nowhere near to any of the modern RPGs that we see nowadays. Combat system is also not very appealing but it does the job but skill system really is interesting and feels somewhat unique. Music/Background score is awesome it does feel eerie when you go to certain locations and changes according to the location and the mood of the scenario. The strongest part is the story. Yes if you wanna buy this game and wanna enjoy it to the fullest then you gotta read a lot. It has so much content to read in this game it can make a novel out of it. Thankfully I don't mind reading and enjoy reading if the content is good and definitely content here is no joke. There are some logical explanations too given but that'll be spoiler if I explain them here. If you wanna play a game that has interesting story and tons of quests to do which are mostly related to the main story arc then this game is for you.  Mind you this game is not casual ARPG fans. You will not get directions, no indicators to complete your quests and combat is painfully difficult at the beginning. But once you understood how things work then it is going to be a rewarding experience and trust me you would ask for more. I recommend this game to only serious ARPG fans , those who can invest some time and play it with patience or else just stay away from it.
3425	1	a	The worst parts: grind and not figuring out some of the more obvious things like hidden floor tiles you could easily see, and items you need to destroy in order to advance in quests.  The best parts: lore, the feeling in game, not pampering &amp; spoiling the players like Diablo series, you can actually find yourself spending some time thinking maybe, a lot of stuff to do, not short game if you dont want to rush through and skip lore.  It's not polished like Diablo series and controls are a bit more off, but it's good and easy to get used to even in demanding standards (I just didn't get used to GTA V autoaim nor manual aim for example but this was no problem).  One issue is memory leak, you need to restrart the game every 1-4 hours, but that's kinda good so you wont find yourself zombified IRL lol
3427	1	a	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.
3429	1	a	Not polished, but brimming with content. A solid choice for patient players on the lookout for an oldschool, dark, atmospheric RPG! I rcommend it.
3431	1	a	A nice RPG to kill time with, it has a beautiful isometric art style to compliment it's mechanics similar to Baldur's Gate.
3433	1	a	Diablo Crime Scene Investigators. You basically have to hunt down heretics before they destroy the world. You also learn about Christian mythology.
3435	1	a	Overall pretty neat game.   Great story, lots of dialogue. Art is great. A lot of small details. Tons of side quests.  Takes a good time to beat over 90 hours if you do everything possible. Can be difficult of you don't spend your skills wisely etc.   Play as an inquisitor and save the realm from evil.
3437	1	a	Interesting Game
3439	1	a	Good story, you can actually torture people and burn them on stakes, could definitely use some polishing though, combat is the worst too (hit a monster, gulp a stamina potion, get hit by a monster, gulp a health potion, repeat)
3441	1	a	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.  The gameplay seems ok, except I wish it was less action-oriented, but that is just a personal preference which I can overlook considering I also enjoy games like Diablo. What I enjoy most about the game is the lore and premise of the story, there is a lot of reading to do, so if you don't like to read you probably shouldn't get the game. What I enjoy most is the part of the game that doesn't involve fighting and the combat. I still don't mind it too much, but I dislike some aspects of the gameplay and the game doesn't help you along enough with certain information about it, along with other aspects of the game, most of which I can disregard.  I am eager to play this game more but personally am not that crazy about the style of combat and gameplay associated with that; my dislike of the combat might be explained by the fact that I haven't gotten very far in the game and it is more punishing at first, but rewarding later. I think it's a special game and deserves significant recognition for its writing and the unique universe the developers created, which I would like to explore more of, not only because of the writing though but also because of the overall atmosphere of the game. The music is great also, and the game doesn't look too bad and is fine at higher resolutions. Inquisitor has that classic RPG thing going, but not just for the sake of it being classic or old, it just works out that way.
3443	1	a	great game but i think most of the bad revews are from people who can't play old rpgs but great game story great
3445	1	a	I read about a comic books worth of text within the first minute. Then I burned someone.  Game doesn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around.
3447	1	a	Drinking potions simulator :)...really the game needs a serious rebalance; but its very addictive, story and setting are very intriguing, and the gameplay has some nice features like arresting and torturing humans muahaaha
3449	1	a	This isn't Diablo. This isn't Diablo II, This isn't Baulder's Gate. This is Inquisitor. One of the best isometric RPG's of its genre. If you don't like reading and RP'ing experiences then go play something else. Its a classic oRPG with elements found in other like games.
3451	1	a	An interesting game with dark and light humour, and freedom to choose as you will. Great game for its age.
3453	1	a	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.

3455	1	a	Very old school, very fun. Hits you right in the nostalgia.
627	0	a	I wanted to like it, and the story seemed interesting, but the author has made some terrible gameplay tuning decisions which prevented me from enjoying it.
628	0	a	This fell short of the 'epic' old school rpg it promised to be. The combat and spell system was generic and clunky. Everything seemed a little out of balance from combat to level progression to economy. Visuals were sub par and buggy. Couldn't quite make it through my requiste 10 hours of gameplay.  On an up note, the mood and setting was dark. The writing, though nothing amazing, had a gritty edge to it. The idea that you are and old school detective working for the house of God to uncover satan worshippers held promise, unfortuantly it didn't hold water (tap nor holy).
3457	1	a	A really interesting 'old school' Role Playing Game that is not as popular as it could be...as it has a really long and vast storyline filled with detailed texts and swell writing.
3459	1	a	Good old school rpg.
3461	1	a	One of Best RPG. Hard but with interesting story lane and nice quests and spells.
3463	1	a	Inquisitor is a great game! If you loved games like Baldurs Gate or Planescape Torment, you will be deeply satisfied by this game. It's long, it's challenging, it's detailed. The graphics are 2d but very atmospheric, and it got a gloomy organ soundtrack. Go, get it, NOW!
3465	1	a	It seems like a really cool game, but would the developers kindly look into the save game bug? I'm sure I'm not the only one plagued by it.
3467	1	a	A bit Glitchy but if you like an immersive and original rpg, this is your game. Buy it during a sale. It's a shame about the graphics and sound, but not bad for the price.
629	0	a	I want to like this game. I really do. I thought the concept was intriguing. The twists and turns of the plot so far are fun to navigate.  However, the combat mechanics don't work well. Even when I have the game on easy, and cheat (I'm a few hours in, and made myself level 100), the game kills me within ten minutes in the current dungeon. And, according to the walkthrough I found, it's a dungeon I should be able to get through at this point in the game.  There is a lot of lore for this game. So much so, it sometimes overwhelms me. I just scrolled through what people were saying and only paying attention when a 'quest added/updated' or 'journal entry added' message popped up.
3469	1	a	Meh. That's the feeling that Inquisitor leaves me with.
3471	1	a	.
3473	1	a	Well finding it for 0.89â‚¬ a few months after buying it for 10â‚¬ kinda hurts. Still good game if you enjoy the genre tho.
3475	1	a	This game looks awesome... If you can bear with the slow walking speed of your character... I feel bad, but I just can't. DAMN TOO SLOW.
630	0	a	The setting and writing are very nice, and the mechanics on screen are interesting, some variation of d&amp;d games like baldurs gate, yet the game fails to deliver badly due to combat mechanics being broken beyond repair. Specifically stamina. All the rest of stuff could be forgiven somehow, but stamina is a deal breaker. You burn stamina like there's no tomorrow, and constitution doesnt help much beyond increasing your initial stamina pool by a bit, which again, burns after the first mob you face. After that you have to wait forever or be hopeful you brought enough dozens of potions, otherwise its a trip back to town. All of this on easy,  I shudder to think how crap the combat would be on on the hardest difficulty, the designer only played the game as a caster.  And that helped by the mobility issues that can be tolerated: Your character acts at a snail pace due to d&amp;d-like rules being applied in real time, it can be tolerated because for movement you can invest on speed, and for other actions it is not THAT bad although an attack speed attribute would have been cool to have.  All in all, once I started fighting less time than going back to town for supplies I decided the game writing was not worth the pain and bugs, and crap. Sad because it looked promising, check the forums, no more fixes to mechanics or bugs, game is dead. Do not play, it's a waste of time.
3477	1	a	Brilliant! Done with the soul. True Hardcore CRPG. 10/10 Diabouls. / Ð‘Ñ€Ð¸Ð»Ð»Ð¸Ð°Ð½Ñ‚! Ð’Ñ‹Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¾ Ñ Ð´ÑƒÑˆÐ¾Ð¹. ÐÐ°ÑÑ‚Ð¾ÑÑ‰Ð°Ñ Ð¥Ð°Ñ€Ð´ÐºÐ¾Ñ€Ð½Ð°Ñ ÐšÐ¾Ð¼Ð¿ÑŒÑŽÑ‚ÐµÑ€Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð Ð¾Ð»ÐµÐ²Ð°Ñ Ð˜Ð³Ñ€Ð°. 10/10 Ð”ÑŒÑÐ²Ð¾Ð»Ñ‘Ð½ÐºÐ¾Ð².
633	0	a	They call it hardcore RPG. I've played most of the CRPGs in the last decade, and i can tell you for sure that this game is not hardcore, it's just broken. It takes 2-3 minutes to kill the weakest enemy you can find, because both of you have a 90% miss chance. To recover you have to wait for eternity or buy potions which cost awfully a lot. I tried a trainer and maxed all my stats, i am still not able to win a 1 vs 2 fight with a god character. BROKEN.  Besides that, the game has a nice frame, interesting dialogues and quests, truly rpg. But it's all ruined by the combat system. It would be a gem but it's just too painful and frustrating to fight.   Buy it only on sale &lt;0,40$  Story/Quest/Visuals: 8/10 Combat System: 2,5/10
3479	1	a	Brutally oldschool
634	0	a	Great idea for an rpg game. Sadly it's poorly made. If you are looking for a rpg in a good, old baldur's gate style you will be disappointed. I can live with poor graphics but when i have to fight mostly with slow movement speed annoying magic system (most spells usually aren't working, if you hit someone once per every 5 tries you can consider yourself lucky). I was hoping for many quest requiring talking but most are rather combat oriented and fighting system isn't good in this game. What can i say more? It's a total failure and waste of money.
3481	1	a	The game is good, if you like reading. It is like diablo but with not so great combat(enemies are really OP even in easy). It's worth it if you like Old School RPGs and want to do something with your laptop what is about 6 years old
3483	1	a	4.5/5
639	0	a	I don't know. It's hard to rate this game. I didn't play it very much as you can tell so I'd give it a neutral if I could. Now I get they are going for an 'old school' vibe - and I love me some old school games. I love the old Ad&amp;D Gold Box games and eat up iso RPGs, But there is a difference between 'old school' and 'plain old ugly and cheap looking'. Seriously, look at old-school type games like Undertale - low fidelity graphics DO NOT mean that it should look bad - Diablo, Fallout, all of those old school games had charm, lots of effort was put into how they looked and presented the story even with the limited technogy of the time. This attention gave them a unique and appealing appearance which still holds up today.... A game released emulating them in 2015 shouldn't look significantly worse. Saying your game is 'old-school' and 'not about the graphics' is not an excuse to release a game that looks like garbage that you obviously didn't spend much time on or put any effort into the presentation. If you are going to do that then avoid graphics all together. This would have been better as a MUD, to be honest. I might have enjoyed it.  I get that this game isn't about the graphics, but It just looks awful, the UI hurts my eyes, the sprites look like they were made in ten minutes (your character doesn't even have a unique sprite), the 'animations' are so low fidelity that I wonder if they spent any time on them at all.   But the worst sin of all is that the text, which is the games main draw and reading is most of what you will be doing, I found it obnoxiously hard to read and the way it explodes on the screen had me constantly scrolling up to follow the wall-of-text conversations. It's a bad way of doing it. Seriously, hundreds of games have done 'conversation style' text well, it's inexcusable and gets old very fast.  That, I think is what did it for me. I could probably have stomached the rest of it if they had a way of reading text and having conversations with NPCs that didn't give me a headache and make me constantly have to scroll around.  It's just... I don't know.. Maybe the story is awesome - that's great and I would have gotten to it if I could have stomached the awful presenation and design. This is still supposed to be a game, after all. If I feel like the devs didn't care about or put any effort into how they presented their product to me, I can't care about it either.  Anyway I really don't like to not recommend indie games. I feel like they are the engine of the industry and need all the support they can get. Especially games that try to be very different like this one and deal with mature subject matter without flinching...but I just can't recommend this game.
640	0	a	Well I definitely agree with all the reviews that say this is a potion drinking simulator. Any problems? Drink more potions until you win. Combat is somewhat clunky, weapons break very fast, game doesn't really teach you how to play. The story is interesting enough except due to poor colour choices and layout of the dialogue boxes its a pain to separate one part of a convo from a different one. hos game doesn't give me quite the hard on i wanted and there are plenty other isometric rpgs that do the job better than this one unfortunately. I will continue to play and update this should be be warranted but first impressions are important and that is what you get.
3485	1	a	Very addicting
3487	1	a	Inquisitor is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - is indie &amp; RPG - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
652	0	a	Can't even get this game to start, just puts a big black block on my screen and I end up having to turn off my laptop and turn it back on again to get rid of it. Really wanted to check this game out, but I guess I can't. My laptop is fine, it is something on their end that is not working right. Be careful if you buy this game.
653	0	a	So far for me this is a control + alt + delete simulator, i cant get it to run, every time i open the game it remains black and covers half my screen so i have to ninja the task manager with arrow keys and the delete button because it even manages to block that. 10/10 would play but cant.
654	0	a	I couldn't get into this one. I don't mind reading in games, but I thought the dialog was really rambling. The combat in this game is painfully unfun. This might of worked as an adventure game, or even a novel, but as it stands, this is the worst ARPG I've ever played.
655	0	a	The writing and story is great so far (I am not too far into it just yet.)  The mechanics of controls, journal references, combat, and combat balance, is like stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.  I am personally torn, I want very much to continue the story, but I can't stand another hour of the mechanics.  If good writing and an interesting story is enough to carry any game for you, then this might be a game worth picking up, especially if you find it on sale for $0.99USD like I did, or in a very cheap bundle deal. At full price, no one should consider touching it, even if you love great stories, it isn't worth $10 USD, buy a book instead.
656	0	a	I have a phrase: It's called 'Diablo Clone'.  Diablo was groundbreaking. It was difficult enough to keep you interested, had good, simple mechanics, and story enough to hold onto you. Sure, Diablo was to grind as Congress is to gridlocked, but story and loot were enough to pull you in and keep you playing. Who WOULDN'T like that?  Well, like any game type, it has good clones and bad ones. Good clone? Path of Exile. Bad clone? Inquisitor.  Gameplay and Story are made to serve each other, insofar as if one fails, so does the other. Bioware titles carried the weight of their stories with solid mechanics. In opposition is Inquisitor. I hear the writing of this story is great, and that it is second to none. However, balance is in desperate need in this game. The story has the makings of a great power-hungry-plot-twisty-not-going-to-be-a-happy-ending vibe to it (much like Diablo), but considering the starting enemies (bats) will kick your â™¥â™¥â™¥ if you are not careful (and that's level 1), you are going to have a long road to hoe, and it's not going to be pleasant or, you know, fun. Diablo and Path of Exile don't throw you into the snake pit, they ease you in. Because unless you have a better strategy than 'Stand, slash, win, health potion, repeat', you're going to lose. A lot.   Maybe I haven't tricked out my character properly with the right stats, or I am currently going about strategy wrong, but when it comes to grind heavy, stat based games like Inquisitor, I shouldn't be trying to find out ways to alter player stats. Difficulty is fine (hell, Dark Souls and Mount &amp; Blade are some of my favorite games), but if done wrong, especially in a grind heavy game like Inquisitor, it's a game killer. Which is a shame, because now I won't experience what I have heard is a great story.

660	0	a	Plenty of excellent written dialogue but the game is broken. it's not even mediocre. It's awful.   One of your first encounters is a spider. A very common enemy. After defeating my first spider, I noticed my character's health rapidly depleting - OH NO - I check my bags - chug a healing potion....but it's no good. The potion goes right out the hole in my stomach where the spider stung me. 80-90 seconds later I'm *dead* Are you kidding me? I'm dead in the first 3-4 minutes of gameplay? I check the internets for a cure to this spider venom, sure enough there is no cure. You have to learn a spell - but it's a level 2-3 tier spell which you can't get until much later in the game. And every cave you go into, heck even in random forests - you will encounter spiders.   The shops are so ridiculous I burst out laughing after I realized what I was dealing with. I am going to play out a scenario in the game for you:  You walk in to a thrift store and you are looking for a pair of headphones and you ask the shop owner if you have any - 'Sorry we are all out' says the blue-shirted employee. You nod. And then ask him again. He again tells you he does not have headphones. Determined you ask him a third time. He replies 'we have three in stock... But you don't have enough money'. Unsatisfied with his selection you ask him again if he has headphones. He replies he has no headphones at all including the three he just showed you. You ask again, finally he reveals to you that he has a pair of used headphones and they are cheap give you a bonus to your health points if you wear it. You buy it. You ask him again out of curiousity to see if he's holding out on you - this time he has headphones that are not used and are slightly better than the ones you just paid for.  Thats right, every single time you check a shop keepers inventory it changes. You could potentially sit there for hours until you see the scroll, sword, shield, whatever you want appear. You don't have to walk out the door to check, you simply click to speak to speak to him again.   Speaking of headphones, don't wear them while playing this game. Music and sound effects are so bad your brain will explode. The startup screen song sounds like a 5-year-old playing on a keyboard. Afte you start you get to keep listening to it over and over and over again. The bats, zombies, ghosts, spiders make painful squeals and grunts as you hit them. You will always hear them before you see them which is good because if there are spiders you'll be running for your life because if you get poisoned, your as good as dead. The only way you could sanely play this game is if you turned off the audio completely - too bad you need to hear for spiders. Seriously, if your freaked out by spiders this game won't help.  The monsters: 1/10 Where are all the demons? Witches? Why am I fighting orcs, zombies, ghosts, and SPIDERS (hate those things). I played the game for 20 hours, got nearly to the end of the first chapter and was completely unsatisified with the selection of enemies. How about a possessed man attacking me? Maybe imps? Witches? IDK - this is the scariest you can think of? The safest way to fight any mob in this game is to get your quickness skill up and run away while firing your short supply of arrows.   The story: ?/10 If you can't play the game, what difference does the story make. That's like a writer handing you all of the pages of his new book, out of order, and dirty from sitting the the backseat of his Buick Skyhawk. There will be better reviews on the story from people who can play this game.  Your companions: 5/10  You gain followers but if they die, they are dead until you gain a resurrect spell. So make sure you quick save every five seconds. All it takes is a quick spider bite. I only recruited I believe 3 companions in my time playing this game. There are a few more. They have little tiny stories but other than that.   The classes My biggest complaint is with mages. They created specializions that are really hard to remember. And when you buy scrolls to learn spells you have to buy for that specializtion to be used. I remember I bought the one that is suppose to make me posion resistant but then found out, it only does it a small percentage and got posioned by a spider anyways and had to chug 2-3 health potions.  Back to the spider - so if you get stung, you literally have to wait nearly 3-4 minutes for the poison effect to wear off. Which means, automatic death if you get stung, there is no way to avoid not drinking multiple potions. Potions can get expensive so I recommend fleeing to church and let the priests free heal you instead of sucking down expensive potions.   Boss battles and combat strategy 1/10 The trick here is simple. Summon a genie, ask him for protection. He will summon a spirit and it will do all the fighting and kill everything on screen including the boss. No need to get your hands dirty. This is not a joke. You can try to fight but you are so limited in combat options that it comes down to this - brute force and running away while fighting. Everytime. And if you don't have it or the space to run away (and you won't) you will be dead in seconds. I hope you quick saved. Demon Souls isn't even this unforgiving.  I suggest you fight the same 5 random zombies, bats, and spiders till you make enough gold to buy good equipment that gives you an experience boost. Then keep farming till you are at a much higher level. So if you see a spider, you can shoot it dead in a shot or two instead of 6-30 shots.   I can't recommend this game and unless you want to play a bad game for laughs but if you do play, do me a favor and kill a spider for me.  
661	0	a	Boring combat ruined the game. I'm curious about the story, but can't bring myself to play this game more than 20 minutes.
662	0	a	Any game that cant figure out how to handle something as basic as mouse control, can never get recommended.  If you have a special mouse like a Logitech 700, you cant play this game, the mouse will lag so bad, youll give up before you are past the chracter creation screen.
663	0	a	crappy game, if you want this type of rpg buy divine divinity or beyond divinity instead alot better. this was slow and with more or less no directions at all
664	0	a	I got this game from a friend and he got it from some magazine i think. If i strart the game, it crashes and i founf no fix!
665	0	a	This game looks fun to play but i cannot recommend it for it somehow combines MOUSE ACCELERATION with menu buttons that are the size of approximately 3 pixels.
666	0	a	it looks like it has a good stoy but it is also a very boring walking simulator so i cant recomend it
667	0	a	The game was fine when I started but the constant need to drink potions, go back to buy more potions made me give up. This is like a potion drink simulator.
668	0	a	I tried Inquisitor for a while and it is not just my cup of coffee, too much reading, too complicated and hard, also it took me a few hours until I was able to start the game on Win10, well if you really love oldschool rpgs, this might interest you.
669	0	a	i wish it were good.  released years ago and still so many basic problems im sorry that i ever paid money for it.  have to play in 800x600 or else the UI is so small you cant see anything or click on anything.  but when you set it to 800x600 it doesnt scale things properly so most of your spell/item slots are pushed off the screen along with the inventory/game menu buttons etc.  supposedly was in development for ten years. if thats actually true i feel sorry for the devs who have spent so much of their time creating something so infantile and pathetic. seems more like it was in development for ten days.  ive been playing crpgs since eye of the beholder on the snes so im not totally clueless to these issues. 3 classes, cant choose skills or weapon proficiencies for any of them. leveling consists of upgrading 1 of 10 or so skills you can never change. plot/storyline full of holes and unexplained things. dice rolls are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up and weird whereby bats are killing the guards of cities. your character feels pre-made essentially. the game dictates to you how you should play it and you are not allowed to deviate from this set path. the six types of magic have absolutely no distinction between them: 'Divine Magic', 'Magic of True Faith', 'Magic of Miracles', 'Inquisitorial Magic', 'Heretical Magic', 'Pagan Magic'. it doesnt really seem to matter which ones you choose, you can do it with your eyes closed or while looking the either direction, because the descriptions of what they do are almost identical. just depends if you want to be 'evil' or 'good', something that is determined by a mass effect style slider in the center of the character menu. you are at the very least allowed to set your attributes although this has a very blunted effect on the actual game. a char with 5 strength and a char with 20 strength dont have that much difference in unarmed.  â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.
670	0	a	Terrible game, there's a reason they don't make games like this anymore.
671	0	a	More text than war and peace. Silly old swing timer based combat.
672	0	a	The dialogue reads like it was written by an 11 year old boy, one of the first conversations describes someone as a 'weirdo' and the town as 'â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥'  If you're writing an rpg game, your writing needs to be better.  The ui and mechanics are poor and the engine makes combat more difficult than it need be.  Theres no tutorial, not even a text prompt to tell you how to add spells, or use potions, see item stats etc, these are all forgiveable once you know but this game isnt polished.  Id give this one a miss if i were you.
673	0	a	It says it's an indie game made in 2012. Yea 2012 B.C. maybe. I say that because I am extremely confident that a better game could be drawn on a cave wall. Got this in a bundle with some much better games included. This is complete garbage. Like an incredibly bad ripoff of Diablo 1. I understand they were probably going for an oldschool look and feel, but this is just horrible. The worst graphics I have ever seen, almost no real combat animations to speak of, no health or mana regen lol, horrible and bland and god awful in every possible way. It doesn't even deserve to be held in the same regard as some of the worst games of all time because it doesn't even qualify as a game.  -100/10. Yes you read that right, negative one hundred out of ten. Maybe if they work on this for a couple more years and release an actual finished product then okay, there you go, a real game. Rather than a day one combination of the worst brainstorms from a team meeting that took place in the span of fifteen seconds then was programmed in the span of fifteen minutes while they were blindfolded punching in commands with their keyboards turned upside down and the lights turned off.
674	0	a	Awesome story, terrible, broken combat/spell casting.
675	0	a	Bugged beyond all belief, completely counter-intuitive to play, but fun when it works.
676	0	a	.
677	0	a	TL:DR; game is TRASH. Im playing computer games since 1994. I'v played lots but loots of old school rpgs and this one is totally crap. First of all i have to say i dont want every isometric rpgs to be similar like ultima series or diablo 1-2 or baldur's gate, which are the decent games i love for whole of my life; but guys Inquisitor is a waste of time, atmosphere is okay but thats only significant pros that you can find about the game. So here is my opinion, do not buy this if you dont wanna feel like a potion addicted junky and just be sure about you can play way more better old school rpg's than that.  SCORE; a point for dark atmosphere, another point for inquisitor made me to miss diablo 2 again and the last point for its easy to forget how mad you're about buying a game like this because its cheap. 3/10
678	0	a	I don't know what I expected. This game is a little to confusing for me. But hey, I bought it for $0.99 so... There is most likely somethong cool in this game but its hard to understand. 4/10
679	0	a	OK first of all it has a greate storyline and I LOVE the design (old-school rpg) . BUT I has more bugs than it's story can cover. You meet the first one when yo try to create your character and the game just blacks out ... no error no nothing. Then you spend half an hour searching through the list of posible isues. Then you have to go through all the comments to find the file where they keep the settings to manually put it in windowed mode. I find this inapropriate for a game you have to pay for and this is the reason I do not recomend it.
680	0	a	One of the more underwhelming games I've played. Very disappointed. It reminded me of the classic Diablo games, and as it turned out, was a cheap knock off of them lacking any charm whatsoever. The dialogue is jarring and stilted, there isn't any drive or motivation to do anything, the quests are quite bland (With the first one being to kill a certain number of bats) and the mechanics aren't properly explained. I was stuck in my inventory for a while, pondering over how to find out the stats of the items I had and what they did. Since I've played, I forgot how to do so, and there isn't any in game hints or even a manual that tells you how to do so. Overall, not a great game. If you're looking to get your Diablo fix, go play Diablo. Diablo II is a far better game than this coat-tail riding copy.
681	0	a	This is a bad game. Do not buy it.  The main selling point of this game is that it has lots of text to read in it. This is no bad thing. Unfortunately, despite taking three years to translate it, the translation is laughably bad. The English is full of mistakes and awkwardly unidiomatic to the point where it is painful to read. Here are some examples:  'Don't lose your faith- we have hope till we breathe!' 'I can only say one thing to that matter'  'I'll say you goodbye in that case' 'Is there any problem in it?!' 'I can't talk to you righ [sic] now'  'people, don't wait for anything and light the stakes for witches and sorcerors' 'a man who has destroyed good many hell spawns' 'one should keep good mood and strong faith' 'before anyone could react they ransacked entire mining village'  'so much dark side power was released that it would have dismembered me to pieces'  Another selling point is that the game doesn't hand-hold the player with quest markers and so on. I can appreciate the sentiment but it just makes playing the game tedious. An example of this is when killing bats outside the town at the very start. You keep having to go back and talk to the guard to find out if you have killed them all yet.  The combat in the game might seem diablo-like from screenshots but it's not that fast-paced or interesting. Generally you will be drinking thousands of potions, missing the enemy a lot and walking round incredibly slowly.  Seriously, do not buy this game.
682	0	a	I want my money back, finally gotten time to sit down to this and I was greeted with an over-saturated pixel game of a slow walking tombstone that doesn't even have synced animations. I love a Good RPG, specially an old one and this one looked promising. This is not, the developers really should be ashamed. corners were cut in development, graphically and mechanically. and it gave an underwelming performance that left me chasing bats in a tutorial phase. the story might be good, the mystery and world maybe fleshed out, but whats the point if the main character and combat mechanics are this bad?

686	0	a	I played Inquisitor. It 'very nice graphically to be an RPG dated and also very intuitive and easy to play. But I have found that some key functions do not correspond to actions.
687	0	a	I donâ€™t know... Just did not do it for me. I was expecting something like divine divinity and got a big steaming turd pile instead.
688	0	a	It's Diablo with creepy religion. Diablo one actually runs smoother and this game has way too much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dialogue that gets boring after about an hour.
689	0	a	Good luck finding that last bat.  Spent a full half hour just trying to get into town, but no. There's BATS out there. Or I should say, at least one... somewhere. Canvassed the whole map as best I could, killed maybe a dozen bats. Not good enough for Mr. gate guard. Screw this, I'm done.
690	0	a	What a s***y game... bad graphics and akward controls. Oh... and you can't change the keyboardsettings!
691	0	a	Game seemed alright at first despite obvious crappy graphics, annoying amount of reading required, weak storyline and lack of tutorial / control introduction. But despite this i still tried it, i circled a camp killing bats trying to stay close to the camp so the quick travel map wouldnt keep popping up, returned to guard to complete quest and it was ready to be completed, finished talking to the guy and suddenly im transported to a menu screen so i go back into my game and my character no longer accepts any commands except to look at his quest book. I try to complete the quest to enter the city which now apparently does not work and i cant talk to the guard now can i move my character or enter the city. almost 25 minutes into the game and im trapped in a bug on the very first quest. Cant recommend a game that looks and runs this bad to anyone.
692	0	a	Graphics are bad.
693	0	a	â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing the worst game ever they had 10 years to take a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i guess beacause this game looks sounds and plays like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. i would recommend this game if you love anal and your a dude.
694	0	a	don't kid yourself you want diablo... dont pretend you don't, do not bother with this terrible wannabe clone, just go buy diablo and save yourself the $2 for a refreshing coke while you play the game you actually want to play
695	0	a	 KAMGUSTA's mini Review   80's graphics. Clunky UI. Tons of text to read. But this isn't the worst part: even the first enemies of the game, bats, will leave you without stamina after a couple of swings with your weapon. Be prepared to use thousands of potions. Funny fact: potions are not stackable and won't refill your quick keys automatically. No, you can't rest either. This isn't an hardcore RPG, this is a clunkycore RPG.   Score 4/10

3505	1	a	I had originally played Deadly Premonition on the 360 during May of 2010. I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.  The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.  The next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.  The rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.  Heavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.  Deadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed. And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your â™¥â™¥â™¥ off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.  But it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.  Deadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.  Deadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience.   And it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits).   The PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.  But it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.  Deadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.
3507	1	a	Deadly Premonition is like the old cadillac you found in your grandpa's barn after he passed away.   Getting it to work will give you all sorts of headaches, and more often than not, you just want to lock the barn and forget all about the damn thing. But if you actually manage to put up with all the crap it throws at you and manage to make it work, you're rewarded with a ride that's both, unique and unforgettable.   Easily one of the best and worst games I've ever played.

3511	1	a	 Deadly Premonition - Poor PC Porting Perfection
3513	1	a	Basically Twin Peaks but made into a game  Pros -So many side missions -Soundtrack (actually pretty good) -Subtitles (Big and Easy to read) -Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 (Probably the Graphics, Specific save points, over the shoulder gameplay and the BIG Subtitles) -York is so quirky -Characters are all so unique in some way (E.g. Gay Assistant, Thomas) -Humor -Quite lengthy  Cons -Its a port -Minor Hiccups -Driving sections  Overall, some might say that this game is bad because of its outdated PS2 graphics and other it being a port and all but honestly, those people don't see the the good points, what good points you may ask? The over-the-top humor, a range of memorable characters &amp; Nostalgic gameplay (RE4). I would say this game is worth a buy but you'll probably only during a sale since the game is kinda old and at $25 you can get other better games and besides its like $2.49 during a sale.  Score: Get during Sale Final Verdict: 8/10

3517	1	a	Oh Deadly Premonition, how you look so fun But alas on our computers, you just will not run. From your unfortunate PC port to your silly resolution Near impossible to fix, leaving us in confusion. Crashing to desktop grows difficult to bear And at your price, it just feels so unfair! Lastly, for some, you won't run as a whole Crying 'Oh please, just work! This is worse than Dark Souls!' Oh, Deadly Premonition, end our dismay We'd just like to enjoy you, so please let us play!  So says Mr. Stewart.
3519	1	a	This is a really tough game to review.  Imagine a really bad restaurant. It has terrible service, terrible decor, smells bad, looks bad and is just generally unpleasant. It shows no promise at all. And yet....  ...They serve about the best main course money can buy.  Deadly Premonition's main dish is it's completely captivating story, which is brought to life by some excellent voice acting. The main characters are a really well written bunch and I found them quirky, utterly charming, charismatic and lovable. I wanted to know everything about them.  If you have seen Twin Peaks, you will not fail to notice this game has derived A LOT of inspiration from that show. Luckily it does so in a really cool and often suprising way and so it never feels like a bland ripoff. Beyond the Twin Peaks influence, it's pretty obvious the game designer, Swery, likes David Lynch's wider canon of work too, to the point that the game could be mistaken as a collaboration. Being a Lynch fan, that's not a bad thing in my book; I think other Lynch fans will love this too.   So what's not so good? I'm afraid there are quite a lot of niggles that takes the shine off the Deadly Premonition experience.  Here we go:   - My experience was massively hurt by technical problems. The game crashed constantly unless put into ME/98 compatibility+admin mode. Alas, this had the side of effect of gradually bringing frame rates down from 60fps to 10fps within 15 minutes of continued play. Repeated reboots were required to maintain a playable frame rate.  - in compatibility mode, a slew of minor bugs arose, such as gun-aiming glitches, which made the game annoying. - A unofficial hack (called DPfix) to unlock the 60fps is required. - Pretty poor graphics with a washed out palette, rough textures, and some very ropey 3D models at times. - Driving is really tedious. It takes too long to get anywhere. - The core 3rd person survival horror game is not very enjoyable.  - The RPG mechanics (health, hunger, tiredness, inventory management) are completely superflous - Time lapse mechanic is frustrating. You have to wait around for certain events to happen. Time can be sped up, but the mechanic means that you can end up passing TOO much time and missing your appointment.  - The game is littered with tedious mandatory mini-games, such as waggling the thumbstick to run away from danger, or hiding from an enemy to escape danger.  - boss battles are a chore - not scary in the slightest. (even the bits I think were meant to be scary) - Dull fetch side quests. - The game is not challenging in the slightest. - Production values are not great. Very rough around the edges. Wonky transitions between scenes and parts of the musical score.  - Story got so ridiculous it was immersion-breaking. (A mad story isn't necessarily a problem, but there needs to be some sort of underlying internal logic to make the suprises and twists truly matter)  - no steamcloud  In short, the core game is just not very good. I played this to enjoy the story and get to know the town and townsfolk of Greensvale, not for the sake of the game.   That's enough criticism. I don't want to put anyone off from giving this a go, because DAMN, the story and characters and atmosphere are SO SO good....Good enough that I can forgive that massive list of faults.  But would I recommend it to you?  Now, that is a tough question. I have to give a somewhat nuanced answer here. I'd have to ask:  - How tolerant are you of bad ports? This is one of the worst I have experienced. - Do you like brilliant stories so much you can put up with a subpar game which is very rough around the edges?  - Do you appreciate great voice acting, atmosphere, superb characters, and perhaps David Lynch's work too?   If you are pretty tolerant, likes stories, love Lynch and can put up with a game that is a quite poorly designed, go for it. You won't regret it.   If you veer the other way....stay WELL clear.   I few things to add: the game is supported by a deliciously quirky soundtrack, and features one of the most charismatic protaganists I have yet encountered in a video game: Francis York Morgan (who is up their with Garrus from Mass Effect for me)   I LOVE this game, despite its numerous faults, and I can't think of a game so in need of a modern remaster that polishes the rough edges, gives it a nice, glossy coat of paint, and improves the core game so it can be experienced by a wider audience.   It's not a whole hearted recommedation, but if you can stomach it's faults you are in for an unforgettable experience.
3521	1	a	A game that understands the player, and uses its entire design to promote both its understanding of player experience and atmosphere. Contests with The Stanley Parable in making player choice contextualized in a way that matters and acknowledges the player's motivation without compromising it, unlike many Triple-A titles that garner more praise. A truly amazing game, and one worth playing at any cost. If more games were like Deadly Premonition, the world would be a better place.   Unlike almost any game before it (with the exceptions of The Stanley Parable and Demon's Souls), Deadly Premonition understands the unique and powerful triad of Player, Character, and Narrator. At no point in the game is any of these functions invalidated.  Many users comment on how 'weird' the game is, or how the graphics are outdated or the controls clunky, and this is important. The game's major aesthetic is that exact cognitive function: It means to play like a PS2 game, look like a PS2 game, and even ape PS2 games. Secretly, though It does all of these things the best way possible: By actually constructing and improving upon the foundation it attempts to make fun of. Deadly Premonition is the unique and rare game that actually constructs on, as opposed to strictly deconstructs, what came before. You may hate the controls, and you may think the graphics are outdated, but if any of these things were changed its own aesthetic would clash with itself. These choices were deliberate, intelligent mirrors for the game's internal design and direction.  Deadly Premonition is surprisingly one of the most intelligent games I've ever played. No matter how strange, unexpected, or uncomfortable it might be it is a game that understands what games can do. It fully utilizes the medium, and for that, it deserves a perfect score.  10/10
3523	1	a	This is the quintessential 'so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad it's good' game. Nothing else comes close. By the end you'll be questioning your sanity, asking god to smite you down, and screaming 'WHY SWERY? WHY?'  'Very underrated.' - York
3525	1	a	When people decide to make a game on a really low budget, but are aware of it and stick with it in their entire game design, then you could either say, it's a bad game with a really low budget, or a masterpiece in its own right. Personally, I say the latter.  This is probably the worst low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, but it is the only low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, which makes it the very best game of it's entire category of all time.  And I mean that absolutely seriously. This is the worst game I had the greatest fun with in a long while. I had more fun with Deadly Premonition than with many triple A titles. It is awkward, it is really painfully badly executed, but even after I saw the ever appearing 'flicking the lighter to light a cigarette' animation during a cutscene for the 200th time, I still thought it was hilarious.  Deadly premonition is the prime example that a bad game doesn't necessitate a game to be less fun. That and the fact that the story is a ginormous clusterf***.  You'll either love it, or you'll hate it. I loved every single second.
3527	1	a	On a technical standpoint this game is one of the worst ports of all time.   You will need a lot of patience to get the game running and to actually play it. Through the steam discussion thread that the dev posted I managed to get the game as stable as it could ever be. It would still occasionally crash after long sessions but it could be solved by saving often and restarting the game every now and then.  If you cant be bothered fixing the game, buy it on the console or watch a playthrough on youtube. Skipping this game entirely would be a real shame since it has a cast of interesting and weird characters with some cheesy B-movie moments.   One of the best scenes is the opening scene that shows agent Morgan smoking, on the phone talking about tom and jerry's S&amp;M relationship, reviewing the evidence on his laptop and even holding a bag of evidence in front of his face all while driving through a curvy forest road on a rainy night.  The absurdity of that moment was one of the things that hooked me.  Without going too much into the story, you play a FBI agent investigating a murder case in a small town. This is the best part of the game since you get to interrogate the weird and interesting townsfolk and the identity of the killer is something that will keep you guessing throughout the game.  The gameplay is nothing special, car controls are bad and so is the map but by the middle of the game I found myself knowing the full town layout.  Shooting has been improved for the director's cut giving the gun infinite ammo and having a button that centers on the enemy. Yeah it removes some of the horror survival aspect of the game but makes the game way easier and less frustrating since shooting was a weaker part of the game.  You will need to manage a hunger meter and keep your clothes clean, its pretty trivial and would only become a pain when you try to skip to to do side quests.  In conclusion and a TL:DR for some people: This game is a gem, very raw and unpolished and I hope you wont skip it just because of the bad reviews.
3529	1	a	 For a normal person, a causal player:
3531	1	a	  How I Made Deadly Premonition Work With Windows 10
3533	1	a	although the port isn't the best, it's still worth it for the rest  so says mr stewart
3535	1	a	Got it when it was dirt cheap, and I do nÃ³t regret it. The whole story kind of has a twin peaks crazy vibe. That's what makes it so wonderful. Somehow it's a bit of a mix of fighting off zombies and investigating. It's really a great game, if you can ignore the awfully terrible port and the bugs.   Would've been worth the full price if it worked a lot better.  Right now it's kind of bad, no proper resolutions, sound is all over the place, and had to use compatability mode to prevent the game from crashing at startup. So there's a risk you might not get the game to work properly. There are a few mods and fixes around on the net tho.
3537	1	a	One of the best stories ever to grace a video game. The game has a few technical issues, and the graphics leave alot to be desired but if you manage to get past these issues you'll find a tremendous story, in my opinion one of the best stories to ever grace a video game.  I'll be honest and say the controls are bad, the graphics aren't really up to par with modern games and you'll more than likely encounter a few technical issues getting the game to run.  Ignore those issues (except not getting it to run, try to find the fix for that) and you'll fall in love with the story. Just keep in mind the game starts off slow, and you'll very likely want to quit if you get caught up in doing side quest in chapter 2. Just push forward, trust me, it's worth it.
3539	1	a	It's the game Alan Wake wanted to be, but with quirks and wonderful B-movie taste.  But be warned: it's bad, it realy is. It won't be working without fan patches, and it's very rough around the corners, and the story's ludicrous. But it has style. It has a character. It's like an old geeky friend with strange tastes. Not creme de la creme, but interesting one.  Reminds me of an old game named Harvester.
3541	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a very polarizing game. Yes, the gameplay can feel like absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (the driving controls still kill me even to this day) and the PC port itself is pretty catastrophic (random crashes, ahoy!), but this game has a lot of heart with a pretty thrilling story and interesting characters to boot.  Definitely recommended for those who love the following:  1) coffee 2) Twin Peaks 3) japanese wackiness 4) who just want to play something that offers something unique, despite having a lot of flaws  I don't like open-world games in general and while Deadly Premonition has a lot of OPTIONAL stuff, I recommend you to do some of those to get to know the local population of Greenvale better. You will thank me later.
3543	1	a	Want to play a game with quirky, rememberable characters? With a crazy mystery that never seems to stop twisting? How about plots that take a second playthrough to REALLY get? Hours of roaming time? Countless collectables? More Collectables? Did I mention too many Collectables? Is there such a thing as 'too many' collectables? Do you like commentary on 80's horror movies? Do you often have suspicions than NPCs are up to no good, but are often unfonded?  Would you like to reveal the dark secrets of those 'innocent' NPCs through tons of side-quests? Even if it ruins their otherwise perfect marriages and lives? And finally ... Are you willing to put up with the games wonky combat controls to enjoy an otherwise great story and game? Then this, my friends, is the game for you.   
3545	1	a	The steam port is absolutely terrible. Crashes frequently and had to change multiple settings on my computer just to get past a certain part.  10/10 this game is amazing, but get it on a different platform.
3547	1	a	Do I recommend Deadly Premonition? Absolutely. Do I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.  Deadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.  Basically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.  But even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.  Which brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.
3549	1	a	Right I just want to say I LOVE this game (trust me I'll need to say that before I get into the parts I don't like). I think the story is amazing. It's a very well-written game with interesting and well developed characters. Yorke is wonderfully entertaining especially when you're just driving around and he's talking to his alter ego Zach about 80s movies. A lot of the mini stories are fun and the action is very tense and can be really scary at times. I'm serious this game can be pretty horrifying. I enjoyed every part that didn't involve...well uh... ok... The controls.  I've read some other reviews and apparently the console versions controls were a lot smoother but the PC controls leave much to be desired. Yorke kinda controls like a tank (which would be fine in a point and click game) but this is a horror shooter so it's a little clunky and awkward. The real time events are uh... a little difficult. Now I'm slightly biased as real time events are the bane of my existence but Deadly Premonitions are something very special indeed. In most games the real time event keeps the same pattern so that you can kinda power through it after several tries. This game changes the pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. So it's a little difficult. Though I feel someone with good reflexes could get through it no sweat, I'm just slow af.  When you drive you feel like you're driving on black ice though I will admit it's very fun when you drive really, really fast and crash into stuff.  Also if you're playing on PC be aware this game might crash, several times. It did for me a lot. You can have several days without crashing and it could play smoothly until one day it's like NOPE and crashes on you during a scary part, and oh boy you forgot to save so time to go back into the scary tunnel again with those wall crawlers that take a dozen hits with a shotgun again!  And yet... after all this... I still love it. It's like Taco Bell, even though it hurts and might even be morally wrong you just keep coming back for more. I really do think it's the characters, story, atmosphere, Twin Peaks-vibe, challenging puzzles and fun shooting segments that keep me coming back.  I'd recommend it to people who have a lot of patience and want a game primarily for story. Still amazing though.
3551	1	a	Deadly Premonition is my favorite game of the entire generation. It's plot, characters and setting are just that engaging every time you come back you still have a great time. The story may sound familiar if you have watched twin peaks in that a girl is murdered in a small town out in the boondocks of america and its up to FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to solve the crime (Call him york by the way, everyone does) but as he arrives in the small town of Greenvale things are not what they seem  with strange phenomenon involving red seeds and a legend of a killer in a red raincoat that only appears on rainy nights. The game bursts and ozzs with personality and charm from the music that plays in the opening menu to the way that York interacts with Zach (his special friend) about b-movies. The directors cut that was originally released on PS3 boasts a new scenes that expand the games ending and also tell the story in a different way. The PC version however brings very little to the table by only offering halloween themed suits for York, Emily, The Raincoat Killer and a car skin and even though the game now runs past 30FPS it just doesn't feel right at that speed as it feels to fast... Another issue is that since the directors cut features reworked movement it feels clunky on the pc without a controller while if it used the original versions tank style controls (which I actually liked) then maybe it wouldn't feel so wierd on PC. The last issue that I have that wasn't addressed in the directors cut is the timing of certain music I will give you an example You're examing a dead body and this forboding unerving music is playing then suddenly it changes to light hearted jazz I will admit I got a laugh out of it the first time around and this is the only time I can really remember this happening.  All complaints aside Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is a game that you have to own Everything about it feels right and it was the game to renew my faith that games can exceed the bar in many aspects without needing multiplayer, graphics with volumetric lighting (otherwise known as WANK) You are a fool to dismiss such a fine game and even more of a fool to insult it One of the generations top games 100000000000/10 
3553	1	a	It is like blue cheese - you either like it or avoid it. I absolutly love it, but ironically wouldn't touch blue cheese with a two meter stick.  An unique game with a story inspired by Twin Peaks. I truly recommend for all horror/mystery fans!    My nominee for 'Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!' Award in 2016 Steam Awards ceremony.
3555	1	a	 Pros:  - From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there. - Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D - Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player 'go there!...is funny isn't it!?' for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time! - The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP). - The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it. - OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a 'pro' but is not a 'con').  - The OST is amazing! Point mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing period! - The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now). - Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding. - If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.  - 'DP Fix' exist!  (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438)  As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;) Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.   Cons:  - Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT. - You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!

3557	1	a	Deadly Premonition: The Directorâ€™s Cut is a strange beast. This horror game plays like resident evil or silent hill, but feels like Twin Peaks. The game is absurd, terrible, weird, stunning and basically the closest thing to art video games will ever be. The story involves an FBI detective who talks to himself and is rewarded with cash for each card of medal he collects as well as any headshots he performs. He loves headshots. You talk to people, like these weird kids and you collect items to use on things, like this fuse box. Lollipops and donuts can recover your health.   The game takes on a wider open world feeling later on and between missions you return to this home base of sorts, to get more incomprehensible chunks of plot thrown at you. This game is weird to say the least, but I dig the vibe of it all. You certainly donâ€™t know what it will throw out next. Make sure to grab DPfix, from the maker of the Dark Souls resolution fix, it lets you play the game beyond the 720P default.  Watch the video review on youtube in Steam Shots EP125

3561	1	a	was about to refund this game, but then got the durante fix and restarted my pc and the problems were mostly fixed. got stuck in a strange world where i was educated on southern tailed squirrels, biscuits, and random b movies
3563	1	a	I wrote a short 'review' a few years ago and i feel i like didn't do this game enough justice it deserves. What exactly is this game? That is a really good question. If you really want a better review just   read   this.   This is supposed to be a survival horror game, is it though? It's a murder mystery, you play as York (everyone calls him that) an fbi agent that investigate a serial killer leading to a small town. Once you start this game, you'll know that this game is bad. The story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is horrible, the cutscenes are attrocious, the gameplay are horrendous, the control is the worst. But it is also a wonderful experience that you'll never forget.   You'll dread the shooting so much with all the bullet sponge enemies, You'll accidentally press the a button and see the 'get out of car' animation a million times. You will also ask questions, a lot of questions. Why is the raincoat killer stopped chasing me after i evade one time? Why is there an old dude on a wheelchair wearing a gas mask? Why is there a jazz playing while i examined a body? Who is whistling that mario theme?!?   please get it out of my head.   And also    Who is zach?    Not all of that question will be answered. At the end of the game, the character will grow on you, you'll no longer ask the unecessary question, because it's deadly premonition.   But if it's all so bad, what makes it a good game, you ask. Deadly premonition knows that it is a bad B-movie and make it their strength. Sure you will be frustated, but that frustation is wiped by the laugh that you'll get. You'll laugh at it, thinking that it's bad, but that's also what makes it so good. It's also possible that you will hate it with passion, that is also fine. Because you gotta have a truly twisted mind to enjoy it. It's a genius of swery.  How exactly are we supposed to enjoy this game, ironically? Unironically? That is a question that will never be answered. Perhaps the saddest part of this game is this will probably be the one and only that ever comes out.
3565	1	a	Normally I find trying to get a game running a bit of a hobby, something fun. I want to really enjoy this game, it looks like it could be great to play, but unfortunately that's where it ends for me right now.  EDIT, I've got it working. I'm keeping it 'Not Recommended' for the faint of heart.   What worked:  Set compatibiltiy mode to 'Windows XP SP2', run as administrator Delete LAV Extensions Reinstall Physx Launch from the DP application and not the launcher  Using these setting will launch in windowed mode, if you want to run fullscreen create a shortcut of the DP.exe and then in properties type in '-fullscreen' within the target field.  So far it's reliable, but don't have a lot of hours in it at all yet. I like it A LOT so far. I recommend the game to those who don't have issues doing a little bit of work to get a game going. If you can't handle that, you really need to stay away from the title even though it really wasn't that bad to get started.
3567	1	a	The graphic and voice acting are really bad but The gameplay is good and the story and charachters are great too.If you are looking for a kinda game you haven't played before you can try this. Btw this game reminds me of resident evil 4 (I don't know why!) Anyway i'd recomend this game for people who are looking for a weird games ... 7/10

3573	1	a	  Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut
3575	1	a	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version. See this forum post on how to get it working right:  http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/forum/showthread.php?31550-Making-Xbox-One-Controller-Work-with-Windows-10-Please-Sticky 
3577	1	a	some things are like trainwreks, a million small errors comeing together to form a cluster of failure. deadly premonition is not like that however; with this game a million errors create something great. goofy and bizzare, but with a lot of heart, this game probobly has something everyone can laugh at.
3579	1	a	A great game in a bad port.   The bad port comes in the form of horrible graphics settings and crashes. Fortunately I was able to find workarounds for these issues making the game less of a â€œbadâ€ port, and more of a â€œdecentâ€ port. The first thing you will want to do is download the DPfix mod which will clean up some of the graphics for you. This does not solve the issue with crashing however. My experience with crashing was that the game would always crash at specific parts of the game, usually at the start of a cut scene. By this, I mean that the crashes were not random. The game would crash, I would reload the game, and it would crash at the exact same spot again. I found a workaround, which involved running the game in compatibility mode until you pass the part that crashes then disable compatibility mode after you save past the crash. By doing this I was able to enjoy the game and complete it with only a few technical issues.  Now for the game itself. The game in my opinion has a great story and cast. The characters have developed back stories, and the game keeps you guessing as to who is guilty of murder. The main character is particularly interesting in his mannerism. All in all, this is a case of a great game that didnâ€™t have enough money for that extra polish.   I would recommend this game to anyone whoâ€™s looking for a good 3D adventure game with an interesting cast and story. 
3581	1	a	Yes, absolutely. There are technical problems, and crashes, but those can mostly be overcome, and if you persevere it's one of the best game story experiences I've had.
3583	1	a	I played this game with a friend on PS3 and while he hated it I honestly loved it. It's hard to say why with all it's flaws and rough edges, but I found it really enjoyable. It could be 'it's so bad it's good' sorta thing but I found the game compelling. In any case it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy quirky rough around the edges games or movies, it's certainly for you.   Also just call him York â€“ everyone else does.
3585	1	a	Do not be decieved by my hours on steam. I have played over 200 hours of this game on Xbox 360 and PS3.  Swery65 is a genius. I was pulled in instantly. I loved the campy voice acting. I loved the tank controls. I loved the sillyness. I loved the characters.  I cried for an hour after finishing this. It goes on sale often. You will be in for one wild ride.  F.. K... In the coffee....
3587	1	a	This is one of the greatest games that I have ever played. It will definitely stay within my top 5 games for a long, long time. I plan to at least do a second and third playthrough, if not more.  Before buying, there are 2 things that you must know:  1. This is the very definition of a cult classic. If you find yourself only enjoying huge budget AAA games and never really straying into anything else, then perhaps this is not the game for you. This game must be played with an open mind, as it is very unique. Also, it is worth mentioning that the game really doesn't pick up until an hour or so into it.   2. The PC port is not very good. I would only recommend buying it if you have intermediate computer skills, as you are going to have to edit a few files as well as apply a user-made patch, DPfix.   The story: Simply put, it's amazing. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate the murder of a local teenager. The story quickly picks up from here and sucks you in. I wish that I could be less vague about the story, but I risk ruining the game's 20+ hour run. This is the kind of story that keeps you wanting to play the game to see what happens next. It takes many sharp turns and streches across several different genres, including, but by far not limited to: horror, mystery, survival, comedy, and even some romance. I consider myself to be good at predicting storylines in games and movies, but even I could not predict hardly any of this game. It truly kept me interested until the very end. Speaking of the end, you may just shed a tear.   Characters: The characters in this game are incredibly varied and all have distinct personalities. I will certainly not ever forget any of them. The voice acting is great and really helps to bring the characters to life.   Gameplay: The driving is pretty awful but far from the worst I've ever played. The pause menu map only shows your immediate surroundings and cannot zoom out, rendering it useless. You'll have to pay close attention and learn the town if you want to get around. While this map issue was mildly annoying, it made the game a little more challenging. The rest of the gameplay is good, but nothing new or super polished. I would recommend using a controller, as the keyboard and mouse control for this game just feels clunky. The game is open world and each character has a routine that they do. This is important to remember, as they may not always be home for you to ask questions. There are some points in the game in which you must wait a certain amount of in-game time before moving on to the next portion of the story. This gives you time to explore all that there is to do in Greenvale, including a ton of side missions and collectible items.  Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is great, and very memorable. I love the acoustic guitar song that plays at the main menu and at various points in the game. Each track suits the level that it was designed for, and nothing seems out of place. The only complaint I have is that the music volume levels occasionally overpower dialogue in cutscenes.   Other thoughts: The game crashed to the desktop about a dozen times during my playthrough. The crashes all occured at set points in the game's story, so they are not random. There are some suggestions to remedy this with a quick search online though. I had luck passing these crashes by setting the game's launcher and .exe to Windows 98/ME mode and running as administrator. I am using an AMD gpu with the latest drivers (15.7.1 at time of writing) and Windows 7 64 bit.   Bottom line: If you don't mind the possibility of some technical issues and you are a fan of survival-horror/mystery games, by all means, buy this game.
3589	1	a	  After 7 hours of play, I can say that this is one of the best games of which I had the pleasure of playing and I want to still play for much longer. This is an open world horror (which to me is splendid), which gives you various situations and things to do and explore. The city is fairly large and strongly recommend not to risk walking out because there are several places spread very far corners of the map, and so there are police cars to take you, and no, you are not a ride in this game you must control the car and it is possible both at first and in the third person. Something that caught my attention is the amount of commands to do so, beyond the standards, give arrow and have control over the lights at any time, as well as using the windshield when it is raining because the game there day transition and changes in time. For this reason the various possible locations may not always be available because everything has its time due to happen. There markets, gas station, houses and other various places to explore, and you can fish in certain places, of course with proper equipment to do so. All of these sites available no atoa, your character beyond the life bar and stamina, there is also the sleep bars and hunger. For this there is a hotel and some houses you have access to sleep in almost any location truth, if not all, it has a bed can rest. About hunger not always have time to go on the market and that is why there are machines where you can buy some food. This also applies to sleep, do not always have a bed available and the way is turn taking cafes stored in inventory. There is gun shop, but perhaps the most interesting is to get the weapons infinite ammunition obtained in side quests. The game has a police series style several years ago, full of stereotypical characters and cliched situations, the beginning of the keep itself has fragments of what happened in the chapter you are both in photos and with excerpts of speeches. Your character is an FBI agent and called Francis York Morgan, but he always says that it is to call him York, and I've got a 'special' name if I present myself this way and the other ignores it tends to say this for some reason did not like me. That's what happens when you present to the sheriff of the town of Greenvale, George Woodman calling York 'mrs. Morgan '. This ends up just causing a bad impression. You come to this city because the murder happened it resembles the other which has investigated, and so he joins the local police: the sheriff with his closed way of being, the beautiful Emily Wyatt and sweet Thomas MacLaine (Interpret 'sweet' as you prefer). In several game moments you can chat with Zach something or someone who is close to our protagonist, but that would be really someone or is it just a hallucination (a second personality perhaps?). In these conversations with Zach, they talk about various things such as films giving various details about the same as the actors, scenes, who is the director and so follows ... but it is more often when we are in the car, it is You can hear a real dialogue, at other times only York speech, apparently alone and this comes to interrupt others and occasionally other people wonder about such conversations with passengers also take place and it will you should tighten the button to start. Deadly Premonition despite being a horror game, occasionally happens comic scenes, however not all actually have felt in those moments stereotypes given much emphasis. Like when York eating a cookie at the police station and say you need to know where it was purchased because it is delicious at this time Thomas gets all embarrassed and bashful and says it was he who made ... (something that usually happens when the girl gets a compliment someone who finds beautiful or who she likes). Time failed typically receive punishments already expected to come face to face with the place closed or even end up getting a 'earful' lack of commitment to the case, as it is possible that the passage of operating time you are invited to remove and this will force you to 'spend time' in some way, perhaps one of the best ways is smoking (consumable item).  The gameplay takes place in three situations (places) different: the real world, the spiritual world and dreams. In fact, the real world to the spiritual is something reminiscent of 'Silent Hill', this transition usually occurs when the character you want to do something alone. On the game mode, it is quite simple, but the sight itself is very difficult to have control, but nevertheless it is possible to 'turn around' with what he has. The other commands usually respond well. Something I saw people complaining are the car's controls are terrible and you end up stuck in places, well I never had many problems, perhaps the fact that I always played first-person account for this. The car has also status, nothing else, just the physical condition and the amount of gasoline. However if you are in the middle of nowhere and end up having to leave the car do not worry, use the signal that exists in inventory and it will bring a new car for you (100% / 100%). The game also has moments of multiple choices and quick time events.  Things that caught my attention in particular: - The menu in the game which is very interactive} - Soundtracks that are great and together with the sound effects give a greater strain on the player. - There are secondary missions of various types: how to make a stretch in less time or find something and give it to someone. - In certain game moments are informative situations, such as in the car with Zach and they talking about movies or even a part of the beginning with Thomas where you need to find a key with a kind of 'squirrel' (if I'm not mistaken) of something specific and every key handed it says it is not right that speaks the characteristics of each species. - There are cards collectibles in the game. I do not know really say what happened to me, but this was perhaps the only game of this style that I felt committed to continue to play and I just loved it from its beginning until now (but I believe it will continue until its end) . Afraid I was very deceived with the game I was behind other analysis and had a completely different view from mine, I finally found one that was negative, talked about the graphics and gameplay treating them as bad, also spoke to this was a game considered a cult, but that could be seen as a masterpiece depending on the person.  tÃ­tulo: Deadly Premonition: obra prima ou pseudo cult?

3591	1	a	Twin Peaks as a Japanese Video Game. Bad port that tends to crash, but otherwise great.
3593	1	a	There are only two types of humans that roam this earth. Those that don't like this game and those that were birthed by the divine womb of Deadly Premonition to rise on high during endtimes and sit in judgement of those that are unworthy in both earth below and heaven above.  I count myself as the latter. Are you mortal or are you divine?
3595	1	a	One of the most memorable video games you'll ever play. The gameplay won't blow you away, but it has a great story, a ton of characters, and quite a lot of fun side missions and stuff to do.  You might be better off getting the PS3 or 360 version of the game, since the PC port is notorious, but there's a guide:  http://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut  that can help with the most common issues. Just remember to save often.
3597	1	a	One of, if not the most divisive video games ever created, there's good and bad with this game.   To be fair, yes the game suffers from stiff controls, very outdated graphics and animations (even  when it first released as I understand it was to be a ps2 game originally), but for me, this game was like falling out of an airplane midflight, only to land safely in a hot tub at the Playboy Mansion on trampoline night.  To be sure, there's a definite influence from the tv show Twin Peaks (I've only seen the first episode of the show and can safely make this claim), but the supernatural story, the memorable weird and  unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, the twists, open world to explore, humor, atmosphere, and adventure that bleeds its own distinct charm, this is one I'll always remember.   Highly recommended despite its shortcomings, I would tell everyone to at least give this a try.  Or at the very least, watch a lets play.  The monkey screaming Squirrels in the opening cutscene should let you know exactly the sort of  experience you're in for.
3599	1	a	This review is for any one having trouble with the game, and my honest opinion. Firstly to get the game to work what i did was, go into steam/steamapps/common/deadlypremonition/redist. then scroll down until you find PhysX_SystemSoftware. Double click then click repair then start the game and it should work perfectly.  The game itself I have played multiple times on both xbox and playstation and is one of my favourite games, of all time. This port is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and its takes a certain patience. But the overall game kinda makes up for it. plus you can get get a bug fix online  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix.  kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ service from the people who ported it but eh what you gonna do complaining won't do anything. Get the bug fix do the repair and have fun with the game. You need to play this game, isn't that right zach!
3601	1	a	There are two kinds of people: those who love this game and those who cant beat the hospital crash.
3603	1	a	Bless you based SWERY! You are the David Lynch/ John Waters to Hideo Kojima's Michael Bay/ John Carpenter.
3605	1	a	I listened to a lady drone on and on about her magic pot, I drove too fast and my car flipped sideways and went on for about 50 feet before correcting itself, I shot 360 bullets from a single magazine of a sub machine gun, smoked for 6 hours inside a guys trailer, then I stole his root beer from the cupboard. I had a wacky chase scene with a guy in a raincoat chasing me throwing an infinite number of axes at me, had a quicktime event that everyone has failed at some point or another. Finally I ate 3 hotdogs and slept for 12 hours.  11/10 GOTY
3607	1	a	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it. Yesterday morning the milk I poured in my coffee made a sign. It said, â€˜Tomorrow youâ€™ll arrive in a place that will change your fate.â€™â€  2 out of 2 peaks.
3609	1	a	Zach, I think we've found a terrible port of an otherwise stellar game.
3611	1	a	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.  BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.  The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling. It's almost like this game has no right to be any good, but it has so much soul, and leaves you with such heartfelt goodbye, that you won't be able to anything but recommend it. Plus, it deals with some really heavy themes like child abuse, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, transsexualism, and it can get very rough and creative when it comes to violence, down to straight up shocking. It goes beyond what most games try.  The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.
3613	1	a	ITS A REALLY GOOD JELLY SANDWICH. REALLY GOOD.   20 times better then Twin Peaks better story better graphics too better sandwich better killer better deadbodies better driving better pot better good looking chicks better good looking tun licks better dogs better best friends better police people better humor better long kitchen table better suits better weapons better killer better controls better cigs better weird stuff coming out of nowhere better crying scenes better everything F.K/10   okay, im going to bed now. Let's hope I don't have spookyjellydreams about red sunflower seeds.  
3615	1	a	i seriously loved playing the game,i first watched half of it as a let's play a and bought + played it all by myself.  many people (Especially developers) think let's play videos make less of their games sell,while if you ask me,they do the opposite. Many games get reviews and trailers...but often they can't really convince people to try a game since they do not know if it's worth it. Let's plays give them more a feel for the game and convince them to experience it by themselfs aswell.  i loved how the game turned from a crime investigation...to a horror hunt for a killer that could be anyone and anything,i wish the raincoat killer would have been fought in his outfit/Character...but besides that,i loved every aspect of the game.  if you guys like in depth mysteries,great soundtracks,characters and horror games in general...go ahead and purchase it,it's worth every coin and i would pay TWICE it's price just cause of how awsome it is,good job SWERY !
3617	1	a	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage.

3619	1	a	This game from what I have played so far, is really really good. The story and investigation is interesting and really makes you want to think about what could be right. The port of this is as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but DPFix tool can easily fix a lot of problems and restarting your computer once you have installed it fixes even more. Crashes are pretty rare, but they give a lot of save points so its been fine so far. Driving in this game is like GTA but even worse control and every surface is made of ice. The talks you have in the car passes the time by pretty well. The game is suprisingly humours while still able to keep a very good feel to the horror parts.  The level designs are extremely atmospheric and the music in this game is great. The developers reference reality and themselves throughout the game and its pretty nice to catch on to them when they do make them. The game feels like a PS2 game should, its not something I feel on most games now adays and its really good feeling to go back in time. I strongly suggest this game even with the crashing problems from the port, most problems can be fixed with enough research and the DPfix Tool
3621	1	a	This game is buggy, broken, and horribly optimized, but it's perfect in every way.
3623	1	a	Buggy. Meh graphics. Clunky to average gameplay.  Yet it's one of the best games I have ever played.  The story is so well written, it really overshines the bad.  Definitely a diamond in the rough.   I can't stress enough to really, honestly, give this game a try.  (If you're a Twin Peaks fan...this is a MUST play.)
3625	1	a	This is probably the most broken release I've ever purchased on Steam, and I do not regret it at all.  Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.
3627	1	a	Once you get used to or just ignore the Playstation2 generation graphics, you will find this game to be quite the gem of Twin Peaks &amp; the X-files translated through some Japanese artist &amp; game designer then translated back to English to make a highly intense mystery-action game with addictive music, humorously written &amp; deep investigation game full of horror &amp; wonder. Hooked on this game after seeing it on GiantBomb &amp; happy to play it again as it's that wicked good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (once you get used to the art/controls).
3629	1	a	Watching True Detective reminded me of this game. Which is good I guess, considering the show is pretty awesome. And from what I played thus far, so is the game. But I have yet to finish it, because the game just keeps on crashing. It is truly a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ port, so if you are not in the mood to try out different fixes and work-around â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t I don't recommend this game at all. Although if you can tolerate its quirkiness and don't mind the frequent crashes (thankfully it auto-saves often enough) it can be a really great game. I definitely plan on continuing it once it gets magically fixed by the video game fairies. Deadly Premonition is unlike anything out there. It's a wild ride. A wild ride indeed, Marty.
3631	1	a	A clut classic in every sense of the word. Clunky, messy and confusing from a gameplay standpoint but utterly captivating both terms of it's narrative and it's outlandish presentation. With endless moments that make you you cringe, smile and gasp. And sometimes all at once. It's not for everyone but it proves that one man's bargain bin trash is another man's game of the year.
3633	1	a	Like many people, I played the tutorial section of Deadly Premonition on the 360 and dismissed it as a cheap, ugly, unwieldy, cheesy afterthought.  It's not. Boy, is it not.  Imagine a game made by someone who watched Twin Peaks, loved Resident Evil 4 and doesn't have a cynical bone in their body. The jankiness of the PC port evaporated along with the essential widescreen patch (YMMV however) and what was left was something that was in equal parts charming, kooky and memorable. It's an action adventure that wears its influences with pride and revels in its clunkiness.  I get it now. Swery intended *everything*.  Can't recommend the game at full price though because although it chimed with me in a big way, there are going to be people who hate it (and I can't blame someone for having a different taste to mine).  With a large reduction, everyone should at least try Deadly Premonition - Just promise me you'll play past the prologue.
3635	1	a	Deadly Premonition What can I say?  The graphics are awful, the voice acting is bad, the controls are clunky, and the gameplay is iffy. There's really no real reason to buy this game from a technical standpoint.  But that's the beauty of it.  Ignore everything I just said. Ignore all of it.  Buy this game.  These guys deserve all of the awards for this game. Because even though it's a terrible, TERRIBLE game, it's a masterpiece.  Don't miss out on this game. Trust me, it's a once in a lifetime experience that you will NEVER forget. The story is worth it.  Do it.
3637	1	a	A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up mix between Shenmue and Resident Evil.  Play if you want that PS2/Dreamcast era Nostalgia trip.
3639	1	a	This is by far the most interesting pile of absolute garbage I have ever had the brain grinding pleasure to wade through.
3641	1	a	the game is good on console  the true mystery is how to get this port working
3643	1	a	I love this game to death. (100+ Hours XBOX360) I'll be honest, this game is not for everyone. Should you choose to buy this game, one of these things will happen to you.  1. You'll immediately fall in love with the game, and the mood SWERY sets.  2. You will hate it, uninstall it, and DP will be one of those games in ur list that has only 30 minutes of total playtime and last played in years.  3. You slowly force yourself to play the game because it's 'CULT' and you inadvertently fall in love with it and become a fangirl/fanboy.   If you love this game, i recommend checking out SWERY's next game  'D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die'   10/10 IN SWERY WE TRUST.
3645	1	a	Twin peaks simulator 2013  If you want to bash Deadly Premonition, just go ahead. There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience. DP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy. The story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching. One of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters. The day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around. The dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while. For fans of Twin peaks and X-files, this is essential. Don't you agree Zach?
3647	1	a	This is by far the most interesting pile of absolute garbage I have ever had the brain grinding pleasure to wade through.
3649	1	a	a real gem if you can get past the horrible port
3651	1	a	Best game all year every year.
3653	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a game that David Lynch would have created had he been a Japanese game developer. It is strikingly similar to the television show Twin Peaks and one of the characters even bares an uncanny resemblance to an actress who played in 'Mulholland Drive', Naomi Watts. It's obvious the game's developers drew heavy inspiration from the show and Lynch's other works. If you ever wanted to play as Dale Cooper in a world so bizarre, spliced with elements of Silent Hill, then this is probably your best and only bet. Just be prepared for what is truly terrifying... a terrible PC port. Save often.
3655	1	a	This port isn't very good, it would be a better idea to play it on ps3 or xbox but if you really wanna play it on pc there are plenty of guides and mods that will help you get it running.
3657	1	a	its wrong in every right way!
3659	1	a	In the game, Deadly Premonition, the main character is recommended a sandwich consisting of turkey, strawberry jam and cereal stuffed between two pieces of bread. A few moments later, he declares it's the best. sandwich. ever.  That describes DP. It's a janky, open world game with poor controls, PS2-era graphics, the worst driving in any any game, and shooting controls that make you want to cry. The voice acting is painful (except York, the main character; I love that guy), and the character animation is so bad, I was shocked that they actually used motion capture for it. It's plot is a convoluted mess, liberally rips off Alan Wake, Twin Peaks, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and with a touch of Cthulu mythos.... and yet....  And yet it's been one of my favorite gaming experience of the year. It's a game so bad that it flips back to good, to bad again, and edges back to good again. All the pieces are so bad, yet the whole was so satisfying in a crazy sort of way.  Now excuse me, I'm going to try that turkey sandwich. Maybe it will surprise me too.    
3661	1	a	Positive: game is somehow unique in some way (like Braid, Limbo, Alan Wake and etc.). I love those 'unique' games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this gameâ€¦. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed... Negative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess Iâ€™ll write about everything what I didnâ€™t had positive opinionâ€¦ Sound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!). Ragdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little. Graphical look: this game looks like 2005 game. Well at least it is at acceptable levels. Enemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2). Boses: during the whole game you encounter X (I wonâ€™t spoil exact number but itâ€™s only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point.  Cutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. Itâ€™s related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there arenâ€™t a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if youâ€™re as am I more interest in a story it wonâ€™t bother you a lot). Dungeons: once youâ€™ll play your 4th or 5th dungeon youâ€™ll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These â€œdungeonsâ€ are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards). Loading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads â€œPress Start buttonâ€ (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game wonâ€™t crash) Iâ€™ll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) Iâ€™ll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hellâ€¦ I can even compare this games loading to Windows 7 booting timeâ€¦ AGAIN 10-20 secondsâ€¦).  Optimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasionâ€™s game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenesâ€¦ It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: â€œDo you want to save?â€ I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). Soâ€¦ In summary it crashes whenever it likesâ€¦ Donâ€™t forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even canâ€™t replay some chapters (I couldnâ€™t replay chapter 7 even after 20th tryâ€¦). Not sureâ€¦ Maybe crashes related to AMD card I haveâ€¦ For those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes: Increase game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this â€œincreaseâ€ method works only on 64-bit systems Use DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Soulsâ€¦ Devs couldnâ€™t add support for high resolutions). SET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark â€œRun as an Adminâ€. Shutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion listâ€¦). And yeahâ€¦ Never do anything to stress your computer during this gamesâ€™ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature). For those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..  So if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestionsâ€¦ That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).  And yeah although it annoyed me a lot I still liked game mainly due to it's story and gameplay :)
3663	1	a	Twin peaks was a weird show huh Diane?   Final score 8/10
3665	1	a	Well, it sure kept me up to date on my movie trivia.
3667	1	a	Played a few hours on it. Fantasic atmosphere, comedy, character and it seems to have a lot of depth. Really fun. PLaying it on windows 7 x64, it does have a bug but theres plenty of explainations how to fix it and its just 1 simple fix. No fps problems or glitches, plays well.
3669	1	a	Even with crashing during important cutscenes, crashing during gameplay, crashing when opening doors, and an altered color palette, it's still Deadly Premonition at it's core, and when you reach that core, with that sweet, sweet, beautiful nectar of Deadly Premonition, you will love it. Right before crashing and doing it again. So says Mr. Stewart.
3671	1	a	Go to where Steam is installed -&gt; SteamApps -&gt; common -&gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut -&gt; redist. Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..
3673	1	a	Having a good time as far as I played. Nothing quite like it. I got this on sale for $2.49 and I am not disappointed.  It's reminds me of games like Silent Hill and early Resident Evil.
3675	1	a	Amazing 10/10 Bad port. Better to play this game on console I suppose.
3677	1	a	One of the greatest games I've ever played.  The story is one of the best I've seen in a video game, the characters are all interesting and fun to interact with. There's tons of sidequest and stuff to explore.  The puzzles are also hard as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, my fav one is when the game kept crashing and I had to run it in windows 95 compatible mode to get it to work.  This is a must have for fans of surealistic horror games like Silent hill or clock tower. Highly recomend that you get it for Xbox as the port is horrible, though entertaining. 
3679	1	a	it hurts me to see a masterwork of budget sitting at a 'mixed' review amount on steam.  people don't understand the Real Dealâ„¢ when they see it. smh!!!! this is like a veritable fountain of lessons on game design. it works great as a 'what not to do' as far as engine development and bug testing and gameplay design, but its got so much heart and passion that it puts games of big budgets to shame when it comes to being a fun experience. infinitely better survival horror experience to any recent game by the dumb baby nerds at Capcom or Konami, even tho this game shamelessly apes off of their designs  admittedly though this port is a piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but hell people still like dark souls and bethesda games.
3681	1	a	I spent a few hours trying to get the game to work. It's crashed dozens of times. The graphics are awful. The port is basically a mess.  But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!
3683	1	a	The best terrible game ever. Truly great if you can get past graphics, and voice acting, and mechanics.
3685	1	a	If Haruhi were to write an adaptation of Twin Peaks, this would be the result.
3687	1	a	Aside from the crashes, and visual DEFECTS this game has gone through it's up there in my top 5 games. It's optimal to play this with a controller, and there's mods to fix a lot of this game up.
3689	1	a	Amazing 10/10 Bad port. Better to play this game on console I suppose.
3691	1	a	One of the worst ports ever. However the game is just a fantastic mess and if you can pull through the terrible performance then you are gonna love it. Keep your standards low for this one though.  If you have a Xbox 360 or PS3 I would recommend getting it on one of those instead. I just cannot get this game to perform properly even with fixes. The PS3 version is most likely the best one to get because the controls aren't a broken Resident Evil 4 rip off like the Xbox version, and the PS3 version has graphical and gameplay fixes too; along with an extra ending.   However then you might have some framerate issues. In that case, if anything, the more broken the better. You're then getting the true Deadly Premonition experience. I recommend the game, NOT this awful port.
3693	1	a	Great game, however it is quite buggy and crashes a lot. Buy on console if you can; but its still good on PC if you can be bothered with all the fixes etc.
3695	1	a	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Let's Play Deadly Premonition (part 1 - MY EYES!! [blind])&nbsp;
3697	1	a	'The balance of milk and butter you've achieved here... oh my...'
3699	1	a	If Haruhi were to write an adaptation of Twin Peaks, this would be the result.
3701	1	a	The definition of so bad it's good. What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists.   The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.  Isn't that right Zach?  (This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)
3703	1	a	I don't think I've spent more time on the starting menu on any other game than this.  This is not a game, this is an art.
3705	1	a	As much of a trainwreck as it is a masterpiece. A must play
3707	1	a	This is a terrible game. The controls are wonky, the actual gameplay is repetitive and it's full of QTEs. The PC port is a total disaster that barely works, crashing every 30 minutes and lacking basic 16:10 monitor resolution support, meaning I played the game with everyone being rather more skinny then they should be.  This is also one of my favourite games of all time. In every other way it's indescribably magical. Playing this game is like a religious experience.
3709	1	a	Let's just get something out of the way here: this port is one of the worst ports I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even after following a lengthy list of instructions and applying the DPFIx, DP: Directors' Cut features a butchered, shoddy port that is prone to frequent crashing, weird speed ups and slow downs, bizarre physics mishaps, corrupted saves, and a really, really weird issue where playing for more than two hours in one sitting can result in some... interesting... consequences for the engine.  And even if the game wasn't completely broken, it still suffers from a myriad of problems. The combat is abysmal. Not only does it feel tacked on, it literally is tacked on, as confirmed by Swery65, who explained that his publisher forced the decision in an effort to garner more sales. The combat is tedious, featuring only two distinct enemies: ones that die quickly with no effort and ones that take up five minutes of your time in pure tedium â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. If the combat is supposed to provoke a challenge, it is easily negated by how easily you can cheese the gameplay by acquiring infinite ammo and durability weapons early in the game, but not even instakill weapons can save you from a never ending supply of quicktime events.  Disregarding the gameplay, the graphics are incredibly poor. I'm not one to turn my nose at dated graphics, as some of my favorite games are before Steam was even a thing, yet Deadly Premonition released in 2010, the same year as Red Dead Redemption, Halo Reach, and Mass Effect 2. Going up against these games graphically is a bit ridiculous when the game looks like it came out in... 2006, but whatever.  At this point, you may be wondering why there's a postive thumbs up next to my review, since I've done nothing but trash Deadly Premonition. Well, the truth is that this game is the best worst game I've ever played. Like I've pointed out, there's just so much wrong with DP: DC, and yet, it's an incredible experience. All of the characters are well written and lovable, and all form a cohesive, believable community and setting. Dialogue is as bizarre as it is hilarious, and trust me, there is plenty of writing to enjoy. Weird quirks dominate the scene, such as having every single character follow a routine and schedule based on a variety of factors, and allowing sidequests only when the time is right, and pulling those sidequests away from you if you're too slow to grab them. Additionally, Deadly Premonition has care in weird areas that I've not seen in other games before, like letting you use your turn signal in a vehicle, or having your character be able to grow a beard and shave it regularly, or most unique of all, having your character sleep under the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing blankets.  Name me one game that lets you sleep under the covers besides Deadly Premonition.  ... *Ahem*  All in all, Deadly Premonition is a bizarre, flawed, hilarious, witty, diamond in the rough. It has a ton of bad, but if you're willing to put up with the bad and push through, you'll discover a truly unique experience that no other game will ever deliver quite the same.
3711	1	a	Well this is the best experience i have ever got from a video game, mixed with some really annoying designer choices. It is absolutely not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the problem on the surface you will find a very interesting and touching story with great characters. Personally, i am not going to forget this game ever.
3713	1	a	It's Twin Peaks: The Game. It's weird, it's wonky, the animations are terrible and some parts are so poorly written that I burst out in laughter when I played through them. This is one of the best games I have ever played.
3715	1	a	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an â™¥â™¥â™¥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'
3717	1	a	7/10 - This game - much like our main protagonist - is split into two halves.   On one side, it's a mechanical mess. Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).  But on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.  It is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of 'Weirdest game I've ever played', ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show.   If you can get past its technical faults, its definately one to experience. 'Isn't that right, Zach?'
3719	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever played. I beat it on ps3 and bought it immeadiately again for PC cause I really love this game. Yea it's not a major triple A game, and honestly, graphics, animations, gameplay while it's not super duper amazing, its amazing in it's own way. This is the definition of a niche title, and this has a great story and a enjoyable experience overall and I highly reccomend it. Sure it may be a lazy port but there is a mod online to fix it, I like the way it is however and it controls fine without a controller so I didn't bother with it. All in all this is an amazing game, right Zach?
3721	1	a	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemyâ€™s you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it wonâ€™t blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
3723	1	a	I played through this game on the Xbox 360 years ago, the play time listed for this version doesn't reflect that. Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.  When Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls. Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.  For everything this game seems to get passable or 'middling', there's something that makes you smile. Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it. You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.  Fans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players. I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks. There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series. The protagonist loves his coffee. The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.   This was one of my favorite games of 2010. If it's on sale I strongly recommend giving it a try. 
3725	1	a	Solve crimes.  Fight zombies.  Talk to your imaginary friend.  Shave your beard.  Oh â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is that a giant zombie dog behind my car?  That is a giant zombie dog behind my car.  Don't read the achievements' descriptions.  FUN.
3727	1	a	This game is truly one of the strangest games you'll ever play, but that's why it's brilliant.  It'll take some time to adjust to the clunky combat and annoying driving segments, but the story, the humour and the characters are all excellent.  I loved this game.  Not many people know about it, but don't be afraid to grab it! Highly recommended.
3729	1	a	This game is almost unplayaple. Not because the story and the game sucks but because of the crashes. This is a awful PC-port of a game. I would not recommend buying this with it's current price of 25 euros. If the price was like.. 5 to 3 euros you should buy this even tought you don't have a fat chance of playing this game trough without spending most of the time fixing crashes and bugs.  Still the story and Twin Peaks feels give this game my recommendation. Just don't buy this game with the absurd price of 25 euros.  EDIT: After 4 hours of fixing this game installing patches etc. it's semi-playable but remember to save freaking often because it will crash even tough you have done all the steps to prevent that from happening.
3731	1	a	Get some wine to go with this cheese. Quality video game. Its like Resident evil 4 had a bad relationship with Grand Theft Auto while also cheating on it with Dreamfall and somewhere someone had a kid that is this game and nobody knows who the father is.  Also fishing.  
3733	1	a	It's like Stephen King wrote script and David Lynch directed... (sic!) a videogame! A videogame that didn't suck! Highly recommended!

EDIT: After 4 hours of fixing this game installing patches etc. it's semi-playable but remember to save freaking often because it will crash even tough you have done all the steps to prevent that from happening.
3737	1	a	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.
3739	1	a	55 hours and I finally finished this game.  Bugged, cheesy, crappy animation, lots of stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing crashes all the time (thanks for the awesome port). You'll have to save your progress. Don't you ever forget! Because crash will catch you off-guard. Fan made fix for this game is almost required! Music is out of place almost all the time, it can switch from drama to comedy at any second.  But! Story was great. It always finds the way to surprise you, lots of symbolism will guide through this journey. It feels deep, rich and dark. Like a good cup of black morning coffee. This case was not easy to solve. Right, Zach? 8/10
3741	1	a	I would give this game a 10/10 if it didn't randomly crash on me. It's very unique, the story is great, the voice acting is good, gameplay is fun. The music is a little weird at times, and it doesn't seem to fit the situation. I get a good steady 60fps at 1440p using DP fix.

3745	1	a	It's Twin Peaks: The Game. It's weird, it's wonky, the animations are terrible and some parts are so poorly written that I burst out in laughter when I played through them. This is one of the best games I have ever played.
3747	1	a	Perfectly dysfunctional.
3749	1	a	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  
3751	1	a	I have nothing but complete adoration for this game. It gives off a hilariously off putting first impression, but when you put time into it the game gives you an incredibly enjoyable experience. My only regret is that I played it on the PS3 version with the Move controller so you can guess how well that went.
3753	1	a	This game man. This is one of the only games that I can't really explain to people at all. You either 'get it' or you don't. It's a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, don't get me wrong. However, behind all the cornyness, jankyness, bad voiceacting, bugs, terrible gameplay, terrible driving, etc. There is something so god damn geniuine about it, something with all of it's elements mixed together creates something beautiful and emotional if you are the type of person that can connect with it. Perhaps similar in a way to all the b-movies York seems to love so much.  It feels like all the very odd, surreal, quirky, sad, and happy aspects of life enhanced by the even more odd, and quirky low-budget japanese game design. And you take that, and you put Swery's special b-movie twist on everything. What comes out is a true, very long, adventure with some of the most memorable characters and stories in gaming today. If you are the kind of person that can really connect with it. I don't want to sound insulting, but I don't think most people will 'get it' without having a certain type of taste and perspective on things.
3755	1	a	Terrible shooting mecahnics, terrible gameplay, kinky animation, terrible(as for 2010) graphics and yet this game is a masterpiece. Storyline, soundtrack and style are all you need to fall in love with this game
3757	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a one of a kind game. I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.  It's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the 'feel' of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.  What's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world 'detective' game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...  Deadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it. Why? Because it's one of those 'love it or hate it' kind of games. I don't even know why I loved it, but when it crashed on me, I always just restarted it and kept playing.
3759	1	a	Buggy, unfinished port of one of the most memorible games ever made. Hopefully they fix this but considering what it is, that is a longshot. Go find a 360 copy.
3761	1	a	If you will ignore game's poor technical level, this game will be very interesting to play. The story, the setting, the execution of a detective's genre, each of them is very good. I never actually thought that there are detective games with mysteries, but this game's concept actually turned out pretty well.
3763	1	a	Yeah, this game has its share of problems. The PC port of the game is terrible, and I am glad I got to experience it on a console. It was only recently I decided to revisit the game on PC, and the amount of times it just crashes for no reason at all is just silly.  If you are a person that require decent graphics (you know, the visuals), then this game is not for you. In fact, the graphics are so poor for its time in this game that it looks more like it was released during the PS2 era, when it was in fact released during the PS3 era (I am using the PlayStation as a reference because it was on a PS3 I played this game the first time). They aren't particularly good, but if you can overlook this, then you're in for the next challenge.  The controls. Geezus. Who sat down with the driving part of this game and thought 'Yeah, yeah this is perfectly acceptable.'? Regardless of what platform you are playing this game on, the driving itself is way to challenging for its own good. Sure, it makes you laugh a bit the first time your car is suddenly on two wheels and spinning out of the road and into a ditch, or a house, or another car. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentyeth? Not so funny anymore. And the combat. Ugh. It can't require that much more polishing to actually get the combat controls improved, can it? Because the most challenging part about combat are the controls, rather than the enemies. And that's not the reason you want your game to be a challenge.  But, this aside, I still enjoy this game, and I still recommend this game. Why? Because of the story and the atmosphere. It is so rare to see a game where each and every character you meet feels well thought out and unique. Where the story of the game may not be super original, yet still manages to suck you in and surprise you with its many plot twists. It was my second playthrough recently (though it had been a few years), and I was still surprised by a few of the plot twists. And that's something special. This game is special. And if you like a good story, then this is something you cannot afford to miss.  Edit November 2016: Just nominated this game for The â€œTest of Timeâ€ Award. It truly is a gem that should be experienced.
3765	1	a	Despite having no right to be, this is one of my favourite games. It's utterly bizarre but I love it to bits. Please play it. It's a weird gem with some utterly horrible gameplay but it is somehow special.
3767	1	a	Gameplay is a little repetitive and clunky and there are some technical difficulties/limitations, but the story and characters are so weird and engrossing that you want to finish the game no matter what.
3769	1	a	Mixed. The game itself is charming and unique, they put love in it. But it has problems - both gameplay-wise and technical issues. Wait a bit until it would be patched up and don't miss it if you are fan of Twin Peaks-like stuff!!!
3771	1	a	Heyyo, 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think thatâ€™s the biggest strength in this game. Itâ€™s interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, itâ€™s quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and donâ€™t flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as youâ€™d expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1â€™s and those budget games youâ€™d find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeahâ€¦ vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I donâ€™t know the development cycle and I donâ€™t know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didnâ€™t focus inâ€¦ but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you donâ€™t saveâ€¦ so itâ€™s up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helpsâ€¦ so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)
3773	1	a	Damn fine cup of coffee.
3775	1	a	This game is good, can you feel it Zach? My coffee told me so
3777	1	a	It's like resident evil on drugs, coffee and stock chimpanzee sounds
3779	1	a	This is one of the most memorable and unique videogames I've played in my life...and believe me, I've played A LOT!  It's really hard to describe what makes this experience work but it does. Is it the atmosphere? Is it the narrative? Is it the characters?  This game is a hit or miss. You either like it or not. As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.
3781	1	a	A near masterpiece, yeah I said it. Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show 'Twin Peaks' are incredibly valid in setting, characterization &amp; situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an 'other world' when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port. The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has. This game truly is not for everyone but I enjoyed the heck out of it. An easy 9/10 from me.
3783	1	a	This game has dull gunplay, horrible driving and breaks all of the time. This is one of the best games I have ever played and everyone should play it to the end.
3785	1	a	A bad port of an already creaky game, the first enemy you will face in this game is the game itself. Google DPfix - the patch made by a saintly individual who also rescued the Dark Souls port - as this is essential. The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.  But here's the thing: I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully. From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight. You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening. You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town. This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.  For all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve: a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules. I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.
3787	1	a	Squirrels scream like chimpanzees. 10/10
3789	1	a	Because it's like Twin Peaks but MORE mental.   That said, it's a real mess of a port, and the patches still haven't fully fixed it. You have to get used to saving at every opportunity so that frequent crashes to desktop won't ruin too much progress.  But even in spite of that, it's still really worth having if you have an appetite for strange.
3791	1	a	Deadly Premonition tries so hard to be Twin Peaks and a survival horror. Because of the lack of fundings, the entire game feels like a cheap Twin Peaks/Resident Evil 4 knock off but not an awful knock off. Just cheap. People tend to have mixed feelings about this game. People seems to adore it, while others just can't stand this game. I understand both statements. If you can bear the awful pc port, awful survival horror part; go ahead. If you are a Twin Peaks fan, you gotta give this game a try. Even if you don't like it, you have to agree that this game has a cult following since its release.
3793	1	a	just a reminder that this is the best game to come out ever
3795	1	a	One of my favorite 'cult following' games. You will ether love it, or hate it's oddball charm. I like my 'F.K... In the coffee!' I hope we get a sequel someday.
3797	1	a	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
3799	1	a	*15/10, fun for the whole family.* This cultural phenomenon, which will come to define this generation for the next several decades, was most assuredly not inspired by the hit TV show 'Twin Peaks' and definitely does not blatantly rip off said show in a hilarious and heartwarming manner. Swery is a tortured genius, and his artistic soul -- tender and tormented -- is laid bare, raw and awesome. It would be a folly comparable to the fall of man to not partake in the seductive madness and ensnaring purity that is Deadly Premonition. If you do just one thing with your life that you can look back on with pride and say, 'I did it perfectly' when on your deathbed, let buying and playing this game be that one thing.
3801	1	a	Clear as a crisp spring morning!
3803	1	a	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
3805	1	a	this game is ridiculous, so many mistakes like the use of public domain monkey noises for squirells and the mutated sounding dogs, also not to mention this is a huge twin peaks rip off. 9/10
3807	1	a	A bizzare game that both saturizes modern 'horror' games and pays homage to the experemental Dreamcast titles like D and Illbleed. Despite the fact that it isn't a scary game, it's atmosphere is a suprisingly unsettling one that gets more insane and intriquing the longer you play. Despite the fact that it is just a lazy PS3 port the PC version is still the best version of this game you can buy but it's recommended you use the DP fix fan patch to fully enjoy it.
3809	1	a	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.
3811	1	a	The Twin Peaks vision David Lynch was never able to truly realize
3813	1	a	This game is amazing I would give it 100 stars if I could riveting story and real to life schizophrenia simulator.
3815	1	a	Controls - C / 4 out of 10 Graphics - C / 4 out of 10 Sound - A+ - 10 out of 10 Story - A+ - 10 out of 10  Verdict?  A++++++++++++++. 1000 out of 100  The greatest game I have ever, ever played. More deserving of the title 'Game of the Year' than any single game ever. Better than Ocarina of Time. Better than Fallout. Better than Grand Theft Auto. The true Famitsu would've given this game 280 out of 40.  Let me explain my scores up there some more. The graphics look like they belong to a game from the middle of the PS2 era, the controls are horrific. The music is amazing, but most of what makes it amazing is the timing of it. Sitting down around a table somber just after someone died? Bring on the whistling! But what truly makes this game shine, is the story and the characters. Every single character is interesting and lovable, though not always to the same person - for example I hate Raging Bull Jack, but I'm quite sure someone out there thinks Jack is hilarious.  For $24.99, this is one game you should not miss out on. So buy it, and get hype for the greatest game ever.  OK, Zach?
3817	1	a	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...
3819	1	a	This game makes me want to peek through every single window, despite long loading times between peeking in and getting back. It makes me desperately want to finish it despite the crash that forces you to play it in windowed mode. Its town feels alive, with real inhabitants, despite their quirky animations and weirdnesses.  I get lost driving with those horrible cars that veer right, and laugh to myself at the uselessly zoomed in map. And still, everything intruiges me to such a degree that I would call this a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would never want to be withouth.  There is so much to do and see, that I found myself fainting outside of an ingame diner and woke up after being driven to the hospital. Surprised I realised I had let my loveable strange FBI agent go too long withouth eating. Similiarly I noticed flies started gathering around me at one point, because I had not changed clothes and sent my worn ones to get washed. I'm growing a beard as the game progresses, as I have not choosen to shave.   The story is full of twists and turns. Every character IS a character, with motivations, secrets, a backstory... They all seem to have lived their lives up to the point you join them in the game. The side quests, silly as they may be, seem to fit in the world. Seldom does one come across a game that can make the gamer so immersed, it has the ability to frighten, make one laugh out loud, as well as puzzle and feel sad.  Cult classic: The mystery, the music, the ugliness, the beauty, the people, the humour, the dialouge... This Japanese tribute to Twin Peaks and movie trivia is beyond words. With all it's flaws, it's simply genius.
3821	1	a	Litterally the best game ever.
3823	1	a	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
3825	1	a	Really weird, but ultimately really good. Once you get over the quirks, it turns out to be a really solid game.
3827	1	a	this game has a great horror story with good gameplay i love the voice acting  this game has its creepy moments and it has its LOL moments  if you want a good horror / crime needs to be solved type of good then look no farther this game is amazing. 85 / 100
3829	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldnâ€™t miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and itâ€™s up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the townâ€™s biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where â€œan ingenious law school student â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over 800 victimsâ€ to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think youâ€™ve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, itâ€™s also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however itâ€™s worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When youâ€™re not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, youâ€™ll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesnâ€™t get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While youâ€™re shooting enemies you may encounter the â€œRaincoat Killerâ€ who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesnâ€™t find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they wonâ€™t impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole â€œso bad itâ€™s goodâ€ tactic perfectly.  Itâ€™s nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, itâ€™s like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think itâ€™s now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you donâ€™t have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If youâ€™re curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: â€œDeadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. Itâ€™s perverse, itâ€™s wrong, and yet itâ€™s so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing funny.â€  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad itâ€™s good; itâ€™s so bad its borderline perfection!
3831	1	a	Terrible but also good.
3833	1	a	The terrible gameplay actually makes the game better as a narrative and aesthetic experience, trust me.
3835	1	a	its got a great story  its got nothing else good about it at all
3837	1	a	Deadly premonition's port to PC is A real hot mess, even with the DPfix for 1080p and controller support is not enough. You still experience massive fps drops do to compatibility issues that can only be resolved by uninstalling most of your media players or changing the codex!  Well... Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale. Truly a flawed gem...
3839	1	a	A True Detective [Twin Peaks] of gaming. Twisted plot. Cult following. Very Swery.
3841	1	a	Remember the cult 90's show Twin Peaks? Fantastic series, and this game holds up well as 'companion media' to the show. You are put in the role of Francis York Morgan, an FBI Special Agent who is dispatched to the small country town of Greenvale to work on a homicide case. As the game progresses York becomes involved in the town's sinister affairs and realises that things are not as they seem.  The game plays a lot like an actual investigation. You will go to gather evidence, interrogate suspects and follow leads. The game world is open to you with no time limit, so there's nothing stopping you from enjoying what Greenvale has to offer!  The game's story is its true strength. The characters, locations and subplots adds to everything that makes the game 'so bad it's good'. A terrific game to play if you're interested in Twin Peaks or The X-Files.
3843	1	a	As much as it's ugly, clumsy, buggy, dated technologically and features some dull combat sequences that belong to much older PS2 games, none of its flaws are at all worth avoiding it for. Deadly Premonition features some of the best characters in gaming in the last 15 years, some fantastic and funny dialogue, a moving story, and some of the weirdest atmosphere you'll ever see. Where it fails, it somehow only enhances the experience. And where it succeeds it soars. It's completely and utterl one o fa kind and every gamer should play it on any platform they can find it on, because there's just nothing else like it. When your time comes to a close, you will so deeply miss York, Zach, Emily, Greenvale, and every looney in it.
3845	1	a	I played this game years ago, and to this day if someone asked me to name the craziest game I've ever played, or the most annoying game, or most surprising game, OR even one of the best games E-VER - you guessed it. This one right here.   I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.  I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did.   I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself 'I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!' I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.  It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!  Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.
3847	1	a	how did this game got a 58 on Metacritic?, aside from having to had to use DPfix, its an amazing experience just finished the prologue and the first fortune telling, and i can already feel all the potential of this game, controls are not the best but York, the coffe and even the old lady are all amazing, the voice acting ists so weird it even makes the game better, it may not be for all but for me its a 10/10 already i will update as soon as i advance more in the game.
3849	1	a	I knew this game was goig to be something else, my Coffe said so
3851	1	a	Very good game, wish there were a 2nd.
3853	1	a	Play Twin Peaks the game as imagined by an insanely quirky Japanese design team- wonderful charm despite the overt violence.
3855	1	a	Maybe we should send the ones who are responsible for this console port to the great city of Harvest. Steve the old kidder with his stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥ lumberjack shirt will accompany their trip for a night and if they come back Deadly Premonition will become the new Harvest and Twin Peaks in one. Ergo: The best â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing town/game ever.   Long story short: Buy this game, its awesome. Torture the ones who made this port. They deserve it.
3857	1	a	Buy this damn game.
3859	1	a	'This is the Best thing ever!' - Giant Bomb 'This is the Worst thing ever.' - Giant Bomb
3861	1	a	This is a game that allows you to say, 'One of the crappiest video games ever made' and 'One of the greatest video games ever made' and have both be true.
3863	1	a	What has often been referred to as one of the 'best-worst' games of all time. Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.  The game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him' and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?  Balancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately 'wacky' music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?  Yes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.  York and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious 'discussions' about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and 'Jaws' amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.  Deadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!  Edit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.
3865	1	a	Amazing game! With the disappointing turn the Resident Evil franchise took with 6 and ORC (though saved by Revelations) I have been on the lookout for any 3P Survival Horror that is actually entertaining. While this is no RE4, it's a fantastic game along those same lines. If you're a fan of 3PSurvival Horror games such as Resident Evil 1-5/Revelations, you must try this one.
3867	1	a	Great atmospheric game. Word of advice: do not rush thorugh game. Explore as much as possbile.
3869	1	a	Worth it just for the ending.
3871	1	a	Clunky combat, weird out of place humor, goofy main character, and self aware side characters. Mix this up with fairly bad performance, terrible terrible driving physics, hard crashes, and what do you get?  A game that ends up being good despite the flaws. Pick it up today!
3873	1	a	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.
3875	1	a	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.
3877	1	a	Mysterious capitalists and cross dressers; whats not to love
3879	1	a	Best worst game ever made. Level design is terrible. Driving mechanics are horrific. Camera is annoying as anything to control. Will continue playing and probably play over again at least twice. 10/10
3881	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a good game but good god this is a terrible port. It took a frankly embarrasing amount of fiddling with fan-made patches and with the games files to get it working and even then it's seems to be running slow. I liked this game a lot on Xbox but I can't recommend it on steam at all.
3883	1	a	I would keep it short.  PC port is terrible, interface is a bit annoying at times, incredibly odd and strange driving, constant crashes and FPS drops.  But it still one of the best games I've played. Intriguing story, charismatic characters and dence atmosphere is what makes the game this great.  About technical part of the game. The following quotes says it all: 'I would drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass just to play another 20 mins of this game's story. ' Steam user jerry.   If you are willing to fight the glitches and crashes, you would experience everything that makes this game so great.
3885	1	a	Deadly Premonition is what Resident Evil and Silent Hill would be like if they had a lot more social awkwardness, imaginary friends, and talk of real life 80's movies. Also, it has music from Super Mario World. For $25, your sides will hurt more than your wallet..   Also there's F.K. In the Coffee.
3887	1	a	a diamond in a dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.  What do you think, Zach?  10 out of 10 coffees
3889	1	a	this game is so japanese it hurts
3891	1	a	Opened a fridge and found a trading card of a turkey sandwich. ... 11/10
3893	1	a	This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice. That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.
3895	1	a	The best detective game ever. You get to talk to yourself and chase potential suspects around in their daily lives like follow them to the club or grocery store. Be prepared this game is so good you will talk to yourself and develop a close alter ego.
3897	1	a	This game is funny. But absolutly not worth $25.00. So either get it on G ... 2 ... A .com (Sorry for the weird link, steam wont let me write the website). were it is 2 bucks or get it on sale for under 5.
3899	1	a	I LOVE THE GAME.... But the downside is the PC Port the sound quality and the effects are horrible especially 5.1 but overall it's a cult classic it's a beautiful game,there's something about this game that just simply reminds me of Sega I just can't put a pin on it but I know it's something nostalgic but with that being said the storyline is so rich it draws you in and just how corny the jokes are....to put it simply just reminds me of an old-school corny detective movie do I recommend the game?, yes but buy it when it's on sale... like i did for 3 bucks
3901	1	a	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...
3903	1	a	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
3905	1	a	This game is amazing I would give it 100 stars if I could riveting story and real to life schizophrenia simulator.
3907	1	a	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.

3919	1	a	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
3921	1	a	I played this to completion on 360. When I first ran this on PC, I did get a crash at startup, but this was fixed by setting to WinXPSP3 mode and running as administrator on both the launcher and dp.exe. Please keep in mind it might be a hard game to get going, since it's a lazy port. BUT THE GAME IS AWESOME This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The characters and story are so weird that you'll keep laughing and keep trudging through the game just so you can find what happens next. There is no other game like this game. Yes the graphics are bad and the game controls pretty poorly, but if you can make it past those things, you have an unforgettable cast of characters and amazing plot to keep you playing into the wee hours of the night. I recommend that everyone try this game for at least two hours. If the graphics are too bad for you, grab the dpfix which is listed in the forums. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.
3923	1	a	This game aint for everyone, the shooting is clunky and easy, the camera can be annoying at times, the game crashes (and needs to be played as Admin, if you want to get past the part) and the graphics look worse then an early Xbox 360/PS3 game. That all said, the game is amazing. The story, the characters and the dialog make the game what it is. Its a special kinda game that cant really be said why its so great, you have to play it yourself. 10/10 we need more games like this.
3925	1	a	It's like Skyrim with a cup of coffee.
3927	1	a	This game is so bad that it is good. Just buy it for the most akward experience ever on PC ever. Just buy it.  
3929	1	a	What IS this game even
3931	1	a	I usually like to go in depth with my 'reviews' but...I just...this game. If you like Twin Peaks and you like Resident Evil style gameplay, give this a try. It's deceptively good despite the incredibly low budget. Also get DPfix because the port is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
3933	1	a	After living through the best 42 minutes of my fledging adult life I've come to the realization that I've ecountered the best single experience one can dream of.  Within this nearly 3/4 of an hour of bliss I've witnessed grotesque horrors beyond my mind's capabilities, dialogue AND monologue worthy competing of Shakespeare's best soliloquys. The life like animation engaged me on not only an emotional level but that of a spiritual one as well. The picturesque enviroment had me on the verge of tears in terms of sheer beauty; the amount of love the developers put into making every drop of water in the lakes and every leaf on the trees shows their commitment to the art that is VIDEO GAMES. The subtle yet numerous pop culture references to movies and films also shows how up to date and hip this studio is. The sound quality and level of fidelity to it is in of itself amazing, the character's voice actors really engage each other with passion for the roles they play.   In short this game is the Citizen Kane of Schindler's Lists' and is truly deserving of being called art. if it was any more perfect I'd need to check myself for testicular cancer. I can't enjoy anything else now, this was the top and it'll be downhill from here on out.  9/11 it was an inside job worth making.
3935	1	a	Who says 'its two hundred' when you want to say its 20:00 c'lock... thats how unique this game is..
3937	1	a	Wow.... This game is really REALLY AMAZING... I recommend it ! 100%!  -Please use the DPfix (lastest release) **Dont overdo with the graphical options or it will crash ALOT** -ALWAYS run it as Administrator!  It never crashed on me  10/10! I love it! 
3939	1	a	This game looks like crap, plays like crap, craps out a lot, lots of crappy glitches, and yet is one of the best pieces of crap I've ever played. Just expect a lot of weirdness in this crap. I recommend only for its story.
3941	1	a	(6.5/10) [65%]  Strange game, Captivating. (8/10) @first, then levels out. You need to endure, but it is engaging.

3943	1	a	Yo this game is weird, I love it
3945	1	a	This port is worse than 9/11.
3947	1	a	This game is likely one of my favorites that I have played within the last couple of years. There are many flaws in the game engine which vary from person to person, but the game was good enough for me to want to push past them. Once I got into the game a bit, terrible things like frame-rate drops stopped happening, and the main bugs were just the physics engine.  As a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.  Onto the game elements...  + Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.  + The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.  + The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).  - The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting 'monsters' was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.  I still think that the game altogether was great, just getting past the glitches took a while. If you are looking for an off-the-wall, but really interesting, action/drama game, just look into this one.

3951	1	a	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.
3953	1	a	Hi! My name is David Lynch and I approve this game.
3955	1	a	Yo this game is weird, I love it
3957	1	a	I made this short because people should know about this game. The story is amazing... it is probably one of the best game I have ever played. The only problem is that the port is terrible but if you ok to deal with it. You will not regret it at all... the story will make you play all the way to the end.
3959	1	a	It's so good, the chipmunks make monkey noises.  What's even better is, you can even turn the graphics up to... Oh wait. Nevermind.   IGN RATES: 10/10  
3961	1	a	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâ€™s good.
3963	1	a	Essentially the Twin Peaks video game, but I'm sure not complaining. Deadly Premonition is a stylish and unique gaming experience, and definitely worth its status as a cult game. My only complaint is the fixed graphic setting and the limited number of control/performance tweaks in-game (settings can only really be adjusted in the launcher), but otherwise a must play.
3965	1	a	If you take the characters, setting, and 90% of the story of Twin Peaks and mix it with Silent Hill-style controls and gameplay, this would be the result. I had a friend who described it as 'Japan trying to make an American game', and he is absolutely right. The voice acting is wonderfully bad and rarely matches the animation (which is a trip in itself), the story is very convoluted, messy, and each NPC seems to have an entire detailed backstory (not necessarily a bad thing), the color pallet flips from blood-and-rust to pastel-everything, controls are clunky and tasks like shooting or driving become a chore, and this game holds the record for the most inappropriate use of 'Amazing Grace' in history.  If so much is wrong with it, why do I love this game so much? Deadly Premonition is an EXPERIENCE. Its shortcomings make it all the more charming. The poorly-timed voice acting results in random one-liners that should not be funny. The story, while almost too big for one game, is rather enjoyable and the character's timelines intersect in interesting ways. Plus, nothing beats charging headfirst through hospital hallway doors because it's quicker than opening them normally.  As much as I can try, Deadly Premonition is too much to describe in one review. You're either going to love it or hate it. There is no in-between.
3967	1	a	it's something else...
3969	1	a	Don't buy this game if you like coffe and smoke cigarettes! It may triple your consumption!  Oh wait..it's on sale! You save 22 bucks! That's enough to compansate!  Buy it!  Now!  Enough said!  Need a coffe and cigarette now!  Zach is back!
3971	1	a	This is NOT a full review of a game, just a post about my personal experience getting this game to run. I have not encountered a single glitch, crash, hiccup or failure to launch while playing this, and I will post my specs below so others can compare. If you have similar specs, I wouldn't expect this game to be difficult for you to launch. Plus its $2.49 on Humble bundle right now.  -Intel core i7-6700HQ @ 2.6GHz -Windows 10 with most recent updates (AE) -Nvidia GeForce 960M -16GB RAM
3973	1	a	This is a game where the villains definitely need a hug Zach.  OK, now I've played through the whole game and it's the first game I've 100% completed. I love this game, I didn't want it to end. It's a good game and that comes despite it's inherent jankiness. Lets face it, the graphics are terrible, the combat is repetitive and boring and it crashes far too often. But those aren't what's important in this game. What's important and what makes this a good game is the story, the setting and the characters.  York is one of the most interesting game characters I've played. He's a pleasure to get to know as the game peels back layers of his personality and you come to genuinely care for him. The town, Greenvale, feels more alive than many game towns. It's full of personalities that while they may be one note quirks, are interesting and often have a reason or a story behind their quirk. I recommend you do the side quests which uncover these stories.  The game makes you care about it's characters and that makes the story have impact. I won't spoil the story because you need to play it yourself. Play this game, there is no other like it and that's the best good thing about it.
3975	1	a	This game is absolutely delicious for those with a taste for weird stuff. The PC port is best described as 'playable.' That is, after installing DPfix. It also allows one to make it much prettier than the original. Pro tip: if something isn't working, reboot. For some reason this game likes when you reboot.
3977	1	a	If there was a reward for Controls Worse than a Car with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for Wheels, then this game would have a shelf dedicated to it. Seriously invest in a controller for this game. The game at its base is bad. Like, really bad. There's a major issue with the game that prevents it from even launching 90% of the time and the game is stuck in a windowed view with no way to change it. There aren't even any graphical settings that you can change.  That aside, the game is still enjoyable. It's one of those gems that's so bad it's good.  Also, here's a link to a mod that lets you change the graphical settings, window view bs, and fix most if not all launch failure issues:  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 
3979	1	a	Turn signals and windshield wipers make this game a more realistic driving simulator than forza motorsport or grand turismo. Solid 5/7
3981	1	a	Love every aspect of it
3983	1	a	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut review     1) Essential - buy it NOW
3985	1	a	This game. Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's just like one of my mystery Chinese visual novels, except in America.  i cant click the yes button enough
3987	1	a	The combat is atrocious, but the story is extremely entertaining, and is very easy to get immersed in. Enjoy your visit to Greenvale! Take your time and don't rush through the story!
3989	1	a	An amazing game, one the best of the last generation, and also one of my favorite games of all time even though it doesn't shine technically. The graphics aren't very good, the controls are clunky but the atmosphere, setting and characters are outstanding and make the purchase really worth it. Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.
3991	1	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan  Deadly Premonition is GOTY for sure If you're tired of boredom then here is the cure If you don't believe me just buy it and see Now you can play it on your PC  So says Mr Stewart.
3993	1	a	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.
3995	1	a	Pure B-Movie in game form. It is amazing.  If you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.  As a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.
3997	1	a	Don't buy until it's fixed...
3999	1	a	Bad console port game with some crash problems. But crazy plot and funny dialogues makes this game weird enough to get interested. Also, Twin Peaks references.
4001	1	a	Take that game without hesitation if you like apocalyptic games. It is funny because it is weird so it makes me laugh with the random musics. The graphic details does not affect the pleasure to play. The charm of that game is the richest content gameplay wich it allows a good longevity
4003	1	a	This game is a good example of high concept not being matched by execution. There's a fix out there for the resolution issues, but nothing can save you from the crashes. If this game were a bit more polished, it would seriously be the greatest game of all time. As it stands, it's a flawed gem.  Buy it. Play it. Imagine a world in which it functioned better.
4005	1	a	WHAT THE HELL IS MY LIFE  This game is incredibly stupid  Seriously, in retrospect it's horrible  It begins with lots of laughs but the last three or so hours are insane  Yeah go play it or something
4007	1	a	The production values are last gen, the dialouge is goofy and awkward, the voice acting flip flops between lazy and hammy as hell, and yet...well, somewhere around the second hour this game transformed from a seemingly 'me too!' survival horror game to one of the most engrossing open world titles I've ever played. It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.
4009	1	a	This game... It's just weird, in a good way. Kind of like Twin Peaks. If your into horror games and want to try a game that's out there. Pick this one up, it will not disappoint.
4011	1	a	This game is great, despite being (technically) clunky and having an unpolished gameplay. It is a great example that games don't need top production values in order to be good. I'd say it beats most of today's games in the game design department.
4013	1	a	Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.
4015	1	a	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.
4017	1	a	Twin Peaks: The Video Game
4019	1	a	Clear as a crisp spring morning
4021	1	a	My coffe made me play this game. And I don't regret a single moment spent playing it. The graphics are awful, the gameplay is horrible and sometimes frustrating, but the story makes you forget about the game's flaws. Twin Peaks like characters and setting, crazy dialogues, surprisingly good score. Go play it. Now.
4023	1	a	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!  
4025	1	a	Beyoutiful
4027	1	a	Weird but very enjoyable story.
4029	1	a	Iâ€™m usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâ€™s a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâ€™s a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ€™ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donâ€™t let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâ€™s supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donâ€™t assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâ€™s a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.
4031	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
4033	1	a	Install DPfix, get the FMV cutscenes working with the K-lite codec pack, then pray it won't crash all the time, and save often.  Fantastic David Lynch-esque story with deep characters, unlike anything you've ever played. 10/10
4035	1	a	The combat is atrocious, but the story is extremely entertaining, and is very easy to get immersed in. Enjoy your visit to Greenvale! Take your time and don't rush through the story!
4037	1	a	Spooky, funny, baffling... sometimes all at the same time. This game is fun to explore.
4039	1	a	It's so bad that it's pretty good.  Beware though, pc port is not too good. The controls work out fine, but getting it to run at times can be a pain. It can be worked around though.  I rarely had some cutscenes (about 2) crash the game, this is extremely annoying, but again, it can be worked around.  I really enjoyed the game at first, until around like episode 4 it starts dragging out and becomes very repetetive. There is a lack of enemy variety, (only about 3)
4041	1	a	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
4043	1	a	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
4045	1	a	A great game with extra staff . you should buy it .
4047	1	a	Positives: Fantastically weird characters, and dialog. Very Twin Peaks inspired setting. Some decently creepy moments. Absolutely deranged music.  Negatives: Dated visuals. Slightly clunky controls. Absolutely deranged music (sometimes it can be annoying!)

4051	1	a	Played the crap out of this when it was first released on the Xbox 360. This is often thrown into the pool of 'so bad it's good' games, but I absolutely disagree with this notion. This game is incredible. It is flawed, very flawed, but it has character and soul that most games lack in abundance. It's fun, interesting, and it's really an unforetable experience. For best results, watch all of Twin Peaks before taking the dive into Deadly Premonition, which pays homage to Twin Peaks in really charming ways. 10/10
4053	1	a	This game is great, despite being (technically) clunky and having an unpolished gameplay. It is a great example that games don't need top production values in order to be good. I'd say it beats most of today's games in the game design department.
4055	1	a	this game is bat squeak crazy and for some reason i can't stop playing
4057	1	a	Funny and quirky all of the way through. 
4059	1	a	Twin Peaks: The Video Game
4061	1	a	This is the greatest achievement mankind has ever made. The pyramids of giza, the Collossus of Rhodes, the Empire State Building, and the whoopie pie combined cannot even begin to match the absolute perfection and impressiveness of this game. 10/10 would play with my dog.
4063	1	a	Very bug ridden game with terrible gameplay mechanics, shooting straight outta RE4, dressing system that does nothing. And the game looks like a PS2 era release. That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.
4065	1	a	I've been sitting outside this bar for 8 hours now smoking because I want to break up this guy's engagement so he'll give me an infinite wrench I can use to beat Sadoko to death. It should be open but it's raining. God dammit open the door I want to do other dumb side quests like teach a police officer how to cook while not solving the mystery everybody is always getting on my case about.
4067	1	a	This is the greatest game ever made. The graphics make it, the characters make it, the surprisingly living world makes it. It â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on most of the 'Next-gen' crowd in my opinion.  Move over GTA with your civvies that complain about their TW@T net. Move over David Cage with your ham characters and QTE rain. Move over Resident Evil 6 here's a true horror game.  Make love to this
4069	1	a	There is always a director in japanese videogames: a director masterly chooses perspective in cutscenes and uniquely introduces stupendous characters, whose skeletons in the closed give you 15 hours of enhanced gameplay.   But first, make sure you caught enough breath, because authors will knock the stuffing out of you by all means and throw you in a great sea, that contains amazing stories about each inhabitant of Greenvale. This sea has hundrends of freshets, and, for example, zingy York is unquestionably perfect in all ways: in actions, gestures and facial expressions.  Every single  local freak is perfect in that ways too. Thus, youâ€™ll never want to leave these boondocks on the edge of civilization.  And the most enjoyable aspect of DP will help you capture dozens of seconds spent in that mysterious place. It is the soundtrack: atmospheric music and your guide in endless mind-voyage.
4071	1	a	Story of this game is well-made but also full of cliche, still fun. performance is low and lots of bugs and crashes. If you still want to play this game, you must prepare yourself with lots of patience for reboot your computer. I played this game about 48 hours (+several hours for reboot and finding solutions for crashes) but do not regret with it.
4073	1	a	Beyoutiful
4075	1	a	Perfection
4077	1	a	Creeeeeepy Japaneseness!!!! Like Resident evil! PS2 fun!! Washed out pallet... crazy zombies... more cut scenes than game.. bit Devil may cry...but is fun nice atmoshphere play it and try to understand the story off the bat?
4079	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.
4081	1	a	Just finished this game and definitely want more. Its storyline keeps you so wrapped up in what's going on and the characters that you don't want to put it down. I couldn't stay away once I started it! I highly highly highly recommend this game.   Didn't have some of the computer problems others are posting about, however it would crash once in a blue moon, but enough save points to where it didn't make me backtrack.   Get. This. Game!
4083	1	a	WORST PORT EVER
4085	1	a	In every possible quantifiable way, this game is terrible. The graphics are sub-par, the music is bad and the wrong volume. The voice acting is dry. This PC port crashes a lot. But by god, if it all doesn't come together somehow in a broken hot mess that's one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. As if Silent Hill and Twin Peaks had a twisted mutated baby.
4087	1	a	Filled with a patent strangeness not unlike that of Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition provides an incredibly memorable cast of characters and an excellent story that will keep you guessing until the end. The game is thrilling, suspenseful, intense, cheesy, and ridiculous, with the right balance of each. It has relatively low production values, but it's almost endearing, feeling akin to cult B movies. This game has solidified itself as one of my favourites. I have no doubt I will come back and play this game again many times in the years to come, reliving the story and getting to know the citizens of Greenvale all over again. Right, Zach?  A quick disclaimer: This game is a relatively poorly done console port, so at the time of writing, there are some technical issues. I found the experience was greatly enhanced by using DPFix and JoyToKey to play with a controller with better looking visuals. Crashes were rare for me, and I was able to play the game without too many problems, but some others have had trouble running the game. The developers have expressed intent to fix these issues, though, so we will hopefully see an improvement soon.
4089	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a game unlike any other that has came out in recent years. The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today.   The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the â€œother worldâ€. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.  It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude.   As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York.   Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale.   Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map.   The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various â€œother worldâ€ levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right).   The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.  Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the â€œother worldâ€.   These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word â€œPROFILINGâ€ fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the â€œother worldâ€, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred.   Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as â€œShadowsâ€. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.  To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.  Continued...
4091	1	a	Absolutely terrible port! No graphic option, not even resolution. It has a crashed a lot of times for me.  As a game I have mixedfeelings. First impression was a low budget game with terrible writing and voice acting, yet for some reason I kept playing. The story got somewhat interesting and made me wanna see the ending. Halfway through the game the story just takes a turn for freaking weird. It's a shame cause it had could have been a very interresing story.  On the gameplay side there are a lot of things wrong with the game. The driving for one is abysmal, you would have more luck driving concrete then cars in this game. The shooting is a bit so so but entertaining enough. There are a lot of sidemissions which are basicly all very short and very boring. The writing of some of the dialogue can be absolutely terrible, whilst the writing of the main story is not to bad.  Oh and make no mistake this is not a horror game not by a long shot! It's more of a murder mystery game, yet it's so weird it's hard to follow what is actually going on.  Still even in all it's flaws I would recommend trying it.  6/10
4093	1	a	This game can be summed up pretty easily: Twin Peaks plus zombies. 
4095	1	a	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)
4097	1	a	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.
4099	1	a	Iâ€™m usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâ€™s a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâ€™s a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ€™ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donâ€™t let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâ€™s supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donâ€™t assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâ€™s a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.
4101	1	a	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
4103	1	a	A beautiful, terrifying disaster. Make sure that you download the DPfix mod to use higher resolutions.
4105	1	a	If you like Twin Peaks buy it now.  If not, the other reviews have got it covered.
4107	1	a	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
4109	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played.

4111	1	a	8/10 Played this first on the Xbox. A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game with a fantastic story. If you can suffer through the horrible driving an medieval graphics for a truly rewarding mystery this game is for you.
4113	1	a	Mr. Random Review Reader  '10/10'  So Says Mr. Stewart.
4115	1	a	Visually and mechanically, Deadly Premonition is way, way below what you'd expect from a modern game.  Genuinely one of my favourite games ever made. Isn't that right, Zach?
4117	1	a	Struggled to get it working initially, but this game is inexplicably terribly made and a great experience.
4119	1	a	An amazing game, one the best of the last generation, and also one of my favorite games of all time even though it doesn't shine technically. The graphics aren't very good, the controls are clunky but the atmosphere, setting and characters are outstanding and make the purchase really worth it. Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.
4121	1	a	Turn signals and windshield wipers make this game a more realistic driving simulator than forza motorsport or grand turismo. Solid 5/7

4137	1	a	Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.
4139	1	a	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!

4151	1	a	Great game, bad port. The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the 'So bad it's good' type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain.   Everything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.  The gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.  The game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.  The game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.  The game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Possibly the funniest cutscene in the game&nbsp;

4171	1	a	It's good.
4173	1	a	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.
4175	1	a	The bad: It's not a good port, you must use a small mod to get it to run in 1080.  The good: It's batshit crazy - so bad it's good.  If it wasn't buggy I'd give it an 9/10 so far.  I'll let IGN explain it ...  'Imagine if you took the complete script from David Lynchâ€™s Twin Peaks television series, translated it into Japanese, then translated it back into English, then had a drunk friend read it to you from the passenger seat of your car while they clumsily flicked between obscure jazz radio stations that intermittently fluctuated in volume.'
4177	1	a	Suda51 + Twin Peaks' lovechild. All time GOTY.   Horrible, horrible PC port though, be warned. 
4179	1	a	One day i was able to play it for 5 hours straight without any crash or freeze and it was the best day of my life. 10/10
4181	1	a	THANK YOU BASED DURANTE  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/ 
4183	1	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Technically,  DP  is a charlie foxtrot It's ugly, and crashes a lot  You'll have to wrestle with it to play Set compatibility and back up your saves  The port to mouse is cause to frown York can aim neither up nor down  It makes attempts to be realistic But lays the uncanny valley effect on thick  E.g., a map to some godforsaken hole Costs 71 times the fine for destroying a telephone pole  And you can subsist on cans of tomato paste Open them first? But that would be a waste!  The presence of zombies is never explained (Save that without them, revenue might not be gained)  Gameplay has a few minor flaws Like the crazy handling when driving cars  Even so, if you're playing for the story Buy it (on sale); you won't be sorry  You control a federal investigator Tracking a supernatural serial killer  The fourth wall is cleverly under attack York is schizo, and thinks you're his friend Zach  You'll travel to a small town and meet the residents Who have lives of their own (and don't always make sense)  Question them, and learn the local folklore Might it be real and connected to the recent gore?  You'll find there's more to this case than meets the eye If at the Raincoat Killer's hands you don't die  Still, no need to rush in investigating the deaths Goodness knows, there's always time for sidequests  So says Mr. Stewart.  Note for pedants who have already played the game:   I know York has dissociative identity disorder, not schizophrenia, but it looks like schizophrenia until episode 6, and I don't want to spoil that reveal.  
4185	1	a	Played for about 10 minutes so far and a squirrel was about to get hit by a car and made monkey noises before running off. Oh, and two little boys seemed more interested in a lady bug than a dead woman tied up to a tree with her guts spilled out and their grandpa didn't even think to get them away from the murder scene once the police arrived.  Really good so far.  42/10
4187	1	a	What an awkward game... 6/10

4191	1	a	Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free 'Pros &amp; Cons' section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.  Pros: + Lovable characters in a charming setting + Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing + Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot + Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore  Cons: - Frequent crashes (both random &amp; reproducable) - Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs - Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX - An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food &amp; sleep were almost never needed) - Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable - Terribly timed and overused QTEs - Tons of muddy, low-rez textures - Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes - A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game   Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.   Spoilers below, you have been warned!  I went into Deadly Premonition expecting 'Resident Evil with FBI Agents' and instead received 'Shenmu with Zombies'. While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.  Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce 'supernatural' elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 &amp; 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.  All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.  While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with 'Previously during the investigation...' segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.
4193	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played. Based Swery.
4195	1	a	its so bad its good
4197	1	a	DONT BUY!!!!!! ITS A TRAP!!!!
4199	1	a	BEST GAME EVER  BUY THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING GAME ALREADY YOU SCRUB THIS IS THE WORST PC PORT YOU WILL EVER PLAY BUT ITS THE BEST GAME YOU WILL EVER PLAY AND IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY LIKE A BABY BY THE END OF IT.
4201	1	a	Twin Peaks + Silent Hill + GTA = ??? Ugly and quirky, the atmosphere and style are awesome nevertheless, plot is good and gameplay is generally ok. The musical score has some gems as well. Would love to see the sequel or something spiritually similar done with an AAA budget.
4203	1	a	I temporarily stopped playing this game to watch the movies York was talking about. Thanks, Zach!
4205	1	a	It has problems right from the beginning, at first the game crashed on me until i used a patch after thoroughly searched the internet for it, you are faced with bad graphics and the shooting mechanics are extremely similar to Resident Evil 4 but that's irrelevant when you enter the twisted and somewhat funny story of Deadly Premonition. I have to admit, i haven't seen in my life characters so unique and entertaining while remaining mysterious, creepy and peculiar at the same time. The story is compelling and the way the game goes are 'too real' for a generic sandbox game, you put gasoline in your car, you use the turn signals in your car, you cannot overspeed (not always) and if you don't change your clothes regularly you'll get dirty and flies will fly over you. It's sense of humour always makes me come back for more and, if you forgive these problems i just mentioned in this review, you too.  Good Luck, Zach
4207	1	a	It's alright.
4209	1	a	This game is so horrible, weird and ugly, it makes you like it. I feel like I am being indoctrinated into some sick cult. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and similar stuff, you should try it. Otherwise, don't.
4211	1	a	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.
4213	1	a	The game has squirrels. 10/10
4215	1	a	If you like good stories then this one will get hold of you like nothing else in videogames. The graphics, combat system and narrative seem cheap and slightly broken at first and you'll be amused in an ironic sort of way. Quickly this disappears to be replaced by genuine affection for the characters, the town and even the things that you previously considered broken. I wouldn't change a thing.
4217	1	a	It's hard to recommend this in a normal way, because this is one that you just get it or you don't. I absolutely love it. And it's not even 'so bad it's good', I mean yeah, the graphics and animations and voices and everything are so kooky but it's an open world psychological survival horror thriller where everyone has their own schedules, and you have to eat/shave/do laudry and there's all sorts of weird side quests, some of which can't even be done until you've beaten it a few times, and Francis York Morgan is one of the single greatest video game characters ever.  I don't know, I mean, I get why at face value some people can't get behind it, but I just really feel like if you actually play it and still don't like it, I mean, I kinda feel sorry for you.
4219	1	a	Zach, my coffee warned me about this PC port.  Play this on console if you can. Most people wouldn't bother to troubleshoot all the issues to get through this game but for some reason I did. I don't regret it at all though.
4221	1	a	This game is balls. This game is seriously balls. It crashes, it burns, it sucks the soul out of me.  3/5, it's neutrally positively horrible.
4223	1	a	Gameplay isn't the best, but the story is good. One of the best games I ever played.
4225	1	a	Have you wondered what would happen if you replaced everyone in RE4 with ham actors? Well wonder no more cause that's what Deadly Premonition is, delicious ham acting. Yeah there are times that the voices would change tone mid-conversation, and the driving is pure-crap but that's ok the story makes up for it so much.   9/10 wish it had less bugs  P.S. You shoot a tree with moving hands, just so you can get a hand shaped doorknob.
4227	1	a	Let me tell you something about Deadly Premonition. The controls are clunky, and driving, being maybe half of the game, is a nightmare. The character animations are awkward and at times terrifying. The squirrels make public-domain monkey noises and the fast travel mechanic (if you get it) is punctuated with a cartoon car crash sound. The voice acting ranges from actually enjoyable to god-awful. Half of the time, the game crashes or won't let me load my saves, and I had to download a patch just to get the game to run at over 720p.  This might be one of the best games I've ever played. 'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity. This isn't a game for everyone, but if you do like it, it's like this game was made for you.  In short: This game is awful. I love every awful moment of it.
4229	1	a	This is the worst game I've ever played in my life.
4231	1	a	Imagine if Twin Peaks was made by a semi-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Japanese man named Swery and that's essentially what Deadly Premonition is.  I love it and you should too.
4233	1	a	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
4235	1	a	Everyone has issues with this game working well. FIX THIS SWERY!
4237	1	a	B. U. Y. in the coffee! Did you see that, Zach?!
4239	1	a	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.
4241	1	a	If you love survival horror games and Twin Peaks, you'll freaking love this game. Great game that was really underated.
4243	1	a	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â™¥â™¥â™¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.
4245	1	a	One of the best games in last generation. Also, one of the best games ever. Almost at the ART level. The problem is... as game this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sucks badly. Everything beside gameplay is gold. Gamaplay is brown. Still, you must play it, there is simply nothing like this around. Beside this. Really good.
4247	1	a	Here's what I recommend:  1. Buy the game; support the developer 2. Don't play it 3. Watch all the cutscenes on Youtube  While there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).  This gentleman/woman took the time to piece together everything. Youtube link:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut - The Movie / All Cutscenes in 1080p [1/3]&nbsp;
4249	1	a	B. U. Y. in the coffee! Did you see that, Zach?!
4251	1	a	I got The Pickles. Rating: 10/10 - Would shoot Japanese ghost acrobats again
4253	1	a	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.
4255	1	a	This is a one B-movie of a game. Imagine a Japanese Fred Olen Ray shooting a Twin Peaks rip-off with a twist of Silent Hill and a bit of GTA. The result is a campy and cliched mess that for some unexplainable reason fits really well into late-night TV program. You hate the game for being stupid and ugly and buggy, but can't stop playing it because it's obviously a labour of love.  Too bad the publisher doesn't give a rat's â™¥â™¥â™¥ about compatibility. Many complain about technical issues to the point that the PC port being totally unplayable. So it would probably be a better idea to get a PS3 version - which has it's own problems as well, but at least is more stable.
4257	1	a	For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning:   The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.  Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)  The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.  TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.  In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.
4259	1	a	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.
4261	1	a	This game is polarizing. You either love it or you hate it. The pc version has a kind of cost at entry, where you have to root out various bugs and hindrances in order to play unaccosted. once you get set up and stabalize it however it's pretty good. This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and 'jank' that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.  Over all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from 'Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling' or 'pffft that zombies running sideways.' Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.  This games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the 'two best friends play' of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.  'The Pickles'
4263	1	a	Achievement is named Anna's Dairy 10/10
4265	1	a	Zach, could you recommend this?
4267	1	a	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.
4269	1	a	This game is so horrible, weird and ugly, it makes you like it. I feel like I am being indoctrinated into some sick cult. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and similar stuff, you should try it. Otherwise, don't.
4271	1	a	Twin Peaks the game 10/10 pretty good. Port is garbage though; so are the quick time events.
4273	1	a	If you like good stories then this one will get hold of you like nothing else in videogames.

4277	1	a	Well io would love to play this game but it crashes as soon as I click the Play button......?
4279	1	a	Honestly, this game is worth every dollar.   The downside for me was the numerous lags. The game in itself wasn't difficult but I had to look for ''walkthrough'' to avoid the lags and be able to keep playing, which is a shame really. The game in itself is a melting pot of humor, horror and drama. The story and characters are awesome and makes you want to keep playing to know what happens next.   For me, this was a little gem and I'm recommending it for anyone who wants something a little different.
4281	1	a	+Incredibile story and characters +With mods, and while the game is not suffering from technical issues, it is the most definitive version of the game. +gameplay  -Gameplay -lacks graphics option (the game is set on defaut in 1280x720 vsync on)Use DPfix to increase rendering resolution along with many other options.  For fix and mod visit this site   http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut 
4283	1	a	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.
4285	1	a	My name is Zach in real life....
4287	1	a	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.
4289	1	a	PC Port is pretty bad, but if you tweak it a bit by going to your Deadly Premonition files located in your Steam folder, right click DP.exe, properties, change the Compaitablity to 98/ME, then go to DPLauncher.exe, and change that to Run as Admin, then launch it through the DPLauncher, it should be fully functioning, aside from the lack of options. Great game. prone to crashes and occasional graphics â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ups
4291	1	a	Bad PC port. Be prepared to waste an hour figuring out how to install fixes to get it to work at all. Almost unplayable in its normal state.   Once I got it running it had a really trippy japanese horror movie thing going on, but I didn't get very far cause I think it crashed.   
4293	1	a	Everything abount this game is horribly broken in all of the best ways. It is the most bizarre yet endearing story I've seen.
4295	1	a	Nearly unplayable without the DPfix mod, but it has a lot of quirky charm to it. It's also pretty spooky, and I totally did not expect those feels I felt at the end.
4297	1	a	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
4299	1	a	Just when you think you've seen it all you go sleep in a shack in the woods and wake up to a giant black dog chasing you... A lovable, absurd mess that made me want to rewatch Twin Peaks.  Also it made me hate driving cars. A lot.
4301	1	a	A technical clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ hiding probably the most unusual and entertaining Twin Peaks fan game i've ever played.
4303	1	a	Easily worth the 2,50 when it's on sale.
4305	1	a	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.
4307	1	a	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
4309	1	a	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.
4311	1	a	My coffee warned me about this game. Good coffee.
4313	1	a	The pickles...nuff said.
4315	1	a	Creepy but fun. Yes.
4317	1	a	TLDR  Had to cool off before posting this. It's been about 4-5 months. Was going to thumb this game down almost immediately. But over time I remembered some memorable moments, even though this wasn't the Alan Wake experience I was looking for. I give Double Penetration: The Director's Cut a thumbs up, but with a caveat emptor ... it's considering that nothing UGLY happens (which it most likely will on PC/Steam) ...

4319	1	a	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.   
4321	1	a	The pickles.
4323	1	a	You have no idea how bad this port is. I can't even think of another port in recent memory this insanely bad.
4325	1	a	It's Twin Peaks, just play it.
4327	1	a	This game is... Well, it's certainly something. Ignorant of the infamy of DP's PC port, I happily bought up a game that seemed like it'd take some time to complete, and for like $2.50 no less!  I love it. Simply put, I love this game. York is a humourous and fun character and the way he reacts with the Greenvale citizens is also great. That said this game crashes like CRAZY, even after installing a few mods to fix it. Deadly Premonition is a labour of love, and while I haven't finished it yet it's been worth it so far. I've never played anything like it.
4329	1	a	I played this on Xbox360 and beat the game with near 100% completion, that's why I don't have much time played here on steam. Anyways...the game is a masterpiece. It has one of the most interesting stories in a video game I have ever played. It has aliens, the main character talks to a person that is in his head(his other persona), romance, and betrayal. Not to mention silly some of the times with it's own (I find hilarious) sense of humor.   The graphics aren't the best, but they don't need to be, because it's simply fun and thought provoking. Good job whoever brought this game to pc and on steam! Hip hip hurrrrrrrray  10cups of coffee out of 10!   
4331	1	a	Did you bring The Picklesâ„¢ today, Zach?
4333	1	a	I can't recommend this game enough! This is above all my favorite story ever. It's the cheezyest most hilarious best worst thing ever made!
4335	1	a	What an Experience I must say. I love story driven games and this one is nothing less than a Gem. If you are familiar with Twin Peaks you could pretty much relate to this story. You are set out to investigate a series of brutal murders that took place in a small hamlet called GreenVale. Be aware that this game is heavily story driven and loaded with Quick Time events while progressing to it. So if you are not fond of that style of gameplay then this game is not for you.  This game has an open-world free roaming approach to it that gives us some freedom of exploration although it fails miserably in rewarding you for doing so. The fact that you have to drive from A to B all the time is dreadful in my opinion and it breaks the momentum.  The game mechanics alternate from Quick time events to a third person shooter and action game which is appreciated actually. The controls are actually poor and most of the time you can't get your aiming straight however it does not punish you for it as it introduces an auto-aim button anyway. The graphics are substandard - I could not care less tough.  Had hours of fun and good laughs with it. It is funny, however it is not cheesy at all. There are a few twists in the plot towards the end. Bottom line is: This is great value for your money.
4337	1	a	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.   
4339	1	a	So far so good. I love the controls and Twin Peaksy feeling. Maybe filling the gas tank is not necessary.
4341	1	a	The version of this classic is HORRIBLE on Steam. However, Over at Good Old Games it retains its charm and delight. Buy it there and not here!
4343	1	a	It's Twin Peaks, just play it.
4345	1	a	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.
4347	1	a	How much to like this game is determined by one question: How much do you like Twin Peaks?  Because if you love David Lynch's show, then you will love everything about Deadly Premontion: Memorable and abstract characters, set in a small town in Washington with gameplay that feels like it was conceived in the Resident Evil 4 era. If you like a good weird experience, you will find it with York and Zach.   HOWEVER...!  Be warned that this is HORRIBLE PC port of an already pretty technically flawed game and it tends to crash. A lot. Your experience might be even worse than mine because I almost completed the main game, but got stuck when the last patch made it pretty much unplayable for me.
4349	1	a	Meet Francis 'York' Morgan  FBI Detective by day Fortune teller by night Complete wacko 24/7
4351	1	a	My milk told me to buy this game, good that I had coffee in the morning, right Zach ?
4353	1	a	An hilarious game, played it about 10 times on the PS3, but now I dont have that, I bought it on PC. Really random game but good story and gameplay. Personally I think its better for PC. There is one bug, but its only when you boot it up it doesnt load, but this can be fixed by going into the game folder and reinstalling DirectX. A must
4355	1	a	This is a game you have to appreciate for what it is. It is the tropic thunder of video games. its a spoof of spoofs while spoofing itself and then somehow still is taking itself seriously in regards to the overall story. Its also worth noting that this game is actually a movie in a videogame. There is a universe of movies where the characters in game are really just actors. Spyfiction is one of the other games that is actually a movie in the universe. Forrest (a character in DP) has the same 'actor' as another character in Spyfiction.   But onto the review. So while you get bad repetitive music (which is a joke on purpose and actually kind of catchy) and characters that are laughable yet deviously insidious you find yourself caught in a confusion of emotions regarding the game. It catches you and sucks you in with it's hard to take serious yet super serious dialogue. I played this originalyl on Ps3 and i kept laughing out loud at the game because it was so bad... but then i found myself going to houses and asking questions and being a detective because i needed to know what was happening. The numerous time specific side quests that give more insite that are only found by what would seem to be chance give more back ground and much of the games nuance for the story is missed if you avoid them by accident or lack the ability to find them. And the story is actually so... well i wont give anything away but its WORTH the time and effort and the annoying car noise that is satans fingernails on a chalkboard.
4357	1	a	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!
4359	1	a	Good game, port needs some love if you want to play it.
4361	1	a	Playable?
4363	1	a	good game, but it's so japanese its not even funny.
4365	1	a	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â™¥â™¥â™¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.
4367	1	a	Great, weird and humorous horror, like it should be.
4369	1	a	Deadly Premonition is simultaneously godawful and one of the greatest games ever made.
4371	1	a	I am honestly very confused by this game. I have no idea if it wants to take itself seriously or not. I can't really give it a description that does justice to how bizarre it all is. There's an FBI agent who solves crimes with the help of his imaginary friend, but you're his imaginary friend... I think? He takes advice from his coffee and the soundtrack likes to play really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up sax solos when you fail a QTE. It seems like it wants to go for the survival horror angle but is just so weirdly written and presented that it feels more like a parody that loops back around and becomes terrifying in a drug-addled fever dream sort of way.  All I can really say is give it a shot if it can be picked up in a sale for super cheap (like $5 cheap). It's certainly... something.
4373	1	a	If you love Twin Peaks and Resident Evil 4, give it a try. Its a unique experience you won't get anywhere else.  Fair warning, install the unofficial patches and be prepared for some bugs, the game is far from technically perfect.
4375	1	a	Definitly not for everyone, but if you can look past its flaws and oddities you truely will find something special. (this is also my first review i've ever written so that tells something!!)
4377	1	a	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
4379	1	a	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
4381	1	a	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
4383	1	a	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies.

4385	1	a	I have a dream: to see Deadly Premonition remastered.
4387	1	a	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
4389	1	a	This is the greatest game ever, isn't it Zach?
4391	1	a	Very bad game that's fun; compliments of Swery. What a good game. Gives you more freedom than most of the new games today. 
4393	1	a	The coffee! 'Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?'  This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre.   Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one 'normal,' and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter.   The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness.   8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again. 
4395	1	a	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.

4399	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.
4401	1	a	Creepy but fun. Yes.
4403	1	a	My coffee warned me about this game. Good coffee.
4405	1	a	twin peaks: the videogame
4407	1	a	The game is a pretty good game. Its flawed but a lot of fun. Its especially more fun when you're a fan of Twin Peaks and you can see the inspiration from it. It just added to the game for me. But anyways yeah, the game is pretty fun. Too bad the PC port is garbage 8(
4409	1	a	Before you leave a negative review, please play trough the first chapter and apply DPfix by durante. The game itself is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on a technical level (crap graphics, crap animations/lip sync) but it realy begins to shine when the story picks up.   Trust me, this is one of the best games i've ever played and it's definetly worth looking past its obvious flaws.
4411	1	a	Probably one of the worst games I've ever played, but I loved every second of it. Don't let the first hour scare you off, gameplay isn't one of Deadly Premonition's strong points. If you like Twin Peaks and don't get frustrated with horrible gamedesign decisions, this is your game.  I also did not encounter any major bugs after 50 hours of playing with the performance mod, but maybe I suffer from False memory syndrom.
4413	1	a	Don't let the near unplayability fool you: this game is a true disasterpiece. Ridiculously terrible, terribly entertaining, entertainingly ridiculous.
4415	1	a	It's like mix of Twin Peaks, Resident Evil 4, with uglier graphics, insane plot and characters... and it's great. Experience one of a kind, isn't it, Zach?
4417	1	a	This game is a meme.
4419	1	a	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.

There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.
4423	1	a	I will never forget Francis York Morgan.
4425	1	a	Broken, ugly, clunky and prone to crashing.  And yet.. absolutely brilliant.
4427	1	a	Nothing is more perfect.
4429	1	a	f.k in the coffee do you see it zack  Buy this if you are into David lynch movies. Buy this if you know how walks with fire. buy this if someone is taking you to the black lodge. Buy this with an open mind and low expectation = realised is the best game you ever play   (don't look at the play time I play it on xbox360 )
4431	1	a	The coffee! 'Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?'  This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre.   Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one 'normal,' and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter.   The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness.   8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again. 
4433	1	a	Don't let the near unplayability fool you: this game is a true disasterpiece. Ridiculously terrible, terribly entertaining, entertainingly ridiculous.
4435	1	a	Very bad game that's fun; compliments of Swery. What a good game. Gives you more freedom than most of the new games today. 
4437	1	a	On the outside this game is really awkward, but its really easy to get lost in its interesting story and atmosphere
4439	1	a	Deadly Premonition is weird. that is true. it's also eerily close in themes and plot to Twin Peaks, a show which the creator of Deadly Premonition claims to have never heard of. The graphics are uncanny valley, the writing seems purposefully enigmatic and strange, and the plot seems right out of an episode of the X-Files while still trying to play itself straight. But these are all reasons why Deadly Premonition is one of the greatest mystery games of all time. Engross yourself in the culture of a small american town as seen through the eyes of a japanese videogame developer. Take control of Agent Francis York Morgan as he reads the future in the clouds of his coffee, and shoots plant zombies while wearing a bright orange suit. Get paid by the goverment for shaving. And most of all, embrace the weird, and you might find yourself seeing the game for the piece of art that it is.
4441	1	a	Fantastic quirky, funny, squirrely game. Played it on xbox but was not interested in getting it to run well on pc. Still great though.
4443	1	a	If you like the chase and tail missions of GTA, be sure to pick this one up, you'll be spending 9 (!) minutes tailing a car at 25 mph, granted it doesn't crash or you try to open the steam overlay out of boredom (which will make you fail the mission).
702	0	a	Great game, TERRIBLE port. Started out at about 5 FPS (unplayable/slideshow) on a computer that can handle Skyrim and the Arkham games just fine. With all the tricks and fixes you can find on the internet I eventually got it up to around 15 FPS, at which point the game was just barely playable. (First time I ever needed to use target lock with a mouse, though.) Then the first boss showed up. The QTEs were impossible at that low framerate.  Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews: almost all of them are from people who played this game on the XBox, where it actually ran properly. The PC version is a broken mess, and it's almost certainly never going to be fixed. I got it for $6 as part of a Humble Bundle deal, and I feel ripped off.
703	0	a	I love this game.  Completed the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the ps3 version and although it had is drawbacks it was narrativley stunning.  The PC port is poorly done.  &gt; Locked 720p resolution and unstable framerate, can't even surpass 30fps most of the time.  There is a fix you can get by a very talented individual by the name Durante, which unlocks various options for the game such as resolution, anisotropic filtering, SSAO etc and it makes a huuuge difference.  this is an essential fix if you decide to buy :  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=373   Many people have reported this fix working perfectly and others claim it does improve gfx and lets you set custom resolution but the framerate is still unstable.  My experience was the latter, i have major unstable framerate for the game and my rig can more than handle this game.  I can't recommend the pc version of this game since it requires you to work on it to get it running smoothly, you really shouldn't have to do it after paying money for the game.   Though it pains me to give it the thumbs down i would recommend you play it on the ps3 for a better experience because it really is a great game.
704	0	a	Worst port I've ever played. Constant crashes.
705	0	a	A truely crappy port of a fanstastic game.  I couldn't get past the second combat section in the game without it crashing constantly.  Avoid at all costs.
706	0	a	I'd love to reccomend this game but honestly, It's not very stable, thankfully thanks to mods and unofficial patches it's a little more playable, but honestly, this is a very bad port right out of the gate of a game that was already pretty buggy and had a terrible framerate on the consoles, I guess i'm glad I bought it because I liked it on the consoles and it's a very weird but great game, but I can't reccomend it for people looking for a stable experience out of the gate.
707	0	a	I wish I could give this a positive review, because the game itself it great. But the PC version is nearly unplayable. If you want to play Deadly Premonition (which you should, it's a great game) I'd recommend playing the xbox 360 version if it's available to you. I've tinkered with this game for hours and it still won't work, and it seems the developers have no intention of fixing this version of the game as it's been unplayable for years. I actually bought this when it first came out and gave up in frustration, and now, years later, it's still broken. I have to give this a thumbs down. Sorry.
708	0	a	This game is so buggy that even with DPfix you will run into trouble. Long load times, autosave doesn't work, crash when you enter a building (since autosave doesn't work if you did any side missions tough luck you have to do them again). The game crashed when I was gonna enter a critical mission building and I did some side missions before. The developers even acknoledged DPfix and said to install it rather than actually putting a patch themselves. And now they are on the front cause of Recently updated but they didn't update the game it's just on sale. Don't let these companies get away with lazy ports.
709	0	a	Really wanted to play Deadly Premonition.  Everytime I launch the game it crashes immediately. Tons of problems with the port after that.  Very disappointed.  Edit: After installing DPfix, changing the compatibility to Windows XP, nearly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing my OS, and uninstalling VLC and MPC-HC, I finally got the game to work. Still not recommending because I don't really want anyone else to go through all that bull â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
710	0	a	The actual game itself gets a wholehearted recommendation. Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a 'so bad it's good' game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the 'shooting bits' were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.  If you can.  The lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.  So in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the 'wall-crawler' enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means.   Some people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not. Maybe in a year (or more), the game will be patched up and as nice as the Dark Souls port. Until then, I consider this game an Xbox 360 exclusive (the Playstation 3 Director's Cut port is even worse than the PC version, don't touch it please!).  Buy this port if you like a gamble, Zach.
711	0	a	Don't even bother. Horrible port, controller doesn't work (xbox 360), frame rate issues are constant (even after the proposed restart your computer fix). 1920X1080 need a fix to work...   I have a decent computer so i don't see that my pc is causing the horrible frame rate issues ( i have a i5 4670 and a r9 290). Can't even get past firs part of the game since the QTE are related to your frame rate, so even if i try to be as fast as i can i get killed.  Alot of dissapointment, really wanted to play this game.
712	0	a	It's a game I really want to like - just wish it didn't crash all the god damn time
713	0	a	As much as I love the original (it remains to this day one of my favorite games of all time) the sloppy control port here makes the game nigh unplayable. I highly reccommend getting the 360 orignal instead.
714	0	a	I would love to recommend this game, really I would. It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.  The truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass ('smoking' in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.  If you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the 'savedata' folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.  Barring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.  However, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.  The minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.  The more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.  The game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.  Sidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.  To wrap this review up and summarize the main points:  [CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.  [CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.  [CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities   [PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.  [PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too  [PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game  [PRO] Decent sidequests and minigames   All in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.
715	0	a	it's fantastic until you reach the part where you literally can't play the game because it crashes without any fixes that seem to work and you should probably just buy the xbox or ps3 version instead
716	0	a	Won't even start up on PC. Fantastic game if you can play it on a platform that works. Avoid the PC version.
717	0	a	While I enjoy the story of this game I cannot overlook the constant crashes and bugs that abound in this poorly ported title, especially given the $25 USD price tag.   My game freezes about 5-10% of the time when checking side quests. Random freezing during loading screens. Performance issues on a beefy rig when running windowed. Unable to interact with required doors/objects during certian missions.  Issues while driving that cause my tires to sink into the road bringing my car to a sudden stop.   Also, this game is locked to 720p which can be fixed with the dpfix mod but installing that brought about an issue where the game freezes when I tab out.   If my friend did not want to watch me stream this game I would have already deleted it within the first hour of gameplay.   TL;DR : Great story, amusing characters in this Twin Peaks inspired game but bugs and crashes make the game nearly unplayable. Not worth the price. 3/10
718	0	a	The PC port is a nightmare. I've tried just about everything - and I mean   everything   - to get this game running. Probably the most hilarious fix I've found has you going on a mini purge of all third party video software, uninstalling LAV filters and setting Windows Media Player as the default app for video files (because y'know, apprarently that works sometimes!?). Unfortunately, like every other fix, it had no effect on my system.   Nobody should be jumping through this many hoops just to get their game running. When the desperation is so bad that the only option is to start deleting other programs from your system,   something is seriously wrong.  
719	0	a	I am telling you Zach, this is a conspiracy . An internet wide conspiracy zach - to convince innocent agents like you deadly premonitions is somehow worth their time . But they are lying to us , Zach . Your life is too short to spend so many hours figuring out how to make the game not crash at lunch Zach. Your backlog is too long to waste so many hours of your life restarting your computer because the game locked up at random . And the inventory Zach , the inventory menu is a death trap - it will freeze your game , always and forever Zach , without fail. All your quirks and weird tonal shifts can be enjoyed in LP form, without the frustrating hurdle of trying to play it zach .
720	0	a	This is a tough thing for me to do, given that Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but I can't honestly recommend playing this version of the game. I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).  Even if this version wasn't completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the 'Director's Cut', the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.  There are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.  While general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.  This is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own. The only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?  It hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.  The game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.  To sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files. While it didn't happen to me, thankfully, I have read about instances where other players' save data was corrupted, forcing them to start over. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.
721	0	a	This port is basically broken and frequently hangs and freezes at random, even after fixing the broken PhysX install the game comes with. Don't bother and just get the console version instead (I only paid $2.50 for it and still feel ripped off).
722	0	a	If you can get it on sale or cheap, this might be ok. However, charging 30 Euro for this is overpriced.  Technical problems: - Crashes and bugs here and there - Clunky controls - A fixed 720p 16:9 resolution; there is a mod that changes that, but that will give you more chrashes  While I am accustomed to clunky controls for console ports, the fixed resolution and the crashes are not acceptable.  This game tries to be so much at once, it ends up being not good at anything particular:  - It tries to tell a story, but that story is weird and has too many turnarounds and arbitrary events. Even after the story is finished, you could still turn it around again and no one would mind. - It tries to be a detective game, but it fails, most detective work is embedded into the story and there is not that much you can do wrong. Lots of suspects, but you don't choose the trail you want to follow, the main mission just guards you through - It tries to be open world GTA driving around, but fails due to extremely clunky driving, unusable map, and chrashes if you go somewhere where the game didn't expect you to go. - It tries to simulate real world needs: You have to eat and to sleep and to shave from time to time. But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc. - It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events - It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable - It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city.  - On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.  The store page tells 'Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)'. Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.  To sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: 'Zach, this is a waste of time!'. Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.
723	0	a	Terrible port, stay the hell away until it's done properly.
724	0	a	Game is Unplayable!! A total waste of money and time. Be warned do not buy, after you download and try to run the game it immediately crashes. I give this game 0.1 out of 10
725	0	a	I've not played a pc game as crash prone or broken since the original unpatched s.t.a.l.k.e.r.  Even with all the fixes and remedies you're going to need some luck to get through it.  I suggest just getting the console version even though that version isn't exactly stable neither but it's at least playable in some respects.   Only because how poor the original console version does this game actually gets excused from being the worst pc port ever.
726	0	a	It pains me to not recommend this game but you can't look past the technical issues. Even if you get Durante's excellent DPFix mod it's hit and miss whether the game will actually run decently for you, if at all. After much trial and error I managed to get it running but after 30-40 mins of playtime the FPS grinds to a halt and needs a game restart to get it smooth again.  What a shame, the game deserves better.
727	0	a	**Speaking for the game itself 9/10, Just awesome !**  With that being said, I tried 4 different computers with every fix available and can't get this working at all. How is something this bad allowed to be released? I recommend staying away from this one all together. So if your thinking: 'Hey, it can't be that bad, and the price is good, why not try it'? Your wrong and it won't work and you'll be mad!  I have 17.8hrs Gameplay and not one achievement so I think that speaks for itself.
728	0	a	Pain you will suffer thru crashes and glitches Look online for Durante's DP fixes Always be vigilant and save when you can You never know if you'll have to do it again  Many hours I have lost, if you ask me Exceptional story, nostalgic and nasty  ...so says Mr. Stewart
729	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a game you need to play, For Director's Cut on PC, though, you should not pay. So says Mr. Stewart.  Deadly Premonition is one of my absolute favorite games. The Director's Cut, however, and especially the PC version are something to avoid.  Deadly Premonition was a flawed, but amazing game full of charming personality with every of it's lots of characters. What it needed is some additional polish, some rebalancing, some QTE removal. Ideally an engine port to make the world feel even more complete by removing the loading screens or at least making them less frequent. It needed something that will make the original strange beauty preserved for generations to come.  Instead it got The Director's Cut. A version that is worse in pretty much every regard. With slightly better visuals in some parts, worse in all others. With all the game breaking and lighter glitches, typos, mistranslations and other issues intact. With next to no changes to actual issues. With one non-issue made better (the controls). With pointless DLCs. With horribly voiced and animated new cutscenes that break the flow of the story, spoil things and add nothing of value. And, especially on PC, with countless crashes. Crashes that you cannot avoid no matter what you do, just make them slightly less frequent.  If you can, find the original for 360, play that instead. If you absolutely must play Director's Cut, do it on consoles. But this version? This version is the one to avoid at all cost. It will ruin the game for you. And the game is very much worth it.  P.S. Bonus video review:        Revisiting Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut&nbsp;
730	0	a	Looked like a decent game. I wouldn't know, though, because whenever I try to run it, I click 'play' and there is an error telling me 'dp.exe has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.' This is the only game that has this problem.  Oh, and the time (69 minutes) I spent 'playing' the game was me trying to get it to actually start.
731	0	a	The game itself might be interesting, but this is an awful port.  I have no problem getting smooth framerates in games like Borderlands 2 or Far Cry 3, but here, I got a slideshow of between 5 and 10 FPS even when nothing was happening on the screen. The resolution cannot be changed. When windowed, the game has problems with cursor locking. Camera is awkward.  Not recommended.
732	0	a	Either it'll run or it won't and no fiddling's going to change that.  Don't gamble and just get it on 360 or PS3
733	0	a	Full controller support is not accurate. Xbox 360 controller works fine for every other game with controller support, but can not even move when I try to use it for this game. I googled it and apparently this is a big problem that still has not been fixed.
734	0	a	It's last day of year 2015 and it's still impossible to make this game work. My whole gameplay time counted by Steam is accumulated from unsuccessful launch attempts. Yes. I tried to launch this game for more than 5 hours. I tried unofficial fix, every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tip, every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ guide. I followed every solution I could google, and boy, I reached end of internet thanks to that. At this point it would be easier for me to write this game from scratch. Happy New Year to you scrublords from Access Games and ToyBox Inc. Happy New Year to you, Hidetaka Suehiro, you hack and fraud.  Rot in hell.
735	0	a	Bought the game for â‚¬ 2,49, thinking to myself I can't do something wrong for that price.  Actually, the story and the characters of the game are quite good (as far as I know it by now), but there are so many technical issues, that I can't recommend the game to anyone. It just will end in frustration.  At first, you have to use some 'trick' to get it started at all. Then you will have crashes every now and then, which have nothing to do with the hardware (my PC fulfills all requirements by far).  My personal 'I won't play this anymore'-moment is that some crash just destroyed a save game. So I played 12 hours only to recognize, that I can start all over again and I have no guarantee, that the game won't destroy another save game on my second try to finish this game.
736	0	a	I love this game so much and I yearn for it to fall into my tender loving arms so I can cradle it like a little baby and give it my total loving care.   But it is not to be...  And you know why that is? Because of the absolutely preposterous port which makes the game practically unplayable - yes I know, you've heard it all before.   I started playing this game a few months back, and couldn't get past a particular cut scene (I'm sure some of the less fortuitous people such as myself know what I'm talking about); and 7 months later - after waiting for a patch of some description - it's still broken.   Yes, I do use DP.Fix, but to no avail.  This is an example of how a game should NOT be on a computer, which is darn shame because I really love Deadly Premonition, and on any other system I'd give it an instant thumbs up.   Consoles, I'm afraid you win this point.  [If I manage to fix my game-breaking bug then I'll be sure to update the review - doubt it'd change my recommendation though]
737	0	a	This game is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time.   I can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable. Provided that it works...  [Rating: 65/100]
738	0	a	nope, dont buy it til they fix the crashing issues, and fix the fact that this game is a pain in the a** to get working in the first place.  booting the game you get an endless intro loop. gotta do a bunch of stuff to get it to work. during the endless loop you cant skip, you cant get to the main menu. you can only close the game. the loop just plays over and over and over.  if you get passed the intro loop..... the start of the game runs fine, but once you get into town and out of the first building, NOTHING BUT CRASHES!  very irritating. drive around crash, walk around, crash, get in car, crash, get out of car, crash....start up game and just barely start, crash.  this needs a patch.  a great game though, but unplayable. the crashes are random and often.  dont buy this til they patch it which doesn't seem likely.
739	0	a	I really like Deadly Premonition. Itâ€™s quirky, strange, and full of enjoyable characters. I had a great time playing through it on the Xbox 360 some time ago and was eager for another play through. Unfortunately, the PC version is a terrible mess. The game crashes frequently and load times are horrendous. Eventually, the bugs and consistently terrible loads caused me to abandon the game. I wish I could recommend the game but itâ€™s just too bad that just doesnâ€™t work.
740	0	a	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Should you know, this game is surreal. Though, what you see now has a tarnished appeal.  'Such poor optimization!' one would declare. If you want the real deal, you should try it elsewhere.  So says, Mr. Stewart.
741	0	a	This game simply doesn't work on PC. Only a few could play it through because of DPfix (or even DSfix), but nonetheless this is utter sh*t. Do yourself a favor and just go watch youtube if you wanna know the story but just DON't pay any penny for this. DOES. NOT. WORK. Crashes everywhere. DON't. Just don't.
742	0	a	I have heard this game talked up for ages and wanted to play it for years. It finally comes on steam and is one of the worst most unplayable piles I have ever seen. I can't even get past the first area because the game decides I want to delete my melee weapon and can't break down a fence now. This port is utter garbage and a total scam that the publishers offload unto steam. As they are publishers they do not have any QA or vetting process restrictions and can drop whatever scum they want directly unto steam and clog up the store with shovelware.   I have given this game a few tries just to get it to even run and now I can't get the control pad to actually do anything when I play. Total rip off.
743	0	a	Terrible port of a game that I might've been able to enjoy but couldn't due to crashing, get it when it's on sale or something if you really are looking to buy it otherwise I'd avoid it if I were you.
744	0	a	i wish i could get it to work   
745	0	a	Bad Port. Bad controls. Bad graphics. Crashes. Controller does not work.
746	0	a	I had a very hard time thinking of how to review this game. There is no  'yes'  or  'no'  for this game. Hell even if steam had it there isn't even a  'neutral'  or  'maybe' . There is simply an   'I don't know' . So this game has what I think is an interesting story line but it is done very poorly. It has bad graphics, glitches, and it crashed a lot for me and others at points in the game (though I think someone  MAY  have made a mod to fix this, I never checked.) to the point where I couldn't see the epilogue because it crashed every time I tried but there is still something appealing about this game I can't explain well. The core story is very interesting. The only problem is that this game could have been much better if they took out the bad combat system and spent the money on other parts. Not being able to change the resolution and the 'DP.exe has stopped working' though are the big part for me.  That being said I will still re-play it some day because I still like the story. As for anyone who wants to buy this game, You have to be aware that it doesn't feel good and have to go in with low expectations to enjoy it's random storyline. I guess that's the best way to put it. I would give it a...uhh...to be realistic 5.5/10 but I'm still not 100% sure how to rate it. You'll just have to buy the game when it's on sale as long as you can live with what the problems I stated to understand why this game is so good-bad. Though this game is a port and doesn't seem to crash or have most these problems on console so it may be worth buying it on an xbox than on steam.
747	0	a	This game is hella fun, especially as a Twin Peaks Fan, but after 8 hours it keeps crashing.
748	0	a	Fire weep with me  This port is a catastrophe
749	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game that I would not recommend to anyone.   Many comparisons can be made about Deadly Premonition - I myself found the combat to play like RE4, the overworld to faintly remind me of Psychonauts, the time-based mission structure to resemble Dead Rising's own (although major difference being in Deadly Premonition you can just ignore the time restraints and be none the worse) and even the mechanically-driven story setpieces to remind me of Metal Gear Solid's storytelling methods. The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too.   It's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.  The point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that 'it's so bad it's good'. This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.  But I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.  It took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.  For the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on. Watch a playthrough on Youtube because it really is worth experiencing, even if second-hand.
750	0	a	Even with numerous fixes and unofficial patches it still crashes very frequently, leaving you frustrated over the fact that the previous checkpoint was 30 minutes ago.  If you are willing to suffer through that, you're probably going to like the game, which is quite original.
751	0	a	When I played for the first time Dark Souls, I thought 'Well, that's the Worst Port In History, I'll never find something like this again'   I was wrong.   Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is even worse, locked at 720p, tons of crashes, control system oh...  Anyway, the plot is really nice and the location is cool too.   I recommend this game only if bought in a bundle.
752	0	a	My coffee warned me about this game but i bought it anyway. Stay away from this game it is an unfinished optimization business. Shame on you â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in developers.
753	0	a	Thiss need a fix. I just wanna play this game :/
754	0	a	I really enjoyed this game on the 360 so when my box red ringed I was excited to pick it up on PC so I could actually finish it. That was not the case. This port is sooo broken. It crashes very very often and, since the game uses save points, it is likely you will be unable to progress. If you are thinking of purchasing this then check the forums first to see if a patch has been released. As of now, there are too many stability issues.
755	0	a	I was interested in this game because it has many fans and was supposedly good. What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.  The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':  1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).  2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.  3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)  4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.  So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.  Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.  This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.
756	0	a	I've heard a lot about this game. This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.  I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...  First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these 'quests' are like 'find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM' (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), 'find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)', 'find sheriff's dumbbell', 'find sheriff's assistant's keys' and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...  ...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like 'guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff' and just push you through till the end. Seriously, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ quests I didn't finish! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ exploring! Surprise, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!  Another thing, last, but not least.  ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!     Imagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail. This is what I felt during the bossfights with George and Kaysen. I understand, that this is a Japanese game, it is supposed to be odd and weird, but Swery, seriously, is it some kind of trolling or were you just high? What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, man?    Thank you for reading this if u did. I am not going to persuade you not to buy this game, I am just sharing my own opinion. For me this game is one of the biggest disappointments ever compared to other games I've played. It started so good and ended like absolute delirium.
757	0	a	An utterly broken piece of software. It'll run for a little bit then either fail to load the save file, stop recognizing keyboard input or simply crash. How bad does a game have to be before Steam decides to stop selling it?
758	0	a	The game crashes without fail on startup. I have tried every solution that was recommended, it still won't get past the intro credits. It should be patched, but never will, because reasons. No, your advice didn't work. I'm sick of being put through the ringer, so even if it did work I don't care. Games should work for everyone, on every system, at launch.  Zero out of five Lennys ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
759	0	a	Let me start off by saying I adore Deadly Premonition. After purchasing it on xbox360 at launch I was super excited to play the game again with this Director's Cut. The story is still great, the characters still quirky and awesome, the combat still forced and terrible.  However. After playing for an hour I ran into a bug that forced the game to crash again and again and again. Community fixes didn't work, I'm completely stuck, and from what I can tell on the forums I am not the only one. It's bad enough that the community had to fix the screen resolution because the game doesn't even give you options to adjust those yourself. But game breaking bugs that still haven't been fixed close to a year later? Ridiculous.   TLDR: Game is great on consoles one of my favorite of all time, get it there. Pc version is a buggy mess that probably won't work for you or at the very least gives you headaches trying to fix it so it's barely playable.  Update late 2016. After installing the game again on a new pc I finally got past the part it crashed at on my other system... only for it to crash righ after at the next cutscene. As much as I love the game...there is just no excuse for the way they have handled this release.
760	0	a	This port is awful. The fps is the worst Fps I've ever seen in gaming. The settings are configured to the lowest they can possibly go (Thanks to a fan who made it possible to even configure the settings), yet I still get the same fps as if I changed nothing. Do not buy. It has been months since this game has released and they still have ignored it. If you really want to play this game, play it on xbox or ps3.
761	0	a	I had this game in my library for about a day and a half when It first dropped on Steam. When I tried to play it, it was all stuttery and unresponsive, so I asked for my money back. I have no idea if that's still the case now, but I'd recommend checking out the pcgamingwiki page concerning this game before making the purchase.  On console, that's a different matter. The game is a gem, and it's weird as hell. Definitely check it out on a stable platform. I usually champion buying the 'good' version, but in this case, like with Dark Souls 1, this is definitely not the good version.
762	0	a	Freezes at the end of a level. Driving is a nightmare.  Unplayable.
763	0	a	Doesn't run. Crash on start every time.

766	0	a	I really like Deadly Premonition but cannot recommend this bad PC port. It has a horrible framerate and crashes frequently. The game now freezes at a specific point which is 2 hours into the story (just after going through the hospital) and I cannot be bothered to find a way to progress as it will probably only crash at another specific point.  Luckily I bought it when it was only $2.
767	0	a	'It can't be that bad!' I thought. 'I'll try it anyway!' I thought. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC! It is a nightmare of technical issues. Experiencing the game this way should be considered an absolute last resort. You can get it in Xbox 360 or PS3 without the crashing or hours of bugfixes that will render the PC version borderline playable.  Third party graphical enhancements SHOULD have made this the definitive edition of the game, but it is far too unstable to be worth any money at all.
768	0	a	Still can't recommend the PC version of Deadly Premonition. Even WITH Durantes fix it still crashes pretty much on the hour every time. Did I mention this games uses save points as the save method too? So save points + consistent crashing = Good luck making any damn progress.  That aside the parts I've played were interesting, but controls are clunky and graphics are PS2-era at best.
769	0	a	It's like Twin Peaks and Silent Hill had a baby with one of those immunodeficiency disorders where they need to be stuck in a plastic bubble. After downloading DPfix so I can run this game at a semi-decent framerate, setting it to windows 98 compatibility mode so it wouldn't crash about an hour in, and finding workarounds to keep the loading screens from freezing up, I got about halfway through. Now I'm in the middle of a quicktime event where none of my keys register, and nothing I can find will fix it.
770	0	a	Unplayable,I spent more time researching fixes for the constant crashing.It may be a good game and it is one I have had on my 'to play' list for quiet some time now.I literally can't tell you waht combat is like as I crash prior to that.I have tried all fixes to no resolve.Finally I just gave up and uninstalled it.  Give it a miss or pick it up on console (never thought I would have ever heard myself say that).I really wish |Valve would clamp down on games like this as it's not my first time being left with a lemon due to what is possibly one of the worst pc ports (not forgetting Arkham Knight but at least that you can play for more than 15 minutes at a time)...  This game and many like it should be removed from the store, forcing the developers to realease a functioning product.I'm a huge fan of games like this and it pains me to review it in such a negative manner.  My specs are fine i7 3770k and a gtx 980 is overkill,so it's not my hardware holding me back..Fresh install of win 10 so its not that either.The game is just a terrible port,which is a real shame...   AVOID ON PC!!
771	0	a	10/10 Game 0/10 Port The world's worst port of the world's best game- it's absolutely unplayable. Buy it for the 360 if you want to spend less than a year of bug-fixing for every 12 minutes of gameplay. I finished this through 100% after easily 200 crashes to desktop. I love this game with all my heart but managing to finish it with only 200 serious crashes and bluescreens is considered fortunate compared to most people trying to run this on PC.
772	0	a	Port is terrible and doesn't work.
773	0	a	The Best Game I can never recommend, because of bugs and crashes. Play the console version if you can!
774	0	a	It's a good game, but it runs so terribly on computer, please do yourself a favor and just pick it up for console instead because it's really good, it's just unplayable on computer. 15fps, 720p, constant crashing and audio glitches, etc.
775	0	a	Unbelievably the worst port I've ever came across in my life. Nevermind the fact you have to go through so much just to get the game not to crash on start, the crazy amounts of tinkering it takes to just make this thing work (or for me, not to work) is just worth it for this game. I'll never know if this game is recommendable considering the fact this port is just a huge piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The first 2 hours of the game is great!
776	0	a	Great game. Terrible port. It hurts having to not recommend this game, because this is one of the best games I've ever played, but this port is unacceptable. It crashes randomly and it's riddled with game breaking bugs like AI NPCs not doing what they're supposed to making certain sections unbeatable (Nick's car not moving when you have to tail him and the final boss bugging out making it impossible to beat).  It's not worth it. Play it on PS3 or XBox. I paid next to nothing for this game and still wasted my money.  
777	0	a	I'm a big fan of the Twin Peaks TV show/movie which was obviously a major influence in the development of Deadly Premonition. This is one reason I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It's simply too buggy to play. The game crashes constantly. At ~14 hours gameplay, the game crashed (which happened frequently) but this time my save file was corrupted. So now I can start over from the beginning, or uninstall. Uninstall it is.  Maybe one day I will try it again &amp; keep a backup of my save file,  maybe ...
778	0	a	The bottom line - not recommended.  The game mechanics is not intuitive, the combination of mouse\keyobard is not working well here.  The options menu - its hard to get arround in it, It took me over half a minute to figure out how to close it.  It seems the game has some performance issues, I ran the Witcher 3 and other more demanding titles on the same machine with ease, but here it seems clunky  About 30+ minutes into the game made me really disapointed, especially after seeing all the other good reviews,   
779	0	a	THE DEADLY CRASH:  Can't play it at all, crashes on start up 'dp has stopped working'. Pity, it seemed promising.  I shift tab - CRASH Press escape - Crash Full screen mode- Crash Windowed - Crash. I don't have a bad computer and am unsure why this is happening but it seems to be unavoidable. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in such a poor state, that I can't even start it up. Sigh, $24... waste.
780	0	a	I would have given this quirky game at least an 8/10, but due to hardware silliness, and a bad port...I just don't know.   I want to LOVE this game. I really do.   The console version is waaay better.   I'll base my review on what the game truly is without hardware/software difficulties and bad porting.   If you are familiar with Twin Peaks or any absurd David-Lynch works, you'll understand this game completely.   If you're not...just go with it. Yes. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing weird. Yes, York (the main character) is a dweeb. Yes, this town has no basis at all in reality. Just go with it.   Gameplay-wise...meh. It's really about the weird characters and story. Sidequests everywhere!  Ultimately, I cannot recommend the PC version if you're running any machine newer than like...2007-2009.  If you can get your hands on the xbox360 version. Great. 
781	0	a	Controller and keyboard control customization is horrible. If I use the controller, then the camera keeps on spinning fast around the character...which causes me to feel dizzy and makes me want to lose my lunch. and I can't even adjust for that sort of thing to prevent that from happening. Keyboard controls also suck hardcore for a lefthanded person like me... you see, I like using my mouse with my left hand... which means I usually use arrow keys to nagvative, not that WASD â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. so there's usually a delayed reaction for my character when I have to switch between mouse and keys.... that ends up with my character dying a lot. it's actually much more work to play this game than it is fun to play..... I actually wish I hadn't brought this game in the first place.
782	0	a	Port is terrible and doesn't work.
783	0	a	Great game, not so great pc port. Play it on console if possible.
784	0	a	The Best Game I can never recommend, because of bugs and crashes. Play the console version if you can!
785	0	a	As some who has played through the 360 version of DP i can say its one hell of a game,but the pc port is a piece of diarrhetic dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.The game literary refuses to run on my rig regardless of what i did to try and make it work.So basically if you have a Ps3 or a 360 go get those versions,they may be ugly but at least they aren't a waste of your money.

789	0	a	Trying to open a door : game crash. Trying to drive my car : game crash. Trying to talk to people : game crash. Trying to launch the game : game crash. Trying to crash the game : game crash. Not doing anything at all : game crash.  10/10  Would crash again. And again. And again.
790	0	a	This game is unplayable. I don't know what the actual game is like, maybe it's great, I'll never know, because the game crashes on launch. I can tolerate an awful PC port; that's what I did for Saints Row 2 and I loved that game (except for the port part, of course). What I can't tolerate is a PC 'port' that does not work at all. Shame on Rising Star for releasing a game that is literally unplayable.
791	0	a	Ok I'm done. I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.  If you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.  Even after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence ('HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!'). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system.   I'm going to spend the rest of my 'time' on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.
792	0	a	Be warned this game simply doesn't work. You can do a lot of effort and fixes to get the game to technically boot, or you can watch the first season of Twin Peaks. One is a significantly better use of your time than the other.
793	0	a	This port is a pure garbage. And the ones responsible for it should be sentenced to 30 years of trying to make this game running. And if they would somehow succeeded, they would have to finish it with a crash after every loading!
794	0	a	I want you to play this game, just not on the PC. Do you have a PS3? If so, turn it on and download this classic. It really is one of a kind at the moment with no other game to compare it to. Sadly the PC port is a right pain in the a$$! I had to fight with it for way too long, starting my game over because of saves that corrupted.   By the time I was done trying to get the game to work, I was afraid to mess with any of the add on content and played it in windowed mode in fear of it crashing. With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans. If I could I would tell you it was worth it since the game is amazing when it is working, if you overlook the low budget that is.   Yet, you might not at the moment have any other choice but to play it on PC. If you choose to endure that path, get ready to fight for your right to play the game without problems. Now with the port aside, the game is far from perfect at times even seeming to be broken in places. The vibe it sets and the story it tells is just so cool that you learn to live with the many flaws and ugly graphics.   Also it does have one of the most annoying boss battles I can remember right at the end, but this game is still great and different. If you loved the TV show Twin Peaks, this is a must have and for any surreal fans, you would just be better off getting it on PS3 or finding a copy of the original on 360.

796	0	a	The Game itself (Gameplay / Story): Wonderfull if you grew up with Twin Peaks.  The technical aspect of the game: Horrible.  ItÂ´s a great game if it runs on your system. (Luck dependend) ItÂ´s a horrible piece of work if it doesnÂ´t.  Chances are this game wonÂ´t run on your system no matter what you do.  This game maybe takes about 8 - 10 hours to playthrough.  Steam sais i needed 24,3h. ThatÂ´s because i had to play sections over and over again because the constant crashes und freezes. I even need to copy the save file between 3 PCÂ´s !!! with different OS and config.  With Win 8.1 donÂ´t even get started, there you will have all the problems that are available. With Win 7 you will have most of the problems.  Like i said, i finished this game on 3 PcÂ´s (Win 8.1, Win 7 64x, Win 7 32x)  
797	0	a	It's so scary my PC can hardly play it with out saying NOPE and crashing to desktop.  In all seriousness there is a decent interesting game here but theres just too many bugs and crashes to make it worth while. From what I have played I really like it but having to play from save point to save point constantly worried if the next cut scene or character conversation is going to cause a crash really distracts from the story and atmosphere of the game.  A few fixes or patches would shape this up into a good little game but as is its I can't suggest anyone else buy this game.
798	0	a	Can't recommend a game that doesn't work now, can I?   I have 6 hours played, with about half of that actually being played and saved. It crashed every 60 seconds, to 5 mins. I spent almost 4 hours trying to fix this game with all the resources available online to no avail.   I wish the devs, would have patched this before releasing it.
799	0	a	This game does not work. As soon as it gets past the first cut scene and enters into play mode, the camera just spins and spins. I've put more time into trying to fix this one problem than I have playing the actual game. I can't even leave the first scene!  I want a game that works or I want my money back.

802	0	a	I can't believe I've put up with this torture for more than 30 hours. Probably the half of it was spent for just getting the game run properly. I've seen all kinds of glitches, e.g. crashing, freezing, broken image, stuck in a corner, etc., etc. I tried DPFix and various kinds of attempts, none of which worked definitively. I am not complaining about the story and contents by themselves, but this is arguably one of the worst implementations of a console game. It's amazing how many bugs the devs could cram into this and still managed to think the game is playable.  No, I won't play this again. (I was supposedly in the last chapter.)  P.S. Also, the game behavior is affected by random things like monitor resolution, which makes running this game a kind of black magic. I regret I've run out of extra sheeps to sacrifice.
803	0	a	I dont no where even to begin this mass.The game apsolutly broken in all ways posible,i have no ide how it is positive on steam. The performance is is just horoble ,the audio in just not in the same place ,you can have like set it to 80% all it will randomly go stronger then weaker ,one cutscene your will bleed through your ears ,in another you cant hear anithing ,and trust me it is not on my side . Ohohohhoo VIDEO....absolutely no settings what so ever ,NOTHING ,no resolution nothing nothing .....  Thank God the is like a *fan made* patch you can copy this files to game and fix this ,you can manually add resolution nad AA and SSA etc ...  Bad optimized game ,even if it is 1,01 version  And the WORST part EVER in this game is just horoble horoble horoble aiming ,OMG ,absolutely broken,and there are many types of enemies ,there are like fast ones ,that can blink like in a sec they are in front of you ,good luck aiming that ,and i hear boss fight are inposible ,will see about that later I just dont like what so ever to quit games,i dont remember last time i did not finish the game,but i think this one will be the first in many years :/  Voise acting in cutscene and worst then amateur ,ahahah lips are not evem moving like WTF  just a fanny broken game ,I like survival horror games like SH and RE ,but this is 0 ,they are going that way ,but failed horoble in everithing.
804	0	a	Zach i should of known.. this PC port the coffee warned me about it.
805	0	a	Terrible combat system. Saving only at specific locations. Not fun at all when you have to repeat 5 or more minutes of your gameplay. I thought it will be more about story and puzzles. It's about shooting zombies in the head.
806	0	a	It doesn't work. It crashes on startup every time with error 'dp.exe has stopped working'
807	0	a	Good game, terrible PC port almost unplayable
808	0	a	Weird Game ! very engaging but a crappy port !
809	0	a	Very definition of nightmare-ish voice acting.
810	0	a	This is an amazing game that is completely hobbled by one of the worst PC ports that I have ever seen. I've tried it on two different, fairly beefily specced systems and both of them get roughly five frames per second. Going by the forums, the developer has apparently abandoned the project entirely, so unless the community gets together and fixes the myriad of bugs still left in this terrible tragedy of a release, it will never be worth purchasing.  Stay away my friends!
811	0	a	This port is absolutely miserable, and frankly I could have lived without ever getting to experience Deadly Premonition if it also meant never having to experience a port this bad.  I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?  Rising Star ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to make it to retail, and they should be even more ashamed that they have still yet to make any effort to fix it. Absolutely shameful.
812	0	a	Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus.   So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.  Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.
813	0	a	The game is very enjoyable and it's design is unique. It has flaws, but those flaws bring a type of charm to the game that is very addicting. But the port is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad that it's unplayable. The fps â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in it's pants in some areas. The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much. You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.
814	0	a	This game is broken.
815	0	a	Unplayable
816	0	a	Horribly ported.  Go buy it for the 360.  I spent a good bit of my playtime just struggling to make it run. The game is good but this port is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cancer.
817	0	a	An unplayable port of a great game. Unplayable within the first 5 seconds of starting due to ridiculous framerates. Did not even get as far as the crashes. Community patches do nothing. I really wish I could play this game because I know for a fact that it's really good. I paid a dollar and I still feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this version like the plague. If you pay full price for this I can only pity you.
818	0	a	I tried to play the game Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut yesterday. This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.  Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.  Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.  This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the 'quirky dialogue' as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.
819	0	a	I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't. This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually 'works' there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is 'improved' version.  Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this... Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw. Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)! My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best. This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5â‚¬ when it was on sale!
820	0	a	There's broken games, like Bioshock and dark souls 1, all fixable with tweaking and fixes  Then there's Deadly Premonition, a cancerous mass that even mods and tweaks can't save. They can only spruce it up, but now we just have a spruced up corpse on our hands. A zany, goofy, unique spruced up corpse on our hands.
821	0	a	This game is broken.

823	0	a	This game literally refuses to work. I have tried every concievable solution to play this game, but it's useless. It won't work.  Shame on you Steam. Make sure the products you're selling actually â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing work.
824	0	a	This pains me to write. The game itself seems fantastic, but it's probably one of the worst PC ports I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not buy this, go and play the SUPERIOR console version over this failed abortion of a port.
825	0	a	I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't. This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually 'works' there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is 'improved' version.  Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this... Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw. Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)! My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best. This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5â‚¬ when it was on sale!
826	0	a	I tried to play the game Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut yesterday. This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.  Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.  Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.  This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the 'quirky dialogue' as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.
827	0	a	The game is very enjoyable and it's design is unique. It has flaws, but those flaws bring a type of charm to the game that is very addicting. But the port is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad that it's unplayable. The fps â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in it's pants in some areas. The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much. You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.
828	0	a	Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus.   So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.  Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.
829	0	a	There's broken games, like Bioshock and dark souls 1, all fixable with tweaking and fixes  Then there's Deadly Premonition, a cancerous mass that even mods and tweaks can't save. They can only spruce it up, but now we just have a spruced up corpse on our hands. A zany, goofy, unique spruced up corpse on our hands.
830	0	a	Wow this game fukking sukks! Daymn.
831	0	a	I am here for Mr. Stewart's lunch, if it is ready I'd thank you a bunch.
832	0	a	Good game IF you can get it to work which i cant
833	0	a	Don't buy this broken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, low frame rate, crashes, looks like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥...
834	0	a	This pains me to write. The game itself seems fantastic, but it's probably one of the worst PC ports I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not buy this, go and play the SUPERIOR console version over this failed abortion of a port.
835	0	a	This game runs poorly, even if you install DPFix. It doesn't look very good. It controls poorly. The combat, hiding, and evasion scenes are even poorly designed, before you get to controlling them. I've had it crash several times. I've only played a short bit on PC to see how it would run, after completiting it on Xbox 360, and I've had force-quits multiple times. I've even heard of bugs that can prevent you from completing the game, which is the entire reason to play the game.   But this game is enchanting. The story and characters, as much as you can say they are stolen from Twin Peaks, are fascinating and engaging. You will likely have numerous fits of laughter as you experience the quirky animations and dialogue. And the plot goes into perhaps even stranger and disturbing depths than Twin Peaks did. It's worth your time to stick with the game, even if the game is not to your liking, because the story is not to be missed.  That said, if a game that has numerous technical issues is going to bother you, then you shouldn't play it. You can experience the story elsewhere, and get most of the enjoyment from watching it as you would playing it, without having to struggle through what most people would consider a negative experience of completing the game's often tedious 'dungeon' segments.   I would say to absolutely wait for sales, even if you really want the game, and know you will enjoy it. This game goes on sale for as much as 90% off fairly regularly, such that I've purchased extra copies for others on several different occasions in the last few years, so you won't have to wait long to get a deal. I first purchased it for $15, as the original release on the Xbox 360, and didn't regret it one bit, but not everyone will get that same enjoyment, or have the same feelings. I can't recommend it at normal price, but cannot recommend it enough for $2.50-$5.
836	0	a	The game was 720p fixed. You must download the dpfix ( you can change the resolution manually in ini file). i played the prolouge and the hotel mission then i closed the game. a little bit later i would play the game,.......... WTF there are no savefiles to load. :( 
837	0	a	This product should not be sold on Steam. Granted, there are some people who successfully installed and ran and even played it, BUT there are many many others, myself included, who have tried and failed multiple times to play it.  Generally, I usually chuckle at people who have problems installing a game but this time the joke is on me. I tried three different PCs, nothing funky in the hardware and OS of any of them (all Win 7 64bit). Long story short, I did manage to run the game. My gameplay (after actually entering the game) consisted of one interaction before the game crashed. Repeated attempts came to the same conclusion: it seemed that any interaction caused the game to crash.  There are a number of so-called fixes, none of which worked. An amusing one requires you to run the PhysX driver over again, first to uninstall and then to reinstall. This actually works, sorta. It allowed me to get behind an instant crash and get the game running. But as noted above, the game would crash soon thereafter.   If you get DP as part of a cheap bundle, go for it and roll the dice, but don't pay even a Steam holiday sale price for this product.
838	0	a	All I can say is: Stay away from this game. It's the single most broken, poorly constructed amateurish piece of technological garbage I have ever witnessed in my entire life.  If you're fortunate enough to get past the confusing launcher(that has absolutely no technical options whatsoever, restricting you to a control configuration screen that thinks 1 and 2 are 'RT' and 'LT'), you get to enjoy the seemingly 9 in 10 chance of encountering a crash before you even see the main character on screen.  Should you, against all odds, actually get to a fairly playable place in the game, you'll find that something as simple as drawing your weapon... Drops your FPS to about 15-20. If you can deal with that, good. But the game doesn't stop there.  I was unable to get past the first time the 'Profiling' prompt appeared. Why? Because the game encountered a runtime error. Really.   And while I realise many will say 'Oh, but Durante's fix will fix all this!', that's a blatant lie. DPFix is snake oil and causes more issues than it fixes. Running DPFix, I was getting several graphical glitches as well as several crashes.  I'll continue trying to get this functional, but this does not bode well.
839	0	a	A fantastic story for an unplayable game.  If your mental is strong enough to endure 10 crashes/mn, you can try to 'play' this game.  With better graphism and professional programmation, this game could be a must have but they may forgot to pay programmers so....  :(
840	0	a	Crash to desktop all the time. Can't even play the game. Useless port.
841	0	a	Waste of Money.
842	0	a	It took me 30 minutes to get it started and, when I did, it crashed.  10/10
843	0	a	It's Twin Peaks, but terrible.
844	0	a	I am sorry but i foound this game losing of money. I did not like nothing in hame. i am sorry to developers and people who thinks oposite... maybe its just not my style.
845	0	a	Despite it's interesting Twin Peaks like premise and great atmosphere the bugs this game is plagued with (like random crashes back to the desktop causing you to lose progress) I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
846	0	a	Was really hoping to love this one, as I'm totally into weird kusoge heavily inspired by Twin Peaks, but I was so taken aback by the blatant misogyny all over the place that I haven't touched this ever since I finally picked it up. Just seems like the weirdest thing that nobody ever mentioned this to me and I had to spend money to find out for myself. So in case you're wondering, yourself, there it is. Now gamers can vote my review down because I didn't evaluate it completely or objectively or whatever (die, nerds).
847	0	a	STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS!  Here's a few of my favorite bugs and glitches:   1. Once you reach the hotel and walk into the cafeteria hallway, the sound will give out this blast of distortion that makes your speakers cry out for a quick death. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES.   2. During the in game cut scenes, York will light a cigarrette, but somebody â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the animation so that when he removes the cig from his mouth, one will be in his hand and another will stay in his mouth.   3. The inventory menu is like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ minefield for crashes. The game crashed on me at least 3 different times when I checked my inventory for either a medikit, some food or just to see the map. The inventory screen will both haunt and mock you.   4. During the second part of chapter one, while you're in the hospital and you're about to wrap it up after killing 3 zombies who are armed with shotguns, you just need to walk out of the hospital and then a cutscene will start up and you've finished the section. What's the problem with this ? WHENEVER THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING CUT SCENE STARTS UP, THE GAME CRASHES. Don't give me this 'windows 98 compatibility mode fixed it for me' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. It worked for me sure, except it took 30 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing minutes to clear a 2 minute piece of game due to the frame rate drop!   5. Starting the game up in Windows 98 compatibility mode will prevent you from using a gamepad. Wanna use that nice comfy 360 controller you bought for games like this? Well don't worry, you can use the A, B , X and Y buttons. Oh, you want to use the thumbsticks? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you.   And those are only off the top of my head! I'm sure if I sat down and really thought about it, I could easily come up with 10 more!   I was really enjoying this game at first, but the bugs make it unplayable. I managed to make my way through almost through the first chapter but then the game would constantly freeze on me whenever I attempted to make my way through to my objective (the manor where the townspeople are to be questioned).   Many people claim running the game in Windows ME/98 will fix this. That much is true only half of the time. This theory works when it wants to, at other times however the frame rate will drop all the way down to 10 FPS (what's the point then?) . I searched high and low for an answer to the drop in frame rate and it seems I'm not the only one suffering from this. No answer could be found.   Seriously, this game is incredibly unique, cool and different. I wanted to play through this so much, but in its current state, it's just unplayable. It'd be nice to get a refund, but considering that the developers don't care about their customers, and trying to convince Steam to test the products they put up for sale is about as likely as the next coming of Jesus, I find this unlikely.   Again, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PORT. If you've got a PS3 or 360 just buy that version, I certainly know I will.
848	0	a	This game seems so promising. I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.  These Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously flawed in the PC market.  Even the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize. The old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.  Most of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market. You adapt, or fall behind.
849	0	a	Recipe:  3 Parts mediocre Twin Peaks rip off (that's high praise for a Twin Peaks rip off, most don't even qualify as mediocre) 1 Part Silent Hill A pinch of Resident Evil 4 (NO, NO, YOU GRABBED CHRIS' SECTION FROM RE6 YOU FOOL!!!!!!!) Enough bugs and glitches to make the game almost need to be called Deadly Premonition Unity And just a touch of Red Dead Redemption near the end  Honestly, I enjoyed 90% of this game, but no game made in 2013 should need to be run in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode if you want to beat the final boss (who, by the way, is so completely out of place from the rest of this game that it's half the reason I'm not recommending it). I had to spend most of the time in XP Compatibility, but that still crashed occasionally and prevents you from aiming up and down properly which is needed rarely, but when it's needed it's needed. When it was crashing or aiming was required I switched to 98 which had enough load times that my hair turned grey. Occassional... dungeons?... are full of QTE which is thankfully only in those specific chase sequemces. The driving of any car faster than the free cop car involves spinning 360 degrees if you hit a pebble as 90% of vehicles handle like turbo charged bath tubs.  On the other handle, I liked the story and characters. Once I finished with the atrocious final boss I went back and finished all the side quests to learn more about the citizens of Greenvale (hence my 56+ hours of play). Of course, a bug involving quest items and replaying missions caused me to have to restart the entire game to get the second last achievement and the last one won't unlock despite patch notes saying the issue was fixed. If you've got the patience and the weird mind this game aims for, by all means play it. I just can't recommend it with a clear conscience without warning you first.
850	0	a	Despite it's interesting Twin Peaks like premise and great atmosphere the bugs this game is plagued with (like random crashes back to the desktop causing you to lose progress) I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
851	0	a	It was funny game but optimization was pretty bad and eventually made it unbearable
852	0	a	I am sorry but i foound this game losing of money. I did not like nothing in hame. i am sorry to developers and people who thinks oposite... maybe its just not my style.
853	0	a	Broken Twin Peaks rip off.
854	0	a	This is one of the worst game I have ever played. Once you're actually able to run it(you'll probably have to google a fix like I did) be prepared... bad gfx, bad voice acting, bad story, bad controls, bad gameplay. Don't buy it, even if it's on special.
855	0	a	I really wish there was a shrug icon when reviewing games. On the one hand, I am enjoying this, on the other, there are way too many cutscenes! It almost seems like take three steps forward, watch a cutscene, etc. The controls feel very awkward at the start. Unlike a lot of other players, I'm not having problems with CTD or FPS drops, so I can't complain about that.
856	0	a	I would not reccomend this game to anyone, the story seems intruiging, gameplay is passable, graphics are passable, but it just SO incredibly badly made, its just a pure miracle if you get the damn thing to work, and even if you do, its beyond impossible to expect it to work well for any decent length of time.  I dont care how good, how unique, how interesting a game may be, when its such an incredible hassle to get the thing working, and then, to have it stay working long enough for you to actually play it, its just not worth the price or the time, i wouldnt accept this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ from an early access game, let alone a full price retail release (i bought it in a sale, and still think its a waste), it just shows incredibly sloppy work, and arrogance on the devs part, to expect people to pay for a game which they couldnt even make playable unless you fix it yourself (or durante fixes it for you).  Long story short, your better off not wasting your money or time on a game that takes blind luck for it to even work for you with or without the community fixes.
857	0	a	I was excited to dive straight into what I've heard is a cult-classic with a strange, but entertaining storyline and fantastic characters. But unfortunately for me, I could not get the game to run without incredible lag, like many others have experienced. After tinkering around for a fix, it now just crashes at startup. Your chances of getting this game to work for you on PC seem to be 50/50. You'll have to decide whether it's worth the gamble.  I am hoping the devs eventually get back to this with some bug fixes, but it's not looking good. As it stands, I can't recommend what looks like an otherwise great game.
858	0	a	Cons: Obviously an awful port of a console game to PC. Terrible keyboard control. Sections of menu are unnavigable (options constantly scroll as if DOWN key is depressed). Terrible graphics/visuals. Trope: Game opens with murdered, naked woman. Trope: Creepy twin children. Trope: Awful voice acting and awful dialogue.  Pros: * Something vaguely like Twin Peaks in the theme (at least of the first 10 minutes). That's a far as I could stomach the cons above before quitting and uninstalling. * Game only cost $0.05 in my humble bundle purchase (all other funds went to other games in bundle).
859	0	a	The game kept crashing. Its such a bummer because from the parts I played, the game did show alot of promise. I can not recommend a game that crashes so frequently however.
860	0	a	Terrible port. Won't run in fullscreen mode if I select fullscreen mode and crashes otherwise. Unplayable. Do NOT buy this.
861	0	a	This is probably my favourite game ever.  This is also the worst port I have ever played.   For a few hours, I thought I was safe from the horrors of the port. I followed recommended fixes, ran it in compatability mode and the like, but it randomly - in full screen mode - being windowed with the rest of the screen black. Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen.   I paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it.   It really is unplayable.   Treat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.  Anyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever. Having ran through the game the first playthrough, I'm doing all of the sidequests this time. It is a wonderful, quirky, interesting, strange game. Get it on console and enjoy.
862	0	a	I really tried to like this, but simply couldn't.  Not long after I finished binge watching Twin Peaks, I felt like the need to revisit the experience and Deadly Premonition seemed like it would be just that. A weird detective game set in a mysterious mountain town filled with quirky characters. Heck, even the female lead looked like Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr?).   There were countless reviews stating how terrible the game was, but no amount of bad reviews could've stopped me from buying this game. Man, oh, man were they right. The game's simply unplayable. And not simply because it's a bad port. It's a small game overextended to a massive open world with terrible writing and the worst soundtrack of all time. I played it for less than 2 hours and had heard the whistling theme song at least 10 times, so I tried playing it with the sound muted. Didn't help.  I really tried to like this game, but it's not just so weird it's good. It's so weird it's bad and not in a Twin Peaks way.  If you're looking for a twin peaks-esque game, try Fahrenheit (also abysmally terrible writing, but atleast I managed to finish it).  Sadly, not recommended. Not until I get myself to finish the game.
863	0	a	Game would not start. I would press play and it would crash. I have windows 7 and a high end computer.  Below is what I found that worked. Anytime I have to go through this much to get it to work it will get a thumbs down. congrats Dp you get my first thumbs down on steam.   -Go to where Deadly Premonition is installed, easily accessible by right-clicking the game in your Steam library &gt; Properties &gt; Local Files &gt; Browse Local Files -Open the folder named 'redist' -Scroll until you find the file 'PhyX_SystemSoftware.msi -Double click -Run the 'Repair' option -Now run Deadly Premonition via Steam as usual 
864	0	a	It won't start, don't buy.
865	0	a	You can't really fully enjoy the game when the crashes keep you from progressing. Yes, there are a lot of them.
866	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME...IT DOESNT WORK FOR MOST ANYBODY...STEAM IS A BUNCH OF â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥UCKERS FOR STILL SELLING IT...
867	0	a	Played this game for HALF AN HOUR and this is what I learned: - Terrible sound design and ridiculous voice acting - Horrible graphics - Poor performance and NO WAY TO CHANGE GRAPICHS SETTINGS - Boring gameplay (Feels like a Resident Evil knock off)  Don't buy - not even on sale! Get Resident Evil or Silent Hill instead!
868	0	a	This isn't a game. This isn't even a beta-test. This is a crashy mess I got gyped into purchasing.  Really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sick of fixing developers issues. Unless you feel like fixing some script DO NOT PURCHASE.
869	0	a	The game's not bad. I got it free on PS3. Can't run it on Win 8.1 though. So no recommendation from me.
870	0	a	Great game but this port is absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, better off getting it on console.
871	0	a	The game itself is amazing, but the Controller support is broken and makes this version too frustrating to play.
872	0	a	This thing barely works.  And even if you manage to get it not crash at the start up, have fun watching it crash throughout the game too.  
873	0	a	It's ugly, it's got not no graphics options (stuck at 720p, though there are fanmade fixes), it plays terribly, features average voice acting and is a poor Twin Peaks knockoff. Grab on sale if you're morbidly curious.  3/10
874	0	a	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.
875	0	a	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.
876	0	a	Avoid this PC port, but play this game (on Xbox 360 or PS3)! It's a terrific, dramatic story, in a memorable, immersive, offbeat/surreal virtual town, PC porting issues aside.  If you do get the PC *port*, expect to put up with crashes every hour or so, long load times between zones and cutscenes (especially cutscenes), if you can even figure out the tricks to get it to run. Then, even when you're able to play, you still have to put up with broken vertical aiming that only shows up in the PC version.  If you still get the PC port, look at DPfix (and fiddle w/ resolution and windowing settings), and try setting compatibility to WinXP SP2, or better yet Win98 (but with Win98 you'll probably have to give up the built-in gamepad support and either use keyboard/mouse (mapped onto console/gamepad-first controls) or messing around w/ a third-party gamepad mapper).  I was on the fence 'yes' or 'no', but I'll leave it at 'no' both to stand out in the reviews, and to stick w/ my opinion that this particular PC version should be avoided unless you really don't have a 360 or PS3. I would hate to have you sour on this game's story and world simply b/c the PC port sucks major suck (seriously, even if you could get around the keyboard/mouse, load times (with only a blank screen, no indication DP hasn't frozen--tip: unless it CTDs, it'll probably load, just give it a few more MINUTES) can be unbearable).
877	0	a	Let me start by saying that I like this game, but I cant say enough how much you shouldnt buy it here. This port is broken. You are lucky if it works at all on your computer. For me, with my brand new gaming computer, this game crashes every seven muinets at the most, Making this game unplayable, as many of the save points can be as far as fifteen muinets apart.  Buy the 360 or PS3 version. Theyre still bugy, but at least they work.
878	0	a	Never able to play. Many problems for most users. Check forums before you decide to spend your money.
879	0	a	Good game, completely worthless port.
880	0	a	 2/10   At first I struggled with the game crashing. After fixing that I realized that crashing is actually better than playing this game.
881	0	a	I wanted to like this game, and it has its moments. It is buggy, often crashing to desktop or bluescreening. The gameplay itself is mostly a string of tiresome exercises that lead from one plot point to another. And for a while that was enough. It is kind of fun to see York unravel the mysteries of this town. But after a while, I don't know if its charm just faded, or some of the twists just broke suspension of disbelief or what. By the end, I was just going through on stubbornness.  On the bright side, it made me all nostalgic for Twin Peaks, and I picked up the boxed set. 
882	0	a	This game is a lot of fun! One day, I will buy it on a console and complete it. There is currently no chance that I will play this all the way through on the PC. All it does is crash. There are numerous help documents to help in making this game more playable for the PC, but I don't think they ever stop. I think we become immune to them at some point, but I have given up reloading this game again, it takes at least a minute to do that on its own. You just have to look at the guide section of this game on Steam to realise that there are some serious issues with this game.  My thought is that a game can become immortalised by being released on PC. Thus being playable for years to come. In the case of Deadly Premonition, it is going to need a serious makeover.  Maybe it will or does work for you, but you are most likely one in a few who have had success with the PC version of this game.
883	0	a	I have this for the XBox 360, so was excited to see it come to the PC. Wow was I wrong...! This is a horrible port, to the point the game is unplayable. Now I have a nice and powerful rig, with 8gb Ram, an Gigabyte HD 7970 and still get horrible stuttering at around 4 fps. So I go to change the resolution which is only at 720 when I realise I cant! The res is set at 720!   WHo ok'd a port like this? It's ridiculous that this game went on sale in a state like this. The original game had it's issues but was a diamond in the rough. The PC port is nothing but a lump of coal. If I thought I'd have a snowballs chance in hell, I'd ask Steam for a refund. Yes, it's refund bad.
884	0	a	Great game bad port. so as things are at the moment ( where i can't even play the port ) i wouldn't recommend anyone to have a try with it. But hopefully it will get the fixes it needs. and when it does, this game is clearly worth the price.
885	0	a	Do not buy this game on PC. Get it on PS3 if you can, or Xbox 360 if you have no other options if you really want to play it.  First and foremost, crashes when trying to run at full screen. Horrible lag when running in windowed mode. Durante's working on a fix, but at least Dark Souls was playable.  Do not get.
886	0	a	I had heard a lot of things about this game being a cult classic so I wanted to check it out. Luckily I got it on sale. The game itself is fun enough....when it works. This is a pretty poor port. In the 2 hours or so I put into it, I encountered serious framerate issues and game crashes. While I'd love to finish the game, having to sit through the unskippable intro logos isn't worth it when I'm seeing them so often due to the game crashing. Looks like I'll be watching a Let's Play of this instead of playing it.
887	0	a	This game is currently broken, crashing to a black screen. Although quirky and original, in it's current state it is a broken product and should not have been released. It is currently impossible to recommend until it is functioning properly.
888	0	a	I love the game, but the PC version is terriable. I always keep on getting a steam fatal error saying that steam must be running to play the game. Get it for the PS3 instead.
889	0	a	Great game but this port is absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, better off getting it on console.
890	0	a	The game itself is amazing, but the Controller support is broken and makes this version too frustrating to play.
891	0	a	Even with V1.01b patch game constantly crashes. Cause of that can't complete Chapter 2 Part 1.
892	0	a	This thing barely works.  And even if you manage to get it not crash at the start up, have fun watching it crash throughout the game too.  
893	0	a	The cheezy and dialogue, dated graphics, terrible voice acting and stale and uninteresting gameplay is over-comeable, as it does mold together to make something weirdly entertaining. However, the game is filled with so many bugs and glitches that it's hard to play more than an hour without stumbling on some glitch that requires you to restart the game to be fixed.
894	0	a	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.
895	0	a	Honestly this game is Terrible, it's a stark reminder of the bad side PS2 era, it looks like a bad PS2 game it playes like a bad PS2 game. Just a reminder this is a 2010 release and LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM 2003. The facial animation for each character is just so horribly done its a joke. The developer thought it would be fun to lock the resolution so its stuck in 720p, had to go and install a 3rd party fix just to get it to run properly in the correct resolution. Then when it does get going it crashes every 15 mins, or freezes on the pause menu requiring you to restart your progress from the last save point which are few and far in between out in the town. Lets talk a moment abou the HORRIBLE town design, I finished a story mission to be told that I have more then 12 hours til the next mission, so does the game give you some directions on where to go to sleep/pass time? NO, it gives you a marker to that mission and keeps telling you to come back, so in order to get to the mission I have to drive half way across town to the only sleeping bag not behind locked doors over half my cars gas. Oh did I forget to mention that? Cars have gas, so if you didnt do what I did after about an hour of searching for the sleeping bag and look it up online, you'll run out of gas and be screwed. The Enemies are a complete joke they are ALL 'ghosts' that do nothing but bend over backwards like a haunted yoga instructer, never actually doing much besides walking slower than the earth turns towards you. They do get weapons but then all the do is just hold them up to thier faces and again never actually do anything. All in all dont waste your time, the game is terrible, the plot works mostly but the game is so horrible broken and terrible that you'll never want to get past the second case with out uninstalling it. 1/10
896	0	a	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.
897	0	a	I was really starting to like this game when I realised that there's a major bug with aiming. First I thought I was just really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dumb and couldn't solve how to get this object down from a tree... you're suppoed to shoot it down but it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ CAN'T AIM HIGHER THAN COUPLE OF METRES VERTICALLY!!!!!!! If you don't want to lose your wits while trying to fix this bug then don't buy this game. On the other hand if you're one of the lucky ones you may not have to deal with the bug but I wouldn't risk it.
898	0	a	Maybe I missed something, maybe it's some cult classic I just don't get. But this is one of the single most boring games I've played in a while... The pace is so slow, I just couldn't stick with it.
899	0	a	The game is not working.  I don't even think they tried to make it work!
900	0	a	The game itself is great, but playing the PC port was one of the worst gaming experiences I've my life. THIS GAME IS BROKEN DO NOT BUY IT.  Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.  Here are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game -download a fan made patch to 'fix' things -Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes -switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes -lower the resolution to get past crashes -download save files that are past crash points -dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes -turn off steam overlay to stop crashes -ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points  I couldn't even finish the game. I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.  I tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.  It sucks because the actual game itself is great &amp; unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.  
901	0	a	You can't really fully enjoy the game when the crashes keep you from progressing. Yes, there are a lot of them.
902	0	a	WARNING: For many people the game is unplayable in it's current state, and the developers have officially stopped updating the game:   https://twitter.com/RisingStarGames/status/528158456448970753   DPfix helps with visuals and performance, but the game still crashes often and has numerous unpatched bugs, many which are game breaking. The last update was on November 28th of 2013, since then, development has gone cold with no signs of improvment. Shame, isn't it Zach?
903	0	a	After trying everything, I still can't get the game to work, which is a shame. I'd recommend buying the console game, as the PC Port is beyond broken and a patch to fix the issues seems out of reach. My only consolation is the soundtrack, that alone was worth the couple dollars I paid during the sale.
904	0	a	Chuncky controls, bad voice acting, robotic animation, and poor graphics that makes this game less enjoyable.  The worse part of the game is the weird background music that destroys the immersion of the game. Just imagine that a happy and joyful music that makes you feels like you're playing arcade games with the scary moments in the game, which makes the scares of the game feels nothing.  The game suffers from poor optimization with makes the game running at 40+fps with i7 processor, GTX 960M mobile Nvidia GPU with 12GB of RAM. Sometimes it even drop to 20 fps.    I didn't even know who's Zach is. The male protagonist in this game makes me feel that he's some kind psychopath  
905	0	a	- Game horribly laggy no matter if fulscreen or windowed (like 4 or 5 FPS while Bioshock Infinite turns flawlessly with my config, wtf!) - impossible to change the screen resolution - QWERTY or GTFO (you can bind all keys except for the directions. Wtf again!)   I got this for cheap thanks to halloween sales but I regret it. I want a refund.
906	0	a	The game's not bad. I got it free on PS3. Can't run it on Win 8.1 though. So no recommendation from me.
907	0	a	i was really enjoying it until i encountered a game killing bug wich made progressing past the hospital impossible without crashing . too bad .
908	0	a	Utterly broken and unplayable.
909	0	a	It takes some serious psychic detective work just to get this game to launch.
910	0	a	It's ugly, it's got not no graphics options (stuck at 720p, though there are fanmade fixes), it plays terribly, features average voice acting and is a poor Twin Peaks knockoff. Grab on sale if you're morbidly curious.  3/10
911	0	a	The time played (2h), is the time i spent trying to launch the game, and I am yet to see the menu.  I read the reviews before buying, and everyone complaining about how broken this is, and i mistakenly thought to myself that it was overblown by the community.  Lesson learnt, it is unplayable on my rig. i did every fix on the faqs, and official troubleshootting guide, compatibility mode, fan-made patch, physX.... and the game crashes as soon as it launches  at least i got it on a bundle, so not a lot is lost, but this game at 24.99e is a ripoff in it's current state, in a win10 up to date environment, as of August 2015  update: it starts in win10 with latest nvidia and physx drivers as of date of this edit still plenty of bugs, and 30 seconds black screens i understand by the amount of reviews, that it is a really good game, but the current state of this port is unbearable, so i killed the process in about 15 minutes of broken 'gameplay'
912	0	a	Worst game I have ever played! I am a big fan of mystery/adventure games and this game and controls were absolutley awful and half the time couldn't even make out where I was going and kept bumping into nothing. The 'ghost' at the beginning was laughable and reminded me of something out of the grudge. I did not even finish this game and turned it off after 5 minutes of playing as I was fed up and bored. Sorry but if you are a fan of adventure games like me , I do not recommend this game as it will be a big disappointment. I want a refund even if was Â£1.99

914	0	a	This game does not work on modern PC's. Will crash on launch. There are a few things I did to get over that but when I finally got into the game the framerate was completely unplayable and controls barely responded. Really disapointing. Another port failure.
915	0	a	Great if you can figure out how to fix the horrendous audio bugs.
916	0	a	The port is horrible, I can't play the video game because, in a determinate moment, the game will not let me play more. Fantastic...   I really wanted play to Deadly Premonition but currently is imposible.
917	0	a	It takes some serious psychic detective work just to get this game to launch.
918	0	a	Bad port of clunky game that belong to PS2. Save money and buy Alan Wake instead.
919	0	a	broken piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. absolute garbage
920	0	a	Don't believe the hype. This game is about as interesting as a trip to the dentist and about as fun as being kicked in the balls.
921	0	a	I don't know if its the graphics or controls for keyboard but I can't believe I paid for this game. I thought I was going to like it when I got it but am so disappointed and dare I say it even a little frustrated. I wanted so much from this game but in no time at all ended up uninstalling it. WASD are standard movement controls but the other controls are just not for me. If you want / can aim with left ctrl and space bar among other things then get this game.
922	0	a	Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks. Sounds freaking AWESOME, don't it? But let's take a closer look...   Your character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head. This would be a fascinating enough idea...except that he does it RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, and no one flinches an inch. He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom...in fact, one of the main, recurring 'side-quests' of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee. And when he finds a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded 'The Pickles' on the label, not bizarrely at all I'm sure you'll agree), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay. WEIRD, maybe...there is weirdness aplenty...but the spookiness is a little more on the sparing side. At least as far in as I have played this game. Maybe I'll try and play it again some other time, but for now I need a break 'cause, quite frankly, MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING HEAD HURTS. Sincerely.   Here's some of the other madness you'll encounter, should you be brave enough. There's wooden crates, in various public places. You can 'push' them. But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, like in, say, the early Resident Evil games, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash. Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel where no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish. To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to try this theory out). There's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror. Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring thematic of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself/his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever). I mean, c'mon...I love The Deadly Spawn from 1983 as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm supposed to be driving to a police station to find out some information about a murder victim. Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your 'tiredness' meter, of course...there's a hunger one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and, er, lollypops and crap like that as well). Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - 'come back tomorrow' - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and find some pistol ammo in it. As you do. Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, and if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that 'This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation'. I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare murder case...   What...you're STILL reading this review? Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function? Ah, look...seriously...I'm done. I don't even want to think about this any more. Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE. I wanted this game to be good. It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...   Oh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight. And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me. I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night. I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS. I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep. I can't take it any more. I'm sorry. I just can't...I just can't...  Verdict: 4/10.
923	0	a	Won't even run unless you go to the forums and get instructions for tweaking. Graphics are weak. There is no manual so good luck with that.   There is more time watching poorly animated movies than actually playing.  This game is a BIG disappointment.
924	0	a	The game itself is fun doesn't take itself seriously and offers quite a lengthy campaign, this game has the best main character i have seen for many years in a video game and made me laugh several times, the game is rather strange to describe but i will try if you had silent hill, a cheesy cop show from the 70s and an old gta game then combined them together you would get deadly premonition, The graphics are bad the textures are awful and the controls are clunky but this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game in any way i think this game works because of how bad some of the mechanics are. If you are mad about graphics and smooth mechanics do not buy this game. If you want to play a quirky game with some good humour and a very unique style of gameplay then this is for you. As for the pc port because it is so half baked and doesn't work for me i will say wait for another patch or just skip it on pc you could probably buy the console version for very cheap now which actually works
925	0	a	Thumbs down mainly because horrendous port.  As a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.  As a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.   The Gold: Really quirky casts WTF is wrong with this music?! The amazing attention to details York's amazing knowledge of old movies   I can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is   the dog  , but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that   fur coat  . (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered. So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so. Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome. In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where. You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business. If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games. You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about. I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.   The Unnecessary: Your piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientation Clunky combat and driving controls End game railroading DBZ boss battles and worse dialogue   Time for the really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem... Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.  This is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. 'Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!' You kill the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. ':cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111' â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game. Any boss battle with more than 2 forms is considered obnoxious. Your boss dialogue is contrived, half â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, simply moustache twirling level evil. Where's that button for taunting or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ slapping my opponent!? Have you dealt with the final boss in Ace Attorney Investigator? Yeah, that really dragged on didn't it? Remember: time crunch, memory leak, game explode? Ugh. I've actually had to skip quite a few vital plot scenes before the boss battles for fear of the game crashing. (and I couldnâ€™t stomach the big badâ€™s writing anymore) It turned out to be a smart move, because it DID drag on. Why why WHY? You had such a great start...     Actual plot spoiler tag, do not click unless you know what you are doing.   You know that bit where you become the Raincoat Killer? Looking back, I probably would've enjoyed the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of that if I wasn't in such a hurry to get to the next save point before the game crash.  
926	0	a	Do not buy this game, it Does Not start.   (I also tried to contact developers but No response or support from them at all)
927	0	a	Game crashes directly after the splasyscreen when I hit PLAY. Nothing working to get it running. I wonder how crap like this ever went through Steam's Greenlight process at all.
928	0	a	serious issues on windows 10, framerate is horrible and is compleatly unplayable.
929	0	a	it is a great game but one of the laziest ports in existance, game is a broken mess and the devs knew it.  it might better on console untill either that magic patch arrives either by the lazy doubtful dev team or more than likely fan patching .  as at the moment there is far far far to much to do to make this game work and far to much to do outside of the game to make it finishable
930	0	a	So somehow this game magically decided to work after hours of trying to get it run, it still crashes here and there but at least I can actually play now.  Amazing, amazing game but save yourself the trouble and get it on console, if you can't then go ahead knowing you may not be able to actually play it properly with dozens and problems, bugs and crashes. It ruins the experience of this amazing game.   I still think this game shouldnt be allowed on Steam with how broken it is and should be looked at again. Overall, it's not worth going through the trouble of getting this game to work during the early stages of the game, despite how amazing the story and characters are.
931	0	a	Oh man where to start.... What a mess of a game.  Its riddled with gamebreaking bugs, youll have to download other stuff to make it work, controls are clunky all around, graphics are dull, the music is attrocious (whistling song) youll get 3/4 skit songs that will play the whole game, so annoying and the monsters are far from scary. The only reason i got this is because it was like 99 cents and everyone praised the story. After trying to play this, i just ended up saying ''â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this'', but i still wanted to know the follow up to the story. So i went on youtube as other reviewers suggested and watched the whole 5h borefest it was. The more the story advances the more WTF moments pop up, until the end..... oh my what an end.....the kind of end that makes you want to cry because you realize what a waste of time it all was.  Save yourself money (even if its 99 cents, its not worth it)  Save yourself time (the story is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ anyways)  Enjoy an other game, there is trully nothing here but a borefest filled with a non sensical â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up of a story.  Not recommended.
932	0	a	I have played this game before steam using GOG. Back then I really thought I should try it since everyone was talking about how its one of the best mystery game out there and how funny and cheesy it is. So I downloaded the game . When I went to start it, it would not start so I modded it and it worked out great with no glitches and no frame drops, but why the hell did I go through the trouble of doing all that? the game it self looks absolutely terrible for a 2010 game, and the shooting and melee mechanics look like butchered resident evil 4 mechanics that should have been fixed 11 YEARS AGO (when re4/biohazard 4 came out). The game trys to be a fresh new start and try a whole new genre of mystery and detective work with resident evil mechanics. but the game turned out aweful looking, broken, boring and dull. Not even minding the bugs, the story itself is decent but not even worth the trouble of fixing the game to play, and the interesting characters are the only thing that basically make the game. People say its good because of the many random encounters that dont make sense and the fresh ideas put into the game but the random encounters are not even funny and makes the game look like crap. If you're gonna play the game stick to console and also if you're looking for a game that focuses on mystery using the atmosphere and the enivronment then do not get this game, its looks like it was put together in a month. People say its one of those game that its so bad its good but I just do not see it. I personally would give the game a 4.5/10 for the characters but for everything else the devs made it look like they didnt even try.   TL;DR Buyers beware. Do not even accept this game for free and put your time trying to fix the bugs to play it, its not even worth it. If you want to play it, play it on Xbox 360 ( I heard the ps3 version is also broken.)
933	0	a	I'm sorry that I recommended this game about a year ago when it was on sale on the humble bundle store for about $1. I thought they had put more effort into the port than they did. But as it turns out it's just yet another bad port. Bad in a way that only japanese studios that regret their decision to take console exclusive deals can do.  Got it running by breaking physx for other games on my system that link to it. Only to see that the resolution is hardcoded to 1280x720. I was aware of dpfix. But even though it evidently loads the symbols just fine (as indicated by not segfaulting) it just sits forever eating my cycles. Likely caused by a recent update.  There are people on the forums trying to defend these incompetent developers. They shouldn't. They're only further ruining Steam. Having a quirky game that likes to have a bit of fun despite itself is one thing (and is why I came to want it in the first place) but having a buggy piece of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ maintained by incompetent developers is another, and believe me they are incompetent.  The fact that libs that override d3d9 symbols exist in the first place is evidence of that. As the complexity of the problem goes up so does the complexity of the override libs. But ones like these -though written by undoubtedly competent people- merely provide basic features that the game should have in the first place. Like adding a second step that adjusts resolution based on values given in a config file.    Edit:  I was able to fix the issue causing the game to just sit there eating cycles and have it running in my native resolution. I'm sure the game will be as fun as I figured it would be but my review above still applies. The short of it is: Don't bother if you're not comfortable having a game that isn't playable right after download from steam. It's going to take a bit to both get it to actually run without segfaulting and get it aesthetically reasonable (meaning native resolution of your monitor and properly saturated environments).  Had I known this port was as bad as it was I wouldn't have encouraged developers who do crap like this by giving them money. I suggest you don't make the same mistake.
934	0	a	Horrible Graphics. Horrible, HORRIBLE Voice Acting, like they translated Japanese-English 1:1. Controls and interface are awkward at best. While I'm not far into the game I have to say the story makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL. Combat is.. well.. clunky and boring. Unless you're into this kind of games and don't mind playing in japanese you should really avoid this.
935	0	a	It's still unplayable with DPfix too but I suggest to buy it and play it as long as it works fine. And after that watch 'Deadly Premonition The Movie' on YouTube.  It's about story, gameplay is pure garbage.
936	0	a	serious issues on windows 10, framerate is horrible and is compleatly unplayable.
937	0	a	Looks interesting but its broken and not just for me.  7 to 17 FPS with all suggested fixes applied and it appears to have a memory leak.
938	0	a	Amazing game, but probably the worst PC port ever. You're lucky if you can even get it to run. Save yourself the bother and just buy it on a console instead.
939	0	a	0/10 Not working on Windows 10!!!!!!!!!!!
940	0	a	Awful game, not the story but the terrible optimization, the lack of Customizing, the clunky inventory, the crashes and overall crumminess of it. Feels like a very old resident evil game.
941	0	a	Horrible Graphics. Horrible, HORRIBLE Voice Acting, like they translated Japanese-English 1:1. Controls and interface are awkward at best.

942	0	a	one of the the crappiest games ive ever played. Looks like pre PS2 graphics, horrid controls, and the most disjointed and impossible to understand game ive ever played. it makes me sick that this game is in my libary. i will be contacting steam for a refund, or at the vary least have it removed from my account. thats how bad this game is, id rather eat it than to suffer the humiliation of having this on my account. the devs should be ashamed of makeing something so horrible.
943	0	a	Bugs.   Bad controls including mouse lag and other stupid things.  Annoying screeching loop while driving.  Driving is badly done.   Really long boring animations.  Stupid combat.   Horrible UI.  Not really immersive. Or rather all the garbage just constantly breaks immersion.  The story is a bit interesting but the game is just terrible. I'd rather read this in a book than play this game.   
944	0	a	Just do yourself a favor and watch an LP of the game if it interests you, even after trying out DSFix the game crashes at the start of a cutscene in the hospital, making progress impossible. I only paid 3 dollars for the game and I still feel cheated.
945	0	a	This game is trash. Crashes and hangs if you don't do things in a gentle manner. Framerates are 'cinematic' even after applying dsFix. I wish I used the money to buy a burg instead.
946	0	a	Great game but it does not start after the setting screen it just crashes thank God i only payed $2
947	0	a	Took a lot of messing about and reading guides to just get this game to get past the intro movie. After that, wanting to use a controller, the controller button in settings was disabled so I just uninstalled out of frustration.  I guess I got a few hours out of my money doing all that...
948	0	a	I have no idea if this plays well or not. It runs at least, contrary to what others have reported. However, it does not recognise XBOX controller at all, there is no way to remap the keys, it has poorly dubbed voiceovers akin to a film originally produced in another language, the graphics are clearly directly ported from something like a ps2 with no way to increase resolution, and (one of my all time pet hates) there is no way to turn off subtitles. For some not being able to use a controller OR remap keys might not be a deal breaker but since I am left handed the whole awsd extended map is a complete btfk for me. Even at 90% off I would advise you not to bother.
949	0	a	Broken from the start. After downloading the game it would not launch at all. To fix that you have to run dplauncher as administrator. Then i calibrated my wireless 360 controller and launched the game after that and set my control config to joystick in the launcher. Buttons worked fine and the game is advertised with 'Full Controller Support'. RIght when i gained control of the character i could not move but the buttons worked. I downloaded and installed the dpfix and it didnt do anything. I really wanted to play this but i only paid $2.49 and i wouldnt recommend buying it at that price. I guess i'll just buy the ps3 version.
950	0	a	I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.
951	0	a	I was really excited to play this, but it's so poorly optimized that I can't even launch it, even with DPFix and all the PhysX hurdles I had to jump over.  That's $2.50 I'm never going to get back. Get the console version instead.
952	0	a	This game turned out to be unfinishable for me. During the final boss fight you have to aim down, but you just can't. Tried this with mouse, tried this with controller, tried bizzare compatibility mode suggestion. Completely broken, 14 hours wasted.
953	0	a	I really wanted to play this game, after having watched a full LP of it. It really seems like a unique experience, despite its many many many apparent flaws. However, after an hour or two of launching, tweaking, relaunching, browsing numerous forum threads, and generally throwing everythign I can think of at this thing, I CANNOT get it to function properly, be it running with a decent framerate or even properly recognizing my controller's analog sticks and d-pad (standard 360 pad). Even after trying every downloadable fix, and recommendation, I have not been able to play any of this game, so I obviously can only recommend you stay far far away from this particular version. If you want to check it out, get it on PS3 or 360. The devs deserve none of your money for this non-functional port.
954	0	a	Amazing game, but probably the worst PC port ever. You're lucky if you can even get it to run. Save yourself the bother and just buy it on a console instead.
955	0	a	Do not buy this game. Crashes all the time.
956	0	a	0/10 Not working on Windows 10!!!!!!!!!!!
957	0	a	i wouldnt recommend this game for now there is alot fps problems, controller problems, so just wait for fixes on game first
958	0	a	Great game, worst port EVER.
959	0	a	Doesn't seem to work regardless of re-instal et al.
960	0	a	just crashed! ... good story but somes bugs
961	0	a	Bugs.   Bad controls including mouse lag and other stupid things.  Annoying screeching loop while driving.  Driving is badly done.   Really long boring animations.  Stupid combat.

963	0	a	I may be harsh - looks bad, plays bad and simply was unable to hold my interest for more than an hour. My opinion might change, I will try and play more with it - but as it stands right now this game is what I call bad. Or maybe I was expecting too much. ---------------------------- I gave it another (short as it turned out) shot. No change: crap is crap. Outdated looks, animation is embarassing, textures are bleak... was this a PS1 game? PC version needs extra utils to actually 'run'... some bugs here and there (maybe more to come but frankly I cannot be bothered to play more....) Crashes? Just some - and only _if_ you get the thing to launch :-) In my opinion this 'game' is not worth playing, not even if it was free. As for it being the Twin Peaks of PC games... poor David Lynch - that statement is an insult. Maybe the story was supposed to be like TP? I will never be able to tell.
964	0	a	This game is so unplayable with its extremely slow frame rate and bad graphics. Just don't buy it !!
965	0	a	if the developers are willing to release a port this poor and expect people to pay full price for it they simply do not deserve the money. avoid this game.
966	0	a	well the game doesn't work how do i get my money back
967	0	a	Don't get me wrong, the game itself is remarkably good but the PC port is just insanely terrible and utterly garbage! It's truly one of the worst PC ports in history, imagine a mix of Resident Evil 4 &amp; Dark Souls PTD ports and make it a hundred times worse. It's terrible in every single aspect you could imagine and  so broken that it's  LITERALLY  UNPLAYABLE :   Performance : Extremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run.  You probably have to use MODs just to be able to launch!  And that's not all, Loading times are infuriating, especially the invisible loadings between each cutscene which could last up to 8 minutes! You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading!  There are countless super-long invisible loading times!  And that's not all! There's one more bonus for you:  Game constantly crashes every once in a while for no reason!    You're better off playing it on the console rather than buying this terrible and utterly unplayable piece of crap on PC. 
968	0	a	Don't buy this on PC. Get it for consoles right away.
969	0	a	This is game is buggy beyond belief. stay away. grab the original version of the game on Xbox 360 if you must play it, the PS3 director's cut is also buggy as all hell.
970	0	a	I would love to recommend this, but its probably the worst PC port in exsistance, which is kind of fitting with the game it self.
971	0	a	I'd enjoy to play the game but the audio keeps skipping. I bought this bad game because I wanted to play it; not to have a stroke everytime I want to watch acutscene. Jeesh, don't buy this game till they patch it.
972	0	a	Will not function despite everything I do. That includes known fixes regarding fixing NVIDIA programs to mods needed to make it run to blood sacrifices. Buy at your own risk.
973	0	a	I was really forward looking playing this little gem. But, was I in for a surprise. This little 'gem' is in fact just a little turd. First, it runs just in 720p, except you got the fix, and the in-game-mechanics aren't great either, driving physics from hell (and there are RACES, who would want to do that?). and it crashes so every often..my game is now broken to the extend that I can't play any further. It crashes after a cutscene, when it's loading...so, please, DO NOT BUY!! cheers, Sam
974	0	a	cant even get this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to launch. why are you selling this broken crap? can i have my money back?
975	0	a	Literally the worst PC port I've ever played.
976	0	a	This port gave me cancer.
977	0	a	Unfortunatly a subpar port, if a ptch is realised then consider picking it up.
978	0	a	Don't waste your money on this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, it's worst port i have ever seen. Horribly broken game. No patch in nearly a year to fix this mess. Oh and botched controller support to put it bluntly it doesn't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing work!!!! so ignore the store page. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you rising star games you theiving â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you might aswell have mugged me in the streets. Never buying any of your stuff again as i know it's a brand of lazy developers who can't be bothered to fix their own mess.
979	0	a	I'm loving this game, having a lot of fun, the weird kind of humor, the tense atmosphere, but still I don't recommend this game. It crashes frequently, and since the game doesn't have a auto-save system, I lost about 2-3 hours of gameplay. I hope they start fixing this crashes, because the game itself (storyline, gameplay) is great, but the crashes can be disappointing.
980	0	a	This game actually looked a lot better before I played it. The game has a fairly 'fear-like' storyline. The storyline is somewhat nice and fits it's theme, but the game itself is boring. The combat of the game is very complicated having to hold around 3 on your keyboard just to aim down when shooting. The game itself is fairly weak and could be improved greatly.
981	0	a	Unfortunately Zach, I just can't recommend this game. Sure, it has some of the goofiest writing I've ever seen, and the music seems to become inappropriately cheery in scenes where a murder has just taken place, but this port is awful. It crashed at least 15 times in my playthrough, sometimes well after my last save point, causing me to lose a lot of progress. The DPfix mod helps make the game look decent, but the game itself is just way too unstable. Get the XBOX 360 version if you just have to see what all the fuss is about.
982	0	a	Never got past the intro thanks to a regular crash. Of course I am not one to give up easily, so I tried 7 more times, using dpfix, using compatibility modes, fiddling with NVIDIA settings, launching stuff as Admin and changing between windowed and fullscreen mode. In the end I sat in the launcher for a few hours to get the cards and then moved the game to my 'Trash' category, because that's what it is.  Edit after all those months : Thanks to a forum thread the thing finally started to work. It required me to uninstall the LAV codecs I had installed. I' guess getting the game to work is already part of the gaming experience :l
983	0	a	Crashes at after intro cut scene, only fix is to uninstall codecs and filters......not happening. I guess this means that PS3 version it is.
984	0	a	The twist at the end is that Suzuki-kun has been dead all these years and Mamiko only saw him because she is crazy. The boat at the end represents their last moment together before Mamiko drowned Suzuki-kun
985	0	a	Utterly broken, with showstopping bugs.
986	0	a	poor voice acting &amp; plot. Stupid gaming mech wow
987	0	a	this game is a real waste of time
988	0	a	  Deadly Premonition * N/A 
989	0	a	This is officially the worst game I've ever played. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.  It's easy to imagine that the early design discussions went something like this:   'I have an idea for a game! And by idea, I mean let's copy something. How about we turn that weird 90s TV show by David Lynch into a game!'  'You mean Twin Peaks?'  'Yeah!'  'Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show.'  'Zombies.'  'Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?'  'No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse.'  'So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?'  'Yeah. Head zombies.'  'Got it. So how does the player get around?'  'It's open world.'  'Like GTA? You can drive?'  'Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town.'  'And you can go anywhere?'  'Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere.'  'Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?'  'Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest.'  'Why obscure?'  'Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing  dynamic weather .'  'Oooooooooo.'  'Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather.'  'That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?'  'Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!'  'I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies.'  'Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!'  'So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?'  'Exactly!'  'This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it.'  'Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it  art .'   On a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.  At one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.  How I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.  The story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.  This isn't groundbreaking. It's not art. It's just bad.
990	0	a	I thought that Resident Evil Revelations was a horribly generic version of Resident Evil but this game takes the cake. Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.  The shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like â€œman this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?â€ â€œwell actually I um... I baked them myselfâ€. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.  I would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate â€œreal gameâ€ from â€œadventureâ€ because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.  I realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.  Painfully generic, 5/10
991	0	a	Twin Peaks + Silent Hill.  this game is like strong black coffee: enjoyable, but not everyone would like it, or even be able to stomach a tiny amount of it.  it's got more hardware issues than a customer support center, and wasn't very stable or well-coded to begin with when it was 360-exclusive.  Stylish as HELL though. I'm loving everything about it in spite of its awful flaws. i can't wholly say it's a game for everybody.
992	0	a	too buggy, controller not working, lazy pc port
993	0	a	This game is just terrible.
994	0	a	Piece of trash. Blurry graphics and unfinished. Many bugs and glitches.
995	0	a	  F.K in the coffee and that is all.
996	0	a	Dun like the weird controls. Something ain't right
997	0	a	I forget to save for 3 hours and a fence appeared a few feet infront of me and I exploded 10/10. Other than that the port is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and it looks like an upscaled dreamcast game. The shooting is resident evil 4-esc. The story features your typical japanese wackyness that you find in a suda 51 or early Dead rising game. Is it worth 25 dollars? No.
998	0	a	Where do I even start with this? Ah, how about from the moment I double click on the icon to start the game:  1. The launcher says at the bottom D-pad: Select Option and A: Confirm even with no controller plugged in. 2. Check box in the settings menu of the launcher is already checked for Full Screen mode 3. Press Play and the game starts in a bordered 720p window on my 1440p monitor. 4. Get to main menu, can't use my mouse. In fact there isn't even a cursor. Have to use keyboard arrow keys to navigate 5. Go to options and see there aren't any graphics settings whatsoever. 6. Quit the game. Cry.  At the time I wrote this review it's on sale for $2.49 which is 90% off it's regular asking price of $25. $25 for this? Even at $2.49 it's a massive rip off. Avoid at all cost or risk a heart attack trying to play whatever the hell this is.
999	0	a	Stupid 3rd person view! In RL i have good aim, point blank as well as long range. And in a good 1st person view game that shows. I'm not about to let 3rd person view ruin my aim.  Besides, this is a small screen what can not be enlarged to full screen. The bones of decaying humanoids apparently are stronger then a steel pipe. Wasting bulets on extremely slow monsters? Just a plain stupid game.
1000	0	a	ive never been so annoyed by a game.  terrible port that makes you feel like playing a PS1 game with a raddled controller and broken fingers. flickering textures, low quality graphics and sounds, slow moving mouse, weird keyboard settings...  but thats not enough! you also get monotonous dialogues and a narcotic story. the gameplay is so weird and slow, i have no idea why this appears in the 'ACTION' category.  worst about this game is the music. pitch and melody forced me to turn it off completely. the composer must have been some suicidal crackhead in a self doubt delirium. ( i bet that the same guy also created the story layout for this game...)  honestly, i expected not much, but even this low expectations got disappointed by this game.   dont buy it, i beseech you!
1001	0	a	stupid game doesn't work! crap crashes before you can play, the waste of space piece of garbage.
1002	0	a	Silent hill 2 if it was directed by Tommy wiseau.  For someone who loves investigation games, this was far too goofy, and you can find out who the real killer is the moment you meet him.
1003	0	a	Clunky graphics, bad controls ... avoid
1004	0	a	Patched...  playable.... under review...  Rating: ?/10 Value: ?
1005	0	a	Screw that game.
1006	0	a	The game is a fine, campy adventure with some bad combat up until it suddenly pulls out transmisogynistic tropes. You'll hear people praise it as a cult classic without ever mentioning that. Avoid it.
1007	0	a	Holy God, this is bad. This game has some of the worst controls I have ever seen in a video game. On top of this the voice acting and lipsynch are garbage. Why does this game have any positive reviews at all?
1008	0	a	Ok... so let me say this: I love Twin Peaks.  But this. This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is not Twin Peaks.  I couldn't get past the forest at the beginning as this game is radiating cancer.  Maybe I'll try it again in the future.  It'll probably kill me when I do.
1009	0	a	Another crappy game people want to like because someone told them they should, it's boring, has terrible graphics and the controls don't work as they should but that could be fixed with a patch. It's definitely different from lots of games that get released and I'm sure some people will find a reason to play it but I prefer to spend my limited free time playing GOOD games.
1010	0	a	Steam told me to recommend this game to my friends. But I won't. You shouldn't play it. Not on steam, not on any other platform, because devs hate you. They'd r*pe your dog and houseplants if they had a chance. Yes, they are that incompetent, ignorant and they are okay with that. This port is A LOT worse than Dark Souls port. It's can challenge the worst ports like DMC3 or original RE4 release and effin' win hands down. I'm not kidding. And you know, xbox and ps3 versions weren't really more of a better game. No, I'm not talking about story writer - the story is actually interesting, the Twin Peaks atmosphere mixed with Silent Hill in open-world detective horror with a whole lot of WTF moments. But you'll get r*ped with a baseball bat for it. Go on, you've been warned.
1011	0	a	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
1012	0	a	I paid for this game in the hopes to actually play it. IT DOESNT WORK!!!! They took my money and the game doesnt work at all. Feel as if I was knowingly robbed, because Steam already knew this didn't work.
1013	0	a	The game is great, until it crashes and never works again
1014	0	a	No clue about the content of the game -- after installing (and restarting PC) it is unplayably laggy. Which I would have read the review section first, my own fault.
1015	0	a	I can't give an honest review of the game because I haven't actually played it - so keep that in mind. I haven't played it because each time I try I physically cannot keep going, it's so terribly cheesy and awful I can't help but turn it off immediately. I hope it's good when you actually start playing - but the cheese factor is too real for me :-(
1016	0	a	Do NOT Buy!  I was lucky enough to get the game running but it's a disaster of a port. There isn't a resoulution option so you're stuck at the 720p console port resolution. It should run with a great framerate at least, right? Wrong. I was getting around 10 fps. When I wasn't moving the camera. When I was closer to 5 fps. I can't really review much else about the game. It's not playable like this..
1017	0	a	A very strange game that had me laughing for all the wrong reasons. The story is rediculasly slow with the actions being even slower. I gave up hope when the game had me looking for a key for a long time through different rooms, the door animation being about 30 seconds of him opening them, this was the final nail.
1018	0	a	I'd want to play all the way through this game, but the game decided to corrupt my save file. And no, the game is not so good, that i'm willing to go through it again. If you want to try this out, DON'T GET THE PC VERSION. Any other version is better than this! Horrible fluctuating framerate, constant crashes and lacking in basic PC settings like resolution. Just don't.
1019	0	a	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game and a must play, I HIGHLY recommend it. However, the PC port is pretty much broken. You're lucky if the game even launches and when it does, it is riddled with bugs, glitches and contantly crashes. The game itself is REALLY good, but I've never seen a PC port this broken. It's exactly like the Dark Souls port but worse. A fantastic game that it ruined by a horrible port. What a shame. Stick with the console version.
1020	0	a	This is the japanese indie love child of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. A pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lovechild, but still somewhat awesome and adorable none-the-less, provided that you can patch it up enough to get it to even run in the first place.    THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS  105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.  I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)  Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a 'bad port'. No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!    HOW TO GET IT TO RUN  In order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to 'repair' its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)  Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to 'Ultra' in that file, the graphics will crash.)  Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.  In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.  As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes. First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.  Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.  If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.  However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.
1021	0	a	In principle it is probably a 'thumbs up' game. Alas, it wont run on my PC, no matter the tweaks with PhysX, DPFix, etc. pp. Hence the thumbs down. Apparently it is a poor console port to the PC.
1022	0	a	i whant my money back the game is bugd and and i cant play it i reinstalt it 5 times i done 100 difrent stuff to it and dont whant to work so is the suporters of the game see the massage. I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!!
1023	0	a	Wow this is why i should read comments this was not expected, stay away from this game it just likes to crash....alot.
1024	0	a	Tried this game out after reading a few of the positive reviews even though they mentioned the game was buggy and the controls could be quite awkward, but that the main story made up for it. Sadly I just couldn't get into it, every line of dialogue was more awkward than the controls and every character felt like they'd struggle to get cast in a B-movie.  If you must try it grab it in a sale, but dont expect much.
1025	0	a	What a disappointment... Did those developers really think it's cool to copy what everything Twin Peaks has done? Talking about a total ripoff here! Anyone who says this game isn't a ripoff is either in denial or didn't watch a single episode of Twin Peaks...  I really wanted to enjoy this game but I couldn't. The execution is really good but the tired story has completely ruined it.  pros:  +atmosphere +good soundtrack +cool protagonist +good gameplay  cons:  -boring missions -outdated graphics -disappointing story  Avoid this game if you have already watched Twin Peaks because it's basically the same thing but in a video game form. 
1026	0	a	Well, I've got to say that this game has a terrific intro where grandpa goes for a walk with his two grandkids through somewhere he knows isn't safe. He's right because dp.exe has stopped working. My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called 'repair' fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway). Nothing seemed to help. It's not as though my system is so old or incompatible (ASUS i7 notebook with 8GB RAM &amp; GeForece 610M with 2GB RAM running Win7)
1027	0	a	As much as I want to recommend this game, I really don't think it's worth buying.  Many other reviewers give this a thumbs up because of the game itself, which is indeed fun and unique. But this port is so awful it's definatly not worth the money. It's crashing more consistently than any other game I've played. Playing it is an excercise in stubborness, and every time you do ANYTHING your first thought is run to a save point before it crashes and I have to repeat that again.  It doesn't matter how good the game is if it's unplayble. Do not buy this unless the devs fix this terrible PC port. If it gets patched then definatly get it. Not before.
1028	0	a	Don't waste your money on this port. No matter what I did to try to get this game to work and not crash, didn't work. I really, really want to play it. I can't say it's impossible, since some people are able to enjoy it, but I can't and it makes me sad. Time to hunt down a copy for PS3.
1029	0	a	Fantastic story and characters with great music. Gameplay is completely busted at moments. I'd suggest watching a playthrough like the one from Video Games Awesome or Giant Bomb instead of actually playing the game. It's really not worth the hassle to slog through the gameplay.  I groaned everytime there was an action sequence (I counted around 6). The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny. There is a sequence where you need to fight four of those monsters in a row and I pretty much ran out of usable weapons at that time. When your health is low, you'll start limping, have fun progressing through the levels like that!

1034	0	a	This game is a scam If you have NVIDIA card you will play with 12 FPS due to a memory leak No solution for this .Be warned
1035	0	a	Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).  The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.
1036	0	a	Worst pc port ever created.STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME EVEN IF TI COSTS 0.1$.I have and nvidia gtx 560 ti 2gb video memory, 8gb ram and an intel core i5.I can barely hit 10 fps.Realy check the community hub.DONT BUY ! DONT BUY!DONT BUY!.  FINAL VERDICT: 0/10 BECAUSE I COULDNT EVE PLAY IT.
1037	0	a	I started playing this and it crashed right away.  I followed the PhysX reinstall option (google search it) and it started working.  Found the game can only be played at 720p, forced resolution, no way around that using the vanilla game software.  Tried DPFix to change that. All ini file parameters were WELL within what my PC and vidcard can handle, which, for this game isn't a heck of a lot. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Did the PhysX reinstall again. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Decided I'd already used up $2.49 worth of my time and uninstalled this piece of crap game.
1038	0	a	Bought the game, it crashed on every start up.  Read the support pages, didn't help. Visited company's website (both Steam and the developer's): no help. Downloaded every mod and patch to fix it: none worked.  They should rename the game: 'System Restore, the reboot joyride!'  Please steam, don't get your customers steamed up. Just give me a refund or store credit and I'll try a different one.
1039	0	a	I would love to say that this game is giving you the whole game worth that silen hill delivered.  However, for that to be true, i would need to actually be able to play it.

1052	0	a	I tried to like this, it's just the right kinda weird to be interestging, but it is a bug riddled mess, and one of the worst PC ports I've seen in a while. Add to that all the unnecessary QTEs and rather annoying boss fights, and I just can't recommend it unless you're seriously out for an all around punishing experience.
1053	0	a	WonÂ´t run at all-a complete waste of time.No tips from the internet can solve this, this 'conversion' seems to have be programmed by badly trained cockroaches. What will the 'publisher' do next? Steal childrenÂ´s lollipops? Shame on you, may your disgraceful coding hand rot away! 
1054	0	a	This game is amazing! It's almost like they took Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, and cast him individually as an FBI agent investigating a small town murder with a Silent Hill twist.  Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the game working, and god forbid you have 5.1 surround sound!  Unfortunately, going through the process of fixing the game, the game is still incredibly bugged, and is borderline unplayable. If this game functioned, I would give it a 9/10 (some gameplay elements are laughable). However, the sad reality is that you may end up wasting your money buying this game, especially if you are not persistent and willing to play through the many crashes that truly break the game's immersion.
1055	0	a	Startup crash because game installs bugged physx? Ok, fixed it. Console resolution? Fine, fixed. Broken 5.1 sound? Oh well, it runs fine in stereo. Unavoidable crash in chapter 2?.. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. I tried everyting. I really hate this game, instead of enjoing it, and fighting in-game monsters, I had to fight the game itself. Curse upon you, who ported it on a PC!
1056	0	a	Really bad PC port. Can't even get past the opening video sequence in the beginning of the game without a crash. 'Dp.exe has encountered a problem' and then crash to desktop.  This happens with DPfix AND without DPfix.  You may have better luck than me, but just to be safe, don't buy this game on Steam unless it's incredibly discounted in a sale. That way you won't lose much if it doesn't end up working.  It's a shame I wasn't able to get this working because it looks like a neat game otherwise. Just can't recommend such a sloppy port.
1057	0	a	I loved the game, however it keeps crashing after hospital level no matter what I do.  I tried various fixes from all around the net, no use.  If you can get this game on a console OR you are confident it will work, you should definetly buy it, because it's a hidden gem.  HOWEVER, if you are unsure whether to buy it or not, don't risk.
1058	0	a	I really would like to finish playing this game but it keeps crashing on one of the loading screens in chapter 3. I have tried a lot of the suggested solutions like: uncheck full screen, run in compatibility mode, run as administrator ... - Like it should never be this hard to get a game to work. What a pity.

1068	0	a	Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).  The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.
1069	0	a	Gave up trying to get it to work.
1070	0	a	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!  But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying 'Dp.exe has stopped responding'  So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.
1071	0	a	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.   
1072	0	a	Probably one of the worst PC ports on Steam.  If you get this game to run, pat yourself and drink a beer.
1073	0	a	Can't launch the game. Crashes every time after opening cinematic. Tried everything I can find.
1074	0	a	This game is unplayable, there are constant crashes.
1075	0	a	Great plot but unplayable most times because a terrible PC port. Also gameplay is a pain in the â™¥â™¥â™¥ when it comes to aiming and shooting people, clearly Swery has no taste in real shooting or action games.
1076	0	a	It's an incredible game, it's simultaneously terrible and amazing (beyond 'so bad it's good', you're going to have to take my word for it) making for one of the most unique, confusing, hilarious, and quotable gaming experiences ever to grace the face of the universe.  So why not recommended, you might ask? The port. Japan is notorious for their terrible PC ports, but this one reaches an all time low, it really is that bad. If you pick this up prepare to be greeted with such lovely features such as:  720p resolution lock (Can be fixed by DPFix)   15fps, but only half the time you start the game. Also note it's still running at 60 (evident by some of the camera movement and the pause menu, but the timing is messed up for everything else).   Bad controller support. This game was originally a XBox 360 game, which makes the dev's choice of DirectInput over XInput make even less sense. Editing controller binding happens in the launcher and is extremely limited &amp; finicky (DPFix does give you a few more options through ini files).   Random crashes, the game tends to crash randomly due to memory leaks or just bugs in the game code. There's some ways to lessen the effect but no way to get rid of all of them.   Not so random crashes, some parts of the the game just outright crash and you have to do all sorts of stuff to try to work around them (such as running in compatibility mode for Win98, or rebooting your PC), but even that's not as bad as   Save file corruption, save files can easily become corrupted, causing the game to crash soon after load, and usually in the same spots. Sometimes the only work around is to delete your save and start again. Save often and backup saves often.   It's a great game but it's just not worth the money they're asking for considering the state of the port, however if it goes really cheap it might be worth the gamble if you can make the port bearable. If you are a XB360 or PS3 owner then I highly recommended you pick it up for one of those if you can find it cheap (might need to import the PS3 version however). If you just want your dose of SWERY then I suggest you go and pick up D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which is cheaper and has a good PC port (Unreal Engine 3). 
1077	0	a	I'd recommend you try and track down a copy of this just to experience it. Just not the PC port. It just started crashing on me and, from what I've heard, it's going to be downhill from here. Find a copy on the 360 or PS3/4 instead.
1078	0	a	This game has wierd amusing moments, intriging story, some puzzles I ran into were kind of interesting and there were alot of strange side activites that I found. I understand why this game was a cult hit. HOWEVER, the pc port of this game is terrible. Locked resolution that cant be changed unless you get the fix developed by someone outside the company that made this game (Which by the way, may or may not work for some people.... which it didnt work for me unless I used windowed mode LAME). Without the fix this game looks like garbage and what I would expect from a playstation 1 game. Awful controls, hit or miss voice acting (which wasnt that big a deal for me), terrible combat system, AND GAME CRASHES are also present in the game. If the developer actually took the time to fix some of these things in the directors cut and properly ported it to the pc, this may have been a fun experince. But since the game controls bad and crashes often, not to metion the resolution debacle, I would recommend you get the console version of this game or watch lets play on youtube or whatever
1079	0	a	I bought this on sale for $5. I couldnt even imagine spending more.  The game is riddled with bugs and frequent crashes and the controls feel clunky and uncomfortable.   The gameplay isnt really that good but the story and music are interesting and are just enough to justify buying it on sale. I can understand the almost seemlingly visual manifestation of something like Macintosh Plus (music) mixed in with heavy influences of Twin Peaks. The music is strange and it makes the whole experience and vibe strange, in a good way.   Unless you like bizarre experimental type games that does not take it self seriously and/or a big fan of Twin Peaks or anything like that then I would skip this unless you can get it for $5 or less.
1080	0	a	game crashes within the first 5 minutes every time.
1081	0	a	Looks great but ultimately unplayable for me.
1082	0	a	bad game in history
1083	0	a	WonÂ´t run at all-a complete waste of time.No tips from the internet can solve this, this 'conversion' seems to have be programmed by badly trained cockroaches. What will the 'publisher' do next? Steal childrenÂ´s lollipops? Shame on you, may your disgraceful coding hand rot away! 
1084	0	a	It's been already a few months since I bought this game but I still can't play this game because whenever I tried to start this game, there was always an error occurred. Anyone who can help me with this problem? Please give me the damn fuc*ing patches!!!
1085	0	a	I tried to like this, it's just the right kinda weird to be interestging, but it is a bug riddled mess, and one of the worst PC ports I've seen in a while. Add to that all the unnecessary QTEs and rather annoying boss fights, and I just can't recommend it unless you're seriously out for an all around punishing experience.
1086	0	a	This game port is absolute trash. It won't even start....geez!!! I see there are some fixes for it but why am I going to go through all that trouble?!?! I waste money it's all I can say!!!! Ok after messing with it I finally got it to load up, but still I shouldn't have to do that much stuff to get it running.
1087	0	a	Deadly Premonition. What can I say? This game is known for being a Twin Peaks-esque cult classic that is easy to overlook as being horrible in every way, yet somehow pulling it all together perfectly.  Unfortunately, it's also notorious on the forums as being nigh unplayable by most people. I unfortunately am faced with the problem. Even after running a mandatory fix for the game, that only got me as far as the mandatory unskippable 5 minute opening cut-scene. Only after this part is over does my game crash every time. After trying a few different methods of fixing it, I concluded that this game is completely broken and not worth the time.  This is a game that I wanted to fall in love with and recommend to all, but I just can't in good conscience do. If you're absolutely determined to play this game, then by all means purchase it for 90% off, but DON'T pay the full amount, and DON'T expect this game to work for you.
1088	0	a	I wasn't even able to play the game, the support is awfull, and the online help useless. I let the game run for 5 minutes just to warn you about this abomination. Dont buy it!!!  This is an update in my review. After some time I managed to solve the crash on start problem. The game is useful, just a pretentious game, with graphics from ps2. Is not a survival horror game in any way. You have infinities bullets, the enemies are really easy to kill, and not scary at all. The story is a little interesting but just for a couple of minutes, before it's pretentiousness kill all the mood. Above all it has a quick time event mechanics in the encounters with the main monster.  Do not buy it!!
1089	0	a	dont bother Im serious
1090	0	a	Sadly, I couldnt get this to work, shouldn't be sold on steam.
1091	0	a	I LOVE THE GAME, I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY IT...
1092	0	a	Unplayable on Win 10. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of bugs keeps me from completing Ch 1.
1093	0	a	Gave up trying to get it to work.
1094	0	a	Crash on start.
1095	0	a	I really want to say yes to this game. Great music, Great story and just like twin peaks. To bad that they sell you the game broken and you need to go into the game files to fix it. Then you need a fan patch to get a playable frame rate and hope it dons't keep crashing on you.   Everybody has this problem. I did my time trying to get this game to run but it refuses to co-operate. Can get maybe an hour or two in before another problem pops up.
1096	0	a	Horrible port, after I got past the crashing cutscene of the hospital in chapter one I just get crashes on every single cutscene after that, screw this mess, I was thinking of actually playing this game but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Fix your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game Rising Star. I'll just keep the game open for the cards. This was barely worth the Â£1 I paid for it.

1098	0	a	It is a great game, the story is great, the characters and the soundtrack are amazing. But it doesn't work properly. I spent two hours fix the dp.exe doesn't work problem. It crashes multiple times I have to repeat tedious activities like driving, the controls are complicated (press space, focus with right mouse than shoot with left) I always f**** up the quicktime events, because there too fast. no I am stuck at the diner and nobody can help me to fix my problem.  if you are in the same situation like me and you have no playstation or xbox...watch a Let's play or ask a friend if you can play it on her/his console but don't buy this game, really it will spare you a lot of frustration.
1099	0	a	Awesome game, unfortunatly UMPLAYABLE, awful port, constant freezes. Just wasted about 3 hours trying to fix it and it won. Won't be fixed, and I won't finish it. Money down the drain.
1100	0	a	It's not the worst case, not the worst game, but it makes you question yourself - but why?! Also controls kinda sucks.
1101	0	a	This game does not work for me. I was excited to play it and its never going to run properly on my computer. Disappointed. I can't really recommend/not recommend this game because I haven't played it. Just a word of warning though, if your computer struggles with SOME games (not necessarily all, I can play a lot of games on my laptop considering its not a gaming laptop per se) like mine does, it won't be able to run this. I wish I didn't waste my money.
1102	0	a	I Like Games that are Ported to PC. I would Probably like it more if it actually worked. I would recommend this game but I would not recomend the port which came out kind-a clunky but for a game like this with already clunky mechanics it becomes too much.
1103	0	a	one of the worst games ive ever played: 1. graphics ps 2 tier at best 2. sound/music nonexistant/abysmal (except title theme which is reused like 50times in the game) 3.gameplay - barely a game, movement is clunky as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, aiming is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, enemies ar â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, qte's out the â™¥â™¥â™¥, its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 4. the port is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing abysmal, dark souls tier 5. oh and the story and characters - â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
1104	0	a	I love this game, but this is a ridiculously horrible port for PC. Crashes render the game unplayable and there are no simple, or heck, even hard fixes that deal with the issues. Unskippable Intros and Cutscenes make crashes even further infuriating. I could not use a controller due to the buttons defaulting to unusual key bindings and not all of the buttons can be altered. The start button was on the Right Trigger. I doubt we'll see patches that deal with these problems as well. I recommend buying it on a console, or watching someone on the internet play it for you, and save yourself the annoyance.
1105	0	a	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it.

1106	0	a	Unplayable on my computer when trying to load a savegame. The content looked promising (being a Twin Peaks fan) but this port does a disservice to the brand.
1107	0	a	I can't get this game to function and there are entire forums full of people with problems getting the game to start and recomending mods that will trick the game into working. Why has there not been a patch to this game to make it playable without having to install mods?
1108	0	a	Might be one of the greatest games ever made... I wouldnt know however because despite jumping through all kinds of hoops to actually get this thing to even run, it crashed after 15 minutes. I didnt even try to restart it. Waste of effort / money.
1109	0	a	I spent more time trying to get DP to run than playing it, and what I did get to play was a mixed bag. In particular, the music, writing, and atmosphere are pretty good, insomuch as they are Twin Peaks: the game but the shooting segments are absolute garbage most of the town, and most of the spaces within the buildings in town are empty space and the cars turn like bricks
1110	0	a	Its not the worst game on steam and makes for a good story.. but the graphics and gameplay are absymal especially the PC mouse and keyboard controls.  The guidance system and world map are trash I wish there were mods to fix this.  The worst part of the game for me is the driving element. THe map is huge but there isnt anything worthwhile to see or do on it, the sleep and eating mandate as well as waiting around for the right time to start your investigation are nothing but tedium.  Most wont be able to get past the fact that the game has visuals from 2006 at best.
1111	0	a	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.
1112	0	a	The game itself is great! Aside from the weird control layout, and sluggish aiming, which is fine. Because the game is very generous in giving you time in battle.   However the reason I can't recommend it is the port. It crashes! A lot! I'm only a few hours in and I've had to replay entire sections 3x so far. There's also no hope of it being fixed. Get the 360/PS3 version. Avoid this on steam.
1113	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I recommend any version of this beautiful game other than the pc port.  Deadly Premonition might be the greatest game of all time. While this review shall be focusing on the abominable pc version, I'll say this about the game itself: the graphics might be terrible, the sound effects were probably pulled from a free sound website, and it doesn't make much sense storywise at several points. But if you believe that games are about being immersed in a truly unique world, if gaming is not about getting an arbitrary number of points but is about telling a story in an amazing way that makes you care for the characters you see, I'd highly recommend you get this game for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Now onto the pc port, it's garbage. The problems are so numerous I have to seperate them into multiple catagories.  Crashes: Crashed 4 times in about 3.5 hours...maybe I could get a fanmade fix, but it's NEVER the fans' job to make sure the game works.  Controls: Space bar is draw weapon and aim (You can only fire and reload if you are aiming) I got used to this, but my problem is, while you can rebind many of the controls, you can't rebind aim to something resonable (Such as right mouse button) Also, certain buttons on the controller won't work if you bind them, for instance, I wanted to put the lock on command to left trigger. After I bound it, it did not work. Same as when I tried to put shoot onto right trigger.  Framerate: First half hour runs at about 10-15 fps, it ran fine for about an hour, now runs at a steady 5 fps. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.  Driving controls: They work fine (If a bit wonky) with a keyboard. When you use a controller, the physics speeds up so the cars, which only go about 60 mps in the game, can easily hit 150 on the open road and it makes the steering hyper sensitive. I thought at first the car's physics might have been locked to the framerate on consoles, explaining why on pc the cars go faster, since the pc version has a higher framerate. But why does it only effect controller?  In conclusion, the pc port sucks it's certainly not worth the bucks buy the game on PS3 or xbox, It will truly, knock off your socks.  So says Mr. Stewart.  Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, 'CultGamerAlliance'. Check it out if you get a chance!
1114	0	a	This port is simply atrocious, constant crashing, locked at 720P, game breaking bugs. I'd rather play the xbox 360 version. Played for slightly too long to get a steam refund, luckily I got it for $3.
1115	0	a	I'm still unable to play this game on Windows 10.64 bit.  Could be the OS but i guess is caused by the PhysX version installed and AMD GPU.  Game dev/publisher should solve this problem.  
1116	0	a	Deadly Premonition sucks. Ultimately, it fails on all levels. The setup of the story is actually pretty good. It's obviously biting off Twin Peaks. A weirdo FBI agent is sent to investigate a murder with supernatural overtones in a small town filled with wacky characters. The obvious inspirations for the game play are Silent Hill and Resident Evil. There are parts where a location transforms into a twisted nightmare version of the place and its filled with monsters and the player has to make their way through the nightmare version of the location to find clues to help the investigation. So, the combat takes place really in the protagonists mind. The combat gets really repetitive and boring really quick. There's really just one type of enemy to fight for most of the game besides bosses. Later there's another type that's even more boring and repetitive to fight. Every location ends up being the same thing. To gather the necessary clues you gotta wade through a series of narrow corridors fighting the same boring enemies over and over again. The combat is really clunky too like a Resident Evil game. There is one interesting part of this, though. At some point the legendary supernatural killer of the story, The Raincoat Killer, will track you down and the screen splits so you can also see through the killers eyes and your own point of view simultaneously. You need to hide from him for a certain amount of time before he gives up and goes away. Usually, right after this section there will be a chase sequence that's kind of like an on-rails quick time event where you need to escape from The Raincoat Killer. These encounters were fun the first few times, but even these interesting parts get repetitive as they are used over and over again. So, the actual combat portion of this game is a big dud. There's also a lot of driving that needs to be done in this game. It is also no fun. The cars handle terribly and they can even run out of gas. This is supposed to be an open-world exploration adventure game, but the fuel tank keeps a leash on you so its an annoying concern that made me not want to even bother with exploring the environment. Really, all there is anyway is some random collectibles to find littered around and also some side quests. So, the driving portion is also not any fun. The PC version is a really bad port too. It crashes ALL the time. I lost several hours to stupid crashes that can and will strike at any time. There was even one cut scene that would guaranteed crash the game. I had to change the compatibility mode and some other options to get past this stupid bug. The game is originally capped at 30 fps and 720p. Ridiculous! The same guy that fixed this outrage for Dark Souls did a fix for Deadly Premonition too, but like the DS one, it seems like it just plain wears off after a while and the game reverts back to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics and frame rate. I had to re-start the final boss because the game was running so horribly it wouldn't even register inputs from the controller. One thing I did find at least amusing is that if you don't have your clothes cleaned every so often, flies will start buzzing around your character because of your stinky clothes. I got a chuckle of watching cut scenes where these big fat (white?) flies were swarming around this guy. Now to the story. The setup is intriguing. There's a serial killer on the loose which brings the FBI to the small town and while there, more people get murdered. I was hooked on the setup. However, once the story starts to explain what's going on and who is behind everything the story just falls completely apart. It's just plain â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. It's like a ten year old's idea of a murder mystery. It's unbelievably bad. It's so dumb! I'm shocked and baffled that this story isn't completely ripped apart by everyone that has reviewed this absurd game. This game is also not scary, AT ALL. It fails in that department too. On the technical, atmosphere, narrative, and game play levels this game fails across the board and I definitely recommend you avoid this game.
1117	0	a	Game crashes. Don't really want to sit through the tedious Nick/Diane mission just to have it crash again.
1118	0	a	Broken port and doesn't work, wouldn't recommend buying this.
1119	0	a	Fromw hat little I played, I loved this game. The charecters and the story are promising and reminiscent to the likes of twin peaks, the gameplay, while clunky seems to work within this context, the graphics and sound are not great but again, they seem to blend well with this game.  My issue witht he game however is that, as much as I want to enjoy and complete this game, the constant game crashes, bugs, freezes and sound glitches have tested and brought my willpower to the brink. I am sad to say that I have finally given in, I haven't even finished chapter 1 yet just because of how unbearable it has become. I've tried the durante patch, I have changed my sound from 5.1 to stereo to fix sound issues yet the random crashes still occur, at times making me lose quiet a bit of progression.   In short, I really love and do wanted to complete this game, but the constant crashes have prevented me from doing so.
1120	0	a	As an open world detective game my thought is, what's not to like? There's going to be a murder to solve, you're free to roam and take on side missions, and there's something creepy and supernatural going on. Unfortunately, this is the definition of a bad port, and probably shouldnt be on steam at all. The game just isn't stable, and it looks horrible. The controls also leave a lot to be desired, at least if you're using a controller. Fortunately, the community of gamers have done a lot to support the game and fix what they can. My version looks a whole lot better, and is a bit more stable as a result. My confusion however, is why steam, and the original developer would want to be affiliated with all these known problems with no attempt to correct for it.
1121	0	a	It is difficult to discern if this game is brilliantly bizarre or bizzarely brilliant. One thing is certain is that this game is not worth full price. There are no options to adjust the graphics; and the graphics suggest that is game has been poorly ported or created.   The controls are fine, but employ tank controls for shooting. That is to say, movement is not allowed whilst aiming. The game does not have the horror vibe that the tags indicate.   One last thing to note is the amount of loading screens and unnecessary sequences. If you pause the game you get an unnecessary sequence of bushes moving aside. Or when you pick up an item, it presents a slowly rotating image of the item.   For buyers considering the game, wait for sale.
1122	0	a	This isn't a full review since I haven't finished the game yet. This is just my current impressions thus far.  This port is terrible. Even with DPfix installed it's still pretty bad. Controls are clunky &amp; driving is nearly impossible with a joystick. I have to swap movement with the D-Pad &amp; lightly press it for turns because it's so sensitive. I don't know if I'll ever really finish this game because of the terrible controls.
1123	0	a	It's not the worst case, not the worst game, but it makes you question yourself - but why?! Also controls kinda sucks.

1127	0	a	I simply couldn't get past the horrible combat system, terrible sound, wooden voice acting, and dated visuals. There might be a good story in there, but I doubt ill see it. Also, the game chugged terribly. Not recommended

1130	0	a	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.

The charecters and the story are promising and reminiscent to the likes of twin peaks, the gameplay, while clunky seems to work within this context, the graphics and sound are not great but again, they seem to blend well with this game.  My issue witht he game however is that, as much as I want to enjoy and complete this game, the constant game crashes, bugs, freezes and sound glitches have tested and brought my willpower to the brink. I am sad to say that I have finally given in, I haven't even finished chapter 1 yet just because of how unbearable it has become. I've tried the durante patch, I have changed my sound from 5.1 to stereo to fix sound issues yet the random crashes still occur, at times making me lose quiet a bit of progression.   In short, I really love and do wanted to complete this game, but the constant crashes have prevented me from doing so.
1132	0	a	This game is a good game, but it has a lot of crash issues and freeze's, i cant continue to play this game because of the problems i even tried fixing the problem but nothing works, but i did not try everything. Overall i think its just broken so im going to buy it for 360 to beat it instead. Maybe one day they will fix it on here i hope so.
1133	0	a	DISCLAIMER: I recommend any version of this beautiful game other than the pc port.  Deadly Premonition might be the greatest game of all time. While this review shall be focusing on the abominable pc version, I'll say this about the game itself: the graphics might be terrible, the sound effects were probably pulled from a free sound website, and it doesn't make much sense storywise at several points. But if you believe that games are about being immersed in a truly unique world, if gaming is not about getting an arbitrary number of points but is about telling a story in an amazing way that makes you care for the characters you see, I'd highly recommend you get this game for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Now onto the pc port, it's garbage. The problems are so numerous I have to seperate them into multiple catagories.  Crashes: Crashed 4 times in about 3.5 hours...maybe I could get a fanmade fix, but it's NEVER the fans' job to make sure the game works.  Controls: Space bar is draw weapon and aim (You can only fire and reload if you are aiming) I got used to this, but my problem is, while you can rebind many of the controls, you can't rebind aim to something resonable (Such as right mouse button) Also, certain buttons on the controller won't work if you bind them, for instance, I wanted to put the lock on command to left trigger. After I bound it, it did not work. Same as when I tried to put shoot onto right trigger.  Framerate: First half hour runs at about 10-15 fps, it ran fine for about an hour, now runs at a steady 5 fps. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.  Driving controls: They work fine (If a bit wonky) with a keyboard. When you use a controller, the physics speeds up so the cars, which only go about 60 mps in the game, can easily hit 150 on the open road and it makes the steering hyper sensitive. I thought at first the car's physics might have been locked to the framerate on consoles, explaining why on pc the cars go faster, since the pc version has a higher framerate. But why does it only effect controller?  In conclusion, the pc port sucks it's certainly not worth the bucks buy the game on PS3 or xbox, It will truly, knock off your socks.  So says Mr. Stewart.  Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, 'CultGamerAlliance'. Check it out if you get a chance!

I have played this game for more than the clocked 9 hours, but apparently Steam does not register this during offline-mode. I 100%'ed the game in about 20-25 hours.  Deadly Premonition is great and terrible at the same time. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the sidequests are almost all gems and when you're in the zone this game becomes rather addictive. On the other hand, the PC version of this game is riddled with bugs. Terrible, game-crashing bugs. If you look online you'll find some fixes, but even after following everything recommended, the game will still crash after about three hours of playing. The problem lies in the memory management. if you unlock the game to use the maximum amount of RAM it takes longer for the game to crash. The way to play with the least amount of frustration is to restart your PC the moment the game starts lagging. Had I not already owned the game before learning of this, I might have passed it over, but even with getting thrown out of the game two to three times per playing session, I still loved it. The graphics are not bad and neither is the sound. the controls are rather intuitive and combat is fairly smooth.  I you're up for a great story and don't mind playing in shorter segments and saving an awful lot, this game is for you. On the other hand, if you get frustrated replaying parts because the dreadful 'DP.exe has stopped working' appears, I'd recommend you go for the PS3 or XBOX versions.
1135	0	a	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.
1136	0	a	Such an awesome game, it's a shame that it has so many bugs in this PC port. Some unofficial patches may turn it more playable, but the constant crashes and issues makes me not recommend this game.
1137	0	a	Game itself is great, this port is horrible. Those interested should play the original version on the Xbox 360 - it has better, warmer colours and more fitting textures. Directors cut version also adds few things to the game that make it worse than the original.   This PC port (- even with the DPfix) is filled with crashes, strange framerate issues and other technical woes. Beating the final boss is almost impossible due to the aiming bug that persists trough out the whole game (some might have luck with messing win98 compatibility modes or alt-tabing â€“ I didnâ€™t).  That said, I enjoyed it but find really hard to recommend this version of the game to any one.
